Operator : Welcome to Invesco's First Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I'd like the call over to the speakers for today, Mr. Martin L. Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; and Mr. Loren Starr, chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin. Martin L. Flanagan: Thank you very much. And thank you, everybody, for joining us today. This is Marty Flanagan, and I am joined by Loren Starr. And we'll be speaking to the presentation that's available on the website, if you're so inclined to follow. Today, as is our practice, we'll review the business results for the first quarter, including a discussion regarding the United Kingdom. And then, Loren will go into greater results in the operating results, and we will then open it up to Q&A. So let me start by hitting the highlights of the firm results during the first quarter. You'll find them on Page 3 of the presentation. Long-term investment performance remained strong during the quarter, 81% of the active managed assets were ahead of peers over a 3-year period; strong investment performance; a broad first year flows and continued focus on clients contributed to long-term net inflows of $6.5 billion for the quarter. Adjusted operating income was up 18.5% compared to the first quarter of last year. These numbers supported a further improvement in our operating margins to 40.9% versus 40.5% in the prior quarter and 38.4% in the same quarter a year ago. Reflecting continued confidence in the strength and potential of our business, we're raising the quarterly dividend to $0.25, up 11% from 2013. Assets under management were $787 billion during the first quarter, up from $778 billion in the prior quarter. Operating income was $363 million versus $347 million in the prior quarter. Earnings per share were $0.60, up from $0.58 in the prior quarter. We also repurchased $120 million of common stock during the quarter, representing 3.6 million shares. And as I mentioned earlier, we are raising our dividend. Now before I go -- before Loren goes into the details on the company's financial results, let me take a moment to review the investment performance. I'm now on Slide 6. Investment performance during the quarter was strong across the time period. 81% of assets were ahead of peers on a 3-year basis, and 73% of assets were ahead of peers on a 1-year -- over the past year. As we mentioned during the last quarter's call, the relative softness in the 5-year number reflects the rolling off of some very strong numbers in the fourth quarter of 2008 in a brief period where we trailed the market during the low-quality rally in 2009. We expect our 5-year number to demonstrate further improvement over the second and third quarters of this year. As you might expect with numbers like these, the long-term performance of investment teams across the enterprise was really quite strong, with a number of capabilities achieving top [ph] performance. Turning to flows, on Page 7. You'll see gross sales remained strong during the quarter, nearly doubling gross sales from 2 years ago. In addition, redemptions tapered off, which led to an improvement in net long-term flows. Importantly, gross sales of active AUM for the quarter also nearly doubled results from 2 years ago. As I mentioned, total net long-term flows were $6.5 billion during the quarter. These numbers reflect the broad diversity of flows we saw across our global business during the quarter, which included strength in fixed income, equities, alternatives and ETFs. So obviously, very broad. Gross sales within retail and the institutional channels were quite strong also. Institutional gross sales doubled from 2 years ago and retail sales nearly doubled. The institutional channel saw continued demand in real estate and bank loans, in particular. During the quarter, we were -- there was roughly a $3.5 billion low fee redemption from a single client in one account, which accounts for the lower net flow number. Gross sales for our retail business remained strong at $19.2 billion for the quarter, up 4% over the prior quarter. The annualized redemption rate for Invesco remained favorable to the industry. Redemptions also remained steady during the quarter, which resulted in net sales of nearly $3 billion. Flows into the complex were led by strength in our traditional ETFs, U.S. Value and International Growth Equity. We continue to see a diversified mix of sales and moderating outflow picture for ABRA. Our U.S. business has become increasingly diversified. We saw 14 retail mutual funds with net flows of greater than $100 million over the rolling 12-month period ended March 2014, versus 9 funds in that same period during 2012. Additionally, there were 21 PowerShares traditional ETFs with net flows over $100 million over the rolling 12-month period ending March 2014, versus 12 in that same time period 2012. We feel good about momentum in our business. We remain confident in our ability to deliver a high level of value to our clients. And we believe the firm is well positioned regardless of where the markets take us. Before I turn over to Loren for a more in-depth report of quarterly financial results, let me take a few minutes to discuss our positioning in the EMEA region. All of you are aware of 2 recent developments in U.K. business. St. James's Place made a decision to transition approximately $13 billion out of Invesco Perpetual separate accounts, which will impact the second quarter. On Monday, the Financial Conduct Authority confirmed conclusion of its investigation of Invesco Perpetual's compliance with certain FCA rules and principles during the period from May 2008 to November 2012. These issues are historical issues, and the FCA has noted that Invesco Perpetual acted promptly to enhance its systems and controls. We're confident the systems and controls within Invesco Perpetual are now strong, effective and compliant with ethical regulations. The small number of impacted funds were fully reimbursed. This matter has been fully resolved with the FCA and is now closed. The financial penalties were approximately $31 million, will not have a material impact on our business. We're pleased to have these issues resolved and fully communicated to the market so we can focus further on building our momentum in EMEA. And so, let me spend a few minutes providing some perspective behind our confidence in this business. As you're aware, investment performance of U.K. retail and across the board, our fund range has been very strong and continues to be. Our well-tenured investment management team has been widely recognized in the market. The transition to Mark Barnett has gone very well. With his excellent track record, the market has been extremely receptive to his leadership in the U.K. equity team. And the team is focused on delivering strong, long-term investment performance to our clients. We have a diversified range of highly competitive funds across the franchise, strong organic growth across EMEA, and a very well-recognized brand in the region. I'm on Page 12, for those that are following. And in particular, Invesco Perpetual has a deep well-tenured investment team that has consistently delivered investment excellence to our clients. We've talked about this in the past, about the team's phenomenal performance. And you can see, during the first quarter, 97% of the assets across that business were above peers on a 3-year basis. The 5-year numbers were impacted by the market's bounce off the bottom in the first part of 2009. Invesco Perpetual trailed in what would have been characterized as a low-quality rally at that time. The 2 primary strategies impacted for the high income and income equity funds, which represented 35% of our assets under management. Our projections show strong investment performance in both of these portfolios returning by June of this year, potentially achieving 98% of AUM in the top half over a 5-year -- over the 5-year period. Investment performance for cross-border fund range has also been strong, with 91% of our assets above peers on a 3-year basis and 89% on a 5-year basis. The top 6 cross-border retail funds by growth flows in the first quarter all had top quintile 5-year performance track records with the Pan-European high income fund, Pan-European equity fund. The top 1% and 2 percentiles, respectively. Strong investment performance drove success in our cross-border retail business, which experienced $10 billion in net flows across all of 2013, and approximately $5.1 billion of net inflows during the first quarter of this year. We continue to make progress, further diversifying our EMEA business with a strong net sales into the European equity and fixed income strategies. A key strength of our business across EMEA is the broad and a highly diversified range of capabilities we provide to our clients. The increase in demand for Invesco's European equity, global equity, Asian equity capabilities, together with the GTR fund, has led to a more diversified U.K. retail business. As you can see on Slide 14, gross sales are meaningfully higher than a year ago, driven by the long track record of a strong investment performance. U.K. retail gross flows continued to increase in the first quarter to $3.6 billion, up approximately 25% over the same period -- same quarter a year ago. Importantly, flows into the funds have been highly diversified reflecting strong performance across the range. In 2009, 80% of gross sales came through 4 products. By the first quarter of this year, 80% of gross sales were driven by 16 products. We have been pleased by the tremendous support we continue to receive from the advisory market. We're seeing this in our sales numbers as well as the conversation we have with the advisors everyday. During the first quarter, we were in first place for gross sales at 2 of the largest platforms in the United Kingdom. Particularly, I'd like to note that investors' response to the recently launched global target -- targeted return fund has been very favorable. Performance since the launch, although recognize it's only 2 quarters, has been excellent and consistent with our expectations of how the strategy would behave in these market conditions. Assets under management in the U.K. and cross-border GTR funds has raised $380 million by the end of March. As you can see on Slide 15, our cross-border business has experienced tremendous growth due to strong investment performance and increased distribution effectiveness. Gross sales in the fund range have nearly quintupled over the past 3 years. And for us, a broad range of capabilities. A key strength of this part of the business is the diversity of flows we're seeing most recently across fixed income, European equities, global equities, Greater China, Japanese equities and multi-asset. Strong asset sales has helped drive a steady growth in assets under management. Our focus on delivering strong investment performance to clients has helped our cross-border business improve its market share. Over this time, rate had increased it from 2.5% in 2010 to almost 4% this year. Given our solid investment performance and strong focus on clients, we're optimistic we can continue to grow our EMEA business over time. Assets under management of our EMEA business totaled $178 billion at the end of the first quarter, as you can see on Slide 16. During the first quarter, net flows into EMEA, excluding U.K. equity income, were $6.5 billion, representing an annualized organic growth rate of 21%. As I mentioned earlier, the market has been extremely receptive of Mark Barnett, who has an excellent track record. Mark is supported by the strong Invesco Perpetual investment team in his leadership role for the U.K. equities. As a result, a number of key clients are choosing to stay the course including Edinburgh Investment Trust, which announced that it's retaining Invesco Perpetual as the manager of the trust. We find these results very encouraging. And we'll continue to do everything we can to deliver good outcomes to our clients, retain assets and grow our EMEA business. As I mentioned, we're very well positioned for long-term success across the U.K. and Continental Europe. First and foremost, our track record of delivering strong investment results to our clients is superb. We have an outstanding winning investment team and highly regarded investment culture. Given the strong investment performance, we are seeing solid demand for a broad range of diversified capabilities, which is supporting a high-level organic growth across EMEA. With some of the key issues resolved in U.K., we're focused on executing our strategy in building on the tremendous momentum across EMEA. With a little cooperation from the markets, we're very confident on our ability to continue delivering for clients across the business. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Loren to speak, in more depth, the financial results. And then, we'll open up to Q&A. Loren M. Starr: Great. Thank you, Marty. So quarter-over-quarter, our total AUM increased $8.6 billion, or 1.1%. That was driven by positive market returns and FX of $9.5 billion, and long-term net inflows of $6.5 billion. And these increases were partially offset by outflows in money market funds and the QQQs, which amounted to $7.4 billion. Our average AUM for the quarter was $779.6 billion. That was up 2.4% versus the fourth quarter average. And our net revenue yield came in at 45.6 basis points. That's an increase of 0.6 basis points quarter-over-quarter. The increase was a result of higher performance fees, service and distribution fees and other revenues, which was partially offset by 2 fewer days during the quarter. And before we discuss operating results, I wanted to provide a brief update on the second quarter flows. Marty already discussed the $13 billion SJP, St. James's Place redemption, that occurred in April after adjusting for the U.K. outflows. I'm happy to say that we continue to see momentum in the rest of our business. Our long-term inflows x U.K. in April were roughly in line with the monthly volumes we saw in the first quarter. So with that said, let's go to the operating results. Our net revenues increased $30.5 million, or 2.6% quarter-over-quarter to $887.8 million, and that included a positive FX rate impact of $1.8 million. Within the net revenue number, you'll see that our investment management fees grew by $6.2 million, or 0.6% to $989 million, and this increase was in line with our higher average AUM after allowing for 2 fewer days in the first quarter. FX increased investment management fees by $0.9 million. Service and distribution revenues were up by $8.5 million, or 3.7%, an increase reflected higher average AUM, again, after allowing for day count as well as a $6.5 million increase in ongoing asset-based service fees. FX increased service and distribution revenues by $0.1 million. Performance fees came in at 300, I'm sorry, that's a big number, not that big, at $33.6 million, an increase of $22.5 million from Q4. Our performance fees in the first quarter were in fact greater than expected and they were driven by the U.K., which contributed $27.6 million and by our quant [ph] equity bank loan group, which contributed most of the remaining $6 million. FX increased performance fees by $0.8 million in the quarter. Other revenues in the first quarter were $35.7 million, and that was an increase of $2.4 million versus the prior quarter. The increase was due to higher front-end fees resulting from increased sales activity in Continental Europe. You should note that these front-end fees in Europe are, in fact, passed through to third-party distributors and are netted within our third-party distribution expenses. FX had no impact on other revenues. Third-party distribution, service and advisory expense, which can be net against gross revenues, increased by $9.1 million, or 2.3%. This increase was in line with the day count adjusted retail investment management fees, service and distribution revenues and higher front-end fees. FX had no impact on these expenses. Moving on down the slide, you'll see that our adjusted operating expenses at $524.8 million increased by $14.7 million, or 2.9% versus Q4. FX had no overall impact on our operating expenses. Our employee comp at $353.1 million increased by $20.8 million. That's 6.3% increase. This was driven by 3 factors. You had higher seasonal payroll taxes, an increase in variable compensation associated with our Q1 performance fees, and also there was a partial impact of base salaries and share-based compensation increases that went into effect on March 1. FX decreased compensation by $0.2 million. Looking forward, we'd expect compensation to decline by approximate $10 million in the second quarter and then remain flat for the remainder of the year. Importantly, this guidance assumes flat AUM from the end of Q1. Our marketing expenses decreased by 6.9%, or 22%, to $242 million. FX decreased these expenses by $0.2 million. The marketing expense was in fact lower than we anticipated this quarter. Now as a result of delayed timing of spend, we expect marketing expense to increase by approximately $5 million to $10 million in second quarter, and then level off at a roughly $27 million to $29 million per quarter in the back half of the year. Property office and technology expense came in at $77.7 million in the first quarter, and that was up $2.8 million. The increase reflected higher outsourced administration costs associated with increased sales activity in Continental Europe as well as continued investment in our technology platforms. FX increased these expenses by $0.1 million. Looking forward, property, office and technology costs will remain around $78 million to $80 million per quarter but may, of course, experience some variability due to sales activity in Europe. General and administrative expenses came in at $69.8 million. That was down $2 million, or 2.8%. The decrease was due to lower professional services costs related to new product development that occurred in the fourth quarter. FX increased G&A by $0.2 million. We expect our G&A line item to remain around that $68 million to $70 million per quarter level as we look forward. And then, continuing on down the page, you'll see that our nonoperating income increased slightly $0.4 million compared to the fourth quarter. And the firm's effective tax rate on pre-adjusted net income in Q1 came in at 27%. This increase in the tax rate quarter-over-quarter was due to a onetime 0.8 percentage point increase resulting from new tax legislation enacted in the New York State in the quarter. Looking forward, we expect the effective tax rate to remain between 26% to 27%, which leads us to EPS at $0.60 and our adjusted net operating margin of 40.9%. And with that, I'm going to turn it back over to Marty. Martin L. Flanagan: Thank you, Loren. So we'll open up to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Bill Katz from Citigroup. William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. Appreciate the extra color for core trends into April. I just wonder if we could back up and just focus on the U.K. footprint for a moment. I guess, there have been a couple more portfolio managers that have announced they're leaving to go join with Woodford. So maybe the broader question is, what's been the general reaction into April, particularly given the big outflow out of St. James, for retail at large? And then, just tactfully, what are you doing here to stem any kind of further PM turnover? Martin L. Flanagan: Thanks, Bill. So again, as I've mentioned earlier, I think the main thing to look at is what's the reaction is. You look at -- let the numbers talk, right? So it's been known for a good long time that Neil would be leaving, and gross flows, sales are up 25% year-over-year. You look at the diversity of the flows, it just gets stronger and stronger. So that's really important. And also, again, just during the first quarter and sort of the continued feedback we get is very strong from the advice channel. And as I said, we actually had the highest place in gross sales in the 2 largest platforms during the quarter in the United Kingdom. So those are all very strong, I think, leading indicators of where we're going to go. And with regard to the 3 individuals that left, we actually anticipated that these individuals might leave. They were junior people. They were not long-tenured and, importantly, they were not contributor to Mark Barnett's excellent long-term track record. And only one of them managed money, and his responsibilities have been assumed by an individual who works very closely with Mark and the core team. And Mark has been building out his support team. And since the start of the year, he's added 3 highly regarded individuals with strong backgrounds. So we view these departures as very manageable and, as I said, they were not fully -- we somewhat anticipated these. Loren M. Starr: And, Bill, just specifically in terms of the equity income. Other than the SJP announcement, it's been no different trend than what we've been seeing, generally pretty muted response. I mean, still outflow. But not anything that is sort of spiking up or doing anything different. William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Yes, it's helpful. And just one follow-up, Loren. There are a lot of moving parts. Your guidance is helpful. But when you think about flows coming in versus what's going out, looks like it's pretty high incremental margin year-on-year in the quarter. But how do you think about incremental margins? Maybe, what sort of a reasonable range of expectation here? Loren M. Starr: Well, I think we're still sort of in that -- sort of roughly 60% incremental margin range that we've been. If markets are strong, it would be moving up probably to 65%, and perhaps higher. Submarkets, we've said sort of 55% to 60% was the right range for you to be thinking about. And we think 60% is probably a good place to focus. Operator : The next question is from Ken Worthington, JPMC. Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : I wanted to maybe dig into EMEA a little bit. So what has led to the big improvement that you've been seeing here? Basically, sales have been accelerating at a really rapid pace over the last 12 months. We'd thought that this might be a transition from fixed income to equity, but your fixed income EMEA business is doing well. So I guess the question is, if performance has been good for a while, what's really changed again in the last 12 months? Martin L. Flanagan: Yes. So thanks for the question, Ken, because you probably won't remember. But if you go back to -- when these conversations by almost 3 years ago, we told everybody that we really wanted to make a difference in a cross-border market. Europe was going to be a focus of ours, and it has been a broad, deep effort over the last 3 years. And what that included was looking at the range of products we had available. There's been a pretty broad revamp of those products. The performance had been very, very strong. We actually redid the servicing model to drive service levels up for clients. And also, a much greater focus on the improvement of our distribution capabilities and how effective we were. And so, it's 3 years of effort that starts to show up in the last 12 months, which is very typical. It's just hard to have that all come together. And as I said, we've been in that region for a long time. We were not happy with where we were. And we'd still say, as we look over the next 3 years, we look to just continue to get stronger in that market. Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. Any specifics you can give us in terms of the expansion of the sales force for the cross-border products? Martin L. Flanagan: Yes. I don't have those specific numbers. But what I would say, this might be sort of boring to you, but it's really taking sort of the best practices that we have in different parts of the world and taking them to Continental Europe and just being much more effective and thoughtful on how we execute with our clients. So there's been a tremendous amount of effort there, but I don't have the specific change in wholesalers, et cetera. Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : And then, maybe, Loren, for you. In terms of performance fees, why were they better than you had guided to? I had thought that the majority of performance fees in the U.K. really came from the Edinburgh Trust. And I thought that was restructured when they kind of renewed their contract with you. So if you could just help us with some of the details there. Loren M. Starr: Yes. Absolutely, Ken. So -- of the performance fees, the $33.6 million, $27.6 million were related to the U.K., $13 million was specifically related to the Edinburgh Trust. And so, that was the part that I would say would not recur. There's about $20 million that is the rest of it. And $14 million of that came from, actually, a fund that Mark Barnett -- close to $14 million of that came from a fund that Mark Barnett himself manages. So it is, again, one of these things that, that performance to that other fund that showed up was very, very good and better than we had anticipated, and showed up as a performance fee that was not in our original forecast. So hopefully that's helpful. Operator : The next question is from Daniel Fannon from Jefferies. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : I guess, just -- we have the expense guidance, but just generally speaking, given your outlook for what we -- or you're seeing in April in terms of flows and thinking about the fee rate and then kind of the margin outlook as you kind of progress through this year and some of those headwinds and some of the markets are flat, just based on kind of where demand trends are. How should we think about that? Loren M. Starr: I mean -- so I think in terms about the thing on margin outlook, we talked about incremental margin, roughly 60%. So certainly, we expect to continue to grow organically. And we've been seeing good strong growth. Obviously, the reality is we do have an outflow that's known in the second quarter, $13 million -- billion that is going to take our average assets down. But the good news is, we're seeing offsets to that through growth in Europe and elsewhere. So for us, even though we've had some benefit of market, we're obviously balancing that against the known outflow. So we think the 60% incremental margin for this year target is probably a good place for analysts to put in their models. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : And your comments about April in comparison to first Q -- 1Q, should we just assume that kind of the inflow trends were pretty consistent throughout the first quarter to kind of get a sense of kind of the other segment of your business in April? Loren M. Starr: I mean, roughly, yes. I mean, obviously, things shift around a bit. But yes, I mean, the things that have been flowing strongly, or continue the strong -- strongly flow like bank loans, real estate, some of the Pan-European equity, some of the bond funds in Europe as well. So those are definitely still providing us the lift in April. Operator : The next question is from Brennan Hawken, UBS. Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : So net flow number for active was really solid. Do you guys have insights into what drove the incremental increase in redemptions? Is there anything behind there? Maybe, could you help us understand? Loren M. Starr: Well, we had the one large redemption that Marty talked about, the single account, $3.5 billion low fee. That was an active mandate that was definitely a hit to the active... Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : So that was active, but low fee. Loren M. Starr: Correct. Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Oh, I see. Okay. And then, when we think about ABRA, I think you guys highlighted that outflows moderated here in the quarter. This is -- it seemed like a good quarter for ABRA given you guys have highlighted it as a conservative strategy. And we saw some volatility here in the quarter. Is what you experience here this quarter in improving on, maybe some color on the sales versus redemptions, did you see increasing interest on that product given what we saw in the markets? Martin L. Flanagan: Let me make a couple of comments, and Loren can get more specific. So the good news about sort of volatility year-to-date is that people remember why ABRA was important part of their portfolio, and that has been an important reason for the slowdown in the outflows. I think, also, realizing that in a retail market, the peer groups are really sort of the hodgepodge. But when you look at risk parity, it is a very, very strongly performing capability. And where there interest continued was in the institutional market. And so, again, as we've always said, sort of more challenging markets, you'll see people focus on ABRA. But in a rising equity market, individuals will go to equity capabilities. And we saw that change. And so, again, I think it's a very good product, positioned very strongly, and is being understood that way in the marketplace. Loren M. Starr: Yes. And I'd say, generally, the level of redemptions has moderated. So it's certainly been helpful. Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : And I guess, where sales... Loren M. Starr: The level of redemption -- yes, I think sales have been stable and the biggest change has been just lower redemption rate. Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Terrific. And then, last one for me. So we heard about reports about Woodford's new fund getting delayed. And I was hoping maybe you guys could help me think about it because I'm not -- I'm struggling whether or not that's a positive for you guys or negative because if it delays, it drags the whole process out. But it gives you guys more time with clients, maybe an opportunity to show better results and keep more AUMs. So how do you guys think about that? Martin L. Flanagan: Actually, we don't think about it. So the reality is he went from a colleague to now a competitor as of May 1. And we compete with some very talented organizations that have been in the market for decades with enormous resources. And we're going to do just fine. And I think that's what we showed. And I think, really to your point, I think the bigger institutional or single-trigger mandates, we think we're largely through that. I mean, I think the way you should be thinking about this is post second quarter, the toughest stuff is behind us. So I think that's really how we should be thinking about it. Operator : The next question is from Michael Kim, Sandler O'Neill. Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : So, Marty, first, just sort of a big picture question. Just being curious to get your take on how you see the underlying mix of the franchise evolving over time from a geographic standpoint. Clearly, momentum continues to build in Europe and Asia. And the U.K. business x Woodford continues to really strengthen. But at the same time, I would imagine the U.S. retail business is picking up, just assuming investors continue to move up the risk curve. So just taking all those things together, what does your footprint look like a couple of years down the road? And what might be the implications for sort of economics of the business? Martin L. Flanagan: Very good question. So maybe up within the context of what we talked about in the past. So one bigger thought was we wanted to do much better in the United States a number of years ago when we had these conversations. We are starting to do that. We are strongly, strongly positioned here. And we would anticipate with the performance in our certain clients from distribution service levels. We would just look for the U.S. business to continue to strengthen. We did point out 3 years ago that we wanted to be much stronger on the continent, and we are showing that result. I'd still say we're third inning, using the baseball analogy, of where we should get to. One of the strongest parts of the business, quite frankly, is our position in Greater China. And it's -- I think there are some people who have a macro view that China is a headwind. That maybe the case in the short term, but when we look out 3 to 5 years, it is a force. And we could not be more better positioned into that. And then, if you look at, again, maybe some -- what's happening within the marketplace. Our ETF business goes from strength to strength. And we would continue to see that as a big contributor. And I think, also, importantly -- and again, you've asked this. Looking for out 3 years it is very clear to us that the advice channel, retail advice channel is focusing much more on outcomes for their clients. And with that evolution there, looking at a much broader range of investment capabilities, and I just want to say it's, historically, equity, fixed income. Clients are seeking lower volatility. They want some inflation production and all these different types of things. So what you saw from us at the end of last year, in particular, and here, was the introduction in the United States of arguably the broadest range of liquid alternative capabilities that will complement very much our traditional asset classes and focus on this evolution in the advice channel, which is not dissimilar to what the institutional market has done. That focus is not limited for us to the United States. We're taking that approach in the U.K., on the continent. And Asia is coming on also with it's just more complicated to get to the market there. So we think we're positioned for where the market is going, looking out 3 years. And again, I think you just have to look at the depth and breadth of the investment capabilities and the performance. This is very strong. And we'd supportive of strength for the next 3 years. Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : Okay. That's helpful. And then, just a follow-up on ABRA. You touched on this earlier, but just curious to get an update on maybe where you stand in terms of marketing those strategies into the institutional or the non-U.S. channels. Just trying to think about the growth opportunities and where you are in that process. Martin L. Flanagan: Yes. So remember, ABRA actually started in institutional market. And it was really the phenomenon that -- it was accepted strongly in the retail market. Where the more recent flows have been a continuation in the institutional market with ABRA. It is available in the United Kingdom, it is a great complement to the GTR fund. And it is also been in the SICAF lineup. And again, it's also being received very well. It is a more complicated product in Asia just because of the regulators' aversion to derivatives. So -- but for Asia, we think it's positioned really quite well for the long term. Operator : The next question is from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous. M. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research LLP : We all kind of -- we're aware, obviously, of the sleeve of SGP's mandate that was with Woodford fund, but I think everybody was a little surprised by the big slug[ph] that was moved to Threadneedle. Have you guys gotten any more color on what drove that decision? And whether it's performance issues or price issues or just something else? Martin L. Flanagan: Yes. I don't have really any more feedback than really the question you're asking. It was a much larger switch than what we had thought the performance of equity. All the capabilities was very, very strong. There had been a review or the balance mandate, and that was really probably the outcome. So some more strategic view that they were taking. And yes, how to have that managed than anything else. That said, we feel very strongly that we would have done an exceptional job, but there was opposition. So... M. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research LLP : Okay. That's helpful. And then, in PowerShares, a broader question, I guess, around operating leverage and contribution to the whole. You've obviously seen nice expansion of the breadth of flow there, away from QQQ. I'm curious if you kind of have an idea of what the non-QQQ AUM level is for that business to really -- or you really feel like you're at a scale that the operating margin -- or operating leverage really kicks in there? Loren M. Starr: And so, Patrick, I think we arrived at that level already. We're seeing significant flows -- continued significant flows into our traditional PowerShares AUM. And so, in aggregate, we are sort of -- we came at exactly like $40 billion, at least $50 billion, probably $50 billion of AUM in our traditional PowerShares. And because the fee rate on those products are higher than the so-called term market cap-weighted type of index, which tends to be 10, 12 basis points, while we are in the 35 to 40 basis points average. We're absolutely at scale now. And the contributions are significant in terms of helping our margins expand as that asset base grows. Operator : The next question is from Chris Harris, Wells Fargo Securities. Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Another follow-up on Europe. Just wondering if this region, we know has been performing really well, flow has been great. I imagine it's high fee relative to other parts of Invesco. But how should we think about this region in terms of incremental margin? I know you gave 60% guidance for the firm overall, but would you say that this particular region has -- is maybe higher incremental margin than the firm on average? Or is it a little bit more complicated than that? Loren M. Starr: I mean -- I think, obviously, it's growing faster, which is great. And it's achieving significant scale to that growth. The fee rates in Europe tend to be higher. And so, I'd say, generally, it's at the high end of that range. And because they tend to be, again, assets that are managed through existing teams, pretty good strong operating leverage. So I don't want to get into specifics in terms of saying where it is, but it certainly is operating at probably at the higher end of the range of operating leverage for us. Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay, excellent. And then, just a quick follow-up on maybe capital management plans. Just kind of wondering what your appetite is now for incremental buybacks especially now that St. James is kind of leaving. Maybe, how do you think about that relative to perhaps the overall level of the market? Somebody, your peers, haven't been buying as much stock back as we would have thought. And I think there's been some pause due to where the market is trading right now. And so, I don't know, does that enter in your thought process at all? Maybe just a little bit more color on that would be helpful. Loren M. Starr: I mean, certainly, the opportunities for us to purchase our shares at a what we will see is a discount because of people's reaction to current news is always attractive. I mean, generally, I'd say, our position around capital management is based on our policy or philosophy around capital which is, first, we're going to use our cash to feed our organic needs. Then we, obviously, are supporting an ongoing ever-increasing dividends. And what's left over is available for buybacks. And certainly, we're seen as we're growing more opportunity to return capital to shareholders. And that's, obviously, sort of seen in our dividend -- continued dividend growth. So I'd say, generally, our opportunity to continue to return capital, we think, is growing. We've not seen any real great opportunities nor do we have a strong strategic need to do acquisitions, which we've talked about. So that takes that off the table. And we certainly have locked in our debt levels by going out long. So we're not into any process to delever. So barring any other thing, any other initiatives, we're well positioned for more capital return. We still are working to achieve our goals to maintain sufficient cash on our balance sheet to give us ultimately what we're looking for to target financial flexibility. We've not quite achieved those levels yet. And again, I think the only thing in the backdrop is the continued discussion -- regulatory discussions around capital requirements for financial institutions and, specifically, asset managers is something that we're paying attention to as it might have some impact on our thinking around capital management. Operator : The next question is from Michael Carrier, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : First question. Just on the one institutional redemption. Just curious if you had any color on asset class, like bucket or region? Loren M. Starr: It was equity. Equity and it's in Asia Pacific. Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay, all right. So I guess, when I step back and I look at the retail number that you guys reported, and I look at the organic growth in retail. It's coming in at 6% or so. And I think if you adjust for the U.K. stuff, it's even higher than that. It just seems like it's a very strong number relative to what we've seen in the industry, particularly this quarter. And I know you mentioned Europe being strong outside the U.K. and the cross-border in the U.S. But I guess, does anything really stand out when you look across the products or the regions? And I know, Marty, if we look over the past couple of years since you did the [indiscernible] in the U.S. and investing in distribution here, and then doing the same thing on the cross-border, like there's been a lot of investment to drive the growth. It seems like that, that level is a lot better just given the volatility that was on the market. So I'm just curious, it was all that kind of playing out, or if there is anything specific that really drove it this quarter? Martin L. Flanagan: I'd say 8 years later it's an overnight success. I mean, I think you're on the core of it. I mean, we have been absolutely focused to build an independent global asset management with a diverse range of investment capability to meet client needs. And I know that sounds so simple. But if you have to look underneath, and it's really the diversity of that flows, by region, by channel, by asset class, is really the fundamental strength. And where we have had -- we have some big holes to address. And we think we've really addressed them. And we think we're in a position that we're going to continue to do well through really almost any market cycle. Obviously, some are going to be more favorable than not. And I'd still say, when we get the more of an equity tailwind we are extremely well positioned for that. Loren M. Starr: And one other thing I'll just mention is, I mean, obviously, we have great opportunity in Europe and in Asia Pac as well as in the U.S. But when you're large in a particular location, it's hard to grow organically consistently at a high level. But we're still, I would say, well positioned. The opportunity for us to grow outside the U.S. is enormous. And so, we think, in terms of our ability to grow really more quickly, it's probably more likely to happen outside the U.S. than in the U.S. And we have, obviously, have a great position there. Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. That's helpful. And then, just a follow-up. I guess, just any clarity or guidance, I guess, on a few items. So performance fees, obviously, that'll come down. But just anything that we should be thinking about in the second or third quarter from a more seasonal versus the others. And then, same thing in the other expenses. Obviously, I know it's extremely volatile. And then, just on the institutional outlook. Just given that redemption, when you look at the pipeline, whether it's on the real estate, the alternative fixed income side, can you see any color there? Loren M. Starr: So in terms of performance fees, I would say the step down will take place in the second quarter and third quarter relative to the first quarter because we don't have the U.K. trusts kicking in. But we've fairly been able to generate a reasonable amount of fees from bank loan products and real estate products and other products in Asia. So again, very hard to predict. But I do think sort of more in line with the $5 million level is probably more realistic. I mean, there's always the opportunity to do something bigger depending on if a particular fund kind of hits the target. And so, but those are difficult for me to ultimately predict. And so, I would just sort of suggest think about the $5 million level as sort of a general performance fee place holder for the next couple of quarters. And then, on other revenues, once again, I think probably we had a good quarter in other revenues. It may drift down a little bit into future quarters, but nothing material I think in terms of major changes there. And then, finally, on institutional flows and pipeline. I think we certainly have seen the SJP come and announce. That one's gone. Beyond that, the pipeline looks good. We see continued strong interest in our products, and our fee activity is high. So again, we feel pretty good, pretty confident that the institutional picture is going to improve. And certainly, we don't have any sort of large sort of Asia-esque kind of that particular outflow we talked about, the $3.5 billion. There's nothing like that on our future that we'll be worried about. Operator : The next question is from Robert Lee, KBW. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : I guess I have a question. You mentioned the press release taking some actions in some business... Martin L. Flanagan: Robert, you're breaking up. Can you speak in the phone? Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : In the press release, you've talked about some business optimization initiatives took some charges. Could you maybe flush that out a little bit? Should we be expecting more of that? And kind of how should we think about that kind of impacting the margins going forward? I mean, do you have a specific type of cost-savings initiatives or objectives out of those initiatives? Loren M. Starr: So -- well, I'm happy to answer that. So it wasn't initiative. There isn't anything like that, that you should expect going forward. This is something we've been sort of planning, thinking about for some time. It really, as you can imagine, we have a lot of offices in many different countries. And our footprint is somewhat tied to actions taken 10 years ago when we might have put a lease in place. And ultimately, the firm continues to evolve and change. And one perfect example would be as we continue to leverage our Hyderabad office more, we're adding more space there, continue to grow that. And some of the other areas where we might have been doing some of the activity that we expect will be done in India is shifting too. So basically, this was a cleanup that allowed us to sort of align our \"who's doing what, where\" better. And so, a lot of the colors, so to speak, I mean, was around other shared service office where we had something in Dublin, for example. That was -- we vacated some of the space there. So we are using more space in Hyderabad. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : Great. And maybe the follow-up to -- if I think about the revamping of really the whole business in the last 7 or 8 years, whether it's distribution or infrastructure or products, I'm just curious how you're thinking about product pricing as maybe evolved. I mean, for example, you had a large product, a large account leave in your last quarter, $3 billion of assets but low fee. If you were -- if you're sitting where you are today, is that the kind of account you would take on today if there was a very low fee structure? I mean, how you've kind of thought about -- or change you're thinking about willingness to take on large low fee mandates? Martin L. Flanagan: It's a good question. And I think you have to start by what is the asset class, right? So we feel we're in a position right now that we've highly competitive teams with real talent. And we, frankly, do look at capacity of teams. And if you have a high-performing team and there's limited capacity and somebody wants us to enter something below market, we're just not going to do it. And again, that you only get to that position by a strong investment performance and the like. And we're just really focused on total alignment with the clients. And it should be fair for both parties because mostly, if it's not, you get bad outcomes. And so, we just think we're just -- we're very systematic in how we think about pricing and capacity and the team's ability to manage money. And so, for example, they say we can't manage any more money. Then, we just stop. So you just really have to be quite focused. I think that's really the main theme that we would say. Loren M. Starr: Yes. And again, I think if you -- I mean, fairly, even though it's low fee, it doesn't mean it's bad business. So I don't mean to indicate low fee is bad business and -- I mean, you can get scale in a particular account or a particular asset class. It very well may be the smart and economically correct thing to do to do that. We do look at that. We do have a discipline around that. So again, I think we do it pretty well. Operator : The next question comes from Luke Montgomery from Sanford Bernstein. Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : Just a quick one on the operating margin. How might we think about adjusting for the performance fees? And maybe you can remind me what the comp ratio is against those fees. And then, assuming a lower level of fees, would your margin have actually been sequentially higher this quarter? Loren M. Starr: All right. So on the performance fees, I mean, the only thing I would say, I'll repeat. There's about $13 million in this quarter that's nonrecurring. I mean, it's probably going to go away. So of the $27.6 million, I would expect $13 million to not be there. And then, on comp base, it really varies from location to location and team to team. And so, I don't think it's a great sort of practice for us to sort of go in and talk about what the comp ratios are for each performance fee. So if it's okay, I'll probably just beg off on that one. Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : Fair enough. And then, I just want to make sure I understand you correctly. Between Edinburgh Trust and St. James, we can conclude that pretty much all the Woodford institutional money is that experienced redemption, or have been renegotiated a lower fee rate. And then, it seems like the commentary on the U.K. business implies retail flows are basically flat in April. So can you confirm just seeing that picture clearly? Loren M. Starr: So I would say you're largely correct on the institutional side, that pretty much everything big stuff is out. There maybe smaller, small-time kind of thing platforms but, again, marginally that was the big news. In terms of the retail side, we've been in outflow. And so, I think my point was more about we continued to be in outflow in April, but nothing has spiked off. There's been no reaction that's been sort of offered around any news particularly around the FCA announcements that we've seen so far. Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : Okay. And then, final one, you've talked a bit in recent quarters about your efforts to increase recognition side, third-party distribution channels, and I'm talking about the U.S. here. I think you've been slightly frustrated about the progress there given your strong performance. So maybe an update on how that's going, and then your general thoughts around the sustainability of distribution advantages? And how those, like yourselves, coming from less strong position, can cope with that? Martin L. Flanagan: Yes. It's a good question. I think we continue to work very hard to sort of get the recognition in the United States. And I'd still say, depth, breadth of the organization relative to the performance is still not fully appreciated within the marketplace. And so, we continue to make all the efforts to do that. I think the reality, as we've talked in the past, is it's always frustratingly slow closing that gap. That said, and we're putting our heads down and taking through how best we can close that gap. And frankly, from the sustainability of our distribution positioning, I think it does -- it's the totality of it all, right? It has to start with breadth of capabilities are strongly, consistently performing and I think we've not shown that for any number of years. But you do have to have distribution excellence. And I'd say the quality of our distribution capabilities throughout the organization but in particular in the United States, is up quite dramatically. And we think we're strong as any competitor in the marketplace. How we think about it, how we serve our clients, the breadth of coverage, the value added to the marketplace and, again, I think the competition -- if you don't have the resources to compete on the distribution side, I think you are going to be relegated to a second tier status. As the years continue, it's just getting much more competitive as you know. But we think we're very well placed against that thought. Operator : The next question is from Marc Irizarry, Goldman Sachs. Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Great. Marty, can you talk a little bit about the institutional business by, I guess, by client domicile? If you look at your gross inflows in institutional, they've stepped-up. I'm curious what asset classes or regions are you seeing the most, the biggest wins there? And is that sort -- are we sort of at a new level just given where you are in terms of your product breadth and your institutional capabilities across regions? Martin L. Flanagan: Yes. So let me -- I'll pick up on some of that, and then Loren can add. So I think overall theme, pretty much globally, real estate bank loans are -- there's a desire globally. But then, when you start to move into other regions, you can get more specific. On the continent there's an focus where we've seen some big strong mandate wins through our quantitative capabilities. Even things like Japanese equities are very mandated, so we're winning in the continent. And when you go that out to Asia, again, you get bank loans, real estate. But again, global equities is a topic there. Asian equities is a topic there. So it just becomes broader in different asset classes in the different regions. We talked about ABRA as another one that you're seeing institutionally continued to have interest. And probably, not far behind that right now, emerging interest in the GTR capability institutionally, specifically in the United States, in the U.K., and on the continent. And we would imagine probably, in time, in Asia, too. So it is just the broadening of the mandates around the world is a very important element of that. Loren M. Starr: And the other thing -- I mean, we're also seeing some of alternatives like Commonwealth Transportation Fund. That's funded. So again, it's in the U.S. That's probably more of a U.S. focus thing. Stable value in the U.S. So could vary from location to location. Operator : Next question is from Eric Berg, RBC Capital Markets. Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : [Technical Difficulty] I'll give you a minute to turn to it. Martin L. Flanagan: I think you got cut off in your first part of your statement. Sorry. Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : I was saying that it would appear that you have remaining in the equity income fund, in the U.K., $44.5 billion. First, can you give me the split between institutional and retail at this juncture? Loren M. Starr: In equity income, it's, post the departure of SJP, it's like probably 99% retail. Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay. So just -- I really have one question only. Going back to Marty's comment earlier and I'm paraphrasing, that the really tough stuff is behind us. What is the basis for that comment in the sense that we now have approximately $44 billion that includes the $13 billion, right? Is that correct? Loren M. Starr: No. The $44 billion was the end of Q1. As of April, you got to take the $13 billion out, right? So... Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Right. Yes. So the number is now in the neighborhood of $31 billion, virtually all of which is retail. Why is the world -- why is the tough stuff behind us? Why won't there be an enormous struggle for these retail assets? Martin L. Flanagan: My point, Eric, is that the -- what I said was the large single-trigger asset pools, which tend to be institutional, which tend to move almost immediately. Those decisions have been made. The secondary point that I would say is, we're in a battle every single day with a broad range of competitors that have been in the market for decades that are strongly tenured high-performing money managers, highly resourced, and will continue to do that. And we do that very well. That's my point. Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : And would you say that the -- last question. Would you say that the loss of assets -- the percentage loss of assets institutionally provides an indication of what will happen on the retail side, or by no means? Martin L. Flanagan: Say the question, again. I'm sorry. Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Does what happened institutionally provide a cue or an indication for what will happen on the retail side. Martin L. Flanagan: No. [indiscernible] I don't think we can do that. No. That's not the experience we've had historically. Operator : And I'm showing no further questions. Martin L. Flanagan: Okay. Well, thank you very much, everybody. And thanks for the breadth of questions and the depth questions. And again, look, we think we had a very solid quarter. And we're looking for good things in the quarters and years to come. And thank you very much. We'll talk to you soon. Operator : Thank you for participating in today's conference.

Operator : Welcome to Invesco's second quarter results conference call. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I'd like to turn the call over to the speakers for today : Mr. Martin L. Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; and Mr. Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin. Martin L. Flanagan: Thank you very much, and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. With me is Loren Starr, Invesco's CFO, and we'll be speaking to the presentation that's available on the website if you're so inclined to follow. Today, we'll provide a review of the business results for the second quarter. Loren will then go into greater detail of the financials and we will then wrap it up with Q&A. So let me begin by highlighting the firm's operating results for the quarter, which you'll find on Slide 3. Long-term investment performance remained strong across all time periods during the quarter. Strong investment performance, a broad diversity of flows and continued focus on client contributed to strong overall flows for the quarter. These were offset somewhat by a previously disclosed single client withdrawal in our U.K. business, which resulted in net long-term outflows of $6.9 billion. Excluding the single client withdrawal, long-term net inflows would have totaled $6.2 billion across our global business. Adjusted operating income was up 21.4% over the same quarter last year, and a continued focus on taking a disciplined approach to our business drove continued improvement in our operating margin to 41.8% from 39.3% in the same quarter a year ago, an increase of 2.5 percentage points. Assets under management rose to $802 billion during the quarter, up from $787 billion in the prior quarter. Operating income was $377 million versus $363 million in the prior quarter. Earnings per share were $0.65, up from $0.60 in the prior quarter. The quarterly dividend remained $0.25 per share, up 11% from 2013, and we've repurchased $50 million in common stock during the quarter. Before Loren goes into detail on the financials, let me take a moment to review the investment performance and some business highlights. I'm on Slide 6 now. Investment performance during the quarter was strong across all time periods. 80% of assets were ahead of peers on a 3- and 5-year basis and 72% of assets were ahead of peers on a 1-year basis. As you might expect with numbers like these, long-term performance for investment team across the enterprise was quite strong with a number of capabilities achieving top decile performance. Turning to flows on Page 7, you'll see gross sales remained strong during the quarter, although down from exceptionally strong first quarter. As we mentioned on our last call, there was an exceptional single client withdrawal in our U.K. business of $13.1 billion early in the second quarter, which resulted in long-term net outflows of $6.9 billion. Without this withdrawal, total long-term net inflows would have been $6.2 billion. These numbers also reflect the broad diversity of flows we saw across our global business during the quarter, which includes strength in real estate, fixed income, European equities, Asian equities and others. Gross sales in our retail channel were also strong during the second quarter, although off slightly from the exceptional first quarter. Continued strength in our European cross-border retail product range and solid gross sales across our business helped offset the previously disclosed single client withdrawal we experienced in the U.K. The institutional channel continue to -- saw continued demand for real estate and Asian equities across the globe drove positive flows during the quarter. Overall, sales during the period were typical for the second quarter and reduced redemptions led to long-term inflows of $1.3 billion. The institutional pipeline of one, but not funded mandate continues to be strong, principally in alternatives, real estate bank loans and non-U.S. active equities. Let me take a moment to highlight our global business, which you'll find on Slide 9. In the Americas, U.S. flows were driven by international growth and U.S. Value equities, high-yield munis and UITs. And the redemption rate was 22% versus the industry average of 27%. U.S. retail gross sales were up 29% over the trailing 12 months in 2014 versus the same period in 2013. And there was a 65% increase in the number of mutual funds and ETFs with more than $100 million of inflows. A client-focused effort on April flows and top quartile investment performance in the U.S. drove down redemptions and further eased outflows from $526 million in January to outflows of $72 million in June. In Asia-Pacific, we saw continued strong gross and net inflows with the exception of increased redemption in Chinese active equities where we saw some profit taking after the very strong results a year ago. The Shinko U.S. REIT and the Australian bond fund both enjoyed continued strong inflows. We also so good flows in Asia-Pacific institutional. Our EMEA business continued to become more diversified with significant flows to the Fixed Income, non-U.S. equities and our multi-asset capability. All driven by very strong investment performance. U.K. retail gross flows were higher year-to-date in the prior year and flows into the cross-border business were significantly ahead of last year. Assets under management by our EMEA business totaled $176 billion, as you can see on Slide 10. During the second quarter, net flows into EMEA, excluding U.K. equity income, were $300 million, which reflects the previously disclosed single client withdrawal earlier in the quarter. We're pleased to report that the client reactions to departure news has been subdued and we saw no spike in redemptions at the time of a competing fund launch in June. Given our efforts to thoughtfully manage the transition, assets in the 2 principal funds have fallen just 15% from the departure announcement in October of last year through the end of June. We expect future growth in EMEA to more than offset any potential outflows from the funds. Mark Barnett and the team continue to deliver outstanding results for clients. As of mid-July, the 2 funds were sixth and eighth out of 265 funds in their sector over 1 year. Redemptions from advisors, the largest component of assets in the funds, are returning to industry norms and have clearly not impacted fund performance. This is a good outcome and we remain cautiously optimistic as clients are choosing to remain invested in the funds. Meanwhile, 2014 gross sales across our broader U.K. retail franchise are at all-time high of $7.3 billion year-to-date in 2014 versus $5.7 billion during the same period in 2013. We find these results encouraging and we'll continue to do everything we can to deliver good outcomes for clients and grow the EMEA business. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Loren for a review of the financials. Loren M. Starr: Thanks very much, Marty. So quarter-over-quarter total AUM increased $15.1 billion or 1.9% and this was driven by positive market returns and FX of $23.9 billion and net inflows in money market funds of $1.1 billion and these increases were offset by long-term outflows of $6.9 billion and $3 billion of outflows from the QQQ. Our average AUM for the quarter was $790.1 billion and that's up 1.3% versus the first quarter average. Our net revenue yield came in at 45.6 basis points, which was flat quarter-over-quarter. The decline in performance fees from the first quarter reduced our revenue yield by 1.4 basis points and this was entirely offset by increases in our effective fee rate as a result of improved mix, one extra day during the quarter and higher other revenues in 2Q. Now before we turn to operating results as we always do, just a quick peek into our current flow trends. As of yesterday, we had $2.3 billion in long-term net inflows across diversified geographies and also diversified across our investment capabilities. The only caveat obviously is we're entering August so there tends to be some seasonality and also obviously there is some market volatility, but we're off to a very nice start into Q3. So now turning to our operating results. You'll see that our net revenues increased $13.2 million or 1.5% quarter-over-quarter to $901 million. That included positive FX impact of $6.6 million. And within net revenues, you'll see that our investment management fees grew by $65.5 million or 6.6% to $1.05 billion. This somewhat exceptionally large increase was due to several factors : first, in April, aligned with evolving industry best practices, our U.K. business took the proactive step to introduce a single fund management fee for their retail funds in an effort to address complexity in overall fund fee structures. This single fee replaced the separate annual management fee and fund registration fee. The results of this change was a shift, and it was purely a shift, of $29.6 million out of service and distribution revenues and into investment management fees. Excluding the impact of this shift, investment management fees would have increased $35.9 million or a 3.6%, which is consistent with our higher average AUM, an additional day during the quarter and again continued improvement in our effective fee rate. FX increased investment management fees by $8.6 million. Service and distribution revenues were down $23.9 million or 10%. As I just mentioned, the change in the fee structure in U.K. resulted in a decline of $29.6 million. Excluding the impact of this shift, service and distribution fees would have increased $5.7 million or 2.4%. FX increased service and distribution revenues by $0.2 million. So in the quarter, performance fees came in at $7.3 million and that was a decrease of $22.5 million from Q1. Foreign exchange had no impact on performance fees in the quarter. In terms of guidance going forward, the Q3 tends to be a seasonal low point for performance fees and we believe the range could be somewhere between $2 million and $5 million. For Q4 of this year and beyond, the picture is somewhat less clear. There are certain real estate and other alternative funds and institutional accounts that could generate meaningful performance fees, but recognizing this revenue is limited by the potential for contingencies such as clawbacks per our accounting policy. Other revenues in the second quarter came in at $38.9 million and that was an increase of $3.2 million. Invesco launched successfully a Japanese REIT fund in June, which resulted in $6 million of transaction fees in the quarter. The $6 million in fees should not be viewed as recurring, and as a result, I think other revenues you should think should fall to the level of $33 million to $35 million in Q3. Third-party distribution service and advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues increased by $5.3 million or 1.3%. That is in line with our higher revenues derived from REIT-related retail AUM. FX increased these expenses by $2.9 million. Moving on down the slide, you'll see that adjusted operating expenses at $524 million decreased by $0.8 million or 0.2% relative to the first quarter. FX increased operating expenses by $3.1 million during the quarter. Drilling down into expenses. On employee compensation, that came in at $344.6 million. That was a decrease of $8.5 million or 2.4%. The decrease in Q2 was a result of the normal reduction in payroll tax costs, which was partially offset by increased incentive compensation and a full quarter's worth of base salary increases that took effect on March 1. FX increased compensation by $2.1 million. Looking forward, assuming flat ending AUM, we expect compensation to increase by approximately $5 million to $8 million in the third quarter and then remain roughly flat into Q4. This change is consistent with the fact that our current AUM level is about 2% higher than the second quarter average AUM level. Marketing expense increased by $6.7 million or 27.7% to $30.9 million as a result of advertising and client-related marketing in EMEA. FX increased these expenses by $0.2 million. We expect marketing expense to remain flat into Q3 and then increase somewhere up to $35 million in Q4 due to our continued focus on EMEA-specific marketing opportunities. Property, office and technology expenses came in at $76.1 million in the second quarter, which was down $1.6 million. The decrease reflects lower rent and related costs due to vacating of leased properties in the first quarter. FX increased these expenses by $0.4 million. Looking forward, we'd expect property, office and technology costs will increase to $80 million to $82 million per quarter for the remainder of the year. This increase is a result of continued technology investments, a doubling of space taken to accommodate the continued growth in our Hyderabad office and variable costs related to our elevated sales activity in Europe. General and administrative expenses came in at $72.4 million. That's up $2.6 million or 3.7%. The increase was due to greater legal, training and other professional services costs incurred during the quarter. FX increased G&A by $0.4 million. We'd expect G&A to remain around $73 million to $75 million as we continue to launch new products and pursue business growth initiatives. Continuing on down the page, you'll see the non-operating income increased $12.9 million compared to the first quarter. The increase was primarily driven by realized gains on seed capital investments of $5.7 million and we also had $4.7 million gain from the liquidation of a CLO in the quarter. The firm's effective tax rate on preadjusted net income in Q2 was 26.5%. Looking forward, we expect the effective tax rate to remain between 26% to 27%, which brings us to our EPS or adjusted EPS of $0.65 and our adjusted net operating margin of 41.8%. And with that, I will now turn things back over to Marty. Martin L. Flanagan: All right. Thanks very much, and operator, can we go to questions, please? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Daniel Fannon, Jefferies. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : I guess, just on the Perpetual products and more the equity income funds, you highlighted no spike in redemptions. I guess can you talk about kind of the gross sales dynamic in those products pre and post the competing launch. And then kind of the outlook, I think you said you're having the highest gross sale of all time in EMEA. Can you just kind of talk about what the top fund -- the top sales or funds that are driving those sales as well. Martin L. Flanagan: Yes, so let me start that and clarify, Dan. So what I was pointing was gross sales in the U.K. are at an all-time high. So you compare gross sales this year to date as compared to last year, year-to-date. Let me pull the numbers again. It was, as I'm paging through it, was -- so year-to-date gross sales in the U.K. were $7.3 billion versus $5.7 billion a year ago. And so the uptake has been a broad -- a real broadening of gross sales into the U.K. business. So that includes European equities, global equities, Asia -- Asian equities, the multi-asset strategies and just the fixed income continues to be very, very strong literally across-the-board. And if you look at the investment performance, asset class-by-asset class, it's just incredibly strong. And so the point that we're trying to make is the business has never been stronger. Yes, there's been a transition to Mark's results who put up some -- and team some really good numbers, but that is the main message there. And I don't have the specific gross flows of the U.K. equity income products, but what I can say is the redemptions are back to industry norms and typically when you go through changes like that, you start by being put on hold and some of the holds are being taken off and so you're starting to see gross sales pick up also. So it's a really -- again in the context of an important change, the business has never been stronger. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Great. And then I guess, Loren, just to clarify the comment around the fee change in the U.K. with regards to the management fees and I guess the impact on sales and distribution fees, is that ongoing when we think about the economics today and that impact is kind of the run rate from here? Loren M. Starr: Yes, Dan. Yes, it's purely a shift. It has nothing to do with RDR. It's really just the shift that is onetime, and then foregoing, it will continue on that same track. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : And any change in client behavior as a result of that shift? Loren M. Starr: No, I mean, I think we've gotten very good praise from the industry, from regulators and others who care about this. So, so far, it's been well received and I think we are sort of out in front of many, many others in the industry first with this. We'll see how others follow. Operator : The next question is from Chris Harris, Wells Fargo. Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : So a quick one on Perpetual. I know we've talked about the outflows for some time now and it's definitely good news that there's been no spike since you've launched the competing fund. But it doesn't appear to me that the outflows are slowing that material there either. Just wanted to maybe if you can confirm if that's accurate, number one. And then number two, do you think you have any sort of visibility on maybe when those might kind of decelerate in a more significant degree? I know it's hard, but maybe just many of your discussions with clients or what have you that might give you a little bit of comfort or color about the trajectory of that. Loren M. Starr: Look, Chris, I think what you're seeing is there's still some smaller platforms that are sort of making smaller moves, much, much smaller level of magnitude relative to what you saw with the SJP and that's really what you're seeing currently and that probably persists somewhere between now and the end of the year, quite honestly. We do think X those little kind of smaller platform positions, the overall trend in the core retail advisor-led book of business is definitely stabilizing. But we're definitely looking to increase our advertising in Q4 and marketing. And so we're not being complacent around everything is fine still. There's still work that we think should be done. But factually, we've not seen big spikes and it seems more of a business as usual addition in the U.K. than anything else. Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Yes, that is definitely good news. Okay. Real quick follow-up then on the margin. Very specific guidance you've given us, but just more kind of broad, big picture question. Incredible improvement in the merger and you guys are kind of exceeding what you had said you'd do there. I know some of that is market related, but as you sit here today, where do you really think this number can go? I mean, do you think there's a lot more room to run on your operating margin? Loren M. Starr: So I think, Chris, as we've said in the past. It will have a lot to do with sort of marketing environment we're in and what sort of help we're going to get from equities versus fixed income-led type of environment. We have and can and will grow under sort of flat markets. We have very good product that will be very much in demand under a sort of volatile-type market environment. We think that when equity markets are stronger, however, we actually will fare even better generally and so our incremental margin is probably going to be higher when you're in an equity-led market than otherwise. But with that said, we're still sort of in that range sort of 55% incremental margin, 60% incremental margin, which should help us continue to drive the margin upward over time. So there isn't anything structural that would prevent our margins from continuing to expand as you've seeing them do right now. Operator : The next question is from Bill Katz, Citigroup. William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Just to follow up on that thread of question, just to work it the other way. Given such high incremental margin and a good performance of the platform on what appears to be overcoming the Woodford attrition nicely, why not step up the spending earlier to really capitalize on the positioning of the platform and maybe trade a little unit growth for margin? Martin L. Flanagan: So I'm surprised you asked that question, Bill. The fundamental fact is what you're seeing with the margin expansion, what is going along with it is strong reinvestment in the business right now. We've continued to do, it but we're getting margin expansion while reinvesting in the business. And the areas that we've talked about over time, Continental Europe was a focus and you can see things coming from that. Fixed income has been a focus. You can see the investment performance in fixed income is very strong right now. That was another area that we think were followed by flows. Also very important to us is the alternative platform, which has been, really, we think it's a core strength of the organization. And we've been expanding that and taking it globally. And so we're trying to be very, very thoughtful in our expansion, investing while at the same time generating the returns that you would expect of us as good stewards. So I appreciate the thought, but we are very much investing. Loren M. Starr: I can confirm that. William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay, that's more of a devil's advocate question. The second question I have is when you look in Europe, and maybe I did the math a little too quick this morning, I think it was about 30% annualized rate of growth in new business. What is it that's driving it? Is this a further market share opportunity, broader geography reach, better distribution, a combination thereof? What are some of the key drivers to that solid growth? Martin L. Flanagan: So yes, again that was one of those overnight successes that we started 4 years ago and it was across-the-board. And you should go back a few years, you'll look at it so redoing the servicing platform, which was fundamental; realigning the product lineup, and if you look at it right now, this is very robust product lineup with the investment performance being extremely strong across the asset classes there; and with, frankly, a strategy that you would hope, very concentrated on those areas that we think we could make a difference and sales execution and taking care of clients. And that's what you're seeing happening. And I think importantly, if you look at the flows there going into, we should want to call it, core asset classes, which years gone by it was much more smaller asset classes. So again, we just feel the robustness of where we are and the future opportunity is very, very strong for us in the continent. So we don't think we're done. William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : And just one last one. When you think about money market reform, a couple of your peers have sort of commented on what the implications might be. It's obviously early days. Just based on your mix, how do you sort of see any impact on the business and maybe what are you hearing from clients? Martin L. Flanagan: So good question. It's hard to believe what started in 2008 is finally coming to an end. I'd say in the -- again, put on your analyst hat in the worst case, if all our prime went away, it's what, Loren? Loren M. Starr: $30 billion, about $30 billion AUM. Martin L. Flanagan: Yes, so it's not... Loren M. Starr: 11 basis points. Martin L. Flanagan: 11 basis points. So it's not a huge financial impact, but let me -- but here's the reality. We don't think that's going to happen to us. If you look at the suite of money fund capabilities we have, they're very, very competitive. We think we're going to be really very fine in it. And again, I think we'll be positioned very, very strongly in the changes as they come through. And clients are still trying to -- look it's been a -- it's not a new story. So clients are banging [ph] their heads around this potential outcome probably for 24 months, I'd say, already. Loren M. Starr: So I mean, we've created other products that would be nice alternatives to prime fund option, which we think would capture a significant amount of people who want to find something of a similar nature. We obviously have a government fund where people might go to initially. So in terms of the loss of the full $30 billion, I think that is sort of the very tail of risk to the business. Operator : The next question is from Michael Kim, Sandler O'Neill + Partners. Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : So first, just in terms of flows. Loren, you'd touched on this a bit earlier, but just looking ahead, do you feel like you really need sort of a sustained favorable market backdrop to really drive organic growth to the next level, if you will, understanding that there are still areas of the business that can continue to grow even assuming the markets remain somewhat choppy? Loren M. Starr: Yes, I mean, I think we have close to 48% of our assets, something around there, in equities. So the reality is for us to be able to grow our AUM as a percentage, sort of organic growth rate, equities need to somehow be plain enrolled there. Otherwise, we can grow and we have certainly huge diversification growth of other asset classes that would be in demand when we weren't or not in an equity-led market. But we do think, overall, our ability to get organic growth to the highest level would probably be under on an equity-led market. But again, it's all relative, right, to peers and competitors. So we still think we should and we obviously aspire to do better than our competitors under all markets in terms of being able to grow. Martin L. Flanagan: And I'd probably add to that, Michael. So Loren is especially correct when you saw that happen this quarter where it was less of an equity-led market this past quarter. And we still did quite well, but getting back to the point I made earlier, I think if you were looking out a couple of years, you have to expect some volatility. You have to expect rates to go up at some point and a pullback in the equity markets. And so that gets back to this point of we thought it really, really important to have a broad suite of alternative capabilities that were in place for those types of markets, focused much more on outcomes for clients. And so again I think the diversity of the business and the strength of the alternative capabilities along with fixed income and equity just put us in a very unique position regardless of the market. Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : Got it, that's helpful. And then just on the capital management front, continue to repurchase shares, cash continues to build. So just curious to get your thoughts on sort of the regulatory front across regions, and how that may be playing into your capital management thinking, if at all? Loren M. Starr: I don't think we're -- it's business as usual on the capital management front right now. We are, obviously, keenly observant and listening to -- and observing on what's going on, on the regulatory front, as you said. But there isn't anything imminent that we're seeing that is going to affect our business-as-usual approach, but it is something that we are smartly watching. Marty, I don't know if you have any further... Martin L. Flanagan: Yes -- no, I agree with that. So we're on the -- our stated capital policies that we have been on. But I think it would be unwise to ignore the regulatory focus and we're very engaged in trying to understand what's possible. But again, we're still heading down the path that we've been on at the moment. Operator : The next question is from Glenn Schorr, ISI. Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : On the alt front, we talked -- danced around that a little bit. So I want to do 2 things : one is talk about the new product launches that happened, I guess, over the last 2 quarters, particularly on the liquid alt front just talk about performance, talk about what you've been able to muster up in terms of sales; and then, two, at a broader level, performance at least on what we can see on the equity side of alt isn't where you wanted to be. Just talk through what particularly you see the most positive outlook on the alt front? Martin L. Flanagan: Sure, so let me get started. So it has been, as you point out, end of last year versus part of this year, so introduction of really suite of alts more broadly not just in the U.S., but in the U.K., in the offshore range also. Our view is, as we said in the past, when you introduce capabilities you have to think that it's a 3-year outlook and if it happens before that, you're quite fortunate. But that's been our framework. That said, if you look at the teams, these are teams who've been managing close to the same strategies for a very long time institutionally with some very, very good track records. That's a very helpful element, too, and some of them are extensions of what's been done in the past whether it be around IBRA and different extensions there. So that's helpful. I'd say the shorter-term opportunity probably looks more with the GTR capability, global total return capability that's getting some traction. But again, I'd say early days. It will be -- the first launch in the U.K. was September a year ago, so you're coming up on 1 year, performance is very, very strong. And it's that type of asset class or product that people are looking at is more a less volatile targeted return and... Loren M. Starr: I think we have about $1 billion in that capability. Martin L. Flanagan: $1 billion so far. So again, our view is 3-year view and we'll have some likely positive surprises within that period, but it's hard to identify. Loren M. Starr: I think we're also having great, I wouldn't say success, but early success with our long/short capability, which the performance is very, very strong. So there may be something we'll see, but these are all small products right now. It takes a while. And then on your question on the equity side of alt, I'm not sure exactly what you're referring too, Glenn, but when you look at our performance, I think you may be looking at the REITs more than in an equity part. So maybe can you just clarify what you're talking about, Glenn? Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Sure, just Slide 18. It just shows those little ring charts on percent of assets in the top half, first bottom half. Loren M. Starr: Core, is that what -- so you said alts or you said core? Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Alternatives. Loren M. Starr: Okay. So that is dominated by -- because alternatives, the way we capture this information for performance is when you have publicly available peers that we can compare to. And so the vast majority of our alternatives don't have public -- publicly available peers that we can talk about relative ranking. So this one slide is really being dominated by the REITs that are publicly traded. So it's not really an equity. It has to be -- everything to do with the way we manage that REIT product is very conservatively managed with some strong positive fall has been, I mean, we're generating sort of billions of sort of interest in that product. So it hasn't affected the demand for the product. So it's a little misleading, I think, when you look at that slide and you sort of broadly brush alternatives in terms of the performance. Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. Last quickie, if I could. It's good to see the buyback and the share count down 3% year-on-year. And I know you guys are planning conservative, but you've got a lot of cash, you keep making more every quarter and the stock is cheap. I'm just curious on just increasing the pace at some point. Meaning, if things are going well and your producing a lot of cash flow and the stock is cheap, if not now, when, is, I guess, the question I get? Loren M. Starr: So I think we've been of the mind that sort of being opportunistic when we think about buybacks and we continue to do so. We've also seen sort of rushing in and doing big buybacks can often lead to poor choices around the timing of markets. So the consistency of sort of averaging it through over periods of time has generally seemed to work better than sort of rapid step-ups. And so we have continued in terms of aggregate amounts to continue to buy back more of our stock. You should expect us to continue to do so, but I think it is in terms of what we said earlier, our priorities have not shifted in terms of how we see the needs of our capital and we continue to focus on sort of reinvesting in the business as our number one draw. And we have seen, more recently, some bigger needs around some seedings and co-investments as some of these alternative products have been getting off the ground. Martin L. Flanagan: And I would add the other thing, which you would know very well. What, 2 years ago, we made a permanent change to materially increase the dividend and sort of make a permanent commitment to paying back to shareholders. And so when we looked at it, it was a totality of giving back to shareholders and a much heavy emphasis on dividends, not to say that we won't do stock buybacks. We'll continue to do it, but I think that was another strong message we are trying to get across. Operator : The next question is from Ken Worthington, JPMC. Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : So Marty, I think you undersold this, so this I'm going to give it another shot at it. So you launched a host of new products in the U.S. The uptake of GTR has been excellent, even though it's really young product. So how far along is the product in terms of getting on new channels in the U.K. and Europe? You took in, I think, over $0.5 billion last quarter. So given the young age of the fund, why has it been so successful because it seems like the launch is doing even better than IBRA did and IBRA kind of peaked at $30 billion. So... Martin L. Flanagan: All right, Ken, well, thank you. You're correct. And so let me put it in more context. So the U.K. is really certain. Again, that was the first launch last September. First, let me say this, across-the-board performance is very, very strong. And on the back of our client -- we came this way because we thought, in time, clients will be looking towards broadening their -- how they build their portfolios and this would be another important part in it. I'd say we're really early days in that development. That said, flows are really strong in U.K., as you pointed out. On the Continent, too, they are taken up much quicker than we thought they would. So again, as we look out to the next 12 months, we'd anticipate that would be another market where they would really probably do well. And I'd say, the teams reputation is more recognized in the U.K. and on a continent, as you would expect, coming from the U.K. originally. So those are probably be the 2 early markets where you'd see continued expansion and acceleration of flows. In the U.S., again, relatively early. There's quite a bit of interest. There's emerging, as you would imagine, institutional demand and that could probably be the area in the States where it might pick up more rapidly than in the retail channel. But again, I think it's a really attractive product with good performance. And again, you can do the extrapolation on IBRA, I won't. But again, it's strong performing and we think it's a very big opportunity. Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : How far along is it, though, in terms of getting on platforms because it's a new product. Is it half the way? Is it all the way? Is it 10% of the way? Loren M. Starr: So I think in the U.S., it's on a lot of the platforms, if not most of the platforms, but it is not yet sort of been sort of gatekeeper approved in terms of the models. So it is one of these things that just getting on the platform doesn't mean that it's -- we're going to be able to sell. And so it is one of these things, it's the first step of many to really have this product succeed in the U.S. But don't take this from saying that -- I mean, we're definitely working it hard. We think it's a huge opportunity both on a global basis. Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. And then just second question. The income in high-income funds got downgraded after Neil's departure. Based on your experience, how long would it take for those funds to kind of get back on the preferred list and recommended list if the performance remains? And I think those funds under Mark, more recently were in redemptions. What do you think needs to change to actually push those products to actually generate net new flows? Is it a simple as just keeping the performance where it is? Martin L. Flanagan: Good question. So I don't have all the specifics on the radius, but you can -- look, you can read publicly, people are actually already considering, already putting it back in the buy list. So as you said from the beginning, Mark is highly experienced. The team is highly experienced. Great track record. So I think the wholes will participate more rapidly than you would expect in a different situation because of that. And so you're seeing early [indiscernible] But let me put this in perspective, Ken. So those 2 funds were in net redemptions before Neil's announcement and I think it's a really important point because these funds, they are very large, they're very old and when you look at the historical redemptions because of the age of the holders, redemptions are a material thing each and every year. So just to get into net flows, the level of sales that you have to meet because of the sheer size is material. So if we move back to the flow levels, preannouncement, which we are getting close to, that's not a horrible thing. Now our goal is not just to remain there, it's to get back into net flows, and we think, in time that will happen. So I think that's an important point to look at also. And if you look at, take -- I don't have the specific numbers, but if you look at the combined, those 2 funds combined, they still represent, I think, they're in the top 5 of gross sales selling funds in U.K. today. So I think that's really the perspective. They're just very large and very old client base. But again, we're moving into a very relatively very good spot at this stage of it. So long winded and hopefully that's helpful. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Shutler, William Blair. Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Just a quick question on IBRA. So the performance there actually has turned around nicely for this year. So just want to get your updated thoughts on the pipeline, both retail and institutional there? Loren M. Starr: So Chris, I think we're seeing redemption rates continue to drive lower on that IBRA product. I think it was on actually out of July on a global basis, I think the flow has turned positive. So again, I think it's -- I hate to say it's a turnaround now and declaring it fully, but certainly the performance on 3-year number -- 3-year track record year-to-date are sort of in the top quartile. So the product itself is becoming, I think, far more sort of attractive again to clients who are looking for what we originally promised to give, which is a sort of balanced risk across different asset classes. And it's -- I think sales are still sort of lower than we've seen them in the past. It's actually -- that's correct on a global basis, but the flow picture has been improved largely through and much lower redemption rates. So again, the goal was obviously to drive sales higher in that product over time, if we can. Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Okay, got you. And then a totally different question, bigger picture. With the PowerShares franchise, it's mainly a retail business today, I believe. So just curious to get your take in the ETF business of the institutional opportunity. So for instance, UBS was recently in the news. For putting a big portion of your DB plan and noncap-weighted indices, which is a lot of what PowerShares does. So -- but I believe they're mainly partnering directly with the index providers instead of using off-the-shelf product. So just want to get your take on institutional opportunity in terms of alternative weighted ETFs. Martin L. Flanagan: So we do think it's an opportunity. It is one of those areas that, when I went through the litany a few minutes ago, that I didn't address but that's within it. So it's been very, very successful for us. There are further opportunities and really would be in the institutional market and it has not been an area where we have historically focused more recently we have headed down that path, so we think not just in the U.S., but in a couple other important markets we think that is an opportunity for us. So we think that will just continue to add to the ongoing success in PowerShares. Operator : The next question comes from Eric Berg, RBC Capital Markets. Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : You indicated that of the 13 approximately billion dollars of withdrawal that took place in the U.K. related to St. James's Place, that just over half of it related to the equity income funds being managed by Neil Woodford and his team, what's the remainder? Loren M. Starr: So the other half, I think it was about $5 billion in what -- I think it's called a distribution fund, which is some mix between equity income and our corporate bond offering. And the remainder is in global equities. Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay. So just to provide a rough sort of back-of-the-envelope reconciliation of where we are now relative to where we stand, how are those numbers go? And by that I mean start with how much money, please, Neil is managing at the time he announced his departure. I realized he remained with the organization for many, many months before departing and ultimately starting in his new place. But if you could just really in synopsized form start by telling us how much money he was managing in dollar terms, how much was lost to the institutional business, I think it's close to all of it, and where we stand on the remaining money, which is the retail side? Loren M. Starr: So Eric, I think originally, preannouncement, it was around $48 billion was the amount and it's currently at $37 billion roughly. So we obviously have the big institutional redemption of $13.1 billion. I think in terms of the retail outflows, generally they've been somewhere around $0.5 billion to $1 billion a month, just normal. We're just getting a lot of that. It's consistent with what we've seen historically, so nothing different than what we've seen in the past. So again, I think you could probably take that and do the math here or someone smartly doing it for me. We had $17.7 billion of outflow in the time frame. And how much of that was retail versus institutional, I think probably most of it is going to be institutional largely. Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : So you started -- in the short/long, you started with $48 billion. Loren M. Starr: Yes. Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : The redemptions have been in $17 billion. That takes you down to -- so you wouldn't, therefore, $37 billion. You'd have $48 billion minus $17 billion or 31, is that correct or... Loren M. Starr: We had market and FX that have helped to offset that. Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay, okay. And of the $17 billion in redemptions, most of it has been institutional. But just to be clear, while you talk about redemptions returning to more normal industry levels in the equity income funds, are the -- I just want to clarify, sort of triple check, the funds are in that redemption mode still, but at a lower rate than they have been. Is that kind of the point? Loren M. Starr: That's absolutely right and maybe the net redemption since 2011. So just factually, again, this is what Marty said that's part of the fabric of being biggest in the industry. But I think, yes, they've sort of returned to more normal levels. They're still, as I think we may have mentioned slightly, some elevated levels that are 2 smaller platform outflows that could still occur. But not material in any sense of close to the magnitude of the St. James's Place. And we believe, again, broadly, in the context of EMEA business, that we can grow flows to more than offset that going forward. Operator : The next question is from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research. M. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research LLP : We've heard anecdotally that the marketing of PowerShares in the U.K. pre-Woodford was fairly low. And I can't remember if you confirmed or denied that, but can you, I guess, talk about what is being done to improve the profile of that business there, particularly as it does look like the passive opportunity has gotten a little bit more interesting over the last year or so. Martin L. Flanagan: So we actually had not been in the U.K. The focus have been on the continent for us. A number of years, it's probably 2007 that we went to the ETF markets. As you know, the market was very, very different than that of the United States and has gone through tremendous change from sort of derivatives-based ETFs to really cash-based ETFs. So we think there is quite a big opportunity within EMEA, within between the U.K. and Continental Europe, in particular. And that is back to one of the earlier questions, we see the institutional opportunity being one in the U.K., in particular, to be something very, very attractive and smart beta, in particular, seems to be not just confined to ETFs, but institutional clients as an opportunity that we think we should be successful in over time. M. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research LLP : Do you think it's fair to say that, I guess, the thinking around, I guess, how much weight you want to put behind marketing PowerShares specifically in the U.K. has changed since the PM changed? Or is that not the case? Martin L. Flanagan: No, our effort has nothing to do with -- first, I'll say it's the strategic focus. Again, originally focused on the continent. We think one of the opportunities in the U.K. really has come -- is emerging because of RDR. The emergence of RDR actually, we think, is an added opportunity to the ETF markets, smart beta and also the institutional market. And U.K., as you're obviously noting is a very, very important, large ETF market that we have not historically participated in. Operator : The next question is from Brian Bedell, Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Great. Kind of actually have my question on the PowerShares, but maybe just to -- just an extension of that, how should we think about timing. You are underpenetrated in that area and the opportunity seems pretty compelling, like you said, Marty, post, especially post RDR. Should we be thinking of that as a bigger effort over the next, I don't know, 12 to 18 months with a potentially stronger ramp throughout that period? Or is this is a much longer-term group? Martin L. Flanagan: I'm sorry, you're breaking up some. Let me just confirm. So it's the ETF opportunity, what's the timing of it? Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Yes. Sort of the pace of that given that it's been more of a newer effort in terms of post-RDR that is. So I\u2019m trying to get the sense of timing now that were through the RDR process. Martin L. Flanagan: You're exactly right. So I would be, again it's probably the next 12 to 18 months that you'll start to see we're clarifying how we want to play what we think the opportunity is. And again, you'll see what we choose to do over that period of time. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. Okay, great. And then maybe shifting gears to defined-benefit market. Maybe just some color on -- obviously, you have a very good product set for the potential outflows and active equity and the shift towards passive and increased barbelling that we're seeing through some alpha products and a more liability-driven investing. Maybe just some color on how you're positioned there. Should we see potential increases in mandates for you on that side? Or do you view it as more of a balanced risk for your franchise overall? Martin L. Flanagan: Let me try to answer the question, if I understood it. So if you look at our capabilities, very, very much focused on active investing and whether it be -- it went from alternatives through our historical capabilities, whether it be equity or fixed income and broadening of the alternatives capabilities more broadly around the world as we talked about. Where we then see an opportunity for ourselves is the strength that we have with our quantitative teams and with PowerShares around what people are referring to smart beta and variations of that. And we think the combination of that range is very, very strong and competitive globally, but also within retail channels as you're speaking off. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. So on the defined-benefit side, you feel that you can be a net winner over the next 2 to 3 years versus some other more plain active equity managers that are losing share to rebalancing? Martin L. Flanagan: No question. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. Okay, great. And maybe just one quick one on the U.K. and it has already beating a dead horse in this, but I think just using -- looking at the math of the U.K. equity income product, looks like you had $3.3 billion in outflows in the quarter. Just trying to get a sense of that trajectory over April, May and June and whether that sounds like it's improving that outflow pace into July. Loren M. Starr: Yes, so Brian, I think that's one that we probably are going to be somewhat better than the pace, we would hope. Again, it's not getting worse. We think it's one that's going to continue to improve through the course of the year. But again, it's a little hard to say with great certainty because there are these smaller types of platform that may make decisions along the way and those can be $0.5 billion here or $0.25 billion there. But overall, I think what you're saying is sort of that level and improving through the course of the year and then probably, by the end of the year, we'll have much better clarity in terms of just say all that will be more solid in terms of whether people are coming or going or leaving. Operator : The next question is from Greggory Warren, Morningstar. Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Just on the Perpetual sort of a housekeeping note. There were no non-compete agreements that we need to worry about where 6 months or a year from the road now that he'll go out and start poaching more of our clients. Is that an issue for you? Loren M. Starr: Yes. So Gregg, I think what we're used to fighting on the retail battlefield whatever and so in terms of loss of clients and we compete with them, and gee, we compete with many others. So there's nothing that will prevent anybody or Neil's fund to take clients from us if they win them fair and square. And so I think it is one where we think that we're well positioned to compete. And we have significant marketing dollars and we have significant sales force strength and obviously a fantastic investment team that is sort of tried and true. So we think that will win and we don't necessarily have to worry about structural sort of legal non-competes or anything like that. Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Okay, okay so basically, it's kind of fair game right now then. Loren M. Starr: Fair game, yes. Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Okay. And the other question I had is it looks like your net revenue yield before performance fees came down -- or came up actually pretty considerably quarter-over-quarter. Was part of that the shift in institutional -- the outflows in the institutional side? It doesn't really seem, I mean -- equity AUM seems to be about the same level as it was in the first quarter. I'm just kind of curious what caused that shift in the net revenue yield. Loren M. Starr: Yes, about 0.6 basis point is just due to day count, so that's a normal second quarter to first quarter impact. But we definitely have mixed benefits that is still driving forward. It has more to do with geography than it does sort of what type of asset class as we continue to flow strongly with growth sales -- record sales outside the U.S., which is where the fee rates tend to be higher that is helping to drive our mix and our yields to higher levels. Operator : The next question is from Brennan Hawken, UBS. Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : All my questions have been -- has, I think, been asked at this point. Operator : The next question is from Robert Lee, KBW. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : And also if you may have touched on this earlier, but I have been kind of jumping around different earnings this morning. The only question I have was in, I guess, it relates to PowerShares. I mean, some of your competitors and whatnot out there have an ETF business, have been, I guess, fairly loud or noisy, however you want to describe it, about why they would not do or don't think things like bank loans are appropriate for an ETF structure and I know that's been a pretty successful product for you in PowerShares. So I don't know, to what extent do you see that as you're comfortable with some of the concerns that they raised? Or how do you view those -- how would, how should we put those comments in the context? Martin L. Flanagan: Thanks for the question. So look, you would know and just for everybody else, we have a very, very strong bank loan team. We manage $30 billion in assets more or less. They've been doing it for decades. We've actually have had an open-ended bank loan funds since the '90s. It is something we are -- feel very comfortable managing. I think it is something that we're not concerned about. And also when you look at the liquidity within the ETF up to 20% of it is in sort of very liquid assets, which would probably meet anybody's idea of redemption. On top of that, there is a line of credit if there is something beyond that. So the idea that this is much different than other open-ended funds, I think, whether it be bank loans or high yield or you could go to small-cap stocks, I mean it is just part of what comes with managing various funds, and if you look at the sheer size of the markets and the redemptions that was less than 1% of the redemptions that you saw in the bank loan market during the period where there were some redemptions of bank loans. So again, I don't see it much different than how we manage our business on a daily basis. Operator : And sir with that, I'm showing no further questions. Martin L. Flanagan: Great. Well, thank you very much for joining us, everybody. I appreciate the engagement and the questions, and we'll speak to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you, and this does conclude today's conference. All parties may disconnect at this time.",

Operator : Welcome to Invesco's third quarter results conference call. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I'd like to turn the call over to the speaker for today, Mr. Martin L. Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; and Mr. Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin. Martin L. Flanagan: Thanks very much, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me is Loren Starr, Invesco's CFO, and we'll be speaking the presentation that's available on our website, if you're so inclined to follow. Today, we'll provide a review of our business results for the third quarter. Loren will go into greater detail of the financial results, and then the 2 of us will open up to Q&A. So let's begin by highlighting the firm's operating results for the third quarter, which you'll find on Slide 3 of the presentation. Long-term investment performance remained strong across all time periods during the quarter. 81% of actively managed assets were ahead of peers on a 3- to 5-year basis. Strong investment performance, combined with a comprehensive range of strategies and solutions we offer to help clients achieve their desired investment outcomes, contributed to net long-term inflows of $6 billion during the quarter. Adjusted operating income was up 16.4% for [ph] the same quarter last year. And a continued focus on taking a disciplined approach to our business improved our operating margins to 41.8% from 40.2% in the same quarter a year ago, an increase of 1.6 percentage points. Assets under management were $789.6 billion, down from $802.4 billion at the end of June, reflecting the late quarter volatility in the markets. At the same time, operating income rose to $382 million from $377 million in the prior quarter. Earnings per share were $0.64 versus $0.65 in the prior quarter. The quarterly dividend remained at $0.25 per share, up 11% from 2013. And we've repurchased $50 million in common stocks during the quarter. Before Loren goes through the details of the financials, let me take a moment to review the investment performance and highlights of the business around the world. I'm now on Slide 6. Investment performance during the quarter was strong for all time periods. 81% of assets were ahead of peers on a 3- and 5-year basis and 76% of assets were ahead of peers over 1 year. It's also important to note that 52% of the assets were in the top third of peers on a 3-year basis, and 65% of assets were in the top third over 5 years. On Page 7, to put this in historical context. I mentioned that investment performance is very strong today. Currently, the percentage of assets under management rated 4 and 5 stars by Morningstar runs 70% for our U.S. retail franchise, 96% for our retail funds in the U.K. and 82% for our cross-border range. And importantly, in the U.S., 97% of all the assets are rated 3 stars or better; in the U.K., 100% of the assets are rated 3 stars or better; and the cross-border range, 94% of the assets are 3 stars or better. Our tremendous focus on achieving investment excellence across the globe has produced consistently good long-term performance. And if you look back a decade, you've seen some dramatic improvements in some of the regions around the world. Turning to flows on Page 8. You'll see gross flows remained strong during the quarter and overall redemptions declined, leading to net long-term inflows of $6 billion. I want to point out this is also the strongest active organic growth rate we've seen since the first quarter of 2013. And these numbers reflect broad diversity of flows across our global business during the quarter, particularly among our active strategies. Gross flows on retail and institutional channels were strong during the third quarter as we continue to deliver strong investment performance to our clients. The redemption picture improved significantly in the retail channel and, combined with strong gross flows, drove net long-term flows substantially higher. The institutional channel continued -- saw continued demand for real estate, bank loans, equities and asset allocation capabilities across the globe, which drove positive flows during the quarter. Institutional redemptions were driven partly by the successful disposition or the realizations within private equity or real estate. And the institutional pipeline of won but not funded mandate continues to looks strong and, as importantly, is concentrated in real estate asset allocation, international equities and alternative fixed income capabilities. So very broad there, also. Let me take a moment to highlight our global businesses, which you'll find beginning on Slide 10. In the Americas, U.S. net flows were $1.3 billion during the quarter, were driven by international growth, U.S. value equities, high-yield munis, diversified dividend and UITs. The redemption rate of 20.6% in August was favorable to the industry average of 28.6%. U.S. gross flows were up 9% from the prior quarter. And we are working very diligently, as you would imagine, to build the awareness in self -- shelf space for our liquid alternative capabilities, which are gaining traction amongst advisers and platforms. As we've mentioned on previous calls, institutional flows into IBRA have remained positive, driven by top quartile performance. And on the retail side, strong client engagement effort and the current market volatility are driving improved gross flows and a reduction in redemptions. With the strong institutional flows and improvement in the retail picture, we believe we'll see a positive -- we'll return to positive total net flows in the U.S. in the next 2 quarters. In Asia Pacific, we saw continued strong growth in net flows during the quarter. Key drivers of the strong results include the Shinko U.S. REIT and the Australian bond fund in Japan, cross-border funds in Greater China and institutional flows into real estate, Asian equity and Invesco quantitative strategies across the region. Investment performance across EMEA remained strong during the quarter and, in some cases, exceptional performance as we discussed earlier. Mark Barnett and his team continued to turn in strong numbers for the high income and income funds, which ranked amongst the top 10 in their peer group of 262 funds year-to-date. As a result, outflows from the U.K. income are steadily returning to normal redemption rates, with $1.9 billion of net withdrawals during the quarter. Our GTR fund also continued to see strong flows on the back of strong investment performance, crossing the $1 billion mark early in the quarter and reaching $1.2 billion by the end of the quarter. Strong investment performance and continued focus on meeting client needs contributed to the strong EMEA long-term net flows, which were $3.3 billion for the quarter. Assets under management by our EMEA business totaled $170 billion at end of the third quarter. And as you can see on 12 -- Slide 12, during the quarter, net flows into EMEA, excluding U.K. equity income, were $5.3 billion. Driven by strong investment performance, our wider U.K. retail business has continued to demonstrate strength with an increase in gross flows year-over-year. The business has strong momentum and continues to become more diversified with increased flows into global equities, European equities and multi-assets, to highlight a few. Our retail clients and advisers in the region remain optimistic regarding the recent market volatility. Activity of gross flows and redemptions declined for a couple of weeks, but we've seen no particular impact on the net flows. In general, what we've seen over the past few weeks of market volatility confirms our long-term business strategy. Invesco is one of the few investment management firms in the world that offers institutions and individual investors a comprehensive range of strategies and solutions that help them achieve their desired outcomes. We provide capabilities for all markets : bull markets, bear markets and markets that go sideways. And we're well positioned to deliver for our clients competitively, regardless of which markets we see in the fourth quarter and beyond. It's also a time where a number of our investment teams look for periods of market volatility, which creates valuation anomalies and opportunities, which they exploit for the benefit of our clients. Historically, it's these periods of increased market volatility that clients seek the established capabilities of our experienced investment teams. So with that, I'll stop here and turn it over to Loren. Loren M. Starr: Thanks very much, Marty. Quarter-over-quarter, our total AUM decreased $12.8 million ( sic ) [$12.8 billion] or 1.6%, and that was driven by negative FX in market of $14.8 billion, outflows from money market and the QQQs of $4 billion. These items were partially offset by positive long-term net flows of $6 billion. Our average AUM for the quarter was $801.7 billion. That's up 1.5% versus the second quarter average. Our net revenue yield came in at 45.6 basis points, flat versus Q2. The benefit of an extra day in Q3 and higher performance fees was unfortunately equally offset by the decline in other revenues and the weakening of sterling versus the U.S. dollar. Now I'm going to turn to the operating results. You'll see that our net revenues increased $12.7 million or 1.4% quarter-over-quarter to $913.7 million. That included a negative FX rate impact of $9.1 million. Within the net revenue number, you'll see that investment management fees grew by $16.5 million or 1.6% to $1.07 billion. This increase was due to higher average AUM and the additional day in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. FX decreased investment management fees by $11.5 million. Service and distribution revenues were up by $7.4 million or 3.4%, also in line with higher average AUM and the extra day as well as the continued strength in our cross-border products sold in Europe. FX decreased service and distribution revenues by $0.1 million. Performance fees came in at $10.3 million, an increase of $3 million from Q2. This is about $5 million more than we had expected based on the guidance we provided in Q2. Performance fees were earned from a variety of areas, including the U.K., bank loans and quant equity. Foreign exchange decreased performance fees by $0.2 million. And as I said in the past, performance fees continue to be one of the more difficult line items for us to predict with great accuracy. Other revenues in the third quarter came in at $34.5 million, a decrease of $4.4 million, resulting from the lower level of real estate transactions fees. As you'll remember, we generated $6 million in nonrecurring transaction fees in Q2 as a result of our Japanese REIT launch. Third-party distribution, service and advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues, increased by $9.8 million or 2.4%. This was in line with higher revenues derived from our related retail AUM and one extra day in the quarter. FX decreased these expenses by $0.2 million. Moving on down the slide. You'll see that adjusted operating expenses at $531.8 million grew by $7.8 million or 1.5% relative to the second quarter. FX decreased operating expenses by $4.8 million during the quarter. Employee compensation at $349.5 million increased by $4.9 million or 1.4%, and this was a result of increased headcount and variable compensation quarter-over-quarter. FX decreased compensation by $3.2 million. Marketing expense decreased by $3.5 million or 11.3% to $27.4 million. Advertising costs came in a little lower than we expected in the quarter. FX decreased these expenses by $0.3 million. Property, office and technology expense came in at $77.3 million in the quarter, which was up $1.2 million. This was about $3 million lighter than we had previously guided. The increase reflects the higher outsourced administration costs in EMEA. And FX decreased these expenses by $0.6 million. G&A expenses came in at $77.6 million. That's up $5.2 million or 7.2%. This increase was due to professional service fees, driven by ongoing technology platform investments as well as an increase in indirect taxes. About $2 million of the increase should not recur in Q4. And FX decreased G&A by $0.7 million. Going on further down the slide. You'll see that nonoperating income decreased $10.5 million compared to the second quarter. The decrease is primarily driven by low or -- excuse me, lower realized gains on seed capital investments in Q3 and the liquidation of a CLO that occurred in Q2. The firm's effective tax rate on a pretax adjusted net income basis in Q3 was 26.6%. Looking forward, we'd expect the effective tax rate to remain between 26% to 27%, which then brings us to our adjusted EPS of $0.64 and our adjusted net operating margin of 41.8%. Now before turning things over back to Marty, I'd like to just touch on the impact of the market and FX volatility on our earnings outlook. In periods of uncertainty such as this, which we have seen before, we will try to manage our level of spend as best as we can without sacrificing strategically important investments. However, we simply can't adjust expenses down as quickly as revenues in a declining market. We expect to remain focused on prioritizing our most important initiatives, and we will diligently manage our discretionary expense in this quarter. Given that the markets have made our AUM a bit of a moving target, we don't believe it's very productive to provide explicit line item guidance in Q4, understanding, however, that we are committed to doing what we can without compromising our most important strategic opportunities. And so with that, I'll turn things back to Marty. Martin L. Flanagan: Thanks, Loren. So happy to open up to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Michael Carrier, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Loren, maybe first question. Just on the expense that you were -- you were just going over. When we think about the areas that you do have some flexibility, so whether it's on the marketing side or the G&A, just maybe just remind us -- or when you think about how much variability you do have if the environment does get -- and not talking about the fourth quarter but just meaning over the next year or so, if you get into a tougher environment, how much can you pull back versus what you would view as like longer-term view investments? Loren M. Starr: Certainly, Michael. I mean, we have -- some of our expenses are somewhat fixed in nature, whether it's amortized, deferred compensation or related to rent. We clearly can move on some of those items over time. I think in terms of near-term ability, it's going to be around the discretionary expenses. Marketing is also a lever that we can and will look at depending on the environment that we're in, where strong levels of advertising may not make as much sense in markets that are somewhat negative. So certainly, that level of $35 million, which I think we had originally guided in Q4, may be somewhat lower if we're successful in Q4. But ultimately, we have more opportunity to affect 2015 than we do the fourth quarter because a lot of the spend is effectively committed within the quarter. So it is really to that point that we -- we'll certainly do what we can within the quarter to manage, but some of it is going to be locked in. Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. That's helpful. And then Marty, just on the flow picture, I mean, when we look at kind of the industry trends right now, things are pretty muted. You guys have put up results and -- whether it's on the European side, which is across asset class things have continued to do relatively well. So where are you seeing some of that demand? And particularly, maybe into September, October because obviously, things got a little bit more rocky in the environment. But it seems like the strength continued, particularly relative to the industry. So just any insight, and that could be on the retail side or in the institutional. Martin L. Flanagan: Yes. It's a good question. And what I would say, it's, really, too early to tell if it's -- definitely what's going to -- what are going to be the reactions. I think we're probably in a transitional period right now where whether it's institutional or retail investors are assessing, and I think their first move, which we all saw in the early -- let's say, their public numbers coming out, retail was -- you saw outflows. And the first move is to do nothing, right? And I think that's really what you saw a number of people do in the United States in particular. But people assess -- get some sense of looking forward and have some judgment. What -- from our point of view, what we think is ultimately is a good thing for our clients and an opportunity for the firm is that volatility is a part of markets. And having things like alternatives in your portfolio, liquid alternatives in particular, is something that is going to, I think, is going to be here for a long, long time. And we're seeing it just with IBRA right here. IBRA has been -- institutions have continued to commit to IBRA but you're seeing, really, with these volatile markets, opportunities for IBRA that GTR funds for us. So we think it's really the broadening of the asset classes that will be the opportunity as we look forward. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Kim, Sandler O'Neill. Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : First, maybe a bit of a more bigger-picture question. I know it's not a -- necessarily a big piece of your overall asset base, but just wondering how your bond funds here in the U.S. in particular might be positioned assuming we see some sort of dislocation in the credit markets. Just curious to get your take on liquidity concerns across the industry and how you think about your funds assuming a potential downturn. Martin L. Flanagan: So let me start at the highest level. So if you look at the performance across our Fixed Income platform is very, very strong, and -- which is a good place to start. I -- with regard to what people do, and I think what you're suggesting is that people started to move from -- redeem from Fixed Income capabilities, what's the liquidity impact. And it is a topic everybody is focused on. From our point of view, we feel like we're positioned very, very well. I mean, it's something that we look at. I mean, obviously, our portfolio managers deal with it every day and have done that for a very long period of time. And in those products where we think that liquidity could be more challenged, there is a greater cash capability -- greater cash levels in those funds. There's also liquidity elements that they have layered on top of it. So we think we're positioned very, very well for it. So we're aware of the topic but we think we're managing very well and don't have a very large concern about it. Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : Okay. And then maybe if you could talk a bit more about product development these days, particularly as it relates to more solutions-oriented strategies and other products that might match up with some of the prevailing demand trends that you just mentioned earlier. Martin L. Flanagan: So look, I think we could be better positioned right now. So if you look at the range of capabilities that we have, from the one at smart beta, we think smart beta is continuing to be an important part of portfolios that are put together, and then as you look at the active range of capabilities we have from the traditional loan only to maybe more traditional alternatives, let's say, private equity and real estate, it's really the suite of liquid alternatives that we introduced very broadly last year that put us in a very unique position. So we think the combination of our active strategies all the way through alternatives and smart beta, there's very little that we can't address in meeting clients' needs. And also, with our solutions group that -- with the larger institutions, you can have that broader range of conversations to understand what are they trying to achieve and what are the different combinations of investment capabilities that you could put together to meet those needs. So we really think we're positioned very well. In one level though, to be clear, I do think we're, frankly, ahead of the market at the retail market with the range of alternative capabilities that we've had. People are very focused on it. But quite frankly, the uptake on the distribution platforms is probably slower than we would have thought. And it's just them getting their hands around their internal -- things that they need to work through. But we think it's a very important opportunity for us and for our clients. Operator : The next question is from Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : I guess, Loren, understanding that the market volatility and that you're -- it's difficult to forecast next quarter out. But just wanted to talk about the fee rate and kind of the products that are selling and where you're seeing the flows if we can still see that fee rate grind higher x currency, x market based on just kind of the gross sales, gross redemption trends you're seeing, and then that corresponding impact obviously flowing through to -- through margins. Loren M. Starr: Yes. Thanks for asking the question, Dan. Absolutely. We've been -- sort of had a headwind with FX working against us. I think it -- if it stabilizes and we sort of enter a period where we don't have that particular impact, we should continue to see our fee rate climb from where it is today as the flows that you've seen continue to be quite strong through the cross-border product line, which, as you know, tend to have a higher fee rate. Certainly, some of these alternative products, as they take and get more traction, have a higher fee rate. So we do feel that the trend is still very much in our favor, to see fee rates climb going forward, absent any further continued strengthening of the dollar versus other currencies. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Great. And then Marty, when you talk about asset allocation and the demand there, can you specifically talk about, is that including IBRA? Or is that just -- are those -- is that just separate products? And then can you talk about kind of where that demand is coming from, from the end clients? Martin L. Flanagan: Yes, good question. So these definitional problems. So we would include IBRA in that. We'd include things like global total return capabilities. There's -- our versions of IBRA there. So it is really that suite that we have brought to market. So where we are seeing demand -- so if you start with GTR, that was probably the next introduction after IBRA, and it's really only been in the market from a year ago, September. In the U.K., it's over $1.2 billion. That's pretty good for a very short uptake. The interest that we're seeing institutionally and also, frankly, in the retail market in the U.S., GTR is really very, very strong. And the same thing on the continent. It's trailing the U.K. just because that was our initial launch. So we think that's probably going to be another natural one. But again, it's really, what you're seeing now with the advisers on the retail side is they are looking to build broader portfolios. And they're interested in having lower-volatility type elements within there. And Bill ( sic ) was asking a question earlier that it is also looked at as an alternative to some of the fixed income, from a stability point of view, within the portfolios. Institutionally, again, it just continues to be areas that some number of the institutions are looking to expand. So it's early days for us, but again, the depth of our capability and the performance out of the box has been very strong. Now it's a long-term game, but it's always nice to start with your performance. Operator : The next question is from Ken Worthington, JPMorgan. Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : On real estate. Real estate continues to be on fire for Invesco. It is cyclical based on the way you talked about your sales and when you get transaction and performance fees. We seem to be in the strong sales portion of the investor real estate cycle. So are we getting late in that part of the cycle? And is the next step elevated performance fees, given you're a mix of kind of U.S. core and international? Loren M. Starr: Ken, I'll try to answer that question. I think we saw, and we have seen, a lot of good transaction fees coming through the funds being able to sell their holdings at a good price. So that's been helpful even though that's been somewhat of an outflow when every time something gets old. We're seeing the pipeline, as Marty mentioned, the institutional pipeline is now really beginning to climb again. And so I think we are entering a sales cycle where that pipeline is going to begin to fill up with more won but not yet funded type of activity, which, again, don't translate into assets until those things start funding. So I think we're very much into a building-up AUM as we sort of start into a buying phase as opposed to a selling phase. So that is going to continue to progress. I think with the realizations that I mentioned, yes, absolutely. The idea that we're going to begin to be able to realize performance fees in the real estate area is something that, I think, we've talked about in the past. And then we certainly have expectations that we're going to see some of that roll through, specifically around the timing, as I mentioned. It's a little problematic for us to figure out exactly what quarter they -- are they going to occur, but we know that they are -- have done a great job in terms of performance. And so there is a lot of built up performance fees in the real estate pools. Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : And then, can you talk a little bit about the investing environment in Europe and the U.K. given kind of changes in the economic outlook for both? You had a really strong third quarter. The outlook in those regions seems to have weakened economically. What does this mean for Invesco in terms of sales and investor appetite? And are you in the right distribution channels with the right products to kind of weather any change, a persistent change in environment if the current choppy market conditions continue? Martin L. Flanagan: So Ken, let me pick it up and start maybe on the continent. So we -- kind of Europe's been a topic. We started the conversation maybe 3 to 4 years ago of the opportunity there, and it's starting to become realized over the last 1.5 years. We still believe we're relatively early stages of success on the continent. So with all the progress we've made, there is more progress to be made. And it's really -- we're not on all the platforms that we want to be on. We are getting on more and more of them. We have good reason to believe that we'll continue to expand the breadth of platforms. As I pointed out, the performance in that cross-border range is very, very strong and it's very broad. So it's very attractive to distribution platforms. And just our ability to help our distribution partners be successful is also in place, too. So I look at it as a continuing growing opportunity for us. With regard to what might happen with investor appetite, I think, if you ask me some -- a couple of years ago when we thought that EU was -- discussions of it breaking up, I would never have thought we would have seen the client demand for investment products as we saw. So it's really been a surprise and continues to be -- they look to funds as the way to invest and save. And they feel that's a really solid and thoughtful way to look after themselves, which, frankly, we think it is, too. So -- and again, I come back to the range of capabilities, too, as demand moves, we do think we have the capabilities to give clients the alternatives. If they want to get out of European equities, they can look at things like GTR, they can look at things like IBRA. The fixed income capability is very, very strong. In fact, it's -- flows there. So we think we're really well placed. And just in the U.K., again, it's -- we're an absolute top firm there, and the performance just continues to be just very, very strong. And so we're -- we're everywhere we need to be in the U.K. and we're well positioned there. So we look at it as continued strength in the U.K. and growing opportunities on the continent. Loren M. Starr: And maybe, Ken, I'll just pile on a little bit. I mean, that -- we saw in EMEA generally, still good, strong flows in the quarter as you can see through our roll-forwards, a lot of products contributing. The full range, actually: balanced product; equity product; Pan European equity was also strong, even though maybe others in the industry didn't see quite as much strength, we continued to see strength there; real estate; fixed income, corporate bond; euro corporate bond, all doing well. And through -- even the October, that cross-border in EMEA is in strong, good positive flows. So we think that, that is a continued opportunity for us that may slow down a little bit relative to what we've seen in the past just as people are trying to figure out what to do given the market environment. But we have such a great range of products at such high performance levels that we think we're going to be able to continue to sell through all types of -- whatever the market throws at us. So I think we're going to probably still do pretty well there. Operator : The next question is from Bill Katz from Citigroup. William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : First big-picture question. You seem to have a lot of momentum across products and geographies and distribution channels. It may be too pointed of a question. But I'm sort of curious, is there something structurally going on that you're starting to see the unit growth coming in terms of net flows? Is it market share gains? You mentioned, Marty, that there may be some more distribution channels. But why -- I know it's been a 5-year in the making, but specifically, what seems to be the linchpin now that's really inflecting the flows? Martin L. Flanagan: Where in particular, Bill? William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Well, I think Europe and Asia in particular seem to be quite strong, looking at your data. Martin L. Flanagan: Yes. No, it's -- I think you're really hitting it on the real point. There's no one thing. It really has been, yes, a number of years in the making. And it is a combination of, again, the range of capabilities are attractive, the performance is consistently strong along with the business support that we can help our institutional clients be more successful or our distribution partners on the retail side. So I wish I could tell you what the one thing is, but it's just many things. And -- but to be more specific, what does it mean? If you look at all of our institutional ratings, they are -- there are many and they're strong. If you look at the number of platforms we're on around the world, they're -- they continue to grow. Now the U.K. has always been strong, right? So the -- it's really the continent and other parts of Asia joining, really, the U.S., which we've been talking about for a number of years. And so it's really the U.S., Continental Europe and Asia just continuing to strengthen. William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. The same question, just a little more technical. So still curious. In the U.K. and now Europe, there's 2 dynamics underway. Some are underway, some are still to come between sort of the shift of RDR as well as on the MiFID II, some consternation about how to sort of treat equity research. How do you think that might impact your business? Because some of your peers, the stock price have come in a fair amount. I think investors have been worried about that. And given you're a pretty big player in the U.K., just trying to sort of see what the economic impact might be to you on a go-forward basis. Martin L. Flanagan: Yes. So with regard to RDR, I mean, it's still early days. But I think what we had said is we were matching what RDR would be in practice. We would say, we're -- we thought we'd be well placed and we are. And it's really again, it's the recognition of the organization and just the depth of capabilities. And so we're doing just fine within the RDR world. Now is it meeting the expectations of the policymakers? That's probably a different topic. I don't believe that the costs have gone down for the end of investors. And actually good point, too, it's probably going up. So I don't think that was part of the plan. So with regard to the topic -- with regard to research, I know everybody's very focused on it. And I think, the conversations that I'm aware of and that -- the undertakings is that, there is now quite a thought of do no harm to the capital markets, right? The unintended consequences of trying to take pieces and modify them, I think, have become front of mind of the regulators. And I think where you'll probably end up is much more in greater disclosure and -- for the end investors. And again, we'll see. It's going to take some time. But I think that's probably where we'll probably end up. Operator : The next question is from Brennan Hawken, UBS. Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : On -- you gave a lot of color on EMEA and the flows, and thanks for that. That's really helpful. I was just kind of curious, if we think about the U.K. and then potential retail flows with Perpetual, is there any kind of seasonality we should think about for retail flows that might be a consideration going forward? Loren M. Starr: I think there may be some degree of seasonality that tacks onto it. But I think that is largely a very modest impact. And probably the biggest thing that we can see, and we're seeing it every month, is this normalization that is happening around our redemption rate, and how, as things are getting back to normal and really, in the U.K., the client reaction to that transition is almost old news now. And so we're -- I think that's probably the bigger impact, is that we're turning into more of a business-as-usual situation in the U.K., which will be quite helpful for us in terms of continuing to turning those outflows into inflows. Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Terrific. And then, apologies if you hit on this before, but given some of the volatilities in yields in October, have you seen any change in the IBRA flows quarter-to-date? Loren M. Starr: We're seeing a much stronger interest in IBRA. So the redemption rate is certainly dramatically down. I think the level of interest around IBRA, both institutionally and retail, is sort of seeing new levels. So it is somewhat at an inflection point where you'd say, if you just follow this through into next couple of quarters, that it would be going quite positive. But again, just drawing a line here. But it has been very month -- every month, you're seeing significant improvement in the IBRA position, and that's not a surprise to us. As people are looking for greater stability and predictability around -- and less risk in their portfolios, it's a natural place for people to go. Operator : The next question we have is from Chris Harris from Wells Fargo. Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : So we've spent some time talking about EMEA. Wanted to talk a little bit about the U.S. part of your business. It sounds like the outlook is getting a little bit better there. I'm just kind of curious if you guys could characterize for us why that region maybe isn't flowing a little bit better than it is. I know you guys rank pretty favorably to a lot of peers, but just wondering if you could expand on what's going on in the U.S., why we're not seeing a little bit better growth. Loren M. Starr: So I think that we're seeing strong pockets of growth. Obviously, the U.S. is a big -- it's a big thing when you look at it, particularly the way that we disclose it to you. And so it does hide the real stories within stories that exist. What we've seen in terms of the greater strength in the U.S. in North America, real estate, direct real estate. We've certainly seen continued strength in the Invesco PowerShares offerings as -- and we have quite a wide range there. We have great capabilities around alternative Fixed Income, particularly around bank loans and CLOs. And then fundamental equity, international growth in values is quite strong. I mean, so these have been somewhat offset recently in terms of numbers where we've seen some outflows in certain products that I'm sure you're familiar with around, let's say, bank loans, where people have sort of knee-jerked out of those types of products, which again, sort of masked some of the underlying strength. Other areas where we had -- and have seen some outflow would be more based on when the equity markets were moving quite strongly. Some of our core, more sort of safety-oriented equity offerings were not performing in line. But they're going to become more interesting in this type of market. So I mean, that's a little bit of context. We have such a wide range and diverse set of products that for us to be at a sort of consistent high flow in the U.S. is hard for us to achieve because they're very diverse in what they offer. Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Yes, okay. That makes sense. And wondering if you guys can give us an update, not just for the U.S. but for the entire franchise, what flows look like so far on October. Loren M. Starr: So I say, to -- today, there, is modestly negative for us. Not anything that we'd get alarmed about, and progressively getting better. Each day that's sort of come by through recently has been a benefit to the flows. I already told you that we're seeing some of the most important, in terms of fee rate, parts still driving forward like EMEA. We have this very strong institutional pipeline that is -- I think it's up close to 70% higher than it was in the prior quarter. And on -- and some of that is going to begin to fund whether it's into the fourth quarter or into 2015. So again, we feel reasonably good about where we are in the flow picture. And I mean, we don't have the industry data yet, but I gather that we're probably doing as well, if not better. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Lee from KBW. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : I have a question on the liquid alt side. Maybe there's a few things in here. The -- I mean, as you roll that out, I mean, you've certainly seen in the industry pretty strong demand for retail and liquid alts products. But I think it's probably easy -- my perception is it's probably fairly easy for investors and advisers to be confused about what's the difference between these products, and some peers will probably put IBRA in their liquid alts stock -- and you have it in your balance. So what can you do or what are you doing to -- with may be in the retail world and with advisers to make sure that they understand what they are buying and how to compare. Because one of the things I think you always fear is that people buy something that they don't understand it, they ultimately get disappointed and that has negative consequences down the road. Martin L. Flanagan: Yes, you're on a very important topic. And so that was really what I was trying to highlight. It's actually -- it is going slower than the -- than what you might be reading in the papers, right? So what I would say is there's an absolute clear recognition that, for the retail investor, the ability to have access to alternative capabilities, as I look at it is more broadening the asset classes that they can invest in. And also, introducing some lower-volatility type offerings to them is viewed as important and necessary. We have spent an enormous effort on education just -- before they even came to the market. Internally, then with our distribution partners sort of tied hand in glove on how they're positioned, what they're meant to do, what you should expect in different markets, how it modifies your portfolio and that you're achieving what you want to achieve. So we even have sort of an internal consulting group that spends time with the distribution channel to help the -- all the advisers be successful with it. So we think education is a really, really important part. And that's why what I've been saying, it is an important opportunity but it's not a 2-, 3-quarter opportunity. It's going to be looking back for 3 years and see where it is in total. And also, and I say rightfully, the advisers or distribution partners, they are slow in putting capabilities on platforms because they want to get it right, too. And I think that's really important. That's good for everybody. You've got to get it right for the clients first. So I'd say it's progressing in a thoughtful manner. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : Great. And maybe to follow up, you've clearly had -- have good flow momentum in a variety of places across your -- across the firm. And I'm going to guess you probably don't look at things in this manner, but I guess I'll ask it anyway. If you look at the breadth of your franchise and geographically, product-wise and size and -- how -- what do you think is kind of a natural or organic growth rate for your firm? Do you think it's in the 3%, 5%? Do you think at peak it could be better than that? How -- do you have any thoughts on that? Martin L. Flanagan: Yes, it's a good question. You're asking the unknowable. But yes. what I think is, if you look at the firm right now, if you look at -- again, depth of capabilities and performance, what we think we should be able to accomplish, there's really no reason that we shouldn't be over -- whatever a reasonable time frame, 3% to 5% organic growth rate. Are there periods that you can be on top of that? I believe that is the case. We have yet to see that sort of all-in, risk-on investor mindset, and that is exactly -- that is where we are best positioned. So we have had these results without having it go straight to our strong suit. So that's a period that you would expect even greater organic growth. On the other side is, if we're all talking now, how are clients reacting? How are they thinking? If people slow down and just stop for a couple of quarters, you're going to have -- you're going to be below that. And so it's -- again, so there's a market sentiment topic [ph] to it, where the market is. But over a good period of time, I think there's no reason why we shouldn't be in that 3% to 5% organic growth bucket. Operator : The next question is from Craig Siegenthaler from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : So just a follow-up here on the U.K. equity income business. Do you believe Retail Distribution Review could have temporarily aided the U.K. equity income retail business over the last 12 months? But as more accounts convert to the new fee structure, because many brokers actually have been avoiding the transition, that U.K. retail equity income redemptions could actually pick up or remain elevated into next year? Martin L. Flanagan: Interesting question, here. We have no evidence of that, and so I -- it would just be total speculation. I mean, I think -- what I really think is -- the fact is that the reputation of Invesco Perpetual's very, very strong. Mark Barnett and his team have had a tremendous track record on their own for a good period of time. And factually, they have performed very, very well. And so that, in combination with our advisers, to be able to have a broader range of capabilities within the franchise, I think those are the vastly dominant factors of why we've got to where we've gotten to. But interesting question. I just can't -- really, it will be speculation on my part. Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Marty, and then just a quick follow-up. So we're heading to the fourth quarter here, we've had a few quarters of sort of lumpy redemptions from the equity income business in the U.K. Given kind of your visibility, are there any sort of larger losses, platform losses that maybe could occur in the fourth quarter? Or should the fourth quarter really be the first clean quarter without any significant redemptions from that business? Loren M. Starr: Okay, Craig, I'll answer that one. I think what we're seeing from the data factually is that it's getting less and less of a topic. And we have not certainly heard of any large -- not been notified. We had no expectations of anything to happen, which is great news. For us -- that doesn't mean that it can't or it won't. And there is always a year-end to kind of -- who knows, right? People may reevaluate their portfolios. So I don't want to sort of say we have 100% certainty on any of these redemptions. Because as soon as you think you do, you'll get surprised. But I'd say, in terms of our level of confidence and feeling that we're moving into a normalized period, I say, absolutely. And we certainly have no knowledge of any large or even small platform redemptions in our future. Operator : The next question is from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous. M. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research LLP : On the news this morning that you're ending the agreement with Deutsche Bank around the commodities PowerShares product. Will that meaningfully change your economics on that product? Martin L. Flanagan: Let me pick up the first part, and then Loren can pick up the second. So no, we're not ending our arrangement with Deutsche Bank. We're modifying it. I mean, it's been a very, very good partnership. And what we're really doing is just changing some of the responsibilities that's around. Now we'll be -- take complete responsibility for the product range including portfolio management, distribution operations. They will continue to be a very important partner in the underlying indexes and the like. And we'll continue to work together for a good number of years. Loren M. Starr: And then in terms of the financial impact, it really is not a material topic. We've not disclosed the nature of the relationship, but it is an ongoing relationship where we will continue to partner with Deutsche Bank as we sort of develop and continue to grow our product lines. But we have internalized, as Marty said, the management the -- of the product as opposed to being largely a distribution relationship that we had before. M. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research LLP : Okay. That's helpful. And then we talked a lot about RDR and the ebbs and flows of that in Europe and U.K. Could you talk a little bit about PowerShares specifically and assets specifically, and to what extent the process of that adoption is occurring because of the regulatory changes in Europe? Loren M. Starr: So Patrick, I'd say, the RDRs, as I think we've talked about in the past, it does somewhat open the opportunity for greater use and take-on by advisers of these type of products where, to the extent that they're going to be paid for advice directly by the end client, the use of such products become easier for them to use. And so we have said that for the U.K. and EMEA generally, it is a major focus of ours, one that we are very organized around trying to develop. And it's one that you probably -- realistically, you're not going to see true results or impacts for somewhere between 12, 18 months because it takes that long to really sort of make an impact. But we're very focused on it. We think it's a great opportunity for people who have ETF capabilities, which obviously, we do. And again, to be clear, our focus in this space is continued promotion of sort of the smart beta-alternative type of ETFs as opposed to the normal cap-weighted type of products that are very much in focus by Vanguard, BlackRock and others. Operator : The next question comes from Greggory Warren from Morningstar. Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Craig Siegenthaler touched on some of the questions I had about Neil Woodford and what was going on with equity income in the U.K. But I'm just kind of curious, as we look out and we look at the -- what they've done with the pension reforms in the U.K., the removal of the requirements for the annuities, how much do you feel that there's growth there to sort of replace what you lost with Woodford's departure? Martin L. Flanagan: Yes. I -- look, as we've been trying to point out, it's a very, very, very strong set of investment teams with superior investment performance. And whether it's across fixed income, broadly, GTR, European equities, Asian equities, European equities, it is probably, I'd say, some of the strongest capabilities in the United Kingdom, period. And so it's a very important part of our business, it will continue to be. And by the way, those capabilities are now being used more broadly throughout the world. European equities, Fixed Income, et cetera, they are a very important part of what's happening on the continent and also different parts of the world for some of the global capabilities and the like. So it's been a tremendous success and it's going to continue to be a tremendous success. And you're actually pointing out something important. This -- with this door opening up that -- investments beyond annuitization, that's a very good thing for us. Now again, that's not next quarter or the quarter after that, but if you look years ahead, it's really quite a good opportunity for us. Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Good, good. And then something we don't really talk about all that often, Canada. Can you guys give us a feel for what the market looks like now with kind of the challenges you're facing? I've noticed that ETF growth has been pretty explosive the last couple of years. The banks have gotten a lot more aggressive about going after mutual fund assets. So just kind of curious how you guys view your position within the Canadian market right now. Martin L. Flanagan: Yes. So I'd start again with performance. If you look at the performance of the teams there, really very, very strong. The success in the retail channel has improved quite dramatically, and it was a combination of things. One, again, getting performance to a very strong level, which it is and has been for a good period of time. You are pointing out, yes, the banks are very dominant. It's probably the one place in the world that they're so dominant with asset management within them. We have done vastly better than where we were a few years ago. So we -- and again, as you point out, it's the addition of ETFs for us and the like make us much more competitive and put us in, frankly, a -- we think we have competitive advantages in the marketplace. And the other opportunity for us that we're early days is the institutional market in Canada is very big, very important. And the capabilities that Canadians are looking for in the plans suit us very, very well when you start to look at the range of alternatives that we have. So it has been an important part of our business and we look at it to be a growing part of our business once again. Operator : The next question is from Marc Irizarry from Goldman Sachs. Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Marty, I'm curious on just the IBRA. And maybe just largely fixed income and just concerns about market structure changes on liquidity and maybe how your funds are responding to that, either in terms of disclosure or maybe just some views on what -- how you're thinking about more stress scenarios, maybe where liquidity conditions could change and given investors' responses to rates and what that might mean for a fixed income manager for you guys. Martin L. Flanagan: Yes. So again, I might be repeating myself a little bit. But if you look at the capabilities and what we do on a daily basis, we're always looking at liquidity. Liquidity management has always been an important part of what we do. The portfolios are stress tested on a very regular basis to get some sense of what is the range of possibilities under different scenarios. The portfolios are then positioned accordingly, if that is a concerns -- some portfolios literally have liquidity -- access to liquidity outside the portfolio. So again, it's something that we think we're absolutely on top of that we're doing very, very well. And by the way, I think the industry does it very, very well. And I think that's something for everybody to really understand. It's worth probing and pushing. But I really think that the industry's really focused on it, and they're really trying to do a very good job with it. Operator : Your next question is from Eric Berg from RBC. Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Marty, my question is going to be purposefully a general one. You've talked a lot in this call at various points about how the conversation between investors and their advisers here, meaning in the United States, has changed, given the extremely low level of interest rates, given the volatility in interest rates and given the major swings intraday in the stock market. It would be helpful to me if you were to sort of focus on the most important ways in which the conversations both here -- well, here have changed. I'd love to know what you would think are the most important ways the conversations have changed, and if you would provide the same answers for Europe. Contrasting how the conversations have changed there to here, I would -- it would be very helpful. Martin L. Flanagan: I think it's a good news development. I think for some of us that were around the TMT period where, if you remember, advice was dead, everything was going online, and there's no room for advisers. Needless to say, that didn't happen, and it's exactly gone the exact opposite way. There's something like 85% almost 90% of all individuals have some form of advice given to them. And I think it's also gotten much more sophisticated over the years and very focused on understanding clients' time horizons, risk tolerance, et cetera, et cetera. Things that we all collectively know quite well. And that they're building robust portfolios around that and using a range of capabilities if it was historically 60-40 equity, fixed income, loan only. The addition of being able to have greater access to a broader range of asset classes and also capabilities that are lower-volatility type capabilities and -- is really, I think, a very, very, very good development. I think it's gotten to, what you're pointing out, I think post-crisis, it's a little bit back to the future. Different names are being used. But people are looking for income. They are looking for capital preservation, et cetera. And I think that, again, is a very good thing, at end of the day, for shareholders. Europe, I would say, is behind that, but it is evolving quite a bit to that. To a degree I'd say, the advice channel in the States is probably as well-developed as anywhere in the world. Operator : The next question is from Chris Shutler from William Blair. Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : So on the topic of bank loans, just quickly, I wanted to ask a couple of questions. So first, I was just hoping you could give us the kind of the total assets that you have in bank loans, the rough split of retail versus institutional, and then how the flows have trended recently. And then in addition, the -- just interested in the credit rating. From a credit ratings perspective, just -- if you take the portfolio as a whole, how aggressive has your team been in kind of investing down -- further down the credit rating spectrum? Loren M. Starr: Chris, so we have about $30 billion, I think, in aggregate around the bank loan capability, both institutionally and retail. The retail bit is the smaller part of that, so I think we're probably somewhere around $7 billion in AUM on that and the rest is institutional. And the current flow picture is -- it's an interesting one. We're seeing continued interest in bank loans on the institutional side, very much so. The retail side, we saw modest outflows. I think it was about $0.5 billion in the quarter related to -- maybe a little bit more, $600 million, related in the retail side. So that's kind of the trends that we've seen, nothing alarming, nothing that is necessarily unexpected. And in terms of how the portfolios are being managed, I know they're being managed with a fair amount of conservatism because of the topics that Marty and everyone has obviously raised around liquidity and managing through stress periods. And so the idea that we are selecting securities that were -- that are most liquid, that are easy alternatives to straight bank loans or using affiliated types of products in those portfolios is very much top of mind. So again, I'd say, our level of sort of management around the conservative side is at a heightened level, as you would expect. Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Okay, great. And then a similar question just on real estate. Could you just give us a quick update where you are there in terms of AUM and how flows have trended over the last couple of quarters? Loren M. Starr: So AUM is roughly $62 billion. We've been trending higher consistently in every quarter, both again split between retail and institutional. We're seeing a lot of interest and demand on the retail side, particularly around the geographies that are most interested in income-oriented types of products, and that would be in Asia and Japan as well. Direct real estate is a global phenomenon that we're seeing in terms of interest and take-on. That really, as I said, sort of continues to pick up, as our capability is one of the few truly global capabilities among asset managers and also one that has done a very good job for its clients historically. Operator : And sir, I'm showing no further questions. Martin L. Flanagan: That's great. Thank you very much. And Loren -- on behalf of Loren and myself, thank you very much for participating and the questions, and look forward to talking to you next quarter. Have a good rest of the day. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference. All parties may disconnect.",

Operator : Welcome to Invesco's Fourth Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I'd like to turn the call over to the speakers for today, Mr. Martin L. Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; and Mr. Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin. Martin L. Flanagan: Thank you very much, and thank you, everybody, for joining us. Today, we'll kind of review the business results for the fourth quarter. We'll include some highlights for the full year, then Loren will go into greater detail on the financials and then we'll open up to Q&A has been our practice. So -- and if you're so inclined, the presentation's posted on the web. So let me begin by hitting the highlights of the operating results for the quarter, and if you are following, I'm on page slide right now -- that's Slide 3. Long-term investment performance remained very strong for the quarter, 81% of actively managed assets were ahead of peers over a 5-year period. Strong investment performance combined with the comprehensive range of strategies and solutions we offer helped clients achieve their desired outcomes and contributed net long-term inflows of $2.5 billion during the quarter. Adjusted operating income was up 7.5% compared to fourth quarter of the prior year, and a continued focus on the disciplined approach to our business drove improvement in our operating margin to 41.2% from 40.5% in the same quarter a year ago. Assets under management were $792 billion during the fourth quarter, up from $789 billion in the prior quarter. Operating income is $373 million versus $382 million in the prior quarter. And earnings per share were $0.63 versus $0.64 in the prior quarter. The quarterly dividend remained at $0.25 per share, and we returned $158 million to shareholders during the quarter. Now let me take a minute to look back over the achievements over the past year, which will provide some insights into our longer-term plans also. First and foremost, we remain very focused on delivering strong long-term investment performance to our clients, which continue to drive growth in the business. 77% and 81% of the assets were ahead of peers on a 3- and 5-year period, respectively, at the end of 2014. By delivering strong investment performance and focusing on client needs, we achieve further growth across our global business. Our U.S. business achieved net flows of $3.6 billion, excluding the Qs in 2014. IBRA flows are stabilizing with continued strong performance garnering attention among clients and advisers. We continue to gain strong shelf space support for our broad product range. We currently rank #3 among peers in the industry for the number of mutual fund placements on broker-dealer recommended lists. Our Canadian business continues to strengthen its retail presence, capturing greater share of the full-service broker channel. Institutionally, Invesco's direct real estate capability is fueling institutional asset growth in defined benefit segment. Our Asia Pacific business continue to grow. We saw strong inflows into our Japanese, Greater China, Asia and European equities as well as real estate strategies. Our EMEA business continue to grow and become more diversified with significant flows into fixed income, non-U.K. equities, real estate and multi-asset capabilities. In particular, we should note the U.K. retail business achieved record gross sales across a range of capabilities, and U.K. equity redemptions normalized in the fourth quarter, demonstrating the strength and resilience of our business. We continue to invest in capabilities where we see strong client demand or future opportunities, such as ETFs, multi-asset strategies, fixed income and alternatives. By extending the teams that we have or hiring talent where need be, also upgrading the technology platforms and launching new products and providing additional resources where necessary. The ability to leverage the capabilities developed by our investment teams to meet client demands across the globe is a significant differentiator for our firm, and will continue to bring the best of Invesco to different parts of our business where it makes sense for our clients. By delivering strong investment performance, Invesco Global Targeted Return achieved strong inflows in its initial Europe offering, with assets under management passing $3 billion at the end of 2014. GTR's strong performance positions us well heading into 2015, and we think this will continue to be a strong growth story. Additionally, I would highlight the other range of alternatives that we introduced a year ago have very strong 1-year performance. Based on our continued efforts to take a disciplined approach to running the business, the firm was upgraded to A/Stable and A2/Stable by both S&P and Moody's. We continue to make progress strengthening our operating margin to 41.4%, while returning nearly $700 million of capital to shareholders during the year. Before Loren goes into detail on the company's financials, let me take a moment to review the investment performance during the quarter. Turning to Slide 8. Our commitment to investment excellence and our work to build and maintain strong investment culture help us maintain a long-term investment performance across the enterprise during the quarter. Looking at the firm as a whole, 77% of assets were in the top half on a 3-year basis, and 81% were in the top half on a 5-year basis. Turning to flows, on Page 9 you'll see that passive flows outpaced active during the volatile quarter and again demonstrated the benefits of broadly diversified range of investment strategies. This is also coming off a very strong active organic growth rate we saw in the third quarter. We also saw renewed strength in the institutional flows during the quarter. The figures on Slide 10 reflect the broad diversity of flows we saw across the global business during the quarter, which included strength in real estate, fixed income, GTR, quantitative equities amongst others. The institutional pipeline of one but not funded mandate continues to look strong. We feel good about the quarter results and the full year. We're pleased with the progress we've made in delivering strong investment performance and meeting client needs with a range of strategies and solutions throughout 2014. We believe our achievements and the continuing efforts to deliver great outcomes for clients positions us well as we head into 2015. Now I'd like to turn it over to Loren to review the financials. Loren M. Starr: Thanks, Marty. Quarter-over-quarter, our total AUM increased $2.8 billion or 0.4%. This was driven by market gains of $10.5 billion and long-term net inflows of $2.5 billion. These gains were partially offset, however, by negative foreign exchange of $7 billion and outflows of the QQQs of $3.2 billion. Our average AUM for the quarter was $789.8 billion, that was down 1.5% versus the third quarter. Since our retail-related average AUM is calculated on a daily basis, the volatility in the equity markets during the quarter resulted in a lower average AUM while the period-end AUM was actually higher. Our net revenue yield came in at 45.9 basis points, which was up 0.3 basis points versus Q3. Let me decompose this a bit. The negative impact from FX on product mix as well as the market impact on equities during the quarter reduced our investment management fee yield by 1.1 basis points. And this was offset, however, by higher performance fees and lower third-party distribution, service and advisory expense, which added 1.4 basis points. Next, I'm going to turn to the operating results. Our net revenue yield decreased $7.9 million or 0.9% quarter-over-quarter, which -- to $905.8 million, that included a negative FX rate impact of $19.8 million. Within the net revenue number, you'll see that investment management fees declined by $38.1 million or 3.6% to $1.03 billion. This was a result of the lower level of average AUM in the quarter and the 1.1-basis-point drop in management fee yield that I discussed on the last slide. FX decreased investment management fees by $25.3 million. Service and distribution revenues declined by $4.4 million or 2%, also in line largely with lower average AUM. FX decreased service and distribution revenues by $0.3 million. Performance fees came in at $19 million, that was an increase of $8.7 million from Q3. Real estate accounted for roughly half of the quarter's performance fees, while the other half was driven by a variety of other investment capabilities, including bank loans, quant equity and global asset allocation. Foreign exchange decreased performance fees by $0.4 million. Other revenues in the third quarter came in at $34.1 million. That was a decrease of $0.4 million. FX decreased other revenues by $0.6 million. Third-party distribution, service and advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues, decreased by $26.3 million or 6.2%. This decrease was largely the result of lower average AUM and foreign exchange. FX decreased these expenses by $6.8 million. And given the impact on our AUM mix and management fee yields resulting from the continued strengthening of the dollar, we thought it would be useful at this point to provide you with some guidance on our net revenue yield for 2015. Based on current FX rates and AUM levels, we expect our full year 2015 net revenue yield, excluding performance fees, to be approximately 44.2 basis points or 0.6 basis points lower than last year. Moving on down the slide, you'll see that our adjusted operating expenses came in at $532.7 million, and that grew by $0.9 million or 0.2% relative to the third quarter. Our foreign exchange decreased operating expenses by $9.8 million during the quarter. Employee compensation at $347 million decreased by $2.5 million or 0.7%. The impact of headcount growth and higher incentive compensation related to performance fees were more than offset by foreign exchange. FX decreased compensation by $6.3 million. Looking ahead to 2015, seasonal payroll taxes and a 1-month impact from base salary increases will lift Q1 compensation by approximately $10 million. Compensation will then decline by approximately $5 million in Q2 and remain largely flat through the rest of the year. Note that all this guidance assumes flat assets from year end. Marketing expenses increased by $5.6 million or 20.4% to $33 million. This was driven by advertising expenses, particularly in EMEA. FX decreased these expenses by $0.9 million. We would expect that marketing expenses would average approximately $30 million per quarter in 2015. Property, office and technology expense came in at $75.6 million in the third quarter, which was down $1.7 million. FX decreased these expenses by $1.3 million. We'd expect property, office and technology expense to be approximately $80 million per quarter in 2015, the result of continued technology investment to support our fixed income and alternatives business as well as due to increased property-related costs. G&A expenses in the quarter came in at $77.1 million, that was down $0.5 million or 0.6%. FX decreased G&A by $1.3 million. Looking forward, we'd expect G&A to average approximately $75 million per quarter. Continuing on down the page, you'll see that nonoperating income decreased $6.3 million compared to the third quarter. The decrease was primarily caused by lower equity in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates. As you'll recall, this line item is the function of the co-investments we have made in our private equity and real estate partnerships, and these investment valuations are booked on a quarter lag. Given the quarterly lag and the somewhat negative markets we saw in Q4, we may see this line item decline from the Q4 levels in Q1 of 2015. The firm's effective tax rate on pretax adjusted net income in Q4 was 26.1%. Looking forward, in terms of guidance, we'd expect the effective tax rate remain between 25.5% and 26.5%. Which brings us to our adjusted EPS in the quarter of $0.63 and our adjusted net operating margin of 41.2%. So before finishing on the slide, I'd like to do a couple things. One, I'd like to take a moment to let you know that this month, we took some tactical steps to protect our P&L against further negative FX impacts in 2015. As you all know, a strengthening U.S. dollar has a negative impact on our fee rate and revenues. Invesco's most significant foreign exchange exposure is to the pound sterling. In fact, based on our calculations, a 10% decline in the pound from the current rate would result in an approximately $0.05 to $0.06 decline in annual EPS and an erosion of about 10 to 20 basis points of operating margin. So given this exposure, we entered into a series of out-of-the-money put option contracts, which will protect about 75% of our sterling pretax income, and this is at a strike of 1.493, and this will be in effect through the course of 2015. The premium cost of these options, of course, there is some money involved here, will reduce our full year 2015 EPS by approximately $0.05. Under U.S. GAAP accounting rules, these options will be mark-to-market below the line in other gains and losses. And we believe this hedge will help reduce the bottom line financial impact of any further significant strengthening of the dollar. And finally, before I turn things off to Marty, I know there's always a question about how things are going on flows. And I would say that we're off to a good start in net flows in January. We've seen about $2 billion, about half of that is in the passive category and the other half is in active. We continue to see Europe grow quite strongly. There's about an 18% organic growth rate, just based on January, again it's 1 month, so take that with a grain of salt, but we're continuing to see strong growth there. And our traditional PowerShares products are growing about 15%, which again, seems like a pretty good rate. Overall, based just again, just based on January, what we've seen about 3.5% overall organic growth rate on long-term AUM. So again, we are not quite done with the month. We may see -- actually see some more month-end institutional flows coming in. Marty mentioned we have a very strong pipeline, so where you could actually see that number improve from here. And so with that, now I'm going to turn it over to Marty. Martin L. Flanagan: So we'll open up to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Michael Kim from Sandler O'Neill. Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : First, just curious to get your take on some of the trends you're seeing across the institutional landscape in terms of potentially de-risking or moving into passive from an asset allocation standpoint, either here in the U.S. or outside of the U.S. And just related to that, are you still sort of seeing decision-making processes delayed just given sort of the environment? Martin L. Flanagan: A good question. So let me -- I've been traveling quite a bit, so I can -- just coming back from Asia. And quite frankly, the appetite still seems strong. The asset classes that institutionally people are looking at for us continues to be our alternatives, which GTR, IBRA, prosperity, real estate, the bank loans, but quite frankly, also Asian equities, European equities, Japanese equities, so really continue to be very broad. Also quantitative strategies are another area that is gaining quite a bit of interest, and on the comment, the same is happening. I can't speak to the timing specifically, but what we have seen traditionally is that when there's uncertainty, people do slow down in the funding, but we don't have that indication right now, but back to the point I made earlier -- and Loren, I mean, the institutional pipeline really is quite robust. So we don't -- we've not had indications that it's people going on hold yet and sort of de-risking. Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe for Loren, if you could just sort of give us an update on where you stand as it relates to excess cash beyond regulatory requirements; seeing capital needs and maybe your marketing some funds to potentially buy in the residual stake in Religare. Just trying to frame the share repurchase opportunity above sort of offsetting annual grants. Loren M. Starr: Sure, Michael. So at the end of the quarter, we had about $1.5 billion in cash versus about $1.35 billion last quarter. In our European subgroup, which is what we need to keep in terms of regulatory requirements, about $940 million of that is in that group. So we still need to hold a significant amount of cash in our European subgroup as you are well aware. I would say that phenomenon is here to stay and it's probably not going away anytime soon. In fact, generally, we think, just based on the regulatory environment, it's probably only going to get worse from here as opposed to better, so that's just a general sort of overarching comment. With that said, though, you should expect us to continue to follow the policies that we've been following. We want to build up some excess cash, about $1 billion over that subgroup level and it is something that -- is, again, self-imposed discipline that we're seeking to achieve. In terms of the seeding and the need for capital, those are elements that are still very much in sight for 2015. Given the number of opportunities that we have in the space of alternative products and alternative fixed income, which tend to use a fair amount of capital, real estate as well, we see an ongoing trend of some of our cash being dedicated to facilitate those flows and those products. In terms of the Religare opportunity to complete our ownership, that's an option that we have. We've certainly made no decision to do that at this point. But if we were ever to do it, it would be something probably in the order of magnitude of $150 million total cash needed. We would need to put $50 million just to have that ownership stake, it's required by India if you have more than 50% stake, you have to put in $50 million. So anyway, that's something that we can evaluate in the future. Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : Okay. That's helpful. And then just final question on sort of -- just a follow-up on hedging, sort of the pound exposure. Any change in thinking as it relates to the euro? I know that's not necessarily as big of a position for you, but any thoughts there? Loren M. Starr: Yes, so the euro exposure is about half of what it is for the pound. The impacts are about half of what is for the pound, something we've looked at. We don't want to get overly complicated and get into a massive hedging strategy at this point. We think that the prudent thing was to put the pound in place and we'll evaluate that. We think that, that will really do the bulk of what we wanted to do in terms of protecting us from a further strengthening dollar. Operator : The next question is from Ken Worthington, JPMorgan. Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : A couple follow ups on the hedge. First, when did the hedge start? Was it January 1, earlier or more recently, given the currencies have gotten creamed a lot in January so far? Loren M. Starr: It was the middle of January, roughly. I don't know the exact date that we put it in place, but think of it mid-Jan. Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. So given the pound stills decline, zero decline, et cetera, it would imply still an incremental hit to 1Q. Now if the equity markets got creamed, I would expect Invesco to tighten the belt with reduced costs. FX seems different. How do you, as managers, think about the business, employees and shareholders in a situation where FX is having a pretty decent impact on earnings? Does it change investment? Does it change the bonus pool? Like, how should we expect that to kind of flow through as we think to 4 quarters, even with the hedge? Martin L. Flanagan: Ken, that's a great question. And so our view is just look at the fundamental strength of the business, right? And you were sort of heading that way in that FX is something we can't control, right? And to the degree other than trying to be thoughtful and reasonable with hedges. But as I talked about and Loren talked about, if you just looked at the fundamental -- go back to the U.K., go back to EMEA, go back to the continent, the business is strong and growing robustly. And I think it would be an absolute mistake for us to, because of ForEx, stop making the investments when we're making such strong progress in the different parts of the world that way. So at the end of the day, we have to do right by clients and do a good job, but be good stewards, and I think we've shown a track record of being good stewards. So is it -- we'll see where this goes, but we're -- I think as you've picked up from myself and Loren, we're on it and we're driving it hard. Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. Great. And then changing gears. Just on performance fees. There's a little seasonality with some of the trusts in 1Q and we saw a nice pickup. Got a lot of different businesses that charge performance fees. As we think about the rest of the year and maybe even to early next year, what is the view there on performance fees? It would seem like the quant business has kind of come back, the -- Wilbur Ross seems to be poised to harvest. How are you thinking about it? And ultimately, if you're getting this cash flow, I kind of consider it found money, what do you do with it? Loren M. Starr: So in terms of performance fees, as we've talked about in the past, it is hard for us to forecast with any great accuracy because of the very strict accounting standards in terms of realizations and when we can reflect those things in our P&L. I mean, in terms of overall levels, because performance is strong in our products relative to what we saw last year, maybe we're sort of in that range again this year. But again, there's a lot of potential change that can come off that baseline based on what happens. And I do think in terms of the most line of sight, real estate seems to have probably the best opportunity to generate performance fees in some magnitude this year. They obviously contributed this last quarter, and we would hope to see more of that coming through in 2015. In terms of the Wilbur Ross, again, that is one where it's very much tied to kind of end-of-life of the funds. It's mathematical impossibility of any claw back is kind of the standard with which the accounting holds us to recognize on that one. And I could say quite honestly, I mean, the volatility around the carry in those funds can be quite significant. So again, that's something that we're going to keep our eyes on, but that we wouldn't be looking directly for any sort of realizations from Wilbur Ross in 2015 at this point in time. But again, some of the other parts of the business that we talked about are generating a bank loan and quant generating some good, consistent performance fees. So I think that will be there. And in terms of what we do with that, I mean, a lot of that does drop to the bottom line, right? And so it helps margin, it helps the business. But one of the things we've often said is that we don't want to sort of make a business on performance fees and sort of lock in long-term expenses against sort of things that are going to be tied to potentially things that won't -- revenue that won't recur. So we're very cautious about capturing that revenue when we think about our plans, when we think about our opportunities, investments that we tend to not count that in. In terms of where the cash goes, it will be part of the operating cash along with the rest of the operating cash that we generate. So we're going to continue to use it, but we don't earmark it specifically for one activity or another, it's sort of fungible in our operating cash. Martin L. Flanagan: I would just add, Ken, to Loren's first point that we do run the business sort of thinking -- ex performance fees, I think it can get you trouble otherwise because of the volatility of them, and then secondly, to clarify the second point that Loren made that -- what do we do with the money? It is part of our normal thinking, and we would continue to, as you call it, if it's found money, although I'd say people work pretty hard for it, it would accelerate some of the plans that Loren talked about, have a rising dividend increase or stock buybacks, and while at the same time, building that cash buildup that we talk about. So... Operator : Next question is from Bill Katz from Citi. William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Marty, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned you've said good success in terms of placement opportunities on distribution channels in the U.S. From some experience, either from Invesco or other places you've been, how long does it take before you start to see a ramp in related gross sales against that? Martin L. Flanagan: Yes, that's a great question, and I wish I had a very specific answer. I think the main point, and you go back a few years ago, where that wasn't the case for us, and yes, that was part of the effort of building out a more robust retail capability, that is now in place, and range of capabilities to performance, but frankly, placement is critical. And so it's a prerequisite to success. And I think it puts us in a position as the retail environment, as it gains steam, and this is going to put us in a very different position and you would hope and expect that our retail results would be that much stronger than what we've seen historically. So I don't have a specific date, but again, I think the main point, it's absolutely a prerequisite for success. William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. Second question I have is -- you mentioned that you're seeing a pickup of quant and we've heard some mixed dialogue on that so far from those reporting fourth quarter to date. Is that a geographic-centric answer or outlook of what you're seeing or is it a market [indiscernible], so curious what's driving the differentiated opportunity for you? Martin L. Flanagan: Yes, interesting. So where relative strength I would say, kind of only Europe is really quite strong, we're starting to see some traction in the U.K. and these are institutions, and again, as just in Japan, China and Australia, and it was topical every area there we're actually seeing some real interest in the capabilities. It also, I think, is relating to the use of institutions using more factor investing or whatever you might want to call it and we have just such a strong capability there, whether it be through quantitative team within the PowerShares, what was referred to more as smart data, but one and the same. And so it is, I'd say, a growing interest around the world, and that's what we're seeing so far. William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : And my last question, I think your January update is probably a little better than people were anticipating, can you break that down a little bit on where you're seeing some of the incremental recovery of volumes? Loren M. Starr: So Bill, so I think it's in the passive area, it's going to be probably overrated in the PowerShares traditional products, and we're seeing that. I don't have the January notice, but I think it's sort of the smart beta type of products that are doing well. In terms of UITs are doing well. Those are sort of passive products that get packaged through the broker-dealers. We're also seeing, as I mentioned, good strong flows in our cross-border products and it's the same kind of thing that we're seeing in terms of euro corporate bond, Pan European structured equity, GTR, Pan European high income, those products are doing quite well. I'd say institutional, generally, is showing up nicely. GTR is really a very bright spot, I think generally. I mean, Marty mentioned that it's now at $3 billion and growing. When we last spoke, I think we mentioned it was $1 billion. So it's really -- it's ramping up nicely and it's in -- prominently in our pipeline, our institutional pipeline. So again, more to come on that story as we get into the next quarter, but it's looking quite promising. So I think that's kind of the highlights in terms of where we're seeing. Now IBRA I'd say, also, just generally is sort of stabilizing to some of the things that have been sort of somewhat negatives on the flow picture, are we going to stabilize in the performance, and IBRA is really quite strong now, and so I think it is positioned to do much better. There was a sort of one small -- large institutional outflow in the quarter on IBRA. If you subtracted that one impact, you'd see this trend very clearly in terms of what IBRA is doing. So we're encouraged by that. And then on the flip side, the bank loan, ETF, which I think some people have talked about, that also seems to be generally stabilizing. I mean, it's still an outflow, but it's -- certainly the outflows are nothing that we can't manage and it's been managed quite effectively, and I think there's only about $5.5 billion in that product, just so people know. Operator : The next question is from Michael Carrier, Bank of America. Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Loren, just on the, I guess, the distribution revenues and expenses. It just seems like there is maybe -- I don't know if it was an offset or something, it just seems like the expenses declined a bit more. So I didn't know if there was anything unusual this quarter or if it was just one-off activity. Loren M. Starr: Yes, I think it's more one-off activity. Michael, again, there's always a little bit of noise and adjustments around some of these distribution things as things get trued up through the course of the year. So in terms of our net revenue yield guidance, that probably will be the best way for you to be normalizing that going forward. Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Got it. Okay. And then you guys just gave some color on like the January flows. And if I look at the fourth quarter, the whole industry is a kind of a crazy quarter just in terms of the volatility and the impact that it had on flows. If I look at the categories, so it looks like equity balanced and then Asia were sort of the areas where we saw weakness in the net flows for you guys. Just want to -- when I look in the outlook, it seems like things are pretty favorable. But anything that you saw during the quarter that was not environmental? And it looks like the performance for 3, 5 years still good across the board. 1 year dipped a bit. But anything else that you would say there's more cautious or cautiousness from investors on certain products versus the longer-term trend which you had been good, and it seems like January is off to a good start. Martin L. Flanagan: Yes. I would say -- you described it as environmental, I think is the right way to capture it, and impact your other point. If you look at the depth and breadth of the performance across the globe, it's really strong. And so there is something that -- to meet investors needs in almost any way that they are looking at how to build their portfolios. And you're right, in the fourth quarter, there's literally, I think it was a $4 billion change quarter-over-quarter just in equities alone because of how people reacted to the volatility. So that was probably the biggest impact overall to us. But again, if you look into 2015, as Loren and I have been talking, it looks like it should be a strong year. I can't speak to what the markets are going to do, but if it's sort of a sideways to slightly up market, I would imagine a very, very good flow picture for us. Loren M. Starr: Yes, I mean, one of the things -- that if we do continue to get served up in very volatile markets where people are less prone to be putting money directly into active equities, I mean, some of our liquid alternative products, even though they are early days, have really strong performance. I mean, they are sort of top decile 1-year numbers, which again bodes well for the positioning of these products and then again, how they get taked on -- taken on by the distributors, that there's a lag, it takes a while to get through. But we're probably as well positioned as anybody to sort to be first-in-line as these things sort of come in. So again, we could probably do quite well under whatever environment comes our way. Operator : The next question comes from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous. M. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research LLP : I have a couple of questions on nontransparent active ETFs. I guess, more broadly, how do you guys kind of view that product relative to your current product suite in terms of viability and as a competitor to PowerShares? And more specifically, now that Presidian has refiled its proposal, could you kind of update us on the degree to which you think the changes they've made can be approved and what the time line is for that approval or rejection? Martin L. Flanagan: Again, very topical, when it came out what, now, a couple of quarters ago. Honestly, I think the quarter ETF and the things that are in place are the things that have been driving the industry. Could, over time, it have some traction? Possibly, but it's nothing that we're overreacting to at the moment. So we think there's actually the combination of the existing mutual funds and ETFs, we think they're both great structures that really gets you to where you need to be. Not so sure what the whole benefit of a nontransparent ETF is vis-a-vis a mutual fund. So again, as a competitor product, again, I can't describe the future, but it's nothing that we see as sort of a dominant disruptive technology as people would describe it as. Loren M. Starr: I don't think there's the same sort of first-mover advantage of being out there first with the nontransparent active ETF because it's all very specific to whatever investment team is managing it as opposed to capturing a particular space with an index. So that is one of these things that we probably going to remain vigilant but not necessarily being a first mover. Martin L. Flanagan: And let me put in context. We say that from experience. So we launched, I'm going lose track of time, maybe 5 years ago active ETFs and if there's $4 million in the 3 funds I'd be shocked. So it just hasn't really taken hold. Maybe it's different here, but that's been our experience. M. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research LLP : Okay. And that's great color. And any update on the Presidian product, which I think you guys are part of? Loren M. Starr: Yes, I've not heard -- only what I've personally read on this thing, so again, don't have any much insight as to how they're going. Operator : The next question is from Craig Siegenthaler from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : First, what specific themes is Perpetual seeing in the U.K. given strong sales activity in 4Q? Loren M. Starr: I'm sorry, Craig, we couldn't quite hear your question. Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : All right. What specific themes is Perpetual seeing in U.K. given the strong sales results this quarter? Martin L. Flanagan: Themes or asset classes? Well... Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Product themes, distribution trends? Martin L. Flanagan: Got it. Okay. So it's -- the firm couldn't -- it just couldn't be stronger. So if you go asset class by asset class, whether it be Asian equities, European equities, fixed income, global equities, the performance is very, very strong. I think everything is in net inflows but for the U.K. equity income capability, it's actually back to net outflows similar to where they were before the change with Neil, and Mark Barnett's done an incredible job in his team generating the performance. So really strong. And that was the point I was making, that I don't think anybody would have expected that 2014 would have been a record gross sales year for Invesco Perpetual. And that is really a result of the strength and depth of the teams. And a lot of those capabilities, those teams are -- they make up the bulk of the product range that has been so strong in the cross-border area. So again, very, very strong positioning in EMEA for us. Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Marty, from the outside here it looks like maybe 4 drivers are kind of driving the strong sales results. You had a bunch of product launches over the last year and 2 years, that was probably helpful. I don't know if you reinvested back into distribution, but I thought that maybe a lever too. There seems to be more open architecture going on in the U.K. And maybe RDR is benefiting some your products like passive. But any of those things do you kind of view as drivers as benefiting your business in the U.K? Martin L. Flanagan: Yes. It's, again, it's a continuation of what we continue to do, right? I mean, we do the obvious. We try to understand what clients need, and we ensure that we have the capabilities in place to do it. Probably the most recent areas that -- of relative greater investment have been in fixed income with multi-credit and the like and again, we look at it as a longer-term capability that performance across fixed income is very, very strong right now. That was an area that we had abroad, and which we have done. And we also believe that extending our alternative capabilities into the retail market was an important thing and that's why the effort at the end of 2013, and as Loren pointed out, the performance has been very, very strong and the second set of launches in '14. And we looked at that as we told you, we think of it as a 3-year time horizon, the best -- you really need a 3-year track record, every once in a while there are capabilities that do well. Sooner than that, historically, we saw that with IBRA, we're actually seeing it specifically with GTR right now, and again, I think it's -- we're probably going to be in more volatile markets for a period of time. Investors are looking for a broader range of ways to diversify their capabilities, and that was the whole point of taking the alternatives into the retail market also. And as Loren said, it's only 1 year, but the 1-year performance is just very, very strong. So it probably bodes well for trends that we see -- that we believe are going to be here for a good long time. Loren M. Starr: And the only thing I would say is the continued focus on, I mean, RDR is sort of an underpinning for sort of broader changes within the whole U.K. environment, the fact that we've gone out with a single transparent fee has been a very positive thing. I think we talked about that before, it affected some of our -- where our revenue showed up. But we're certainly at the forefront in terms of doing things that we think are going to be quite friendly for shareholders, for the IFAs who want to sell our products. And we think we're very well positioned with the brand. And the advertising that we put in place have been really helpful for our recognition and it's something that we expect to continue to do in 2015. Martin L. Flanagan: And the thing I don't want to have lost in this conversation, though, is we're talking about sort of advancements, if you want to call it that, but let's not lose track of the fundamental core capabilities, the long-running capabilities in this organization are very, very strong. And not just that, I firmly believe that the active management is a very important thing, it's been topical to the contrary. But that said, we're into the markets where they're doing well and you can see demand for them more permanently. And I think it's going to be a time for active managers over the next 3 years. Operator : The next question comes from Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : My question's on the IBRA franchise and it's kind of been through a little bit of fits and starts. Obviously, it came out of the gates very hot with good performance and very solid flows and then we went through the underperformance and now performance is good again. I guess, just wondering how it's being sold or what changes have been made in terms of the messaging, in terms on how that product can perform? And do you think it can get back to the momentum it had 2 years ago? Martin L. Flanagan: Good question. And so I'll answer it this way. So I'd start by the reality and the right way is that clients have a range. Every client has a different set of investment objectives and risk tolerances and they build their portfolios with ranges of capabilities, as you know, that's what you do. But IBRA was always meant to be an anchor in a portfolio, greater -- a diversifier and a risk mitigator. And we always believed and have said that when you had a very strong equity market, the likelihood is that it would relatively underperform, and at the same time, you saw the flows happen. So we saw that exactly. But I would also come back to if you look at the performance 1 year, 3 year, since inception, it's very, very strong. So since inception, top 11 percentile, 7 percentile over 5 years, the 3 year is 40 percentile, 1 year is 16 percentile. So it's just a really strong performer. I mean, it is an anchor in a portfolio and again I think we have to separate flows from portfolio construction and we think it's really well placed, especially if we're going to be in a volatile market environment. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Great. And then just to follow up on the January transitors [ph] that have been so strong. Is this the combination of both lower redemptions and higher gross sales or more just a gross sales pick up? Loren M. Starr: I believe it's combination of both. I think our redemption rate is much lower and sales have come back in January. Operator : The next question is from Eric Berg, RBC. Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : It feels like that the -- there are not only important product preferences being expressed by investors, alternatives, real estate, fixed income. But it feels, too, like there's an important difference that needs to be articulated, and I'm hoping you can do it for me to sharpen my understanding, of investors thinking about investing abroad, investors thinking abroad versus that in the United States. It just seems like they're approaching investing and what they want and what they're doing is completely different in Europe and Asia than in the United States. My question is, is that right? And if so, how would you sum it up? Loren M. Starr: Yes. Look, I think you're right and I think that's not a new trend. I think if you look at equity preferences and fixed income preferences around the world, just using those 2 categories they have historically been different, they've been different for, I'd say, structural pension reasons is 1 level and frankly also people's risk tolerance. But you also are seeing some changes where if you just go to Japan, Abenomics has -- it is making a real change, where in the pension plans dominated by fixed income, Japanese bonds and some Japanese equities, there is absolutely movement into non-Japanese equities, non-Japanese fixed income. And so that is a very big change. But you're also seeing the preference towards equities outside of the States has probably been higher and with active managers in particular, and it's served them well. So that's what we're seeing and it's a good observation. Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : One separate question. I noticed again in the back of your press release in the final table or right around the final table were your -- you're displaying both your performance relative to benchmark and performance relative to peers, but there are quite a few circumstances, I don't suspect this is distinctive for Invesco and I suspect this has been the case for a while, where there are quite a few instances in which performance is below benchmark but quite strong relative to peers. My question, do you think that -- I think that, that may -- that the public's tolerance for that sort of performance, strong relative to peers, weak relative to benchmark, is their tolerance is going to become less and has become less and less and will become even less and less. Do you agree or disagree? And what do you think the implications, what do you think the implications of that would be? Martin L. Flanagan: So tolerance of underperformance vis-\u00e0-vis benchmark? Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Versus -- yes, in other words, imagine a manager who was doing very well relative to peers, in the top quartile or top half or let's say top quartile, but is underperforming his benchmark consistently. Martin L. Flanagan: So a good question. And what I would say is, very hard to draw a conclusion from that, and so here's what I mean by that. Again, I don't care if it's an institution or an individual. They're going to have a set of things that we know, a set of investment, check of time [ph] prices, risk tolerances. And that benchmark doesn't necessarily represent what they're trying to accomplish with the different investment capabilities. And I think that's really the very, very important key there and I think you'd have to look institution-by-institution and mandate-by-mandate to come to that conclusion. But -- so I can't give you a broad answer to that specific question. Operator : The next question comes from Betsy Graseck, Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : I just wanted to follow up on something you mentioned earlier regarding the active ETFs, that 5 years ago you put it in place, there's maybe only $4 million in AUM. Could you just give us a sense as to why you think that is? Is it a function of the distribution? And what seemingly seems like there's a difference in connectivity between distribution of active ETFs and other products that needs to be fixed or do you think it's a function of pricing? Or it was just ahead of its day? Martin L. Flanagan: Maybe all of those. And I wish that we had a specific answer. I mean, we've asked ourselves that. I think probably what it does come back to is how people are using ETFs and mutual funds. And I think people have generally -- this is a broad statement, if you look what's in mutual funds, they tend to be longer-term time horizon type capabilities that people use. Now that's not to say ETFs aren't but I think they tend to be used in overall portfolio to sort of modify exposures or get access to an asset class they might not be able to in a mutual fund. So I think it's really how the group portfolio construction, how they're using them. That would be my take on it. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And then just separately, you've obviously had great success at taking the ETF PowerShares product and applying it to different portfolios that might not appear liquid but you're providing liquidity, i.e. the bank loan product. Can you talk about what the plans and opportunities are to expand that into other fixed income markets? Martin L. Flanagan: Yes. I'm really not prepared to describe what we're going to do next, or I prefer not to. And that said, what we -- again, the answer is we continue to try and understand what investors are looking for and then we determine the best way to deliver it, whether it's a separate account, a mutual fund or an ETF. So, sorry, I just don't want to get more specific. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Sure. No, I get that. So then I guess just lastly, the -- Loren, for longer interest rate structure that we've got, does seem like it would provide an opportunity to expand the product set because part of the challenge is the liquidity in the underlying product set versus what you're offering to the client in the ETF. And does -- is that a fair assumption that a lower interest rate environment enables you the opportunity to provide potentially more liquidity than you would otherwise be able to do? And then separately maybe you could talk to how you're thinking about liquidity for these products in general, given in December we had some commentary from Congress on liquidity and how asset managers are providing liquidity to their investors. Martin L. Flanagan: Yes. A lot there. So let me just get to liquidity question. So I think it's like this is a new idea that liquidity management is something new to the money management industry. It is absolutely fundamental to how all portfolio managers that manage portfolios for price since inception. And I think that is something that's not fully understood by maybe some of the regulators. And I think money managers do a tremendous job of liquidity management. It's just core to their job, and they all do it in different ways, right. So whether it's keeping levels of cash, having backup lines of credit if they detect [ph] in a way, so there are just many different ways to do it. So I don't know that it's such a new idea and topical as others are bringing up. That said, we continue to do what we've done for decades and just make sure that all the different portfolios have -- the portfolio managers are managing them soundly and appropriately. So that's my perspective and that might be too simple of a view but that's how I look at it. Operator : The next question is from Luke Montgomery, Bernstein Research. Lucas Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : So on the currency translations, I realize it's a crude comparison, but we've seen more of a natural currency hedge, I think, between fees and expenses at some of the other firms like the trust banks. And based on the last 2 quarters it looks like you guys have a 1 for 2 offset from expenses. So perhaps, it's an obvious answer, but is it the higher-margin of the model or some other issue related to where you keep staff versus where you generate the revenue. I know it will be changing with the hedge obviously but understanding the underlying operating structure and how that translates to the P&L would be helpful. Loren M. Starr: Yes, so we tend to -- because we have fairly large portfolios particularly in the U.K. relative to the portfolio -- number of portfolio managers, there tends to be good scale there and good scale, better fees, higher fees than other parts -- in particular in the U.S., similar topic with Europe in terms of the fees. The margins in that region tend to be at the higher level relative to some of the other regions. So I'd say it is a margin topically, you described it, that is causing that ratio. Lucas Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : Okay. And then I know it doesn't necessarily apply to your performance, but as you noted there's been a lot of noise in the press on the poor showing of active management versus benchmarks in 2014. I think the measure of that most often cited leaves a lot to be desired, but to Eric's point, there is a commercial issue here. So I wondered if you could just get a little more detailed about what in the investment environment you think is so challenging for active managers and why you feel that outlook for 2015 and beyond is better, as you said. Martin L. Flanagan: So it's a great question and something that we've taken a look at and I think what we're reading in the popular press is, by our calculations, not exactly correct. And if you look at performance over the last 5 market cycles, peak-to-peak, trough-to-trough, and you look at managers of active share of 60%, so that probably excludes -- this is just mutual funds, that probably excludes about 15% of the population. All managers have outperformed during that period, 63%. And that's -- there's lots of detail here but I won't go into it. My point is, and that's before you start to pick good managers, and so what it's really saying is you really need to look at money managers through the cycle and what to expect during the different cycles and not some calendar or arbitrary date. That's not how the world works. And so I think people could be making bad decisions based on a simple calendar-to-calendar element, but if you are ever going to see active underperformed, it would be from 2009 on when you consider the chunk rally off the bottom and 3 grounds of QE, so there's never been an environment like this. And I think people could be making bad decisions by drawing the conclusions that they have. Operator : The next question is from Robert Lee, KBW. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : And I apologize if this may have been asked earlier in the call, but I just wanted to follow up. I know you guys have been, as you invest in products like GTR and whatnot, have been building up your seed capital over time as new product launches have accelerated the last couple years. How should we -- do you think you're kind of getting to the point, you're kind of near the end of that and it'd be more of kind of just recycling and harvesting? Do you see much more need to build the seed capital book further? And that's the question I have. Loren M. Starr: Yes. I mean, I think that we're still a little bit in the bubble of development, particularly as we rolled some of these capabilities out to different regions. It may be sort of the same type of capability but sort of see it in different regions. So I'd say that's sort of a continuation to 2015. I would expect, probably as we get into 2016, that would begin to slow down. But it's still early days. I mean, there are some things that we did in the liquid alternative world that were launched specifically in the U.S. and we're not fully rolled out everywhere, too. So again, I don't want to sort of get too ahead of what could be the case. Real estate, just as a theme, though, as we continue to grow, it's a very, very successful franchise that we've got here. And we think that we could do more in there, I mean they're obviously well established in U.S., becoming more and more established outside the U.S. That will continue to probably demand some amount of capital that is going to be consistent. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : And maybe on a related topic, I know you guys are clearly very hopeful about the GTR and its potential on a global basis to gather flow, so -- and Loren, you did just mention real estate but are there any other maybe a couple of products that you could point to that you think fairly new but that you feel that given seed in different jurisdictions, whether U.S., U.K., Europe, Asia that there's -- you feel like they have a potential to build what I'll call maybe a global scale franchise off of it? Loren M. Starr: I would say absolutely, I mean, unconstrained bonds. We think that we've developed some really, really fantastic products with our team. And again, just because of the newness of it, they really haven't been able to sort of get established. So I think there's probably quite a variety of fixed income capabilities that are yet to come and will position us in a very large market. So that's something that's in the future, probably a couple of years away still but something that, I think, will provide a lot of opportunity for flow and growth. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : Great. And then just one last question on PowerShares. And I'm just curious, to what extent, if you think of product development for PowerShares, do you or can you leverage the quant skills you have on kind of the separate account side of the business and more traditional side of the business? I mean, is that really kind of a -- I mean, can you take strategies as you do there and leverage them into PowerShares? Or are they kind of help you develop what maybe good, smart beta strategies for PowerShares? Just trying to get a sense of how they kind of, if at all, work together and kind of leverage each other. Martin L. Flanagan: Yes. So that is exactly what has been emerging for us over the last 18 months in particular, where, as factor investing or smart beta, whatever you want to call it, institutions are looking at it and some institutions want to use the ETFs and they do. But by the way, there's others who want separate accounts, and utilizing our quantitative team to do that is something that has been emerging and is a really strong complement. So it's really -- and we look at it -- we can become vehicle independent in that and do what you really want to do and just understand what the capabilities the clients want and deliver them. So it's really the combination of those 2 that are really putting us in a very strong position. Operator : The next question is from Chris Harris, Wells Fargo. Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : A quick follow up on the U.K. Was there any negative impact from Woodford this quarter? I know in prior quarters, there had still been a little bit of leakage from retail and I just didn't know if there was any kind of modest outflows that hit the U.K. this quarter as a result of that. Martin L. Flanagan: No. I mean, as I mentioned earlier, the net outflows in those, they're now back to the same levels that they were when Neil was managing the portfolios. Loren M. Starr: And just, I mean, on that one there's a natural redemption rate against the large portfolio and so pre any changes, there was always sort of an ongoing outflow in those large portfolios. And it's gone back to those levels which are really de minimis now. Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. The other question I have was on PowerShares, specifically the Qs. I know you guys really don't have any economics there, but certainly how the Qs do does have some impact on the brand of PowerShares. So just wondering if you guys could maybe comment a little bit on why flows in Qs were so weak in 2014. Martin L. Flanagan: Yes. I don't know if it's -- so, the Qs do what they're supposed to do because there -- it's actually a passive portfolio, just a typical passive portfolio. But if you're responding to the flows, again, a lot of that is used by institutions wanting access, and what you can really see is almost all investor sentiment is the way I would be looking at that. When you have strong flows to the Qs, you can sense where people's confidence levels are in the U.S. market, in the segment of the U.S. market. And when you see those outflows, that's what you've got and so if you look at Q4 in particular, that's exactly probably a great indicator of investor sentiment and how they were feeling about the risk they were taking in the market. Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. So there's no product switching or anything like that, it's more like a sentiment issue. Martin L. Flanagan: Very much -- yes, I mean that's... Operator : Next question is from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But maybe just 1 further, Marty, on the active and passive side of the story. How has the positioning within your sales force, within the retail channels of active versus passive, I guess, changed over the last year? And as you're thinking -- and moving into 2015 obviously being bullish on active performance, how are you positioning that versus the PowerShares franchise? And if you could talk about the retail distribution landscape in that regard in both Europe and the U.S. Martin L. Flanagan: So good question. I'm glad you asked. So again, the way that we look at it is very basic. We absolutely try to understand what clients are trying to accomplish and we'll use a range of capabilities to meet those needs. And so that would include whether it be our passive or our active capabilities and so we're 1 firm, if you want to say, from, an economic point of view, we're indifferent. The good news is because it's so broad and so deep our capabilities, we can focus on the clients and that's how we look at it. So we just listen and then lead with whatever capability meet those needs of a client. And to use an analogy that a colleague of mine says, if you're a hammer everything's a nail. And so the point is since we have such a broad range of capabilities, we actually can absolutely focus on what clients needs and so we don't look at them as competing with one another. We look at them as complementary to one another in helping clients get done what they need to. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : And maybe just a follow up to that, I guess, where are you seeing -- maybe again in the last few quarters, where are you seeing that demands change on the active and passive side, I guess, looking, again, both at Europe and the U.S. and the financial advisory channels. Are you seeing any significant difference in the demand for the PowerShares versus the active products? Martin L. Flanagan: No. No, we're not. I mean, if anything I think PowerShares continues to be strong and I -- as we were talking a question or 2 ago, I mean, it's -- the factor investments is really taking hold, I'd say, maybe more so outside of the United States within institutions. And as you've heard Loren and I talk, quite frankly, there is a range of institutional investors in particular, if you want to use them as a, really, bellwether that are also very much investing long only equity capabilities along with fixed income and alternatives. So it's really quite broad environment at the moment. What the whole year looks like, I can't speak to, but that's just what we're seeing right now. Operator : Next question is from Douglas Sipkin from Susquehanna. Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Just 2 questions. First, wanted to just follow up on some of the mechanics of the currency, the hedge, I guess. So in terms of sort of the impact on revenues and expenses, that still will be vulnerable or benefit from exchange movements. But below the line -- excuse me, in the sort of, I guess, other comprehensive income account, the gains and losses from the hedge will show up. So it's still possible -- is it still possible that currency weakness or strength can weigh on sort of the revenues and expenses in the operating income number? Loren M. Starr: Yes, Doug. Unfortunately, yes. The hedge is going to be reflected below the line other gains and losses, it'll be mark-to-market, so it's non-operating, I mean, it'll protect our cash, it will protect the bottom line EPS, but the operating will definitely be subject to whatever changes we might see around the yield. And certainly, expenses will move in line with revenues in the U.K. and in Europe largely. So it will certainly have that natural hedge. It's really the operating income that is still going to be exposed. And so again as we talked about in terms of the margin impact, a 10% decline is going to have 0.2, 0.3 basis points' degradation in margin, if you saw a 10% decline. So in any event, it's still on operating -- still are operating results will be exposed to FX. Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Okay. So just a little bit more on that, I mean, will it hit the income statement, though? The gain from the hedge or when... Loren M. Starr: Absolutely. It will hit the income statement and it'll offset any operating income. So there'll be an offset that will even out EPS impact. Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Got you. And then I guess, just digging in a little deeper, I mean, obviously, it does create a little bit of noise in your numbers, but -- and my math could be wrong, but like the actual EPS impact doesn't seem too material. I mean, I know you're more vulnerable with pound weakness, but there is some element of matching on the expenses. So I guess, I'm just wondering, given -- looking in the rearview mirror, obviously, the currencies have come down a lot. But at this point, I mean, I'm just trying to think the methodology. I mean, is it sort of like something you guys are thinking, you know what, let's just take the currencies out of this, we don't want to make any bets on anything? Because I just -- just from that standpoint, I feel like maybe we're past a lot of this currency movement and maybe it doesn't make sense to do it at this time. Loren M. Starr: Well, we certainly would hope that's the case. We put the options really just as protection against any further strengthening of the dollar. So we're not trying to do anything relative to where we are today. The floor is at 1.493. I think the pound is at 1.5 something, right now. So again, if we see the pound start to strengthen from here, my forecast around net revenue yields x performance fees would improve, which would certainly help margins and any estimates around earnings. So it's really -- we felt important just to protect us against any significant further strengthening of the dollar, which again I don't think there's anybody who really knows clearly what is going to happen in terms of that story. And so we just didn't want it to be an ongoing concern for our investors or for others, and so we sort of just kind of took that topic off the table. Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : I got you. So effectively, you're protecting on more downside but if the pound did sort of change direction driven by whatever, you guys still look -- position for upside. Loren M. Starr: Well positioned, nothing lost, yes. Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Okay. Perfect. And then just in terms of investor sentiment, I know it's been very early days with the European announcement. Any preliminary sense that the risk-taking in some of the European areas is going to pick up or has picked up already from what the ECB did? Martin L. Flanagan: Yes, 2 parts to that. I think, no question, I think the ECB move helped sentiment. I think the anchor right now is what's happening in Greece, and I think that's going to keep some volatility in the market until some greater clarity is there. So one's a positive and you'll probably -- you just have to mention that the Greece situation gets into something that's a manageable outcome but lots of noise in the meantime until that happens. Operator : The next question is from Greggory Warren from Morningstar. Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Just a quick look at your balanced segment over the last year. Organic growth was down about 4% on the year. It's traditionally been one of your better growth areas. Yes, I know Atlantic Trust was a big part of that historically. But when you look at where industry growth was for that particular segment last year, just wondering what potentially impacted that last year that's different from any other period, was it performance, was it distribution, lack of interest? I'm not sure, can you add some color there? Loren M. Starr: Yes. So Gregg, thanks for the question. It was really 2 primary things. One you're quite familiar with, I think, in terms of IBRA. IBRA is booked into that category, so we've been seeing some strong outflows in the earlier part of 2014 progressively improving quarter-to-quarter. So again, we think from a trend perspective, that is on a good plane. We also saw just episodically, lower -- outflows in a European high income lower. So that was a balanced product, and so that was just kind of a onetime thing. So we don't think that there's anything this quarter on the balance side that's really worth saying that there's something fundamentally shifting other than we think there's a positive trend and we would expect to see balanced, sort of, go positive again. Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Okay. Good. Good. And then just a quick follow up on what's going on in Canada. You've got a couple of independent providers up there struggling a bit with poor performance, poor flows, the market shifting somewhat where banks are moving both into manufacturing and distribution of mutual funds. Just kind of curious where you guys feel yourself positioned, how you potentially get better growth out of the active piece of the business and then sort of what the plan is for PowerShares there. Martin L. Flanagan: So a couple things. So first of all, as you go back a number of years, we struggled with performance, investment performance lagging into the period of time. Now we've had, it's probably, 3 years of strong growth and that's been really important to get in place. So again, the first principle in place, have a range of capabilities performing well. So that's been a good sign and that's been really what moved Canada to almost as breakeven last year in the retail channel. It's always been broadening in the retail channel and PowerShares are in Canada and that has been another thing that has -- following the playbook that was used in the United States. It is broadening the things that we can do for our clients up there, so I think that's going to help a lot in the retail channel. The other opportunity for us is that we think that, that we should be able to do just much better in the institutional business in Canada. So again, a very important part of our business, some real talented people there with some good capabilities. And you are right, Canada, compared to I'd say almost anywhere in the world, maybe Brazil would be about the same, but the dominance of the banks is quite extraordinary. Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Is there any sort of key to unlocking that to getting on those platforms? Is it just -- is it a fee differential? Is it a performance issue? Or is it just that they're more hungry for the business? Martin L. Flanagan: Well, I think you've hit it. I mean it's -- they like selling their products more than they like selling other people's products and yes, I mean, it's -- when I got into the business decades ago, I thought that would change and it's not changed a bit up there. So again, it just -- you really just have to continue to do a good job and just recognize the strength of the banks. And also you have to expand your range of offerings beyond what they would be doing themselves and that's what we're doing. Operator : The next question is from Bill Katz from Citi. William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Just to follow up, and I did have to hop off for a second, so I apologize if you did cover this in some of the other Q&A. You mentioned quant coming back a little bit more I asked earlier, can you give me a sense of where the mandates are coming from? Is it replacement to active long only equity, fixed income cash, where are the mandates being funded from, if you have a sense? Martin L. Flanagan: So you're talking about the institutional pipeline, Bill, sorry? William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Well, on the quant equity you mentioned that factor based investment is scientific. Martin L. Flanagan: Yes. So it's, again, kind of [ph] in Europe is probably the strongest followed by the U.K. and again, Australia and emerging interest in Japan, which is again, I think relatively new and follow-on to sort of Abenomics and some interest in China. William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : I understand that but -- I'm sorry if my question wasn't clear enough. Where you think the mandates are coming from in terms of from other allocations from equity, within asset class or fixed income, et cetera? Martin L. Flanagan: Bill, I wish I knew. That's a good question I don't have the answer to it. So sorry about that. Operator : And so with that, I'm showing no further questions. Martin L. Flanagan: Well, again, on behalf of Loren and myself, thank you for attending, and thank you very much for the questions and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference. All parties may disconnect.",

Operator : Welcome to Invesco's First Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I'd like to turn the call over to the speaker for today, Mr. Martin L. Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; and Mr. Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin. Martin Flanagan : Thank you very much. And thank you, everybody, for joining us. I'm joined with Loren Starr, and we'll be speaking through the presentation that's available on the website, if you wish to follow that way. As has been our practice, we'll review the business results for the first quarter. Loren will go into greater detail on the financial results, and then both of us will answer any questions that people might have.  And so let me start by highlighting the operating results for the first quarter, and you'll find those on Slide 3. Long-term investment performance remained strong during the quarter. 81% and 80% of actively managed assets were ahead of peers over 3 and 5 years, respectively. Strong investment performance combined with comprehensive range of strategies and solutions we offer, to help clients achieve their desired investment outcomes contributed to long-term net inflows of $10.3 billion during the quarter. Adjusted operating income was up 3.1% compared to the first quarter of the prior year. Reflecting continued confidence in the fundamentals of our business, we're raising the quarterly dividend to $0.27 per share, up 8% over the prior period, and also, returning $185 million to shareholders during the quarter through dividends and in buybacks.  Assets under management were at $798 billion during the first quarter, up from 200 -- $792 billion in the prior quarter. Operating income was $374 million in the quarter versus 700 -- $373 million in the prior quarter. Earnings per share were $0.63, the same as you saw in the prior quarter. Before I go into -- before Loren goes into company's detailed financials, let me take a minute and review investment performance. I'm now on to Slide 6. Our commitment to investment excellence and our work to build and maintain a strong investment culture helped us maintain solid, long-term investment performance across the enterprise during the quarter. Looking at the firm as a whole, 81% of assets were in the top half on a 3-year basis, and 80% were on the top half on a 5-year basis. Now there's been a tremendous amount of debate in the marketplace recently about active versus passive investing. Here at Invesco, we take a more balanced view on this topic. Clients seek better returns with less volatility at reasonable fees. Our focus as always, is on helping clients achieve their investment objectives with a broad range of capabilities and vehicles. We take a high-conviction approach to both active strategies, high active share, and our passive strategies through strategic data. Separately and combined, they are better tools to build portfolios in a more precise way that helps clients achieve their investment objectives. With our high conviction approach to investing, our broad range of capabilities and vehicles, Invesco is well-positioned to help advisers and clients build better portfolios. We're developing a series of white papers that provide further clarity, in both active strategies and passive strategies, to help investors and clients build portfolios that better meet client-investment objectives.  Our focus on meeting client needs with a broad range of active and passive capabilities drove solid flows into the business during the first quarter. On Page 8, you'll see that active and passive flows were quite strong during the quarter, reflecting continued efforts to deliver strong investment performance and provide excellent outcomes for clients. I'd also like to note that these are the highest active flows we have achieved in 2 years.  We also saw strong flows across our institution on retail channels during the quarter, and flows were positive across all 3 regions during the quarter as well. These figures on Slide 9 reflect the broad diversity of flows we saw across our global business during the quarter, which included strength of GTR, fixed income, quantitative equities, real estate, International Growth, amongst others. The institutional pipeline of won but not funded mandates remains at an all-time high, including a broad range of investment capabilities.  Drawing on our discussions with clients and others, we've identified several key themes that will drive growth and shareholder value within our industry over the long-term. Invesco is well-positioned to deliver for clients, which is a core element of these major themes. We have a strong, long-term investment performance. In fact, Invesco was recently cited by Barron's magazine as 1 of the top 3 fund families for 2014 in their annual fund ranking, and Invesco was the only fund family placed in the top 5 over 1, 5 and 10 years. We have a comprehensive range of distinctive investment capabilities delivered through a set of investment vehicles that are fully aligned with client needs. We have deep and stable teams in local markets across the globe, with discreet investment perspective and experience across diverse market cycles. This puts us in a very strong, competitive position, and will help us continue to deliver value to our clients and shareholders.  We feel good about the results for the quarter. Strong flows we saw in the first quarter are continuing into second quarter across our global business, both in retail and institutional channels, and also, within the region, continued strength in EMEA and Asia-Pacific and across a broad range of asset classes. April, month-to-date, we have generated nearly $3 billion of net long-term inflows. These flows are result of the progress we continue to make in delivering strong investment performance and meeting client needs with a range of strategies and solutions, which positions us well for long-term success. I'll now turn it over to Loren to -- more details on the financials. Loren Starr : Thank you very much, Marty. Quarter-over-quarter, total AUM increased $5.9 billion or 0.7%. So this was driven by market gains of $14.4 billion and long-term net inflows of $10.3 billion, which translates to an annualized organic growth rate of more than 6% on long-term assets. These gains were partially offset by negative foreign exchange of $9.5 billion and outflows from money market, and the QQQs of $6 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. Assets also fell by $0.7 billion due to the ETNs that did not come over as part of the transaction with Deutsche Bank, that closed this quarter.  Average AUM for the quarter was $795.4 billion and that was up 0.7% versus the fourth quarter. Our net revenue yield came in at 46.1 basis points, an increase of 0.2 basis points versus Q4. This was driven by higher performance fees in the quarter, which added 1.6 basis points. The increase was partially offset by a few items : 2 fewer days during the quarter; the negative impact from FX on product mix; and lower other revenues, which collectively reduced our net revenue yield by 1.4 basis points. Next, I'm going to turn to the operating results. Our net revenues increased $11.7 million or 1.3% quarter-over-quarter to $917.5 million, which included a negative FX impact of $20.9 million. Within the net revenue number, you'll see that investment management fees declined by $9.3 million or 0.9% to $1.02 billion. This was the result of 2 fewer days during the quarter and the impact of the strengthening dollar on our product mix. The decrease was partially offset by higher average AUM, and FX decreased investment management fees by $26.7 million. Service and distribution revenues declined by $4.3 million or 2%, also in line with day count. FX decreased service and distribution revenues by $0.7 million.  Performance fees came in at $51.7 million, an increase of $32.7 million relative to Q4. Real estate amounted or accounted for roughly $35 million of the increase. The U.K. accounted for $10 million, and the remainder came equally from Asia and bank loan capabilities. Foreign exchange decreased performance fees by $0.6 million. Although very difficult to predict as we've discussed, for the remainder of the year, we'd expect performance fees to be approximately $5 million per quarter.  Other revenues in the first quarter were at $31.2 million, a decrease of $2.9 million, the decline was largely due to a lower level of real estate transaction fees versus the prior quarter. Foreign exchange decreased other revenues by $0.2 million. Looking forward, we'd expect other revenues to be roughly $35 million per quarter.  Third-party distribution, service and advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues, increased by $4.5 million or 1.1%. This increase was in line with higher average AUM. FX decreased these expenses by $7.3 million. Moving further on down the slide, you'll see that our adjusted operating expenses at $543.1 million grew by $10.4 million or 2%, relative to the fourth quarter. Foreign exchange decreased operating expenses by $11.2 million during the quarter. Employee compensation came in at $362.7 million, an increase of $15.7 million or 4.5%. This step up was a result of seasonal payroll taxes, variable compensations linked to performance fees earned in the quarter, and 1-month impact of higher base salaries that became effective March 1. Foreign exchange decreased compensation by $7.3 million in the quarter.  Given the anticipated drop in performance fees for the remaining quarters in 2015, we'd expect compensation to decline by approximately $10 million to $15 million in Q2 and then remain roughly flat during the remainder of the year. Note importantly, that this guidance assumes flat markets and consistent FX to current levels.  Market expense decreased by $5.6 million or 17% to $27.4 million. This decline was driven by lower level of advertising in the quarter, due to delays in the timing of certain campaigns. Foreign exchange decreased these expenses by $0.7 million. Consistent with our prior guidance, we'd expect marketing to run at about $30 million per quarter. Property, office and technology expense was $77.8 million in the first quarter, which was up $2.2 million. FX decreased these expenses by $1.3 million. Property, office and technology costs should run at approximately $80 million per quarter, again in line with our prior guidance.  G&A expense at $75 million was down $1.9 million or 2.5%. FX decreased G&A by $1.3 million. Again, this is in line with our prior guidance and we believe G&A costs will average around this level through the remainder of the year. Continuing on down the page, you'll see that our nonoperating income increased to $4.8 million compared to the fourth quarter. The increase was driven by higher equity in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates, which benefited from favorable marks in certain of our Invesco private capital and real estate portfolios.  The firm's effective tax rate on pretax adjusted net income in Q1 was 26.3%. With respect to our future tax rate, I need to point out that in Q2, we'd expect a one-time tax increase due to New York City tax legislation enacted in April, resulting in a 2-percentage-point increase in that quarter. The rate will then return to the 25.5% to 26.5% level through the last half of the year and going forward. Which then brings us to our adjusted EPS of $0.63 and adjusted net operating margin of 40.8%. Given the continued momentum behind our business, we believe we are on track to produce good margin expansion relative to last year. Given where we sit today, year-over-year incremental margin is at the high end of our 50% to 65% target. And with that, I will turn things back over to Marty. Martin Flanagan : Thank you. We'll open up to questions please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Brennan Hawken : So if we normalize for day count and FX, what was the delta in the revenue yield x performance fees sequentially? Loren Starr : So maybe just, to normalize you mean eliminating it or taking out the -- because what we saw was FX, obviously, had a negative impact in the quarter. The impact was probably somewhere in the line of 0.3 basis points due to FX. That was offset by some benefit in terms of the mix, which was good in terms of flows, but overall -- the overall impact on the amount of non-U.S. higher fee product was reduced due to FX. So I'm not sure if I've fully explained what you're looking for but hopefully, I got some part of it. Brennan Hawken : Yes. So basically, it sounds like what you're saying is, if we exclude out FX and day count, we're probably looking at a flat to moderately improving revenue yield x performance fees, am I paraphrasing that right? Loren Starr : Yes. So I got -- so, yes, the day count impact was about 0.8 basis points. We talked about the FX mix being about 0.3 and then the other revenues was about the remainder. So that's the normalize in elements. Brennan Hawken : Okay, great. And then on the performance numbers. The 3- and 5-year performance numbers have been really, really steady. But the last 2 quarters, the 1-year performance numbers have deteriorated a bit. And can you help us maybe understand what's driving that and whether or not this is a concern to you guys at this point? Martin Flanagan : Yes. For us and probably everybody, the 1-year numbers tend to be the most volatile. Largely, the movement in energy had some impacts on the number of the larger portfolios. That said, when we look at dispersion, dispersion's actually very, very tight on that shorter term number. So it's nothing that we're worried about at the moment. So... Operator : The next question comes from Michael Kim from Sandler O'Neill. Michael Kim : First, just at a high level. Obviously, you guys are one of the biggest and most diversified franchises out there, but are there any sort of manufacturing or distribution pockets that you might -- you think might make sense to fill? And then, how do you kind of think about the build-versus-buy decision, particularly in light of what seems to be the rising importance of scale across the industry? Martin Flanagan : Look, when we look at the organization today, just look at investment capability is pretty well covered as far as we're concerned, and then, when we look in it, what are the qualities of the team and what are the results that they're generating and they're all very, very strong. The probably largest, organic, if you want to call, build, that we've undertaken in the last 3 years has been in fixed income. And if you -- we have a talent that's here, right now, the numbers are very, very strong. And we mentioned that 3 years ago, when we started going down that path and my personal opinion, they're ahead of where they -- where you would imagine they would be, when you do something organically like that and again, I think we're in a very strong position there. So we don't really feel like we have gaps right now, and yes, we'll just continue to get better at what we have. Michael Kim : Okay, great. And then separately, just given kind of the pending money market fund, regulatory changes, and any updates on kind of your plans on how you might potentially transition that business? And then stepping back, any shift in how you might be thinking about the money market fund business just from a strategic standpoint? Martin Flanagan : Yes. Again, really talented group that we've had, been in the business a very, very long time. I think you probably have seen, with some of the new regulation and some of the people we have been focused, you have 60 days and in shorter duration. We've had a fund in that space for 30 years. So, yes, we're naturally, I'd say, positioned, strongly there. We're also seeing institutional clients, they still want in short-duration, cash management and it's going to be bear [ph] weathers and funds with separate accounts, it will continue to be there. Loren Starr : And I'll just say, we've had very productive dialogue with distributors of our traditional products in terms of other types of products that would be very interesting. So we feel that the business is going to be quite resilient despite the regulation changes. Operator : The next question is from Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Daniel Fannon : I guess a little more color on April and the institutional backlog would be helpful. I guess anything different than -- kind of, you've been talking about whether there's products that are becoming increasingly a bigger component of the sales or vice versa on the slowdown? Martin Flanagan : Yes. It's -- yes, I'd say in -- from my perspective, that almost 10 years I've been here, I've never seen it more broad, more deep. We've had once before, where we've been in a situation where we've had all regions in net flows, but we've never been all regions, both retail and institutional. And even when that was happening, it was maybe more narrow in investment capabilities. So yes, we're seeing it, things like you have GTR, risk parity, international equities, real estate, fixed income, that -- all the quantitative capabilities. I mean, it just is really broad, very deep. So -- and usually, I'd say, for most organizations, that first quarter, historically is one of your stronger quarters for net flows for various reasons. Again, we can't predict the future, but April, it looks like our second quarter is very much on the same path as the first quarter, which would also just, again, suggest that things are looking really quite strong for the organization. Daniel Fannon : Great. That's helpful. I guess just on that in terms of the regions, everything looks positive, I guess, except Canada, which was right around breakeven. I mean, anything happening there that you -- that can change kind of the outlook for -- to be a little more robust or your seeing demand or product shifts there? Martin Flanagan : Yes, 2 things. So the ETF business there has actually been, really, a very important thing. It's almost following some version of -- and Dan, you've been following the company for a while so it's almost the ETFs were a reinforcement of our active management, and we're starting to see that happen there. There's also some very thoughtful product introductions that we've done in Canada, and I think that's also going to help in the retail channel. But also, the other area of focus is the institutional business. It is an area that we think we should be much more successful than what we had been, and that's an absolute focus for us in Canada and we expect that we'll be successful there. Loren Starr : I will point out that Canada was positive, even though it didn't show up. It rounded to 0, but they were positive this quarter. Operator : The next question is from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous. M. Davitt: On regulatory front, we're hearing whispers and some chatter from some of your competitors that the FSOC and other bodies are really starting to kind of focus in on the liquidity issue. And the fact that a lot of products are being marketed as liquid products, but the underlying assets can become illiquid quite quickly. Are you hearing similar issues, and is there any more color you can give us on where you think that trend is going from a regulatory standpoint? And what, if anything they could do, that could alleve  that issue, I guess? Martin Flanagan : Yes. It -- I wouldn't call it whispers, I'd say it's an open dialogue and I'd start by the regulators trying to get a better understanding at the FSOC level of how do money managers manage portfolios. And the idea of managing liquidity is not new, it's a fundamental core strength of the industry. It's what the industry has done forever. The difference is, it's sort of the broadening oversight of FSOC, actually educating the other set of regulators that have an interest there. That said, there's a lot underway from an industry point of view that where there can be improvements in potential liquidity, they're being addressed. There are some -- been some good developments in the bank loan area and there's further developments there. So again, I think it's a good dialogue, it's an important dialogue, but I think education is a big part of it. And as an industry, we'll just continue to -- where we can get better, we will. M. Davitt: Is there any sense that any regulatory changes or the outcome would be a significant negative for you from either a capital, I guess, some sort of capital issue or having some sort of reserves? Martin Flanagan : Yes. Again, I would classify that it's a topic, it's a dialogue right now. And you have to first -- if your question's assuming there's a problem and I say, yes, on the margin there's areas where you can improve, but that's no different than anything the industry does. So I'd say we're a long, long way away from any regulatory changes just because we're just too early in the process. Operator : The next question is from Bill Katz from Citigroup. William Katz : It looks like Europe continues to be an area of significant growth for you. This is probably a bit of a naive question, given you're going to say it's still a relatively small AUM base. But 2-part question, one, can you talk about what the success is there, how broad is it? And then are you -- given the rapidity of growth, are you running into capacity issues yet? Martin Flanagan : Yes. No, I -- again, no. It's an area we've been discussing it for some period of time, and again, it's not an overnight development. I mean it was -- when we sort of put our focus on it 3 -- 3.5 years ago, it was broad-based, right? It was considering the product offering was robust and strong and it is very robust and strong, and excellent investment performance. It was also, on an execution side, where we cover in clients in a manner that we should and delivering, that's been a big change and that's helped also. Frankly, a redo of the servicing capability underneath and that's been in place too, so it was really broad. And that was, again, largely a -- in the U.K. has always been very, very strong. It was really getting the cross-border retail market on a continent into a very strong position, and that has happened and it continues to grow. So -- and we don't have any issues with capacity at the moment. And the other opportunity, again, for us, and you're starting to see it actually in our numbers is, we -- institutionally, we think we should be doing better than we have historically, and you're actually starting to see some of those results come through and I would still say, we're pretty early in what we expect over the next 1, 2, 3 years institutionally in EMEA. Loren Starr : And Bill, I will also just comment that, I think, in terms of country-wise, Italy has been a big driver of some of the flows and success, but Spain as well. And Spain is -- a lot of the dynamics that happened in Italy are now showing up in Spain. So Spain, Italy, Germany, Switzerland all are contributing nicely, but Italy right now, is probably outsized in terms of its contribution on a cross-border flow. William Katz : That's very helpful. And then, Loren, maybe just for yourself. I think you said you're running at the high end of your incremental margin. I just wanted to make sure I interpreted that correctly. From here you're at the high end or you were at the high end and, therefore, you're not going to sustain the high end? Loren Starr : No. For the full year, year-over-year, when you're looking at our incremental margins, we're going to -- if all things flatten or goes well, we'll be at the high end of that range in terms of delivering incremental margins. William Katz : '15 over '14 for you? Loren Starr : Yes. Operator : The next question is from Luke Montgomery, Bernstein Research. Luke Montgomery : You've talked about the efforts to increase tractions at third-party distribution channels in the U.S. and I think you've been slightly frustrated by the progress there, given your strong performance. Retail flows were pretty robust this quarter, so maybe an update on how that's going, a little color on what's selling? And whether you feel increased brand recognition might suggest some sustainability there? Martin Flanagan : Yes. So let me start at the end. Brand recognition, the last founding, if you want to call it, sort of came out 8th. So that was, Luke, that's a tremendous improvement from 5 years ago where we weren't on the list. So I -- and I do think that is an important thing. We still have not closed the -- fully the perception and reality gap. That is something that we continue to do and it's -- from prior experience, it just takes longer than you think it should. But good progress. And if you look at the underlying fundamentals in addition to the breadth of capabilities and the performance, it's -- placement's on the other different platforms and that continues to just be stronger and stronger. And I will say the other element, too, is as a number of the distributors went through a number of changes, that they -- the distributors, as they have settled down and gotten organized, quite frankly, that's a good thing for us. And we think we'll see some greater impact in a couple of the principal distributors than we might have had 2 or 3 years ago because of that. Luke Montgomery : Okay, great. And then staying with retail distribution. I think we can agree the independents and RIA [ph] channels are growing in importance. It's a -- they're far more fragmented channels and so I think a lot more expensive to sell through. So any sense of how much of your retail flows have been going to those channels, and more broadly, how you're thinking tactically about selling into that channel without driving up cost too much? Martin Flanagan : Yes. Again, we -- as probably most everybody and we all do it in different versions, the same flavor, but it is a channel that is covered and we are focused on it. Yes, we do see it continuing to grow but quite frankly, the output of that channel vis-\u00e0-vis you have some of the main firehouses there -- it's just no comparison at the moment. That said, longer-term, it's something we'll continue to focus on and is, I think, you're sort of suggesting that it's probably a wise thing to do and we have been and we will continue to do it. Operator : The next question is from Michael Carrier, Bank of America. Michael Carrier : Marty, just on the alternative side, you mentioned that you feel like you have the products that you need. I just wanted to get a sense, when you see the demand in that product category, I know it's pretty diverse, but are you seeing more on the institutional side or you're seeing some uptake in some of the -- maybe the newer products on the retail side that's driving those flows? Martin Flanagan : Yes, I'll make a couple of comments and Loren can pitch in. So institutionally, I mean, it continues to -- what would be the more recent -- yes, real estate continues to be just very, very strong for us or World Bank loans continues to be very, very strong. The newer thing, well, risk parity continues to do very well institutionally, for us as an organization. And also adding to it now multi-sector credit is starting to get some real traction for us, and GTR's another one that has actually been very successful, and in total, GTR assets are about $5 billion, right? So -- and that's in what, a year, 1.5 years maybe, that's been in the market for us. So it's continued to be a focus, I'd say, for institutional investors. On the retail side, if you start with United States, a year ago, we introduced that very broad range of alternatives into the retail channel. Our expectation at the time was we'll look back 3 years from then to determine how successful it's been. It's just this is a long process, and back to Luke's comment a little bit, the distributors are very slow in adopting. So if you look at their commentary that they anticipate alternatives being -- pick a number, 15% to 20% of a client's portfolio, they -- what is available in their channels is -- can't meet that asset allocation capability. So I think that's sort of a headwind to that, but I do think, if you look at things like risk parity, GTR and some of those extensions that we've had, they are -- those are the types of things that are gaining a lot of interest in retail channels, and we've seen flows against it. Michael Carrier : Okay, that's helpful. And then Loren, just quick one. Buybacks in the quarter just picked up. Just wanted to get a sense, is that seasonal because of grants or is it just, given where your cash level is, the net debt, are you having more flexibility? Loren Starr : It tends to be a little seasonal as we've discussed in the past, because we have some of the restricted stock grants granted March 1, and we certainly, do our best to eliminate the dilution associated with those grants as quickly as possible. So going into the second half, you may see the levels step down a bit. Operator : The next question is from Ken Worthington from JPMC. Kenneth Worthington : First, cross-border. Having huge success in Europe, can you talk about the sales of the SICAF products in Asia? You've got a lot of product. You have a fabulous track record in this product. Do you have the right product in distribution to meet investors tastes in Asia? And I know this is a hard benchmark, but like, is -- you're doing so well in Europe, how do you make Asia as good for Invesco in cross-border as it is in Europe? Martin Flanagan : Yes. Good questions. So let's see. Different ways I can answer that question. So yes, what we look at is sort of a core strength of ours and where we think the market's going is, really, Greater China investment capabilities. And performance is strong there for us and we're actually starting to see quite a bit of uptick in flows there. I think also, you saw probably the Hong Kong-Shanghai Connect launch, it raised almost $2 billion in 3 days. So I think it is part of the mechanisms opening up in the marketplace along with the asset classes that people are interested in. Also, it is again, for us, just be -- want to be more effective in the marketplace. We have a new retail leader out there and I think that's also going to help very much to make us more effective in the area, and I will also say you're seeing things. Japan for us is, it is day and night from 2 years ago and it is a very busy place for us, probably for some other managers too, and that's largely fixed income and it's really some broader equity capabilities too. So we're going to see, I think, results in Asia-Pacific this year that we've not seen for some period of time. Kenneth Worthington : Great. Loren, in terms of performance fees, love the guidance. Can you help us understand which areas you have the greatest visibility on in terms of performance fees and what areas you have less? Loren Starr : They're all pretty murky. Yes, I think in terms of the real estate and private equity, which are 2 ones where we've seen a lot of built-up performance fees. It had a lot to do for real estate in terms of timing of certain sales of certain properties and now as we have visibility, we just didn't have a lot of sense of timing. And obviously, some of that materialized this quarter, we said -- we knew there was something out there and we didn't know when it was going to hit, and obviously, the bulk of it's hit this quarter. That doesn't mean there's not going to be more. There will be probably some more real estate performance fees we're going to see, but nothing of the magnitude that we just saw this year or we won't expect it to happen. But in terms of private capital, private equity, we've discussed this, because of our very strict accounting rules we can't recognize any carry until essentially there's no mathematical possibility of clawback. And that really means that it's going to be close to when the fund who has -- that has the carries, it's at a wind down -- wait until wind-down mode. So that's probably not going to happen this year. It's more like a 2016, possibly even 2017-type of event. But that's much harder for us to forecast. In terms of the visibility, that we do have good sense of visibility. U.K. trusts is pretty good. We've provided guidance there, it's -- and you've done a lot of work on that too, I know, Ken, where we can actually take a look at the performance and the trigger date and you can sort of get a sense of whether they're going to be there or not. We've generally seen sort of $10 million-ish numbers or higher in the first quarter. Bank loans, it's sort of hard. We do have some sense of it, in terms of the timing of when a bank loan is coming to advance, and when we also often see a performance fee and often connected with the launch of a new loan [ph]. And quants is also pretty decent because it also has certain trigger points on investment performance. So that's why the $5 million guidance, I'd say, is pretty good. We could be surprised by something else coming in that we didn't see. But generally, I think the $5 million a quarter is probably the right guidance. Kenneth Worthington : Okay, great. Then lastly for Marty. There are number of new, nontransparent ETF structures that have been proposed and Invesco's partnering with one such provider. What are your thoughts on the opportunities of the new wrap or the new structure? What does that mean for the active management mutual fund industry if anything? Martin Flanagan : Yes, Ken, we've talked about it before. I mean, yes my -- first is, my personal opinion, it's interesting but I don't think it's a game changer by any stretch of the imagination. I think if you look at the ETF structure what it provides, the fundamental elements are well-known and enjoyed by market participants, right? So it's to deal with liquidity, it's some of the tax benefits that come along with it and really, the ability to see the portfolios as opposed to you have the open-ended mutual fund, where it is really a longer-term vehicle for sure and, I think, for active management, it's a better vehicle. So it may take hold, but I bet if we're sitting here in 5 or 10 years it's -- it will probably be there, I don't see it being an important part of the marketplace as it's currently being discussed or designed. But again, we'll pay attention and we'll -- we don\u2019t want to be -- my feeling could be exactly wrong. So we're going to make sure that we're there. Operator : The next question is from Robert Lee from KBW. Robert Lee : Just on the ETF business, I mean, you've have had a lot of success in Europe with the traditional businesses and I know it's been the focus on trying to grow ETFs there, but it seems like that's one part of your business where maybe you've had less traction than hoped. So can you maybe update us, just given the potential growth prospects of ETFs in the U.K. and the continent, kind of how maybe you're looking to reenergize that part of your business and what are you thinking about the opportunities there? Martin Flanagan : Very good point, you're correct. So we -- on the continents where we started the ETFs business, a number of years ago, we got very little traction, and it was just frankly a very different market. I would say, we're ahead of the curve, we thought there would be retail takeup similar to the United States, it just really wasn't the case. It was much more of an institutional tool. And as you know, it went through quite a large change from basically derivatives space ETFs more to physical and that is really coming to an end. We still think there's quite an opportunity there. We have just, more recently, in the last 12 months, sort of stepped back to sort of how to go forward, and there was a recent launch of an ETF on the continent. We also look at the U.K. as more of an institutional opportunity for us, in the shorter-term, and that is an area where we've, in the last 6 months, been starting to put some effort. Robert Lee : I mean, as part of that, kind of like where -- I think you've done in the U.S. where your retail distributors also, I guess, market the PowerShares product. So is it part of this combining distribution efforts? Martin Flanagan : No. That is on the continent. That is the case. There's still a open strategic question for us with RDR, what is the best way to use ETFs in the retail channel in the U.K.? And we're still working on that. So in the meantime, we're actually using our U.S.-listed ETFs in the U.K. into certain of the institutional market there. Robert Lee : Okay. Great. And the second question is just really kind of a, I guess I'll call it, a big picture industry question. But it's interesting your take on it, I mean, you talked about this morning how the marketplace kind of misunderstands the active versus index performance dynamic over time, and some of your peers have made similar comments today and in the past. So I'm just kind of curious, what besides some white papers? I mean, is there anything as a industry or maybe individually as a company? You feel you can do the -- kind of get that message out? Because it feels like it certainly gets way overshadowed by the press and whatnot. So I'm just kind of just curious what kind of things you could do as an industry to actually get that point across? Martin Flanagan : Well, that's a great question, and that's why we're reacting as other people are. I mean, it is -- we feel we have an obligation to educate the marketplace about what are the facts. And I would say, the reality is the active managers really did not do a good job of it. In a level we just thought that, well, everybody knows this of course, and it just wasn't true. And then you end up in a situation where go from this last market cycle which, not over yet from '09 on. You've had -- with an unprecedented market because of bouncing off the bottom, all the kiwi[ph] . So if passive was ever going to be attractive, this is the market and it's -- it probably wouldn't have happened since 1929. And so it was too easy to come to an answer that active is dead, when in fact, if you look at -- and the way you have to look at it, right, you have to look at market cycles, peak-to-peak, trough-to-trough. And the other thing that's totally misunderstood, too, is not just relative outperformance but risk mitigation and drawdown and those other -- so that in the work that we did, it just shows active management is a very, very important thing. And so, I also think we're going into a market where active management results are going to be more profoundly understood. So -- but we owe it to our clients to get the facts out in the marketplace. Robert Lee : I mean, along those lines, I'm just curious, I mean, if there's been some inkling that maybe in the institutional world that argument resonates or is resonating maybe somewhat more. But any sense as you think about the retail world that -- you getting some traction with those kind of...? Martin Flanagan : Absolutely. So the -- our retail, kind of, they are desperate for the facts. And again, the paper we just put out, it is -- the interest level is enormous within the adviser community, because they really need the facts to talk to their clients. It's been too easy to read USA Today and then say, \"Buy a passive index\" and that's what they're responding to with no facts or I should say, yes, limited facts. So I think getting the facts out there and important -- in our view is, we take a very balanced view because we have our active business and our passive business and we think high conviction active and frankly, high conviction passive, which we describe as smart data, that's how you get better outcomes for clients. So we're not wedded to a single answer because we only have one capability. We have a broad range of capabilities and we just want to meet client's needs. And I think that's -- that, I think, resonates with the adviser community too. And again, just helping them construct a portfolio as to meet investor outcome is -- that's what we do. Operator : The next question is from Eric Berg, RBC Capital Markets. Eric Berg : Marty, I have a 2-part question that actually follows on from the question that was just asked. Are you essentially saying that putting aside the admittedly important issues of risk and drawdowns, I'm certainly not disposing those mentions as not important, they're very important. But are you essentially saying that if one looks at a full-market cycle, that it is simply not the case, that active managers have underperformed typically on passive strategies? Martin Flanagan : Not all. So, again, you can get the white papers. So basically, what we did is -- and I -- if I could just try do this succinctly so it doesn't go on too long. We looked at peak-to-peak, trough-to-trough market cycles for the past 5 cycles, and through all U.S. major funds, 17 different asset classes holistically. And 60%, I think it was 61% of all managers outperformed the passive index, and that was with active share of 60%, which is not much. It only took out something like 10% of the funds. And our point is not that active manage -- yes, that active share is the predictor of results. All we were starting with was take out 5 indexes and what was the result? And that's before you try to pick a good manager. And again, so you can read the paper and draw your own conclusions, but I think it's really quite compelling. Eric Berg : I appreciate that. I will read it. I have one follow-up. One dimension to this active passive that has not been discussed at least today, is the whole tax issue and the idea that it is supposedly the case. I haven't -- or really documented this myself that there are too many active managers who are not tax mindful. What does Invesco have to say about that part of the discussion? Martin Flanagan : So that is, I'd say, one of the benefits of an active manager that they can actually -- part of what they think about is managing the tax elements of the holdings that they have. So I would put that in another positive category of active managers. I can't speak for all the active managers. I would say the vast majority of asset managers pay deep, deep attention to that and have tax teams that help them work through those types of topics, as do we. And I think the other reality is -- so that's important, but the vast majority of all investments are likely in some type of a retail -- excuse me, in a retirement vehicle, so it might minimize the benefit of it for many people. But it is an important topic. Operator : The next question is from Chris Harris, Wells Fargo. Christopher Harris : So you guys are performing at such a high level right now in so many different areas. Just wondering, if you can share your thoughts about maybe your strategic priorities over the next few years? And really, kind of wondering, what areas are you guys really focused on, perhaps, trying to grow further or if there are areas that are maybe underrepresented or perhaps not in your suite at all that you're really taking a hard look at it and making some additional investments there? Martin Flanagan : Yes. It's a good question. I don't know that if there's any earth shattering news, we're going to really very much stay on the path that we're on. And as I've said during this call and Loren has, too, it is really the first focus of broad, deep investment capability to perform well. And again, we'll focus on getting better there, and where we can be more thoughtful on product capabilities we will. We're doubling down in a number of areas that we've been on. We think we can do a better job having our investment capabilities available around the world, more effectively. That is an area of focus for us. We also think that the broader acceptance of alternatives around the world for the organization is an area of focus for us. And probably, the third leg is the institutional business. We think collectively, we're at different phases in different parts around the world. We think that is a real opportunity for us as an organization also. Operator : The next question is from Douglas Sipkin from Susquehanna. Douglas Sipkin : I apologize if this has been hit on already, but just wanted to get a sense, obviously, with the great growth out of Europe. I'm assuming, but I'm not certain, is that net revenue yield fee accretive, given that that's growing so much faster than everything else right now? Loren Starr : Yes, absolutely it is. This -- the fee rate in Europe tends to be, on a net basis, 80 and above. So it's certainly at the higher end of our product offerings. Douglas Sipkin : Great, that's helpful. And then secondly, obviously, PowerShares has been a great story this year. I mean, can you guys update us on maybe on your sort of product development plans? Have you been raising the budget there to sort of launch new ETFs, given what you've seen a big move into smart beta in '15? Martin Flanagan : I would say it's a continuation of what we've done. I think we try to be thoughtful about our product introductions, and we'll continue to do that as opposed to put things in the market and hope they work. So I'd say it'd be more deliberate development as opposed to many, many things. Loren Starr : Yes. I would say some of the things that we've just recently done like our Equal Weight Russell product was just a very big flower this quarter, BuyBack Achievers continues to do well, S&P 500 High Dividends, certainly, the ones that are already out, but some of them have been pretty new. High Beta, actually, was a pretty good winner this quarter too. So it's -- I think the products that have been launched are now beginning to take root and there's probably more opportunity to seeing growth in our existing product set than necessarily going out and trying to fill other holes. Operator : The next question is from Chris Shutler, William Blair. Christopher Shutler : Most of the questions have been answered already, but just one quick one on performance, which remains really strong across the franchise. U.S. seems like the kind of the one area that continues to have some challenges, particularly in the core and growth areas. So Marty, I just wanted to get your thoughts there and any changes you think are necessary? Martin Flanagan : Yes, thank you. No, I -- so if you look at core, relative underperformance. Again, very good team, very -- they're sticking to discipline. Yes, we -- yes, this is -- yes, it's what we've seen happen in prior market cycles and they've tended to build up cash in these periods of time and they have done that. But again, I have confidence that they're very strong. The growth team actually has put up some very strong numbers, actually. So I -- the leadership there in the last 3 years, I think -- Julie has brought in the large-cap growth. They've done a really good job. So I -- we feel comfortable in both areas. Operator : The next question is from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : I joined the call late, I'm sorry if this -- if you've covered this already, but Marty, maybe if you could just comment a little bit on -- I know it's early but a little bit on the Department of Labor fiduciary proposals? If you're hearing anything from your wholesalers as they talk to the distribution channels, both on the warehouse and RIA [ph] side? And also, your view on the defined contribution channel, whether you think that will have any impact and across your product set, if you think there's certain product areas like multi-asset and PowerShares that might do especially well if more strict rules are proposed on the fiduciary side? Loren Starr : Yes. Brian, that last part of your question, I couldn't hear. I don't know if Marty, you could. Brian Bedell : On the defined contribution side? On the product side? Yes, I'm sorry. On the product side, there's any products such as, say, multi-asset or products in the PowerShares complex would -- do you think might benefit from more stringent fiduciary standards? Martin Flanagan : So let me -- a few comments, right? Also right now, I'd say the fundamental idea is a good idea. You can't argue with the principles that are in place. I think that is thoughtful. I would also say, by the way, I do think the financial advisers have been very thoughtful and very minded about their clients. That said, raising the bar is always a good thing. I think the DOL is very focused on making sure that there's not unintended consequences by what they are putting forward where some smaller plans and smaller accounts are disadvantaged, where they can't get advice anymore. So that, I think, is one of the topics that they're focused on right now. With regard to us as an organization, we provide the investment capabilities. So it's more of an issue for the financial intermediaries and how do we weigh into that it's really, if you have strong investment performance, broad range of capability, your probably still in a pretty good place, and if you have competitive fees, you're probably still in a good place, which we are. And it's just how we interface with the intermediaries using -- on their models and different types of things. It's what we do already so I would put the whole element without knowing what the details are. Good idea to continue to raise the bar. As a firm, I think we're positioned well for what we could see coming down the path and whether that's in the DC channel or the retail channel. Okay. Thank you very much on behalf of Loren and myself. Thank you for your time and questions, and I look forward to speaking to everybody soon. Have a good rest of the day. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference. All parties may disconnect.",

Operator : Welcome to Invesco's Second Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now, we'd like to turn the call over to the speakers for today, Mr. Martin Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; and Mr. Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin. Martin Flanagan : Thank you very much, and thank you everybody, for joining Loren and myself. And those that wish to follow the presentation, it is on our website, if you are so inclined. Today, I'll review the business results for the second quarter. Loren will go into greater detail around the financials. And as our practice, both Loren and I will answer any questions that anybody might have. So, let me start by highlighting the firm's operating results for the quarter, you'll find this on Slide 3 of the presentation. Long-term investment performance remained strong during the quarter. 75% and 79% of actively-managed assets were ahead over a three- and five-year basis respectively. Strong investment performance, combined with a comprehensive range of strategies and solutions we offer to help clients achieve their desired investment objectives contributed to long-term net inflows of $5.9 billion for the quarter. Adjusted operating income was up 4.2% compared to the first quarter. The quarterly dividend is $0.27 per share, which is up 8% over the prior year. We also returned $198 million to shareholders during the quarter through the combination of dividends and stock buybacks. Turning to the summary of the results for the quarter, assets under management were $803 billion at the end of the second quarter, up from $798 billion in the prior quarter. Operating income was $390 million in the quarter versus $374 million in the prior quarter. Earnings per share were $0.63 per share, the same as the prior quarter. Before Loren goes into details on the financials, let me take a moment to review investment performance during the quarter inflows. Turning to Slide 6, investment performance remained are strong across the enterprise, in spite of the volatility later in this past quarter. Looking at the firm as a whole, 75% of the assets were in the top half on a three-year basis. 79% were in the top half on a five-year basis. I am now on Page 7. I think we all recognize that every client has a unique set of investment objectives with a desired set of outcomes that can be achieved in a variety of ways. We believe the greatest opportunity for clients to achieve those investment objectives is by using a well-constructed portfolio that is needs-based, spans asset classes and considers both active and passive strategies. One of the greatest strengths of Invesco is the broad range of active and passive capabilities we offer our clients. It's a key differentiator for us in the marketplace. Our focus on meeting client needs with a broad range of active and passive capabilities drove solid flows into our business during the second quarter. Active and passive flows we saw across the globe, reflecting continued efforts to deliver strong investment performance and provide excellent outcomes for clients. Although retail flows were impacted by the macro event, we saw strong flows in our institutional channel during the quarter. The figures on Slide 8 reflect a broad diversity of flows we saw across our global business during the quarter, which included strength in fixed income, namely investment grade, stable value, global total return, real estate, and other asset allocation products. Despite significant funding during the quarter, the institutional pipeline of won but not funded mandates remains strong and diversified across asset classes. We feel good about the results for the quarter. In spite of the late volatility we saw in the second quarter, we continue to see strength in Asia Pacific and EMEA particularly, and across the broad range of asset classes. These flows were the result of the continuing strong investment performance, and our ability to meet client needs with a range of strategies and solutions, which positions us well for long-term success. And from my perspective, this quarter really represents the value of being broadly diversified by channel, asset class, investment capabilities, and the value of the investments we have made over a number of years. Smart data in ETFs, European cross border investments, the institutional business globally, alternatives, fixed income. We have a history of advancing our business during uncertain times, whether it comes through markets or more recently the impact of such developments coming from the regulatory changes. We believe we are positioned very well. We believe we are making the investments to continue to strengthen our business, while at the same time, we recognize we are in an uncertain time, and we will be thoughtful during this period. Loren? Loren Starr : Thanks, Marty. So now we'll go through the asset roll-forward and operating income. So quarter after quarter, you'll see that our total assets under management increased $5.3 billion, or 0.7%. This was driven by FX translation of $8.5 billion, and long-term net inflows of $5.9 billion. These gains were partially offset by negative market returns of $6.2 billion and outflows from money market and the QQQs of $2.6 billion and $0.3 billion respectively. Our average AUM for the second quarter was $810.9 billion. That was up 1.9% versus the first quarter. However, as Marty mentioned, due to the market declines in June, our end of period AUM came in at $803.6 billion, which is in fact 0.9% lower than our Q2 average AUM. Our net revenue yield was 46.2 basis points, which represented an increase of 0.1 basis points versus Q1. The drop in performance fees quarter over quarter accounted for a decline of 1.9 basis points, which was more than offset by a variety of factors, including an improved mix, which added 0.7 basis points, one extra day during the quarter, which added 0.6 basis points, favorable FX and higher other revenue, each of which added 0.3 basis points. Let's turn to the operating results now. Net revenues increased $19.1 million or 2.1% quarter over quarter to $936.6 million, which included a positive FX rate impact of $5.1 million. Within the net revenue number, you'll see that investment management fees increased by $59.7 million or 5.8% to $1.08 billion. This was a result of higher average AUM, one extra day during the quarter, and the impact of the growth in higher yielding product. FX increased investment management fees by $7.2 million. Service and distribution revenues increased by $6.2 million or 2.9%, also in line with higher average AUM, and the increased day count. FX increased service and distribution revenues by $0.2 million. Performance fees came in the quarter at $13.1 million, and they were earned from a variety of different investment capabilities, which included bank loans, real estate, Asian equity and quantitative equity. Foreign exchange had no impact on our performance fees. Other revenues in the second quarter were $37.9 million, which was an increase of $6.7 million, and that line item benefited from a higher level of real estate transaction fees. Foreign exchange decreased other revenues by $0.1 million. Third-party distribution service and advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues, increased by $14.9 million or 3.7%, and this increase was in line with our higher average AUM and higher day count. FX increased these expenses by $2.2 million. Moving further down on the slide, you'll see that our adjusted operating expenses at $546.4 million grew by $3.3 million or 0.6%, relative to the first quarter. Foreign exchange increased operating expenses by $2.3 million during the quarter. Employee compensation came in at $351.4 million, a decrease of $11.3 million or 3.1%. The decrease was consistent with the decline in seasonal payroll taxes and a reduction in variable compensation linked to performance fees earned in the first quarter. These declines were partially offset by a full quarter of higher base salaries that went into affect on March 1. And foreign exchange increase compensation by $1.7 million. Marketing expense increased by $3.3 million or 12% to $30.7 million. FX increased marketing expenses by $0.2 million in the quarter. Property, office, and technology expense were $82.2 million in the second quarter. That was up $4.4 million. This increase was the result of higher property-related expenses, and foreign exchange increased these expenses by $0.3 million. G&A expense came in a little bit higher this quarter at $82.1 million. That represented a $6.9 million increase or 9.2%. The increase in G&A was the result of $3.6 million of additional fund and regulatory costs, as well as higher professional service expenses associated with technology initiatives, which amounted to $2 million. Foreign exchange increased G&A by 0.1 million. Moving on down the page, you'll see the non-operating income decrease $6.7 million compared to the first quarter, and that was largely driven by lower equity and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates. The firm's tax rate on a pretax adjusted net income basis in Q2 was 28.7%, which was consistent with the guidance that we provided in the first-quarter call. Looking forward, our tax rate will return to the lower level of 25.5% to 26.5%. Which you brings us to our adjusted EPS of $0.63 and our adjusted net operating margin of 41.7%. Let me just take a few minutes to discuss Invesco's financial outlook, before turning things back over to Marty. At the end of Q2, clearly negative market sentiments and risk-off behavior on the part of many clients occurred, and that was driven the situations in Greece and China. As a result, as I mentioned, we find ourselves starting the last half of the year at a level of AUM that is, in fact, lower than what we average in Q2, and roughly flat to the average AUM we had across the first half of the year. We continue to believe that Invesco is very well positioned for success, and we face many significant growth opportunities, many of which do require further investment on our part, in order to realize. At the same time, we are aware of our needs to manage our expenses in a disciplined way, especially when markets are particularly volatile and uncertain. So as of today, our expense guidance is still roughly in line with what we discussed with you in the first half of the year. Nothing has changed. However, we will be looking closely at other areas of spend and investment with an eye to prioritize and look at certain non-critical projects and initiatives to see if we can delay certain events, particularly until the market has stabilized. However, on a positive note, in the last half of July, we have seen some improvements in the markets, and a significant positive turn around in the retail sentiment in Europe and our ETF business. In fact, just in the last two weeks of July, we generated more than $1 billion of net inflows. In addition, we continue to see very strong institutional demand across a variety of our investment capabilities, and we would say that should this improvement continue, we do believe that our organic growth rate is on track to meet our plan of 3% to 5% for the year, and our incremental margin target of 50% to 65% is achievable. With that, I will now turn things back over to Marty. Martin Flanagan : Thank you, Loren. Operator, any questions? Operator : We have a first question coming from Michael Carrier, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Michael Carrier : Thanks, guys. Maybe the first question, and maybe for both of you. Loren, maybe just given what you said in terms of the shifting tone and sentiment in July. You mentioned the last two weeks. I don't know if you have a full-month picture, but even more important than that, you gave some color on the institutional pipeline. Just on the retail. When you think about maybe up through April, all the momentum and the progress that you have been seeing versus some of the pull-back that we have seen in the past couple of months, we just want to get a sense on which products continue to work, where you are seeing that demand. In the cross-border, we have seen huge swings early in the quarter versus what we are seeing now. I just wanted to get an update there, since that is a big driver for you. Loren Starr : Michael, I'll answer maybe the first one and Marty you can add whatever. In terms of July, I would say we are roughly flat in July on net flows. So obviously those first two weeks were tough, and they have been completely offset by the last two weeks in July. The daily flows continue to be strongly positive from where we are today. That is the good news. In terms of the products that are absolutely on track and continue to be in high demand, we're seeing alternatives generally as an asset class flow very well. GTR in particular, bank loans, CLOs, alternative fixed income continue to be a very strong provider real estate. Those are going to be continued trends. We're pretty certain that those didn't even really slow down that much. Balanced also continues to be a strong area of growth for us. IBRA, we have got balanced product in EMEA and CE as well. What we really saw was equity. That took the hit from that April - May time frame, and that was around -- very much a target of domestic equity, got hurt pretty bad. UK equities also got hit. China got hit. That was the real element that took the flows away. The things that are still flowing, and we think very positively, that are going to continue to flow, also I did mentioned fixed income, which is another area where we have spent a lot of time and effort and investment to build out our capabilities, and to allow our clients to understand those capabilities. And we're seeing a lot of demand at both retail and institutional for those products. So I'd say, the themes are going to continue. Hopefully the equity element, which was really the part that hurt us is stabilizing, and now we're going to see more continued interest in those products. The ETFs as well, clearly stalled for us for a while, and that was because most of the flows going into ETFs was really centered on either the hedged, foreign exchange hedged product or the international products, which we don't have a presence in nearly to the extent to a sense that some of our competitors do. We have, as I mentioned in my commentary, seen that turn around. Our products are now selling across many of our capabilities in our ATF range. Michael Carrier : That's helpful. And Loren, just on the expenses, it sounds like keening an eye on things, just given the volatility in the market. I think in the past you have given some guidance on the line items, and just particularly the G&A. You called out a couple of items that you have seen maybe were more elevated. But I just want to get some sense going forward where these things should be running, and I hear your comments on keeping an eye on the markets, but just anything that was maybe more noisy this quarter? Loren Starr : I'd say G&A did pop up. There were a lot of things that you would definitely circle as being one-time in nature. Probably somewhere you could easily circle $3 million to $4 million of stuff in G&A that was non-recurring. I think the issue is that -- other things may fall off, but other things may come on. So there is a recurring, non-recurring situation in the G&A. We are managing that line item, looking very closely at it, trying to manage through it, and I would say it's probably at a very elevated level in the second quarter generally, and we would hope to see that number decline from where it is. In terms of giving explicit guidance as to where it lands, harder for us to say exactly where that would be  If I took a swag, I would say somewhere in the $75 million to $80 million range is probably the right level, but it is harder to really manage and forecast that line item, just because there are certain things that are going to be related to product launches or certain needs around regulatory situations, where we're just going to need to spend money to deal with those situations. Michael Carrier : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Glenn Schorr : Thank you. Maybe we could get a little more color on the Asian franchise. I think, I heard your comments on equities in China, but in general, that is $60 billion now. $1.3 billion in positive flows, and I think there was like $7 million in performance fees from the region. If you could just get a high level, what is working, what do you still need to build across Asia, because I think it held up a lot better than people might have thought. Martin Flanagan : Two points. So we look at it as one of the fundamental strengths of the organization. Lots of commentary about China right now, but if you look three to five years, it is a very important place to be. We look at our greater China capabilities, unique. We look at our presence in mainland China as unique, both retail and institutional. And it may go through a challenged period here, but we think we are uniquely positioned there. What I would say is we talked about the institutional business. The leadership in Asia Pacific. The institutional leadership is new this year, very, very strong. We think that, and we are seeing greater results already, which is frankly hard to believe, and we're seeing it in Australia along, also Japan is a very strong institutional market for us, and historically, that's not been the case. We are seeing additional success frankly before I would have thought that was the case institutionally in the region. And again, we're looking for continued positive contributions from that region for us. Loren Starr : I'd say the things that are really working for us, we have seen a lot of demand for fixed income product in Japan. We're seeing a lot of institutional business generally. Australia as well is taking on our GTR product. Real estate continues to be a theme. A lot of things working for us in many different regions within that Asia category. Glenn Schorr : Thank you. Last quarter, you mentioned on the institutional pipeline, the won but not-yet funded was at an all-time high. Any color? I hear you, that the pipeline's good. I'm just curious on how good. Martin Flanagan : It's really at the same level it was last quarter, which is very, very good. I think the question for all of us, and we would -- the uncertainty, I think we'd all have to -- What will institutions do? When will they fund? I think if we're in a stable market, we're going to see the funding of those, which we would anticipate, we don't have any indication otherwise, but we have seen over the years when markets get unsettled, sometimes the institution are low slower to fund it. Won but not funded continues to be at record highs for us. Glenn Schorr : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And we have another question coming from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Ken Worthington : Hopefully I got this right. It looks like you won a larger series of large active US institutional fixed income mandates in the quarter. Generally not an asset class I think of first when I think of Invesco, and I mean no offense there. But can you flush out what is happening, where the mandates are being won, and any color you can provide? Loren Starr : We are seeing it across a broad fixed income, stable value, and we are seeing it both in terms of corporate activity, our Taft-Hartley business. It is spread across a variety of asset classes. The one that we are probably most pleased with is the growth in the corporate side, which has never been necessarily the strongest area we have played in. We continue to add resources to be more meaningful to the corporate clients that we are working with. It's really in broad fixed income and stable value, where the largest wins took place. Martin Flanagan : Ken, just adding to that, if you look add our fixed income performance, it's really very strong. And the client results are frankly sooner than I would have thought, and I think you'll see, we talked in prior years, we thought we were going to miss this whole fixed income cycle, and it was just really making sure we had the capabilities for the next one. That said I would say we're making progress before I thought what would have happened. So it's all very good from my perspective. Ken Worthington : Great. And then maybe my follow-up. Invesco made a large push in product development in marketing into alternative products in the US and Europe over the last 18 months. So the track records are still young and developing, but Q2 would seem to put these products to the test. So the question is how are the products performing? Are they meeting your expectations? And given maybe the change in sentiment, how are conversations evolving with the intermediaries to really sell the products, both in the US and in Europe? Thanks. Martin Flanagan : Very good question, Ken. Our view is that, if you are taking feedback from the clients, the feedback has been quite clear, whether it be retail or institutional, but retail in particular is relatively new, that allocations are going to go from 5% to 15% to 20%. Whether they get that high, who knows, but let's just say they go to 10%. That is just quite an opportunity. We have had the investment capabilities internally, largely for institutions. We, as you know, put probably the broadest range of alternatives into the retail market, beginning at the end of last year. Our view always was, think of no shorter than three years before you're going to get results, because of, as you say, developing the track record and the like. And every once in a while, you get some success before its time. The first one that came on was IBRA. You all know how successful that has been. It continues to be successful. The one that is an early success right now is GTR, and it's in the UK, on the continent, in the United States. Asia, the derivatives component slows that down in that region on a retail basis. So we think it's going very, very well, and it's nice to have another early surprise if you want to call it that, from a client response in GTR. With regard to your question, the volatility of the markets. Did we see disproportionate flow into the alternative bucket on the retail side? We did not. I think that's too early. I think if we continue to have a couple more quarters of this, the intention is going to be there. One limiting component continues to be the distribution channel's ability to get alternatives on their platform. There is high desire, but the mechanics of getting them on the platform are still slow. It's not a criticism, they're just being very, very cautious. Just recently, GTR has been added to a couple of very important platforms here in the United States. That should be a good development in the future. Loren Starr : And just on GTR. The good news is GTR is now at $6.5 billion in terms of AUM, and if you add in the won but not yet funded component, it would be at $9 billion. It really just continues to grow, and again, a very attractive fee rate on that product. Roughly 100 basis points. Good to know. Ken Worthington : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Patrick Davitt of Autonomous. Patrick Davitt : In these past quarters where there was a pretty significant decline in the stock price, you have ramped up your me purchase quite a bit. Didn't really seem like that happened this quarter. Could you walk through the thought process around that, given the weakness in the stock last quarter? Loren Starr : Patrick, I think we have debated internally for some time about how to react to certain market dislocations, and it's always unclear when to go in big, because you have to have a real strong view on the market, and tactically, you can get in and you can do some. We did buy more this quarter than we did last quarter. At the same time, we are still feeding some large products as the large feed capital needs that we need to balance across the buy-back opportunities. And we are still looking to maintain $1 billion in excess of what we have from the regulatory capital perspective. And so there's a balancing act that continues to exist our prioritization of how to use capital. The first call on our capital is always going to be the internal one, in terms of organic needs, which would be the seeding. And so I think given the size of the seeding, this is probably the largest element, in terms of being a little bit more circumspect, doing more on the buyback. We will continue to be very systemic in our buyback. And again, the stock may go up. We're going to continue to buy. Stock may go down, we're going to continue to buy. And so, we have seen our ability to forecast markets as a challenge. And it's probably better on our part to be more systematic as opposed to trying to time the markets in a big way. Patrick Davitt : More broadly it seems every day now there is either a regulator or a press article talking about bond liquidity. And you always enter that conversation, given your size in the bank loan markets. Curious if all of that kind of noise is bleeding into your conversations with clients, and to what extent you feel like that conversation is going positively for you? Martin Flanagan : It's a good question. Look, I think when you read the public commentary generally in the papers, it's too shallow of a commentary, quite frankly, the thing to say. Money managers, including ourselves have been constructing portfolios for decades. It's the fundamental strength of what we do as an industry. In portfolio construction, you are always looking at liquidity needs and the like, and there's an assumption in the paper that if you are in bank loans, you have 100% in illiquid, hard to trade bank loans, and it is just false. So if you look at the combination of our bank loan products or others, there is a high liquidity component to it. There are back-up lines of credit. The clients absolutely understand that, it's just the public commentary doesn't. But I will say the industry is working things like shortening settlement periods and the like in bank loan markets and doing the things that we should, just to continue to make the markets more efficient, more effective for the benefit of our clients. That is our perspective on it. Patrick Davitt : Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from Bill Katz of Citi. Bill Katz : So just trying to run the math a little bit, if you're feeling pretty good about the 3% to 5% organic growth rate and July is basically a push, and we know the first half of the year. It would suggest the theme here is the institutional business is doing pretty well, but the thrust of the question is, I think you have to have some pretty big numbers coming through in the second half of the year. Are you at a point now where you are starting to really take advantage of scaling some of the products? Obviously, you gave the disclosure on GTR terms. But just more broadly, one of the pushbacks has always been, oh you have a lot of small funds, but nothing that is really sizable. Do you think you're at a nice inflection point now where you are starting to scale some really scalable assets globally? Martin Flanagan : It's a good question, Bill. You get scale by doing good things for clients, and I think you start by if you look at our performance, it's really very strong. That said, you have to do something about it. We, as a firm, for the last couple of years in particular, have refocused again on taking those capabilities that can become offered globally to clients and taken to clients globally, and that is what we have done and that's what you're starting to see, whether it was risk parity, GTR, bank loans, real estate. So that is an absolute focus of the firm, where it makes sense to do that, and we have been making progress, and we are focused on accelerating that progress. And I think you're seeing that. Loren Starr : The opportunity around the products that have global demand, whether it's IBRA or GTR or some of the bond products, that is absolutely what we're focused on, and I'd say we're making progress. It's not something where for fixed income we said it is happening faster than we thought, actually, but we're probably not at a level where you would say we're at the same scale of some of our larger competitors. But again, we value the diversification, too. I make that point, that we don't want to be probably as large as our competitors in certain products. We like to have a series of diversified capabilities, all that work on a global basis. Bill Katz : That's helpful. And I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that the regulatory pressures are building in terms of the costs. Is that idiosyncratic to Invesco, or is that more of an industry dynamic? Where are you seeing it? And then if you still feel pretty good about the incremental margin range and we know the GA, does that suggest there's a little more operating leverage on comp from here? Martin Flanagan : Let me take the first part. The regulatory thing, it is hitting everybody. Not like the banks, but we think it's quite overwhelming, the amount of regulations that have come this way. Where it's hitting the most, so again, it will depend on if the firm is global or not. If you are a global firm, the UK was probably the most dramatic in its change and its regulatory environment and the demands on a firm, the investments we have made around that are material. You also have impacts of things like RDR and what does that do. We have talked about that over the years. We thought we would be a winner. We are a winner in it, but by the way, you have to make changes along the way. The continent is another area where again, much more complex regulation impacting the business and the like. Yes, we're spending money. But what I would say too, it also increases the barriers to entry, which I think, that is fine for us. It's probably too bad for the market. But longer term, the bigger stronger firms that can make investments will, and will frankly probably do better than the mid-sized smaller firms. You come to the United States, we have had again, an awful lot of regulation come out. It wouldn't be to the same magnitude there. I think some have paid close attention to, which you have all have is, what happens with the fiduciary rule. That could have some incredibly negative consequences ultimately to all of our clients. Well-intended, but currently proposed, not very thoughtful. That said, we think we are going to be one of those firms that is quite well positioned if some version of this rule comes out. I think others are going to be at quite a disadvantage. It really is an influence on businesses like I have not seen in my career, and we do feel that we can take advantage of opportunities that emerge as business models get changed through the regulatory dynamics. Loren Starr : To answer the last part of your question, Bill, the answer is yes. It's leverage on all the line items. We are seeing with the now renewed strong growth in cross-border flows in EMEA, for example, that the trend on the fee rate should be more positive. FX has improved slightly as well, which is again very important in terms of getting that operating leverage in some of our most scaled products. I think those elements will help, and as you know, our compensation line item is probably most strongly driven by investment performance. It's probably reasonably stable, so there isn't sort of a sense of large needs to change compensation. For those reasons, we think that 50% to 65% opportunity on incremental margin is there, as long as the trend comes back, or it continues, where we are seeing the flows come back in the most important places. Bill Katz : Okay. Thank you for taking both of my questions. Operator : Our next question coming from Eric Berg of RBC Capital Markets. Eric Berg : Marty and Loren, why do you think there is such a bifurcation, such a difference between the behavior of institutions and individuals during the quarter? And by that, I mean if one pieces together the different pieces of information that you are giving us, and the different tables that show the flow of assets, it looks like it was a fixed income-led, institutional-led, US-lead advance. And active advance. And there wasn't nearly as much retail activity, and I should say fixed income and alternatives. But so heavily institutional. What is your sense, obviously, you can't get into the heads up of individual investors everywhere. That's impossible, but from talking to your colleagues and distributors, what is your best sense of why there is such a difference of behavior by retail investors and institutions? Martin Flanagan : That is a really good question. I think this is something we have all studied over our careers here, and for all the education that we all try to put into the market with clients, et cetera, not just us, but distributors, consultants and the like, you continue to have different behaviors. Institutions, frankly, do a better job of being consistent in investing for the long term. And I think what you have seen on the retail side, the bigger element probably, I don't have this number exactly in front of me was not so much redemptions as much as retail investors stopping. Instead of making the decision I'm going to put more money into -- I'm committed to this monthly investment plan into my US equity capability, they are until they're not. I think they get really scared with what was going on in Greece and what was going on in China and even with advisors, and I think advisors are really, really important for our retail clients, the idea of just holding off is very, very common. And it is as simple as that, but it was pronounced. Eric Berg : If I could ask another high level question to you, Marty. During the course of this call, we have talked about all of the many businesses in which Invesco competes, other than active equity investing. We've talked about risk parity, global total return, bank loans, other alternatives, real estate, and so forth. My sense is that there is a view in this business by many people who follow it that somehow active equity vesting is the holy grail, it's a good business, and that everything else, especially fixed income, is not as good. What are the merits of that, whether people believe that? What is the truth about your business? By that, I mean that as Invesco transitions to these other businesses in many quarters, other than active equities, is that a good thing? Should I feel good about it, should I feel bad about it, or indifferent? Martin Flanagan : Good question. So here's our answer. So it gets to the comment that I made earlier. Every single client, whether retail or individual, has a unique set of investment objectives, and you can get there through a variety of ways to meet their outcomes. What we are committed to, and how we have built the firm is having a broad range of investment capability to meet those needs. High conviction capabilities, whether they are active or passive. So when we talk about passive, we believe in smart data. It is a better data, and you get better information for your clients. The combination thereof is how we think we can generate the results for our clients over time. I can't pass on my individual judgment on how somebody should build their portfolio. That said, I'll put on my personal advice. Over time, always, active management will give you the greatest returns for the level of risk of investment. That is a fact. That is not common wisdom right now, because the period we have come out from 2009 on, and the bounce off the bottom, three rounds of QE, et cetera, et cetera. It is an absolute mistake to be giving up on active equity investing. And I will say you go cap weighted passive investing, the best you can do is an average, minus fees. I don't think that is how you serve your clients best. Loren Starr : And Eric, just on the purely Invesco-specific financial point, the margins on those capabilities, fixed income or alternatives, are certainly as good as what we have seen in active equity. So there isn't a financial give-up in terms of us moving from one active class to another, particularly as long as we have scale and those capabilities. Martin Flanagan : I come back, Eric, just to make the point. Our view is if you are looking to invest in Invesco, our absolute focus is on our clients first, and we think if you do a good job for clients and you run a disciplined business, Invesco is going to do really, really well. I think that is really an important thing to understand, too. Eric Berg : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from Daniel Fannon of Jefferies. Daniel Fannon : My question is again on the institutional side. Just curious with the strength you are seeing there, are you having success cross-selling to existing institutional clients, or are these new relationships mostly? Just trying to get a sense of kind of the breadth? Martin Flanagan : Quite frankly, many of them are new. And frankly, an area that we are focused on to improve is having a greater number of relationships with each of our institutional clients. Not just what's in, but a number of them are multinationals and just doing a better job of serving them around the world. And again, we think we are one of very few organizations that can do that, so we look at that as an opportunity for us. Daniel Fannon : Great. And then just also, just thinking about the backdrop, volatility, and what that presents potentially opportunistically for you. Has your views around M&A changed at all? Do you think about potentially being more aggressive in a market like this, where maybe some peers or others aren't in as good a position as you are? Martin Flanagan : Our views haven't changed. The criteria is still focused on what are the skill gaps, or product gaps that we are missing, and that is the first criteria. We try to build them first internally, but again, I wouldn't say we're there. In challenged markets, it's amazing what presents itself, and again, we're not there, but we're not -- we'll just have to see what happens. Daniel Fannon : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from Luke Montgomery of Bernstein. Luke Montgomery : So coming to the ETF business, you have got a foothold there. It's a number four position. Still a small fraction of the overall market, and fairly concentrated for you by AUM flows in a few products. But you have talked a lot about growing the platform with smart data. Seems like more and more of your competitors are talking about it, too. I thought perhaps you could speak to whether you feel, if you have a comfortable lead in the race here. What your competitive advantages are, and whether you think there's a first advantage in some of these product ideas. Any thoughts on that competitive landscape? Martin Flanagan : I think others coming into it, just verifies that it's a good idea, and that there is -- that it's a good thing for clients. So the others coming in, we think that's a good thing. There is absolutely, in the ETF market, in particular, first mover advantage. Very differently than institutional mandates or another retail mutual fund. So product development becomes very important and it's really, what, two or three of the same products, and that really takes up the shelf space. And so being first or second really matters in that. And we also think our competitive advantage in smart data is that if you look at our product range, it's the broadest smart data product range out there. It's also the oldest. When you start to look at track records, you're not doing models and looking backwards, it is the product range that has the longest experience in the marketplace, and that is valuable over time. So coming new into the market, you are disadvantaged by those facts. Luke Montgomery : Thanks, and then coming back to the fiduciary rule, I think most of the focus has been on how this impacts intermediaries. There's been a little bit of talk about how this could be more challenging for bundled defined contribution providers, but at least in my view, it seems rarely supported by anything specific in the legislation, that would accelerate any of the pressures that already existed or introduce any new pressures. As you think about the opportunity in DCIO, any thoughts on how the rule changes the competitive landscape for the legacy providers? Martin Flanagan : Yes, it's a good question, and I think everybody is searching exactly for what the right answer is. I think if it does go through in its current form, which I doubt, because it is absolutely unworkable and it does any number of things, but if it did, I think it would be quite unsettling to the whole marketplace. It would put a value on size, which could be, quite frankly one of those catalysts for combinations that you would not have imagined previously. It also, in some of the support commentary, it is very specific in sending people towards types of investment strategies, types of investment products, types of vehicles, that will clearly have unintended consequences for investors. We have the unique position from being in the United Kingdom, and with RDR and there's corollaries there. So trying to create purity is a wonderful goal, but what you have seen in the United Kingdom is individual investors. There are more people not taking advice right now because of RDR, and their total cost has gone up. I believe you're going to have that same type of thing here. The people that most need advice won't get advice, and they'll be disadvantaged by the whole process. So it's hard to answer the question until we know what comes out at the other end. But as currently, I think it would be quite disruptive. Luke Montgomery : Okay, thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from Brennan Hawken of UBS. Brennan Hawken : First off, congrats on the quarter, particularly in what has proven to be a really difficult and challenging environment for a bunch of your peers. So I just had one question left at this point. You highlighted that towards the tail end of July, volatility in Europe is subsiding. Now that you are seeing flows and trends come back, what is different in recent experience versus earlier in the year, or is it just a return to the products that were popular, and working before? And is there any difference between retail and institutional. Just some color from there would be helpful. Loren Starr : It feels largely like a return to the previous part of the year as opposed to some new trend emerging that is different from what we saw before. Maybe there's a little less interest in corporate bond product than we saw before still, but that is being offset by some other products, that fixed income, long-dated corporate fixed income, maybe less so. That is about the only thing that I can point to that feels a little bit different. Brennan Hawken : And then one small one. There was a little noise around New York tax in the quarter. Is that going to have any impact on the tax rate going forward? Loren Starr : No. It was just a one-time situation that is no longer going to affect our P&L. Brennan Hawken : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from Michael Kim from Sandler O'Neill. Michael Kim : A little bit more about the opportunities you see to leverage the breadth of product across the franchise, to build customized offerings across both active and passive strategies, as well as maybe other alternative quantitative or allocation services, and I know it's still relatively early days, but any early read into relative economics of what I would assume would be chunkier mandates, if you will? Martin Flanagan : And you got cut off at the beginning, but I think I got the gist of it. It's really -- the question around solutions and how do you put together the various capabilities. It is an area that we are very, very focused on. I would say we're early days of success. It depends on where in the world, probably -- opportunities are probably greatest at the moment for us in Asia, probably in China in particular. We're also seeing it on the continent. We also believe there should also be an opportunity here in the United States. It has just been relatively slower in those two regions. Loren Starr : And early read on relative economics of chunkier mandates. We have seen no change in terms of the attractiveness of the mandates that will stay around stable value. The broad fixed income was one where we don't have as much scale, and so it's improving significantly as we generate more AUM in that category. So that's the two big movers. In terms of GTR, the economics are excellent, similar to what we see across the cross-border range, so rates tend to be at the high end. So other than that, I think we have sort of discussed the other elements. They are all at margins that are very attractive to -- should be attractive and accretive to our margin overall. Michael Kim : Got it. That's helpful. And then, just in terms of some of the newer vehicles we are seeing on the actively-managed ETF front, just given your market presence with power shares and as you communicate with your client, how important is non-transparent actively managed ETFs? Is that something that investors are really looking for, or is transparency in terms of portfolio holdings not really that high on the list for your clients? Martin Flanagan : The conversation has been going on for some period of time. And if you remember, we have introduced two or three active ETFs five or six years ago. We were one of the firms ahead of the exemption. And I think I have said in the past, we still have them. They might have $3 million in them across the board, and it's probably our CTFO. Loren Starr : And those are transparent. Martin Flanagan : Those are transparent. So again, I'm just a big believer that at the end of the day, people don't invest in vehicles, per se. They invest in investment strategies first to meet their desired outcomes. The mutual fund vehicle is a spectacular vehicle for a long-term investors, and we all know the disclosure period on and the like, we have just not seen a lot of demand for non-transparent ETFs from our client base. And some of the things that we look at, the things we are pointed to of the advantages, we think that you can solve any of those through share classes within mutual funds, too. That said, we are indifferent because we could do active ETFs ourselves, we have our existing ETFs and mutual funds. So we're just really -- we study it, and we're capable, but we're just not seeing demand, which is very counter to the commentary that you might be reading in the papers. Michael Kim : Got it. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Next question coming from Robert Lee of KBW. Robert Lee : Thanks. Most of my questions have been asked, but I did have one. This hasn't come up on your calls in a while, but relating to a potential M&A. You have done most of your product building in house for the last several years post the -- I can't remember the name of the acquisition. The Morgan Stanley acquisition. Haven't really done much, and you have talked about it being a low priority. But I am just curious as you went through the product build-out cycle, have a lot of oars in the water, so to speak. Is there anything that as you've gone through that, you've said, gee we would have liked to have built this, and we just, for whatever reason, maybe it wasn't a capability we thought we could do, and does that at all kind of shape your thoughts about maybe going back and looking at some M&A here and there? Obviously maybe nothing large, but just your updated thoughts on that. Martin Flanagan : Good question. They have not changed too much. I think you're right, and as Loren has said and we have said, we first look to advance the business looking internally, organic development, and that is what we have done. If you look at the range of capabilities right now, we don't see a lot of gaps, and during that process, we thought the gaps we had, we did solve internally so we don't see gaps right now. That said, that's continuing why it puts M&A on the back burner, because we look to M&A when we can solve the problem with the capabilities that we have. Where we have done it though, Rob, it's more in India, that was a market that look over at a very long term, a good thing to do when we saw a way to get into India, and a relatively small investment, and we think it's a good investment over the long term. So it was more country than capabilities. But as I said earlier on the call, nothing looks obvious at all right now. That said, if the market does get very challenging, it's amazing what pops up in those periods, but it's not apparent at this time. Robert Lee : All right. That was all I had. Thanks for taking my question. Operator : Thank you. And we have another question coming from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : A couple of quick questions. One is on the alt and distribution. You mentioned earlier in the conversation that there is a high bar on the distributor side to accept alts. At least, that is my read of what you said. I am just wondering what is there for it, and is it simply a matter of time and performance over time to prove out, to get on platforms, or is there other things going on? Martin Flanagan : So I think it's a good question. The reality, is although the desire is there, it's complicated; right? So really the distributors are working through a mechanism of what do they want on the platform? How do they get it on the platform? Education into the sales force is critical. There's a lot of focus on making sure -- suitability and so these are -- to me, those will all really good developments. We don't want to be on a platform, and none of us want a bad outcome for our clients, so it has really been educating sales force. What are they trying to accomplish? What are the distributors saying? What capabilities do we have confidence in from the money manager, and so that's really what slowed it down. There are just a handful of alternative capabilities on the various platforms. We probably have as many as anybody in the market. Betsy Graseck : Right. Martin Flanagan : I think it will change though. I think it will pick up the pace as people get more confident. Betsy Graseck : So it's dedicated sales team into distributors, as well as just helping them understand the various products? Martin Flanagan : Yes. To be clear, I am also saying the distributors themselves, like a Morgan Stanley are spending a huge amount of time on education for the sales force there. Betsy Graseck : Right. Martin Flanagan : They want them very focused on suitability. It's jointly solving that problem. That is really the element where it's taking an awful lot of time. Betsy Graseck : I got it. Martin Flanagan : I think it's appropriate, by the way. Betsy Graseck : Right, okay. And then separately. There has been -- a know your customer requirement, regulatory requirement in the asset management community as well. I think it's called FATCA. I'm wondering if that had any implications for flows, not only in this quarter but into the next couple of quarters, because I thought it went live July 1, and I was wondering if that was something that you could benefit from? Loren Starr : As far as I know, we have been working on FATCA for two years now. It has not been anything that has surfaced in any of our conversations with any of our distributors or regions about clients being somehow disturbed or displaced or acting differently than they otherwise would. So at least from where I sit today and what I have heard, it's sort of been a non-event. It's probably been a lot of work, but it's not created a different demand behavior. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from Chris Shutler of William Blair. Chris Shutler : The long term net inflows continued to average somewhere in the mid to upper single digit billions per quarter, so quite encouraging. Just looking out over the next couple of years, recognizing it's tough to predict, but what do you think are the biggest opportunities and risks to that range from an asset class product perspective? I certainly recognize that part of your value proposition is having that diversification to be where the demand is, but I just wanted to get your take there. Martin Flanagan : I think the biggest opportunity for us is people coming back to equities. It has been a long time, and I think they will. You can go back to the same percentages because of demographics, and et cetera, et cetera. That said, if you look at us as a firm, it's the historic strength of the firm, it is the broadest range of capabilities. When you get any active movement back into active equities, it is going to be quite a difference for us. What is the risk? You get into a very difficult bear market right now, and that could extend that outcome for quite a period of time. That said, everything we have been talking about today is the other side of -- it's a broad range of capabilities that puts us into an easy position. Chris Shutler : And Loren, you mentioned that, it sounded like maybe you are pulling back on a little bit of spending here. What are you maybe delaying in terms of project spending, and what magnitude of dollars are we talking about? Thanks. Loren Starr : It's an active discussion right now, so we are not at a point where I would say we would provide any different guidance than what we have in the past. As I said, our current guidance is pretty much in line with what we said before. It's going to be more of a discussion as we continue look, are we in a really turnaround, where flows are coming back. I'd just say it's one that we are looking at day-to-day. In terms things that you could be delayed, there's certainly things that are prioritized and delayed, relative to other things you absolutely have to do because of client need or a regulatory need. That is the kind of thing that we are looking at, is could you delay three months or six months and not really affect clients in a regulatory situation. Chris Shutler : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we have a last question coming from Gregory Warren of Morningstar. Gregory Warren : Yes, thanks for taking my questions, although a lot of them have already been asked here. I may have missed it, but we talked about the fixed income flows being heavily influenced by some institutional mandates. Was that the same case for the balance, because that looked to spike up during the quarter? Loren Starr : Well, the balance -- we saw a lot of interest in balance. That was really a continuation of interest in Europe. We have a very well-performing balance product that is managed out of our industrial perpetual team combines the capabilities of our equity teams and our fixed income teams. We also saw a lot of interest in balanced product in China. And in the balance category, we also have IBRA, which we have talked about institutionally has been of great interest and we're winning some good interest there. Gregory Warren : You had mentioned the fact that the organic growth target on long-term assets is between that 3% and 5% range for the year. Do you just have a bit more clarity? Is there more institutional stuff in the pipeline? I think right now we are sitting in the 2% to 2.5% range. Loren Starr : I think we absolutely see interest in the big institutional pipeline, as Marty said, all-time high plus, with retail coming back. Obviously, July was a bit of a lost month, and we are making good headway, but if we stay -- even if we stay at this $2 billion a quarter, sorry, $2 billion a month type of rate, we're going to be at that -- probably at 4%, just doing the math myself. So I think we're -- and I also think we can do better than that. Gregory Warren : That's good to hear. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank do you. As of right now, we don't have any more questions on queue. Martin Flanagan : Thank you very much, and thank you, everybody for joining Loren and myself, and have a good rest of the day. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Welcome to Invesco's Third Quarter Results Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I'd like to turn the call over to the speakers for today, Mr. Martin Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco, and Mr. Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Thank you very much and thank you for joining us today. I'm on the call with Loren Starr, our CFO, and we'll be speaking to the presentation that's available on the website, if you're so inclined to follow. Today, as we typically do, we'll review the business results for the third quarter. Loren will then go into greater detail on the financials, and the two of us will then answer any questions you all might have. So let me begin by highlighting the firm's operating results for the quarter, and you'll find that on slide three, if you're following it along. Long-term investment performance remained strong during the quarter, 73% and 83% of actively managed assets were ahead of peers over three years and five years respectively. Strong investment performance and continued focus on meeting clients' needs were not enough to offset the impacts of the volatile market, and a single large institutional client withdrawal, which resulted in net long-term outflows of $3.9 billion for the quarter. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 41.4% versus 41.7% in the prior quarter. The quarterly dividend remains at $0.27 per share, which is up 8% over the prior year. We also returned $292 million back to shareholders during the quarter through a combination of stock buybacks and dividends. Assets under management were $755 billion at the end of the quarter, down from $803 billion in the prior quarter. Operating income was $373 million in the quarter; this was down from $390 million in the prior quarter, but roughly in line with the operating income in the first quarter of this year. Earnings per share were $0.61, down $0.63 from the prior quarter. We repurchased $176 million of stock during the quarter. Before Loren goes into details on the financials, let me take a minute and review the investment performance, that's on slide six. Our commitment to investment excellence and our work to build and maintain strong investment culture help maintain solid long-term investment performance across the organization during the quarter. Looking at the firm as a whole, 73% of assets were in the top half on a three-year basis, and 83% were in the top half on a five-year basis. The one-year number results partially reflect increased exposure to energy by certain of our equity teams, who also during the quarter took the opportunity to make investments in those positions, which positioned very well for the future. The results also reflect our European corporate fixed income portfolios, which short in duration during the period in corporate bonds to position themselves again for a continued long-term success. Our investors are taking advantage of the short-term market dislocation for the benefit of the long-term results for clients. I'm highly confident our clients will continue to benefit from this high conviction approach to investing. On page seven, you'll see active flows reflect the macro environment during the quarter as investors reacted to volatility in the markets. Within ETFs 60% year-to-date net flows have come from international ETFs, and 50% of the international flows have come from currency hedge products to areas where we do not have an offering. This narrowing of client demand impacted demand for passive capabilities in the short-term year-to-date. Also, during the third quarter, specifically traditional cap-weighted ETFs captured 80% of the net flows, again, an area that we do not focus on. So the combination of these is a unique, abnormal thing that we've seen. We suspect it's short-term in nature. We saw positive institutional flows during the quarter in spite of the volatile markets, and a large single institutional client withdrawal. We view this withdrawal as an isolated event. Retail flows were impacted by the macro environment, as investors weighed their options during the volatile quarter. We did see continued strength in number of asset classes, asset categories and \u2013 Global Total Return, European Equity, Investment Grade Fixed Income, Diversified Dividend to name a few. Additionally, it's early in the fourth quarter, but quarter-to-date, we have net flows of about $700 million and in the different areas, we've seen ETFs come back quite strongly. Traditional ETFs, net inflows are about $1 billion in total, about $2.1 billion from the QQQs, which is more interesting from a market \u2013 investors' sentiment point of view. Core retail flows continue to be challenged, but we're expecting them to be better than they were in the month of September. Asia Pac, EMEA continue to be in net flows. In the institutional pipeline of one, but not funded remain near all-time historic highs. We feel good about the results of the quarter, continued strong investment performance. Our focus on meeting client needs contributed to solid operating results, despite what we saw in the markets. We continue to see strength across the global business, in particular within Asia Pac, EMEA and the institutional business globally. Our focus remains on strengthening our efforts to deliver strong long-term investment performance that help clients meet their investment objectives and running a very sound, good business. With our comprehensive range of capabilities and broadly diversified business, we believe we are well-positioned to succeed over the long-term, regardless of where the markets take us in the short-term. That said, we continue to see numerous short-term opportunities which will advance our business. Given the strength of our capabilities and the disciplined manner in how we run our business, we believe we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of these opportunities, including, for example, ETFs after investing in the institutional business globally, alternatives and solutions, to name a few. Now I'll turn the call over to Loren so he can review the financials before we answer your questions. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Thanks very much, Marty. Quarter-over-quarter, total AUM decreased $47.8 billion or 5.9%, this was driven by foreign exchange translation of $5.9 billion, long-term net outflows of $3.9 billion and a negative market return of $35.6 billion combined with outflows from money market and from the QQQs of $1.5 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively. Average AUM for the third quarter was $788.9 billion, which was down 2.7% versus the second quarter. Our net revenue yield was 45.8 basis points, a decrease of 0.4 basis points versus Q2. Other revenues accounted for the decline of 0.5 basis points and a change in mix reduced the yield by 0.1 basis points. These are offset by an increase in performance fees in the quarter, which added 0.2 basis points. Now turning to the operating results. You'll see that net revenues declined by $33.6 million or 3.6% quarter-over-quarter to $903 million, which includes a negative FX rate impact of $1.4 million. Within the net revenue number, you'll see that investment management fees fell by $45.2 million or 4.2% to $1.04 billion. This reflects the lower average AUM during the quarter. And FX decreased third quarter management fees by $1.8 million. Service and distribution revenues decreased by $4.8 million or 2.2%, also in line with lower average AUM during the quarter. FX reduced service and distribution revenues by $0.5 million. Performance fees in the quarter came in at $17.6 million and they were earned from a variety of different investment capabilities, including $9.4 million from UK equities. Foreign exchange decreased performance fees by $0.1 million. Other revenues in the third quarter were $27.6 million, and that was a drop of $10.3 million due to lower transaction fees from real estate and UIT activities. Foreign exchange decreased other revenues by $0.1 million. Third-party distribution, service and advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues, fell by $22.2 million or 5.3%. The movement was in line with the lower revenues derived from retail AUM, and foreign exchange decreased these expenses by $1.1 million. Moving on down the slide. You'll see that our adjusted operating expenses at $529.6 million declined by $16.8 million or 3.1% relative to the second quarter. FX decreased operating expenses by $1.6 million during the quarter. Employee compensation came in at $346.9 million, a decrease of $4.5 million or 1.3%. The decrease was due to a reduction in variable compensation for the quarter. FX decreased compensation by $0.9 million. Looking forward, assuming AUM flat to current levels, we'd expect compensation to run between $340 million and $345 million for the fourth quarter. Marketing expenses decreased by $4.9 million or 16% to $25.8 million. The decline was driven by seasonally lower expenditures for advertising, literature, travel and client events. FX decreased marketing expenses by $0.1 million in the quarter. Marketing costs will ramp back up in Q4 as it usually does, coming in somewhere, we believe, between $32 million and $35 million. Property, office and technology expenses were $79.9 million in the quarter, which was down $2.3 million. The decrease was the result of reduced property-related expenses and lower outsourced administration costs in EMEA. FX decreased these expenses by $0.2 million. In Q4, we'd expect property, office and technology to be around $80 million to $83 million. G&A expenses at $77 million decreased $5.1 million or 6.2%. The decrease in G&A was a result of non-recurring fund and regulatory costs in the prior quarter, as well as lower professional services expenses. FX decreased G&A by $0.4 million. Our Q4 G&A expense, we believe, should be in the range of $77 million to $80 million. Continuing on down the page. You'll see that non-operating income decreased $15.8 million compared to the second quarter. The third quarter had unrealized mark-to-market losses on our trading investments and on our consolidated sponsored investment products compared to gains that we saw in the prior quarter. The firm's effective tax rate on pre-tax adjusted net income in Q2 was 26.5%, down from 28.7% in the second quarter and consistent with the guidance that we provided in the second quarter call, which then brings us to our adjusted EPS at $0.61 and our adjusted net operating margin at 41.4%. And, with that, I'm going to turn things back over to Marty. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Operator, can we take questions, please? Operator : Yes, sir. Our first question coming from Michael Carrier of Bank of America. Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Thanks, guys. Marty, maybe first just on the flow trend in the quarter, but then probably more importantly the outlook. You mentioned on the institutional side the pipeline being really strong. I just want to get a sense on the retail side. Obviously, the quarter was pretty volatile. Given your guys' exposure both in the U.S. and then outside the U.S., just some of the trends that you're seeing, some of the products that are still gaining some traction or there's still demand for versus the areas where you've seen the let up. And then you mentioned like the October trends. But what do you see shifting? Particularly the areas where you feel like the performance is still there and in a more volatile environment there's going to be demand. Just want to try to get a sense of which products can work in this environment. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: So more retail focus, was that right? Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Yeah, because it sounds like the institutional was good. If you had that, the lumpy amount or the one institutional outflow number, that too. But just wanted to get a sense on the outlook. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Good question. So what we're seeing, and I can't speak for other organizations, but it really has been moving very rapidly. September being a very volatile quarter in particular. Where you saw it impact the most I would say would be the U.S. retail business and even not just mutual funds, but ETFs. It was a really different environment. It feels like it's changing already in October and we're seeing that, as I said, sentiment. You're seeing traditional ETFs again really looking quite strong for us. And, again, I used QQQs as an example of follow that for sentiment. That was actually pretty strong. Where the flow is, you're seeing it still in things like Diversified Dividend. I think it's confidence, international equities and the like. But I think as confidence comes in, there's a broad range of things that I think could work. I will say what's also interesting is the broad range of retail alternatives that we have perform extremely well during this period. So things like GTR and the like, again, you test those things in these periods. And so that would be an area within the U.S. Outside, as you frankly, Loren and I, we're in Frankfurt, Germany now, and so you really get a pulse on the ground. The retail business continues to really look strong. Europe Equities actually in particular, is sort of a core retail focus here, has been an area, and also Asia Pac retail is back in net flows. And it tends to be pretty broad, but it feels like, again, it's early, but confidence seem to be coming back more quickly in Europe and in Asia than in the United States in the retail market. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. And then I would also just \u2013 a couple points too on flows. The other thing around flows, I think there's about $700 million of the institutional outflows that was just related to fundings in, or dispositions \u2013 sorry, in real estate. So that's good news. I mean it's also a part of the process, as we sort of provide returns to our shareholders. So it had nothing to do with performance. It's really just part of a lifecycle of some of these funds. The things that are really showing up in October more recently, and we're seeing good positive flow activity in October to-date, is around GTR. We're seeing Pan European Equities continue to flow nicely. It continues to be of interest. Fixed income is a very strong driver, generally both on the retail in the U.S., as well as outside of the U.S. So it's sort of broad-based in terms of what's coming back in October, and certainly Marty mentioned it, but it's important, the ETFs are backed significantly, the traditional ones, which were an outflow. We're now seeing strong inflows close to $1 billion of continued inflows, and that's across a variety of different capabilities within the ETF spectrum. Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks for the color. And then just as a follow-up, Loren, just on the guidance that you gave, I think you mentioned the comp in that range. Obviously, the markets are a bit stronger than maybe flat for the AUM. So, any color on that. And on the revenue, just given the volatility that we saw this quarter, maybe relative to the expectations and performance fees and other, kind of any color on the outlook? I know both are tough to gauge, but just any sense. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: The comp estimates were based on sort of current asset levels as of today. So we're in that \u2013 a little bit above $790 billion in AUM. Obviously, that could go up or down depending on day-to-day activity. But it's sort of based on current levels... Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Got it. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: ...which is obviously above where we ended in September. So I think again, management around it are sort of comp-based and expenses will be in line with what you'd expect. In terms of the revenue outlooks and performance fees, traditionally are not seeing sort of one area produced performance fees in the fourth quarter, and so again, we would probably tend to sort of guide conservatively in that space for Q4, but it probably, without knowing much, we're talking about $5 million, something like that. The other issue on other revenues; definitely saw a slowdown in Q3, just given the volatility of what was going on, that happened around transaction fees. We could see a pickup on that line item in Q4, could get it back to the $30 million, $35 million range in Q4. Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks a lot. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from Luke Montgomery of Bernstein Research. Luke Montgomery - Bernstein Research : Hey, good morning, guys. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Hey. Luke Montgomery - Bernstein Research : Just on the operating margin, I think, you speak to incremental margins in the 65% range. Average AUM was down about, I think, 3% on a period end, 6% on an average basis. Revenue was down 4%, and yet the margin held in really well. So I guess, I'm wondering, how we think about incremental margins on the downside. It seems like you've been pretty successful at controlling comp in spite of I think some significant head count growth over the last couple years. So I'm not sure what that says about your ability to ramp it down in lower markets. And then maybe how we think about other expense levers to pull in lower markets. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: I think we would \u2013 as we've said in the past, and I'll obviously reiterate again. In a declining revenue situation it's just hard, it's next to impossible to \u2013 smartly to have expenses go down in line with revenue declines. We saw this a little bit in advance in the quarter, and we might have even talked a little bit about it in \u2013 at our last call. But we ultimately did put out some signals within the business to try to slow things down, think about prioritizing our investments within the quarter, because we just didn't know what it was going to \u2013 what was going to happen. And so I think \u2013 we were successful in terms of holding off certain discretionary elements of our spending in the quarter. We gave some guidance obviously to the fourth quarter. Some of those expenses are sort of going to be in line with this last quarter, but perhaps up a little bit. I mean, there are investments that we continue to need to make, want to make, which will help improve our success and positioning strategically going forward. Again, with that said, we're going to continue to work really hard to \u2013 think about our investments, and we'll continue to watch the volatility of the assets. And so the pressure is still on internally in terms of thinking about, how to be smart around our investments, just given the uncertainty of our revenues and AUM. So we can't really, sort of say, we're doing a better job now. I think we're doing a good job as we've always done, in light of volatile markets where we're trying to sort of pause and take a breather on certain investments that can be paused without doing much damage. Luke Montgomery - Bernstein Research : Okay, thanks. And then just a technical question about how you mark AUM for FX. Is it once at the end of the quarter? Is it month-end or some kind of daily average approach? Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: It's done monthly. Luke Montgomery - Bernstein Research : Okay. Thank you very much. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: I just do want to reiterate Loren's comments. We have \u2013 we are, as we always have, very focused on running a thoughtful business, and we're always looking to what we call create capacity to continue to invest. And we just see that there are a number of areas where we think we can continue to create an advantage for us, and our clients, whether it'd be in ETF, that we're investing global institutional businesses we've been talking about, alternative solution. So we're working that balance very diligently, and we will continue to do that. Luke Montgomery - Bernstein Research : Thank you. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt of Autonomous. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Hi, good morning. Historically, when you ramped up repurchases like you did in the third quarter, it's kind of been a one quarter or two quarter event. I guess, could you kind of speak to how you're thinking about the sustainability of this level, or is it purely just where the price is? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. So look, we do like the approach that we've had. We think we have strengthened the financial position of the firm, while at the same time focus on these capital returns. Where the stock is priced, you just can't help, but buy in the stock, and it looks like still where the stock is right now, we think it's very, very attractive. And probably something seem more consistent this quarter to what you saw last quarter. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Okay, thanks. And then just to clarify, the $700 million, did that include or exclude the QQQs? Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: That excludes it. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Okay. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: The QQQs were, like, $2 billion \u2013 $2.1 billion, and the traditional ones were close to $1 billion. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Hi, Craig. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): So we ran the new guidance numbers, and it looks like the adjusted margin may dip down into the 39% range versus the strong 41% result this quarter. And I realize you didn't provide any adjusted operating margin guidance today, but would you make any additional steps to protect the margin in 4Q if it trended down into the 49% range? Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: So yeah, we definitely are continuing, as I mentioned, focus on this as a topic. The guidance is, you know, somewhat of a, based on what we know right now, we would like to do better. But again, based on what we know right now, the guidance is \u2013 make sense for us to provide. We would agree generally with what you're sort of identifying. We don't think it's a great result. And so we're obviously trying to do better. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks, Loren. And just as my follow-up, Asia flows slowed, but remain positive. I'm wondering if you can provide us a quick update in terms of what Andrew Lo and team are seeing across Asia from a product demand standpoint. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. I think, I mean, Asia is definitely in the numbers that we're seeing through October. Asia is quite strong, quite positive in terms of its flow pattern. It's very much driven by the institutional business, which continues to take on significant follow-on fundings, as well as new fundings across fixed income, bank loans, equities as well, so it's a pretty well diversified element. They now have GTR in Asia as well, so that's very interesting. So I'd say the level of optimism around the fourth quarter for Asia Pac is at a much, much higher level than it was in Q3. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks, Loren. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from Michael Kim of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Hey, guys. Good morning. First, can you maybe talk at a high level about sort of business with sovereign wealth funds, just trying to get a sense of, sort of the risk of attrition assuming commodities pricing remained under pressure, and then any sense on sort of relative fee rates versus the overall weighted average for the firm? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Let me hit a part of that, Loren, and chime in. So just generally, an area that we don't talk about specifically, the clients; that said, we have no indication that there'll be redemptions in that area. And I know, it's very topical within the industry, but that's what we would know right now. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: In terms of relative fee rates, obviously, we saw a little bit of a mix impact, which was negative point, I think it was 0.1 basis points in the quarter. That was largely due to just the market impact on our percentage of assets that are equity-based. We still are seeing good flows coming in from cross-border, so we don't think the story around fee rates is \u2013 we think it's going to continue to march forward as we grow. Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay. Okay, and then, Marty, I know you've been quite vocal in terms of the DOL's fiduciary standard proposals. And I understand, sort of the broader concerns around less advice, less options, and maybe even higher costs at the end of the day for investors. But just curious to get your take on some of the consequences for asset managers specifically in terms of potential changes to the economics of distribution, as well as maybe from a product development standpoint. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah, it's a fair question. I'd say, it's too early to know, because we're not exactly clear what the outcome is. That said, I will tell you, obviously I think the people that are going to be more strongly placed are those organizations that have a really broad range of investment capabilities. Those organizations that have ETFs, those organizations that are strong and smart beta factor investing, and also have the ability to create share classes that are very stripped down, that will be really investment fee-type share classes only that will be much more sought-after, and will ultimately be sort of unified accounts on the retail side. So that's been our focus. That said, otherwise, it's going to be a guessing game to see where they end up. But those would be the areas that I would look at that we've been focused on and how we are positioned then to \u2013 what might come out of this. Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay. And then just one minor clarification. So you mentioned the $700 million of inflows quarter-to-date. I know you said that does not include the Qs. But does that include the traditional ETF inflows? Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Yes, it does. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yes. Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI. Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI : Hi, thanks. I think in your prepared remarks you mentioned some money is going into some products that you don't have capabilities. And I think you mentioned cap-weighted and currency hedged. I'm curious on two-fold. One, is it too late to start investing in things like that just to continue to constantly broaden the product suite? And then other parts where you think you might have blind spots, where you might be investing? Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah, it's a good question. I guess at one level you don't know the blind spots until you're blind. Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI : Well put. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: So the currency hedged international capabilities, it really has been quite the area over the last year or so. And I will say within the ETF world, it's hard to have more than handful of firms with offerings that are successful, so being pretty quick matters a lot. That said, we won't ignore it. But I will say if you look at the fundamental strength that we have is the longevity and breadth of all the smart beta products that we have and low volatility offerings in particular. So, again, we are always asking ourselves, what are we missing, what are clients needing and trying to respond. So hopefully that's helpful. Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI : Absolutely. And then the overall performance is in very good shape, three-year and five-year, you pointed out. In the one-year, there's some slippage, particularly in equity. I didn't know if you mentioned or if you could mention any specific factors that you think are particular to your business that a certain market might respond better to? Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah, so good question. I was trying to address a little bit in my comments, and this is a better way to get to it. So the one-year performance, quite frankly, a handful of capabilities are just under 50%. I mean, maybe 50 basis points off. So the dispersion from the top half is very, very little. And it tends to be those areas where people have invested in energy, in particular. I personally think it's going to be a great investment. Timing is always a question. That said, I also think confidence that they have been continuing to have add-on investments in those areas during this period and I think probably, I don't have the numbers, but from September 30 on, I think that could only be a good thing. So we have really good \u2013 high level of confidence in what our investment teams are doing and where they're positioned as opposed to, probably what you're trying to get to is, are we concerned about the quality of one of the products. And we don't feel that at all right now. Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI : Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from Bill Katz of Citi. William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks so much. So certainly I appreciate the tactical volatility of the markets and your expense guidance within that. But sort of stepping back as we look out into 2016, what's your latest thoughts on incremental margin opportunity? Are we at the end of the incremental margin opportunity based on some of the quarter-to-quarter guidance? Or is that just more timing around market impact? Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah, so, again, where we are right now, Bill, like $790 billion in AUM, we'd sort of be right in line with our average AUM for 2015, maybe even a little bit below. So we'd actually, all things equal, expect revenues if you're just flat, no market impact, which is the way we tend to look at things, you could see revenues down year-over-year if we didn't have any organic growth or anything like that going on. So the topic of margin, incremental margin, it's an important one. But it's not necessarily one that applies perfectly in this environment. Obviously, we want our assets to grow with market and our assets will grow with organic growth. Both those things said, we're absolutely going to see that 50% to 65% incremental margin impact be there. If revenues are down, you'd want it to be as little as possible. If revenues are up, you want it to be as high as possible. We certainly get that point. We're obviously working hard to position the firm for results in terms of margin that the Street will certainly respect and appreciate. We're still working it through and you're going to get a lot more color in terms of thoughts around guidance for 2016 on expenses at the next call. Just know that we're very aware, we're very tuned to it and we're working hard to try to manage the expenses in light of this volatile market. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah, Bill, what I would add, though, I would say, subject to this short-term volatility that we have in the downdraft, nothing has changed in our long-term outlook. In fact, I couldn't feel more confident about that and that in a more normal market that is where we are. And also at the same time, what we are absolutely trying to do is deliver the financial results that would be expected of us while at the same time not be penny-wise and pound-foolish and not investing things that really separate us from a competitive advantage in the marketplace and also we believe generate the results for the client. So we are trying to do both and we're very focused on doing that. William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then just as a follow-up, I appreciate your update for the October flows. So it sounds like the active business is in still slight outflow mode. From your comments, it sounds like Asia is doing pretty well and maybe European Equity. Is it U.S. that continues to be the bugaboo? If that's the case, any strategic thoughts on how you try and ramp that to may be more of a positive market share opportunity? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah, much of it, if you look at the overall industry results, that really is frankly where the U.S. mutual fund industry is. Now, that doesn't make anybody happy in the short-term. I still have a high degree of confidence in \u2013 may be in great products and great things for clients. And we continue to generate the performance that will ultimately serve clients very well, and serving the distribution partners in a way that will be more important to them moving forward. So I think we're doing all the right things. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: I would also say, I mean, we're continuing to be good traction with some of the liquid alternatives getting put on platforms. Some of the performance on these products, again, like GTR, we have this market neutral product is spectacular. So it's exciting. We're seeing the daily flows around GTR even in the U.S. grow every single month. So there's definitely some element of potential here. Then other products, like Diversified Dividend has been positive, I think every single month for the last year. And definitely growing in its traction too. So there's definitely some positive things, despite the market overlay, which has been somewhat negative for Domestic Equity. William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you, guys. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Thanks, Bill. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Just wanted to highlight the \u2013 or discuss the institutional pipeline. It seems like a lot of the same names in terms of the funds are in there, in terms of the strength. I guess is there anything that's may be fallen out, given some of the implications of the third quarter or may be the outlook isn't as good or, and also just kind of walk through the funds that obviously are in there? Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah, Dan. I think nothing has fallen out. Everything is sort of moving in line with what we've been seeing. Probably again, the biggest grower continues to be GTR. Real estate continues to do very, very well. We're seeing broad fixed income really move \u2013 a big mover, and so that continues. General multi-asset, IBRA, as well continues to flow well. International does well, fund \u2013 is also \u2013 so it's pretty diversified across many, many different capabilities, and also across all the regions, too. So we don't feel at all like the institutional story is weakening. If anything, it may be, that we'll have \u2013 something is funded, and \u2013 but we're near the all-time high, and we expect to sort of see those all-time highs continue to get hit going forward. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Great. And then I guess, just on GTR, could you give us some specifics on kind of the way that AUM sits in terms of the overall complex, and kind of where that product is being marketed today? Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah, so it's probably mostly focused in the UK, that's where the greatest asset base is, retail, as well as institutional. Europe, it is absolutely getting traction \u2013 traction now. Asia really early days, so nothing really to talk about. And then as I mentioned, in the U.S., getting viewed and rated by the consultants, which is important. And then on the retail platform, growing every single day. I think of the total assets right now, $10 billion, pipeline $1.4 billion on top of that. So again, it's definitely continuing to impress. And very encouraging thing is in this last market environment, performance has been outstanding. So I think people are really paying attention to it. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from Robert Lee of KBW. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just a question on capital management, and Marty, I heard earlier, and I think, maybe it was Loren, on the share buybacks, obviously accelerated this quarter, kind of find the stock at a level that probably is still prone to buyback more than your average. But I think back this quarter, you did the debt offering. I think you more or less reached the liquidity levels you've long talked about wanting to maintain on balance sheet. So in light of that, and the fact that you really haven't, aren't too interested in M&A, I guess going forward, is it reasonable to assume that notwithstanding the near-term pickup in share repurchase that we could see just an ongoing higher level of repurchase going forward than maybe we've seen the last couple years, as you don't have to kind of build cash on the balance sheet to get to your targets? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Let me make a couple comments, and Loren can chime in. So \u2013 it's exactly the right question, the reasonable question to ask. Part of what we said with the target, so it's also getting some clarity in the regulatory environment. And I don't think we've come to the end of that honestly. And so we just want to continue to be a little bit cautious there. We're feeling better than we felt 12 months ago, for sure. We also continue, as I've said a couple times on this call, that we really do see some really important investments that we can make in the business that frankly will generate better returns in us buying back the stock, and limiting our ability to make those investments that we need. But we like buying our stock, and that's for sure (42:29). Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: I'll just ask as maybe the follow-up to that. I mean, I know the last couple years, your level of seed capital has risen, has gone up. And do you feel like that's starting to get to a point where it's more about recycling, or do you see that there's, just given the opportunity do you see that, that actually going to continue to grow somewhat next year or so? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: I guess, I can comment on it. I mean, it is \u2013 because the alternatives continue to be such a point of focus for investors and the need to co-invest alongside important parts of our business that really require co-investment. It probably is \u2013 continue to be a theme for us. And it's a competitive advantage in many ways, the fact that we can do this, where others may be more capital constrained and not able to do it. So it's something that's part of our planning process, and we look at the products that we know we're going to need to put capital behind and earmark some of that for those types of activities, which again sort of leads us to be perhaps just a little bit more conservative than some others who may not be using their capital in that way or don't have the capabilities that need capital the way the real estate and others do. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay, and then maybe one last question, and thanks for your patience on ETFs. You touched on earlier, flows rebounded quarter to-date, that's great. And but it feels like competition is coming out of the woodwork, particularly in the so-called smart beta space... Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yes. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: ...where you operate. And some of those competitors seem intent to compete on price. I'm just curious if you're seeing that have any impact on, on demand. I mean, apparently not since your flows are good. But just kind of your thoughts around that dynamic and how you think about responding if you need to? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah, take a step back and I think when you put on your U.S. hat, we tend to think of smart beta, we tend to think of ETFs as one thing. We have separated them as a firm in a way that we approach it and it's a combination of actually our quantitative team actually in Frankfurt we're with, who have a very, very long track record and systematic factor investing. And outside of the U.S., the continent in particular, in Asia you're starting to see it more, different, separate account-type mandates in the area. So it's the combination of that, and the vehicle, the ETF being, so we look at it as important parts of the world, there's an opportunity for us, and when you look at the breadth of team, the depth of team, the length of track record, and I think that's the other thing that people \u2013 you don't need to pay attention to. You are in much better position when you have a long track record in anything, right? And if you look at the track records of our smart beta, capabilities in ETF, it's the broadest capability. It's the longest tenured capability with the results. So I think more people coming in, is just confirmation that we're doing something right, and that there's demand for it. And we just look at it as a very important part of our business going forward. And to the pricing conversation, it's \u2013 we're not seeing much different than what we've seen over the last number of years. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. That was it. Thank you for taking my questions. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Thanks, Rob. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Good morning. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Continuing with the theme, so first PowerShares, can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of ETFs outside the U.S.? And to what extent are you seeing evidence of kind of a ramp in the UK with RDR kind of getting underway? And then, in line with that or understanding a smart beta is gaining momentum, especially in Europe, especially with institutional investors, so is there a way to kind of link what's happening with PowerShares in the U.S. in ETFs to what may be demand by institutional clients in Europe for smart beta? Thanks. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah, so good question. That's what I was trying to get to, so I'll try to be more clear, Ken. So ETFs outside \u2013 so RDR, it really has not taken off like we thought it would take off. That said, our focus with our ETFs, the U.S.-listed ones, it really tends to be through the Capital Markets' desk, and that has been a helpful thing. But we've not yet seen the uptake of it with RDR. We're thinking about it that actually smart beta factor investing, however you want to call it, it might make more sense to be bringing in a different type of vehicle, more an open-ended fund for RDR. And our engine is not limited to PowerShares, but it's our quantitative team, again like \u2013 who have this very long, deep track record. And you're right. So we're seeing it in particular on the continent and we're actually seeing it in Asia, Japan, China, so it is really \u2013 but again, it's not limited to the ETF package. And I think that's also what's very important. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. Okay. And... Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Does that answer your question? Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah, that gets to the heart of it. And then we'll try this. Talk about the changes going on in the Japanese postal service. And if it's appropriate, would you tie what seems to be changing opportunities there to what is your very big presence in Japan? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: I hear the question. I'm not going to speak specifically of institutions, but what I will say is that Abenomics has changed things. It is creating real opportunities outside of local JGBs and pension plans. And so, it's been an expansion into Japanese equities, it's been an extension into fixed income, investment grade type fixed income, bank loans, so it is really broadening. And it looks like for the foreseeable future, I'm sorry, it's dangerous to say, but let's put it this way. It continues to be quite an opportunity, I'd say within Japan. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: I'd say \u2013 also to say that, because of the investments and the time that we've spent building out our fixed income capabilities in our team, there's a lot of interest in the products, the fixed income products that we're now offering that, I think may be displacing others who maybe at levels of concentration that the clients don't feel comfortable with. So I mean, there may be some of that, that's going on too, that's helping us, now that we have a very, very strong offering. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Thanks, Ken. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks, guys. First question on IBRA, yeah, you guys sound like you're pretty constructive on that particular product. But the data we're tracking, which given it's very limited, it's limited to just U.S. retail is showing kind of outflows there. So just wondering, if you guys can expand a little bit on where you're seeing the demand for IBRA, is it institutionally-oriented at this point? And then if the U.S. retail is an outflow, I'm wondering, why that is. It seems like this quarter given all of the risks off, would have been a good quarter potentially for that product. So any color you could provide there would be helpful. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: So you're right. Retail is out in the U.S. on IBRA, institutional is positive, so we're seeing continued take on IBRA. Obviously, in the retail space, IBRA is competing with a whole variety of different types of funds with different capabilities for the institutional investors, much more specific, someone is looking for a risk parity product, they're going to come to us, because we have one of the best capabilities that's available. So \u2013 and the risk parity offering is one that's getting more and more acceptance in the consultant community. So that's why IBRA is doing well, I think in institutional. I think the fear is right now for IBRA on the retail side is what's going to happen with the Fed raising rates, and how, you know, how will it form. And again, we feel quite comfortable that our product will perform well under sort of a rate hike increase. But people are skittish at this point, and generally the market is skittish about that one topic overall, which is keeping people a little bit off side. The product still has a very good, strong long-term performance around one year, three years, five years. And so it's not a performance topic, it's entirely I think just an investor apprehension topic at this point. Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And did you guys disclose the large institutional redemption that you had this quarter? And if you haven't yet, can you disclose it? And then maybe a little color on why that particular redemption occurred. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: So all we're really going to say about that particular thing, because we don't talk about clients, it's our policy not to talk, it's about $2 billion in size. Asian Equity was the mandate. It wasn't at the highest fee level, it was fairly below a normal retail product, well below. And we felt, as Marty said, it was an isolated event. Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from Ken Hill of Barclays. Kenneth W. Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon to you guys there. Last quarter I think you discussed a little bit on the liquidity for your products. I'm wondering if you've had any discussions with regulators regarding maybe some of your more alternative style ETFs, PowerShares franchise. And has that sparked any concern internally or with the SEC? And how might you think about that moving forward? I guess really are you looking at regulation causing any sort of disruption going forward? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah, it's a good question. I think we've just seen the beginnings of the liquidity framework coming out from the SEC. The industry is very involved, have been very involved, will continue to be very involved. And so at a specific company level, too, we are very involved in those conversations, wanting to get to the right place with those and so it'd be too early to describe a point of view. Obviously, we know what the regulations are trying to get to and, at the same time, we want to make sure that they understand the framework they've put in place doesn't cause unintended consequences. So I still think we're a good number of months before having a view on the exact end game there. It's just an unknown at the moment. Kenneth W. Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. I guess then just a little bit more generally on Europe, I know you guys have worked very hard to build a strong platform there and we've seen some more positive sentiment around further easing there. How would you characterize the opportunity for higher flows in Europe? And on the back of some of the monetary easing, what are you trying to do to capture that longer term? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: We have been quite successful the last number of years here, but it came from multiple years of improving the range of capabilities, the service levels, et cetera. We are still relatively early innings on the impact that we can have on the continent. Strong team in place, strong products in place, good performance. What we are now getting through and improving is the acceptance of our products as top-tier partner-type recognition. Within a number of the big distributors we've made good progress, but we're not done. So that makes us feel that the future will be quite bright. Kenneth W. Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, thanks for taking my questions. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah, sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from Chris Shutler of William Blair. Chris C. Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. First, just based on the product mix, where you sit today and where you're seeing flows, just wanted to get your thoughts on the fee rate going forward? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah, Chris, again, the product will have some impact so will the geographies in which they are being sold. We think overall the product mix is leaning more towards alternatives, and that's helpful. We have never been traditionally an enormous provider of lower fee fixed income products, for example, or in our ETFs, as you mentioned, as we know, kind of at the higher fee range. There's a lot of expectation that Europe and Asia will continue to grow. And they have certainly significantly higher net revenue yields in aggregate relative to the U.S. So all that said, I think we would believe our fee rate will continue to march up from where it is based on mix. Chris C. Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. That makes sense. And then secondly, just wanted to get an update on the Wilbur Ross business. You haven't talked about that in a while, and just the outlook for performance fees there over the next few years. Thanks. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: So, again, without \u2013 because I'm not (56:20) terrible at predicting performance fees. I know that. The performance on the products have been good. It's been a very volatile market, though, so things can move around quite dramatically. Based on everything that we know, the embedded performance fees and carry within the products that we would be able to access in terms of performance fees, which would be Fund 4 and Fund 5, are significant, and it's probably an aggregate something on the order of nature of something you've seen for a full year for us in the past. So it's a pretty significant element. Timing-wise is a big unknown. Very unlikely to be realized in 2016. More likely than not 2017 just given the fact that the dispositions that would have to take place in those portfolios would be significant before we, from an accounting perspective, would be allowed to recognize any performance fees. There's still a fair amount of time to go, so that's why we don't talk about it that much, because anything can happen in markets and there's a lot of things that can happen in a year. But based on right now, it's pretty significant, pretty attractive. Chris C. Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah. Understood. Thank you. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question coming from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, folks. Marty or Loren, just to circle back on GTR and the pipeline. How do you think about the fee rate overall, I think it was 100 basis points roughly? And correct me if I'm wrong on that. And then just bifurcating between retail and institutional, in that fee rate and how you see the pipeline on the institutional side for GTR versus the retail demand. And if you can say what GTR flows were in the third quarter, if I missed that. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah, so, again, I think on the retail side our pricing is transparent. You can see those numbers. I think it's like 90 basis points to 100 basis points. On the institutional side, I don't think we get into disclosing those fees. Its prices are in line with I'd say the normal differential you'd expect from a retail versus institutional. So it's a nice price, very, very attractively priced. In terms of the pipeline and the opportunity, I think we're seeing, really just because it's easy to see, the huge take on on the institutional side that is giving us a lot of comfort that it's going to be growing certainly on the institutional side. Retail capabilities, probably even larger. But it's hard to quantify ultimately how big it could get. We know just how large some of the competing products are on the retail side. And so, and again, in terms of, I guess just even in the third quarter, the flows were about $3 billion for GTR in aggregate across retail and institutional. So it has a lot of capacity to grow on both sides. And it's just brand-new, as we mention, in the U.S. and just really kicking off in Europe and Asia, it's also brand-new. So great opportunities. Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: That's great. That's helpful. And then Marty, just if you want to talk a little bit about on the institutional solution strategy, as you mentioned, I think you're not seeing the \u2013 some of the redemptions in sovereign wealth funds like others are seeing. But if you can comment on your view of pension plans certainly in the U.S., reallocating more to fixed income into fees and liabilities, and how you think you've been developing your solution strategy to capture that, to basically retain the assets with the client. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah, so our approach to solutions is really is literally, again, they tend to be the most obvious is the larger institutions. And it's really facing off to understand them when you're more (1:00:26) what they're trying to accomplish. And it ultimately is bringing a number of different investment capabilities to meet what they are trying to achieve. And again, I'd say that's really early days for us, but also very important. On the retail side where people are less focused, it also is an opportunity where more and more of financial advisors and sort of the higher end financial advisors are also looking for \u2013 they have the ability to get that type of feedback and guidance from money managers. And that's the other area where we've been having some early successes. So again, I'd just look at it as a part of \u2013 just what you need to be doing as an organization, and I think we're doing it reasonably well, but we sure have some room to do better than what we are. Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Just one lastly on the buyback. I assume you're sort of locked up until earnings are through. Is that \u2013 when are you able to go back in the market for buying back your stock? Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Well, just a day after earnings. I think we can get back in 24 hours... Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks very much. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Eric Berg of RBC Capital Markets. Rosa Han - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi, good morning. This is actually Rosa Han standing in for Eric Berg. Our first question is, how do you perceive the rise in interest rates would affect your fixed income flows? And would those flows necessarily turn negative? Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Again, simple question, harder answer because of the magnitude of it. But yeah, probably what you'll see is a lot of the credit type capabilities will probably still be in demand. They seem to be in demand, and that's what clients are looking at right now as they anticipate a slow rise in interest rate. So if it is a slow rise in interest rates, we don't see a big rush to the doors. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. And it just helps at some of our largest well-known funds, like the bank loan capabilities would tend to do well and we're seeing actually \u2013 in October our bank loan ETFs and positive inflow just as people are beginning to expect a rate hike in December sometime. Rosa Han - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, great. And then what are your latest thoughts on how the SEC's proposal to strengthen the mutual fund liquidity might affect your company? Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. Again, we were speaking to it little bit earlier. It's \u2013 again, it's \u2013 the early feedback, the industry is very engaged on it. There is some thoughtful comments in there. And there's some areas where there really needs some improvement. And we're not going to know for a number of months what the outcome is. So it's hard to predict, to give you a specific answer until we get through that process. Rosa Han - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks very much. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Patrick Davitt of Autonomous. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Hi. Thanks for the follow-up. It may be too soon for this, but I thought I'd throw it in at the end if we had time. We're expecting the final method two rules next month. And I'm curious, how much preliminary work you've done on what it could mean for your business either expense-wise or margin-wise and if you have done a good amount of work, maybe give us some, an early read on what you're thinking. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Like us, everybody, that's operating over here is dealing with it and it's been in the works in our organization, always coupled for a good period of time. So, it's really well embedded. And we don't see any immaterial consequences to our business really at all from it. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our last question coming from the line of Michael Kim of Sandler O'Neill. Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Hey, guys. Just a quick technical follow-up. Just want to understand the dynamic between the 5 million share repurchases during the quarter versus the average share count being down just a bit less. Was that just a function of timing, or is there anything else in there that might have impacted the calculation? Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. Michael, it's just timing. Yeah. Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: The buyback happened late in the quarter. Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Yeah, got it. Thank you. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Okay. Thank you very much, everybody. Thanks for participating. Loren and I appreciate the questions and the engagement, and we'll be speaking to you soon. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Welcome to Invesco's Fourth Quarter Results Conference Call. All participants will be on listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I'd like to turn the call over to your speakers for today, Mr. Martin L. Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco, and Mr. Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin. Martin Flanagan : Thank you very much and thank you everybody for joining Loren and myself, and I'll briefly review the 2015 highlights before getting into a review of the business results for the fourth quarter, and then, Loren, will go into the more depth of the financial results and then of course we will open up to Q&A as we always do. So let me start by providing a brief overview of the operating results for the full-year, and if you're so inclined, I'm on page 3 of the presentation. Long-term investment performance remained very strong in 2015, 79% and 85% of actively managed assets were ahead of peers over three-year and five-years respectively at the end of the fourth quarter. Strong investment performance, combined with a comprehensive range of strategies and solutions we offer, helped clients achieve their desired investment objectives contributed to long-term net inflows of $16.2 billion for the year. Our efforts to deliver for clients while taking a disciplined approach to managing our business resulted in an operating margin of 41% for the full-year, off just slightly from the very strong prior year. The annual dividend totaled $1.08 per share which represents an 8% increase over the prior year. We also returned more than $1 billion to shareholders during 2015 through dividends and stock buybacks. Assets under management were $775 billion at the end of 2015, down from $792 billion at the end of the prior year, mostly reflecting some late-year volatility. Average assets under management were $794 billion for 2015 versus $790 billion for 2014. Adjusted earnings per share for the year were $2.44 versus $2.51 in the prior year. As you can see on Slide 4 foreign exchange had a significant impact diluting earnings per share by $0.15 per share from the prior year. During 2015, Fitch upgraded the firm's credit rating to positive outlook and we repurchased $549 million worth of stock. So let me take a moment and look back over the achievements over the past year, which will provide insights into our continued long range plans. First and foremost of course we made focus on delivering strong long-term investment performance, which continued to drive to grow our business. And as I mentioned 79% and 85% of the assets were ahead of peers on a three-year and five-year basis respectively at the end of 2015. By delivering strong investment performance and focusing on clients needs, we achieved further growth across the business. In the U.S., Invesco was the only firm to appear in the top 5 over one, five and 10 years in the Barrons Best Fund Family Annual Ranking. Our Asia-Pacific business continued to grow and we saw strong inflows and a range of strategies resulting in net sales of $5.7 billion, the stronger showing in the region since 2011. Institutional sales of $14.2 billion nearly doubled to prior year. We also saw continued growth in our EMEA business, driven by a focus on delivering strong investment performance and meeting our client needs. Cross-border and institutional were particularly strong with $7 billion and $4.5 billion in net inflows respectively and we remain in a very dominant position in the United Kingdom. We continue to invest in capabilities where we see strong client demand or future opportunities by hiring world-class talent, upgrading in our technology platforms, launching new products, and providing additional resources where necessary in 2015. The ability to leverage the capabilities developed by our investment teams to meet client demand across the globe is a significant differentiator for our firm and we will continue to bring the best of Invesco to different parts of our business where it makes sense for our clients. By delivering strong investment performance, Invesco Global Targeted Returns achieved strong flows in its second year of offering, with assets under management surpassing $11 billion globally at the end of the year. We continue to invest and strengthen our fixed income platform in 2015, which is enhancing our ability to meet our client needs. We also invested in our institutional business in 2015, refining our global strategy, bringing on additional highly regarded talent to more effectively aligning ourselves to the opportunities in the marketplace. We are seeing some early successes from this work, institutional flows, during the first quarter were amongst the strongest in past several quarters, in spite of a very volatile market. We are very focused on bringing together the full range for our capabilities to help meet our client investment objectives; the Road Island mandate of $7.2 billion is an example of the success we are achieving with our Invesco Solutions effort. Throughout the year we continue to innovate and expand the range of alternative products we offer, leveraging our strong teams and capabilities for the benefit of our clients globally. Two years ago, we began leveraging our presence in China to explore and better understand the opportunities in digital and mobile technologies in the marketplace. We've also been exploring the possibilities with market leading firms in Silicon Valley. Our acquisition of Jemstep in mid-January is an outcome of this research. Jemstep is one of the first digital platforms that focus exclusively on advisors, and is the market leading provider of advisor focused digital solutions. Invesco Jemstep platform enables wealth management, home offices, and their advisors with a full suite of technology solutions that are highly flexible, customizable, and easily integrated into their existing systems. This acquisition represents an investment in our partnership with the advised community and highlights our efforts to participate in the technology evolution within our industry. Turning to the fourth quarter let me take a moment to highlight the results which you'll find on Slide 8. Strong investment performance contributed long-term net inflows of $3.9 billion for the quarter. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 40.1% versus 41.4% in the prior quarter. Quarterly dividend remained at $0.27 per share. We also returned $329 million to shareholders, during the quarter through dividends and stock buybacks. Assets under management were $775 billion at the end of the fourth quarter compared to $755 billion we reported in the prior quarter. Operating income was $356 million in the quarter down from $373 million in the prior quarter reflecting the very volatile markets we saw in the quarter. Earnings per share were $0.58 versus $0.61 in the prior quarter. We repurchased $214 million of stock during the quarter representing 6.5 million shares. Turning to page 11 and looking at investment performance, as I mentioned during the quarter it continued to be quite strong was 79% of the assets in the top half over three-year basis and 85% were in the top half on a five-year basis. We also improvement in the one-year number which was 60% of assets beating peers. Turning to flows on page 12, you'll see that active and passive flows were positive during the volatile quarter. Active flows during the quarter were driven by a variety of capabilities including Global Targeted Return, Investment Grade Fixed Income, Real Estate, and Quantitative Equities to name a few. Passive flows were positive with renewed strength in Invesco's PowerShares ETF which saw net inflows of $2 billion. These flows were offset by $1.2 billion outflows associated with the Invesco Mortgage Capital deleveraging. This did have an impact across a number of categories. If you look at passive institutional fixed income in U.S., and if you add $1.2 billion each of those categories, you will eliminate the impact of the deleveraging of the Invesco Mortgage Capital during that quarter. Retail flows were relatively flat during the quarter, impacted by the macro environment as investors waived their options during the very volatile quarter. Institutional flows were particularly strong driven by inflows in the fixed income real estate and reflecting our continued focus on this part of the business. The pipeline of one but not funded mandate remains at near all time highs and is up more than 28% versus the prior year. Notably this excludes the previous announced $7.2 billion Rhode Island 529 win which is expected to fund sometime in the third quarter. Hope we feel good about the results for the year and the fourth quarter and that puts us in a strong position heading into a volatile year 2016. Continued strong investment performance, our focus on meeting client needs contributed solid operating results despite a very volatile environment. We continue to see strength across the global business, in particular in Asia-Pacific and EMEA. Our focus remains on strengthening our efforts to deliver strong long-term results and help clients meet their investment objectives and enhancing our comprehensive range capabilities. But given the very volatile markets, we are taking a disciplined approach to managing our business, balancing our goals of reinvesting the business for the benefit of clients with a need to run our business effectively and efficiently as we have in past very volatile markets. I would now like to turn the call over to Loren to go through the financials in more depth. Loren Starr : Thanks, Marty. Quarter-over-quarter, our total assets under management increased $19.8 billion or 2.6%. This was driven by market returns of $21 billion, long-term net inflows of $3.9 billion, and inflows from the Q of $2 billion offset by negative FX translation of $5.3 billion, and outflows from money market of $1.8 billion. Our average AUM for the fourth quarter was $783.7 billion and was down 0.7% versus the third quarter. Our net revenue yield came in at 45.2 basis points, a decrease of 0.6 basis points versus Q3. FX translation reduced the yield by 0.4 basis points and change in mix reduced the yield by another 0.4 basis points. These impacts were offset by an increase in performance fees and other revenues in the quarter, which in combination added 0.2 basis points. Next let's turn to the operating results. You'll see that net revenues declined by $16.9 million or 1.9% quarter-over-quarter to $886.1 million, which includes a negative FX rate impact of $8.1 million. Within the net revenue number, you'll see that investment management fees fell by $29.3 million or 2.8% to $1.01 billion. This reflects the lower average AUM during the quarter as well as changes in the AUM product and currency mix. Foreign exchange decreased fourth quarter management fees by $10.1 million. Service and distribution revenues decreased by $7.2 million or 3.4%, again reflecting the change in mix and lower average AUM during the quarter. FX reduced service and distribution revenues by $0.1 million. Performance fees came in at $18.8 million in Q4 and this was earned from a variety of different investment capabilities, including $9.8 million from real estate, and $3.2 million from UK equities. Foreign exchange decreased performance fees by $0.1 million. Other revenues in the fourth quarter were $29 million, an increase of $1.4 million driven by a higher real estate transaction fees. Foreign exchange decreased other revenues by $0.1 million. Third-party distribution, service and advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues, fell by $17 million or 4.3%. This movement was in line with our lower retail management fees and service and distribution revenues. Foreign exchange decreased these expenses by $2.3 million. Moving on down to slide, you'll see that our adjusted operating expenses at $530.4 million increased by $0.8 million or 0.2% relative to the third quarter. Foreign exchange decreased operating expenses by $3.9 million during the quarter. Employee compensation came in at $338.8 million, a decline of $8.1 million or 2.3%. This was due to lower incentive compensation for the quarter. FX reduced compensation by $2.3 million. Marketing expenses increased by $8.8 million or 34% to $34.6 million. This is a function of seasonally higher expenditures for advertising and other marketing costs particularly in EMEA. FX reduced marketing expense by $0.4 million in the quarter. Property, office and technology expenses were $80.4 million in the quarter, an increase of $0.5 million over the third quarter. FX decreased these expenses by $0.5 million. General and administrative expenses came in at $76.6 million and that fell by $0.4 million or half percentage points. FX decreased G&A by $0.7 million. Going on further down the slide you'll see that non-operating income decreased $3.3 million compared to the third quarter. Included in the fourth quarter were a $7.3 million loss on the disposition of private equity partnership interest, as well as a $2 million mark-to-market on paid money investments. These were offset by gains from consolidated sponsored investment products compared to a loss in the prior quarter. The firm's effective tax rate on pre-tax adjusted net income in Q4 was 26.6%, up slightly from 26.5% in the prior quarter which then takes us to our adjusted EPS of $0.58 and our adjusted net operating margin of 40.1%. And before I turn things back to Marty, I would like to provide a little more detail on the business optimization work that we began to implement in Q4, in light of the current market volatility and as well as in light of our lower AUM levels. We believe this optimization work will make Invesco an even stronger company further increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of our operating platform. The business optimization work that's underway is primarily focused on our use of our shared service centers, outsourcing, automation, and office location strategy. In the fourth quarter, U.S. GAAP results we recognized $16.2 million of expenses primarily in the form of staff severance cost and we expect costs associated with the optimization initiative to continue through 2016. Total costs for 2016 are estimated to be up to $85 million. Reducing our run rate operating expenses in 2016 and in future years is an important outcome of this work. And we expect the ongoing benefits of this project will be well in excess of the projected one-time implementation cost I just discussed. We anticipate the project will achieve cash payback within less than three years and it will add an estimated $0.06 to $0.08 EPS accretion in fiscal year 2017 and beyond. Finally, in terms of reporting and consistent with our past approach to dealing with material one-off expenses, the incremental optimization charges will continue to be adjusted out of our non-GAAP presentation but will be detailed and tracked each quarter in the U.S. GAAP reconciliation table within the earnings release. Additionally we will provide you updated estimates of the implementation cost and benefits of this initiative to the extent that these change in any material way. So one additional item for me to note is that new for this quarter we've included a schedule detailing the impacts that the change in foreign exchange rates had on our non-GAAP operating results and expenses for the quarter. The amounts presented on Slide 17 represents the impact of the change in exchange rate movements in the quarter and the year and were calculated by applying the prior period FX rates to the current period non-U.S. dollar earnings. Going forward, the schedule will include each quarter and can be found in the Appendix of our earnings presentation. And with that, I will now turn it back to Marty. Martin Flanagan : Thank you. And so Loren and I happy to answer any questions, people might have. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from Mr. Michael Carrier of Bank of America. Sir your line is open. Michael Carrier : All right, thanks a lot. Hey guys may be just first on the flows in the quarter and then I guess the outlook. It seems like a lot of the strength, Marty, you highlighted you're coming from the institutional side of the business. And then, Asia, you mentioned a pipeline near at all time high. Just wanted to get a sense from a mix standpoint what's driving may be that pipeline. And then when we think about it may be for Loren like from a mix shift on products obviously the market or the beta side is having an impact for everyone. But just wanted to try to get a sense on how that pipeline is relative to the current mix or the fee rate? Loren Starr : I will be happy to pick that up, Mike. So the pipeline is being driven really in four big buckets, probably one of the biggest is direct real estate probably 30% of the pipeline continues to be strong driver. Fixed income generally, across broad fixed income, alternative fixed income, stable value, probably another 30%. And then, the remainder is split between asset allocation and multi-asset solutions and then quantitative and regional equities would be other. So it's fairly well diversified and generally high fee. And so when we look at the fee rates of the pipeline, it's actually at one of the highest levels we've ever seen it, it's well above our current net revenue yields for the firm as a whole. And so, as these assets come in it will be accretive to our fee rates, which is great news. Obviously the negative that we've seen in our fee rate is due to the compression on equities just given what's happened in the market and then foreign exchange has also had an impact as well. But in terms of the mix overall on the pipeline, institutional pipeline we think it's very positive for our fee rates. Martin Flanagan : Yes, so I don't know if I could add much to it, other than it is a part of the business where we turn our attention. It's really seemingly getting stronger and stronger, frankly in each region in the world in the Americas and EMEA and in Asia-Pacific, and it is really quite broad-based. So it's a very positive. Loren Starr : And the other thing I would just mention I mean we would expect our fee rate I mean given stability in assets and stability in FX to grow across 2016. Michael Carrier : Okay. That's helpful. And then just quick follow-up, Loren, usually or sometimes you will give, some guidance just on like the expense lines and I don't know if it's because of some of the work that you guys are doing here to streamline the expenses, as you get into '17. But just any, I guess color I think comp you typically had the 1Q seasonality but may be the marketing you have some 4Q seasonalities. So any color on the expense outlook just given the volatility in the markets right now. Loren Starr : Yes, I would say given the volatility we're probably going to not give any explicit guidance around line items at this stage. There is a lot of work obviously that I discussed being done around some of this optimization work which will have some impacts on those line items as well. Generally, we are working hard to bring expenses down. Right, as you can imagine year-over-year decline in expenses. Our compensation generally moves and flexes in line with operating income, so those will be down. Some of the optimization work especially around, we just mentioned some of the severance, will also help bring some of the compensation line down. But the benefits of the optimization work will probably spread across most of the other categories other than marketing explicitly. But looking at marketing that's another interesting topic for us, it is one of these conundrums when you're in this market, your clients want to hear from you and you want to be out with them, but at the same time it certainly is a discretionary expense in this format where we're continuing to look at. So I'd say we're obviously going to be very vigilant to making sure that we manage expense very smartly in this environment with no presumption of snapback or some reversal. The other thing I would like to just mention there is some impact just to the acquisitions that we discussed in terms of Jemstep and in terms of Religare Asset Management completing our 100% ownership there. It's absolutely immaterial in terms of the earnings impact, so you don't have to worry about EPS impacts, but it does add probably roughly $15 million of expense and although bit more in revenue in 2016. So you will see some of those line items go up just as a result of those acquisitions but offset by obviously higher level of revenues. So we normally wouldn't be surprised by that. The optimization work that we're doing should have a benefit in 2016 that you will see. So again we will quantify that as we get through it. But that will help drive expenses down year-over-year. Michael Carrier : Okay. Thanks a lot. Martin Flanagan : Yes, I would just add to Loren's point. I mean, we feel like we're really quite capable at this, and if you look at our history, we use these volatile periods to really advantage of opportunities as they show up. It is a period where I think '16 for the industry is going to be quite interesting, where clients will be looking for those firms that are in a position of strength and we're one of those firms and we feel we're operating from a position of strength right now. And so we're going to be very responsible on the expense side but we have some real opportunities that we want to continue to advance at the same time. So that's what we're working through and we will continue to make sure that we're communicating very clearly with everybody. Operator : Our next question is from Daniel Fannon of Jefferies. Sir your line is open. Daniel Fannon : I guess first can you expand upon the 529 mandates. I think the $7.2 billion you mentioned is going to fund in the third quarter. Is that -- can you talk about the mix of products that's going to be and then also it's obviously very large is that something that is a new channel for you guys or can you talk about how that evolved and may be the other opportunities within that sub-segment? Loren Starr : Yes, so it will fund in January -- Martin Flanagan : July. Loren Starr : Excuse me, in July. It's two plants. The vast majority of the money is in one plant is just the Rhode Island alone that's ETFs alone sort of a broad range of ETFs. It was -- it's driven by our Solutions team, so they are building the portfolio consistent with what's Rhode Island the CIO has set their as a set of investment objectives with a much larger part of the plan which is probably $6.8 billion of that is a broad range of active and passive capabilities again managed by our Solutions team. And from my point of view Rhode Island has been very, very thoughtful and it is really well constructive approach and again as our Solutions team is managing the capabilities. With regard to the channel, it is new channel for us; from the standpoint of as we all know many, many people use 529s for kids and et cetera, et cetera. And so it will be available in the advice channel throughout the country and it's one of the largest 529 plans in the marketplace and we just think it's going to be that much more competitive. Our goal is to help Rhode Island meet the needs of the people in the portfolio but frankly they also want to grow their plan too and we work very hard to do that. Daniel Fannon : Great. And then you mentioned part of the strength in the fourth quarter has been in Asia and Europe, I think that has been for some time, I guess. Given the volatility to start the year, as this demand changes, as this demand kind of trends changed at all or kind of how would you characterize the start of the year? Martin Flanagan : It's really hard to -- I think we all know the psychology day-by-day, week-by-week changes. It does feel like it's, as the markets are seeming a little more calm, and you're getting some more clarity, I will say business in Asia last week and all the business I have were all very, very strong, so I would anticipate continued strength there, as Loren said, in EMEA but it feels like we're starting to see a little bit more positive reaction to the environment. But again it's so early to say anything with dollar. Loren Starr : I mean I think your point that you made before Marty is good, I mean institutional the strength on the institutional side is actually strong across every region. Martin Flanagan : Right. Loren Starr : Great pipeline. The retail behavior has been sort of hard to gauge sort of in and out as pharmacy go off. But generally I would say in EMEA we feel very, very comfortable and confident that the retail side is going to be quite strong. The GTR product is doing very, very well, pharmacy has been quite strong, and we think that will help continue to allow us to grow both in the UK and in Europe on the retail side. Daniel Fannon : Great. Loren Starr : And the other thing is the quantitative product as well is unbelievable off the chart performance, so also very, very strong performance and demand. Operator : Thank you. Next we have Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI. Sir you may proceed. Glenn Schorr : Quick follow-up on the 529 I'm just curious on how the fee structure works. Do you get a fee on each of the underlying assets is it a wrapper up top and is it at a normal institutional rate? Martin Flanagan : Yes, it's -- I can't remember exactly where it comes. But just think of an institutional rate on the whole, on the portfolio -- Loren Starr : And that's down to somewhere around 35 basis points. Martin Flanagan : Right. Loren Starr : Something like that. Yes, that's going to, sorry net down to something around 35 basis points on the basket. Glenn Schorr : Got it. Helpful. And then a question on Jemstep, I saw your details and rationale for growth in the slides. I just had a follow-up question. How do you expect the distributors to use it, and then more importantly, how do you differentiate because I'm assuming there's going to be many large asset managers having their version and may be even the distributors doing their own version. I'm just curious as to say early mover advantage that it makes their lives easier but just curious how you expect that to shape up? Martin Flanagan : Yes that's a great question. So I think you\u2019re going to and we are expecting the large distributors will have some version of their own. That's historically what we've done in the past. We've still contacted them and but that would be our -- what we're going to anticipate. It's really just sort of the other channels, though there is a high degree of interest in this. And really what it is, it's just partnering up with our distribution partners and more effective we can be with them, at the end of the day, that's a good thing for their clients and for us also. I don't believe that they're going to be, let me say it the other way, I believe strongly there is a first move advantage to this, because quite frankly multiple distribution partners are not going to have yes, multiple I think, three, four, five, six, 10 of these within the system they don't need it. And it's like any other application is, it's education and investments to move it forward. So that is our other core belief. Glenn Schorr : To that end, is that your point with we have 300 people on the ground selling and educating as we speak? Martin Flanagan : Yes. Glenn Schorr : Okay, good. Last one, Loren, with the cash balances hitting your internal hurdles and the valuation in my words at a ridiculous level. How you think about the payout ratio relative to the past like can we start seeing 100% payouts even through you have a lot of things going on? Loren Starr : I think you saw something probably very close to that this last quarter. So again we certainly have demonstrated our willingness to respond when the stock is, as you call ridiculously low, and we would tend to agree with you on that one, just given our sense of optimism around our ability to grow over the long-term. So you should expect us to continue to pay a lot of attention, you know our needs for internal organic growth CDs and so forth are still pretty sizable, lot of opportunities, so we need to balance those against returning capital. But you should certainly expect us to be operating in the stock buyback around in a non-business as usual approach which is somewhat similar to what you're seeing in the fourth quarter may be not at the actual level but something between business as usual and what you've seen us do. Operator : Next we have Mr. Bill Katz from Citi. Sir, your line is open. Bill Katz : Just trying to reconcile some of the numbers on the optimization program you delineated a little bit, Loren. You mentioned that you spend; I guess roughly $100 million between the charge in the fourth quarter and then what you expect for this year, and sort of in the three year payback, $0.06 to $0.08 accretion in '17. Is it accretive to non-GAAP earnings for '16 and the reason I'm asking is I guess you got to run the expenses through the GAAP line. I presume if it's a three-year recovery either you really back ended in '18 or you would get some pretty sizable savings this year as well. I\u2019m just trying to figure out the cash flows? Loren Starr : So the execution of the optimization is going to happen all through 2016. So the three-year payback is really going to be in, at full throttle in 2017 and beyond. We will get savings in 2016 probably somewhere around $15 million is what our non-GAAP run rate, positive impact would be -- are -- is what we expect and that would certainly ramp up significantly into 2017 and on. So again our estimate is based on what we know today based on the activities that we're engaged in today. But we're going to be pretty that's the way we do believe that it won\u2019t be no more than $85 million in terms of what is required for us to implement that long-term run rate savings which again is somewhere $30 million to $45 million in run rate cost savings post 2017. Bill Katz : Okay. That's very helpful. And then, Marty, may be both of you guys you gave a nice delineation also where by region and by product but the one area that seem to sort of not be within that list was more traditional equity mandates. What are you hearing from clients on the institutional side, is a still more this barbell notion or is there any sort of interest in more traditional playing vanilla type of mandates? Martin Flanagan : Yes, so there are actually I mean this again I'll just use the A structures because I was there but I wouldn\u2019t limit it to there. I mean you\u2019re actually seeing institutional clients recognize this is probably the time to increase their exposure to the equity markets. So you\u2019re actually hearing very constructive things and also you\u2019re starting the year by the way this is a time where active management can really start to add value in a way that was harder from sort of a beta run from 2009 on. So I think you're at a point where you're actually going to see, if you're a high conviction manager, you're going to continue to start to do well. So I don\u2019t know what you put in traditional but clearly international equities are high, we\u2019re seeing a lot of regional capabilities people are interested in. So I think it's just where we're in the market cycle and I think you're going to continue to see, excuse me, you will begin to see much more commitment to active management. Operator : Thank you. Next we have Mr. Patrick Davitt of Autonomous. Sir, your line is open. Patrick Davitt : I have another follow-up on the Rhode Island mandate. One, maybe I misunderstood how you frame this. But does this mean that there is a $7.2 billion of outflows coming from other people ETFs and funds on this fund? Martin Flanagan : Yes. Loren Starr : Yes. Patrick Davitt : Yes. And then two, I imagine that that approval of capital like this has a pretty stick inflow stream. Is that the case and if so can you kind of help us frame what the organic growth of it has been kind of over the last few years? Martin Flanagan : It's a very good question; I don\u2019t think I have a satisfactory answer. What I would say is that the first decision was to engage us to meet the program of the investment that they had in place that was the first desire. Secondly, they recognized the depth and breadth of our retail distribution capability with some very important distribution partners throughout the country, and so their anticipation of growth in the plan is part of what the decision was, and obviously we\u2019re very interested in it and we think it will be a new channel for us and we think we'll be quite successful with it. And I guess the other way to put it in context and again I don't have to assist -- they were successful enough to become I think as the third largest 529 plan in the country, and we would look for growth to be stronger than what it had been in the past. Loren Starr : And I would agree with your characterization about it being sticky right? Martin Flanagan : Right. Loren Starr : As long as performance, everything else continues right. Martin Flanagan : Right. Patrick Davitt : And finally I guess on that again. Was this kind of a broad, kind of beauty show, what was kind of the decision process in terms of that? Loren Starr : Yes, you've to think about it as typical, institutional, beauty show, and obviously you -- we have the choice of anybody they wanted to work with in the country and who is very competitive and because we know this is the largest 529 transfer that's happened in the industry. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Kim of Sandler O'Neill. Sir you may proceed. Michael Kim : First any early read into quarter-to-date flow trends particularly given the seasonal step-up we typically see in retirement accounts in the first quarter. And then related to that, I think in the past you sort of targeted may be a 3% to 5% organic growth rate. So just assuming a more cooperative market backdrop going forward which realizes a big assumption these days. But in that sort of environment is that still sort of a reasonable range to expect? Martin Flanagan : Yes, I'll make a couple of comments and Loren continue. So we still look at that 3% to 5% organic growth rate is very achievable. And again, as Loren and I have talking about such as this ever previously we just continue to see ongoing strength throughout the regions, both retail institutional, so we think that is fully in place. You're now talking about a few weeks of January very, very hard to anticipate the quarter quite frankly and this week is a whole lot better than the first week of January. So I wish I could give you some great insights I really can't. That said, I do know and Loren made this point very clear that the institutional investors are continuing to move forward, the retail investors tend to be more risk on, risk off, depending on the daily movement in the markets although it feels like that's coming down probably the best I could describe at the moment. Could you add? Loren Starr : Yes, Marty, I think that's about right. Probably say there is lot of risk cost behavior in the early part of January and so it's getting healthier. Michael Kim : Okay, fair enough. And then so if we focus on kind of the alternatives bucket net flows have been consistently positive for a number of years. I know the real estate business represents a big chunk of those assets but there is also number of different strategies that are in there. So just wondering if you could sort of give us a sense of where you're seeing the best growth opportunities. And then, as it relates to fee rates, any sort of color there because I think the range of the respected fee rates within that bucket can be pretty wide? Loren Starr : So Mike, I think the other probably even larger in terms of what we're seeing certainly in the fourth quarter is GTR I mean just continues to grow. I think it's brought in about $1.5 billion in net flows in the fourth quarter; it's about $11 billion in total size to-date. So that is one that certainly outside the U.S. has really taken on a lot of good momentum and I think the product that it competes with in the marketplace had some issues around its performance. And so the positioning is even better probably now than it's ever been. Still early days in the U.S. for us and so we like nothing more to see GTR sort of reach its appropriate timeframe and sort of get through all the hurdles that we need to get through for it to be on the platform. But I think that in real estate and then perhaps as well alternative fixed income is still an area where we believe we can play at a much more significant level than we have in the past and there are lot of products that are still sort of early days in terms of their track record. So I think it's really GTR and real estate right now are the primary drivers for us and where the demand is. Michael Kim : Got it. Okay. And then just one quick one you mentioned or you called out the $7.3 million realized loss related to the disposition of private equity partnership interest. Can you just sort of give us some more color on exactly what that related to? Loren Starr : Yes, so that was previous time where we were warehousing partnership in just before they were put into a vehicle for our clients and unfortunately the mark-to-market on that really hit us before I got into the vehicle and so that's what that is. Normally we would be able to get it in there faster but there was just again some exposure to a pretty volatile market and that's what you saw. Operator : Next we have Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse. Sir your line is open. Craig Siegenthaler : I was looking for a little more color on excess capital. I think historically you would like to provide a sort of guidance here in terms of cash and investments versus long-term debt and they're pretty close here. So could you just provide an update here and may be you're pretty comfortable where it is right now? Loren Starr : Well so I think you'll see that we had about $1.85 billion in total cash at the end of the quarter. The amount that is required from a regulatory perspective in the UK and Continental Europe is around $550 million. So we are about $1.3 billion in excess of our rate capital requirements we've talked about in the past that we want to be at least $1 billion. So again we are feeling strong in terms of our cash position and our ability to use our capital to the benefit of our clients probably better than we have in a long time. And with that said, assets have dropped a little bit and so our cash flow is definitely having some -- there is some impact to our operating cash there. But overall we are feeling very, very strong and then optimistic about our ability to deploy our capital for the benefit of our shareholders in terms of return on capital. Craig Siegenthaler : That's very helpful, Loren. And then just my follow-up on Jemstep. I just wanted to get a better understanding for how this business will function, how it will generate profits and sort of what really attracts you to do this business? Martin Flanagan : Yes, well, I probably said what's the attraction, as I said we -- our view is, it's a mistake not to pay attention to what's going on in the digital world and it\u2019s really easy to just ignore, we think that's a mistake that's why we went and spent some real good time researching what is happening and we came to the conclusion that a digital mobile tool that could help us with our distribution partners will be a very wise thing to do. It's a simple thought and your thought is that. There will be a combination of and I don't want to get into pricing on Jemstep where there will be a combination of things that we think will be accretive, if you want to call it to the organization. First of all, the most important thing is well deeper relationships with our clients; we will be able to do better job with our clients. We'll be able to offer more effectively the broader range of investment capabilities we have to our clients, and those at the end of the day will ultimately result in increased assets under management if we again that we have to be performing et cetera all the obvious. But we think that's the fundamental thoughts of why we try Jemstep was very important development for us. Operator : Thank you. Next we have Mr. Ken Worthington of J.P. Morgan. Sir your line is open. Ken Worthington : First also on capital management. We're getting to the point in the year where I think you will be recommending to the Board the dividend increase for the coming year. In recent years the dividend increase has been particularly big. But given where the stock price is, how are you thinking about the kind of the mix of capital return between dividend and buyback as we look forward to the next year? Martin Flanagan : I think it's probably not great for us to be talking about this in event of our discussion with our Board. But generally it's I think our sense of more modest, a modest dividend could be appropriate stride in light of the fact that that will create more capital for buybacks which I think given the market pricing of our stocks may be the better way to use that cash. But again we need to wait before we get in front of our Board, before we sort of signal anything quite honestly. Ken Worthington : Okay. Thank you. And then just little ones the pound hedge, the pound obviously fell a lot in 2015, can't really tell how much you made at the end of the day on that. Bill said in your release you're hedged out to March, I thought you were actually hedged out to May. How are you thinking about hedging out the currency as we think about 2016 and actually what did you end up making in 2015 on it? Thank you. Martin Flanagan : Yes, great question. So the hedge as you know was structured, hedges were structured 1.493 that is reflective to the average rate for the quarter and so there was no quarter in 2015 that had a rate that averaged below 1.493. So we made nothing this year or last year in 2015. On the current quarterly hedges definitely in the money and again, so again more to come on what the value there is it's moving around. But it's certainly something we would see at this rate noticeably, notable number. We are expecting to hedge our currency going forward around the pound. In particular, we believe that the pound is potentially going to be still a little volatile in light especially with the BREXIT discussions that are going on. And so those are again as we've done in the past hedges we put in place that would be out of money puts that really will protect us from the downside, allow upside to occur and again would protect our cash flow in particular as opposed to operating results which we can't really protect against. Operator : Thank you. Next we have Brennan Hawken of UBS. Your line is open. Brennan Hawken : Most of my questions have been asked and answered. Just one left as far as the U.S. equity performance you saw some deterioration here this quarter. Could you speak to that? And I think that you referenced last quarter that there was some loading up in energy stocks did that play a part here? Loren Starr : It did. And again my perspective on that is overall the performance is still very, very strong and is very short-term in nature and frankly it didn't improve last quarter to this quarter. But it's -- then again it's all very short-term. But yes, moving into this year, it just continued to strengthen. So those portfolio sets will have the energy exposure we think that plays very, very well and they are going to do hopefully do very, very well for our clients. Martin Flanagan : And the other thing I would say is that the improvement that we saw in the one-year numbers relative to Q3 were due to our small cap growth equity team as well as our growth in income products. So there were definitely some equity capabilities that can show improvement in the quarter relative to last quarter. Operator : Our next question is from Robert Lee of KBW. Sir your line is open. Robert Lee : Hi I have got two questions. The first one is kind of curious -- Loren Starr : Hey Robert, it's hard to hear you. Robert Lee : Sorry. Is it any better? Loren Starr : Good, thank you. Robert Lee : Okay. Couple of questions you did mention in the release a couple of regulatory targets strictly private equity. Kind of curious what that is and even though adjusted that for EPS should we expecting quarters, a filling quarter it's kind of -- Loren Starr : Hey Rob we're really having a hard time in hearing you. I don't know you kind of grabled. Robert Lee : You know what I will call you offline. I'm on a cell phone that's probably not working well. Loren Starr : Sorry about that. Martin Flanagan : Sorry, Rob. Loren Starr : We're getting every other word. Operator : Next we have Mr. Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Sir your line is open. Chris Harris : A few questions on PowerShares. Are you guys seeing any fee pressure at all in that business? And then sort of related to that given how competitive smart beta is and it just keeps getting more and more competitive, do you think ultimately we might see new pressure in that area? Martin Flanagan : So a couple of things. I think when you want to think about us, think about it beyond smart beta it is really factor investing. So one of the delivery mechanisms are PowerShares, ETFs but factor investor team is really the one team you\u2019re seeing real demand for factor investor team outside of the United States both retail and institutional, institutional in particular in Europe, institutional in particular in Asia, and we\u2019ve been doing it for 20 years. And I think the other thing if you look at the PowerShares line up what is important is that differently than mutual funds you really can\u2019t have more than three in a category. So there is a first mover advantage topic within ETFs is something very, very real. And if you look at the length of the time that our smart beta ETFs have been in the market, they have liquidity, they have real track records and when you're the incumbent you're really in a strong position. So we think other people come in into smart beta areas, it's a confirmation that it\u2019s a better way to create exposure and to passives. And again, we're just seeing continued strength within PowerShares in particular in fact investing outside of the United States. Chris Harris : Okay. My one follow-up would be on the cost optimization plan. Can you guys give us a little bit more detail about what those costs really are; I mean is it a combination of project spending and layoff comp or is it something else. And then sort of related to that, I\u2019m wondering why the spending is taking sort of it's sort of backend loaded if you will, you would think it was layoffs are something of that nature it would -- benefits would be pretty immediate? Martin Flanagan : Okay, yes, it's good question. Thank you. So we will make sure it's clear. These are long dated infrastructure type program. So many years ago we have a low hanging fruit is we call that's long on it's been long on for long time. So these are efficiency related undertakings hardcore system upgrades, process improvements type things. So it's large projects by having all of our institutions but they're pretty broad right now. Loren Starr : Yes, in many ways they are transformational around processes and the way we do things. So it's not just trimming people that kind of behavior, you're right. That could be done very quickly. This is very thoughtful that will make us a stronger better company at the end of the day. And again in an environment like this, we will move more quickly to get those things done, they have been on our list, and we have all these things that we would like to do to continue make ourselves a better company. But we\u2019re absolutely accelerating a lot of these activities right now but they do take time to implement thoughtfully. Operator Next we have Mr. Chris Shutler of William Blair. Sir you may proceed. Chris Shutler : So on U.S. and Global Fixed Income, you have really terrific performance, over $10 billion of active flows in 2015. Can you may be just talk about that area with rates may be rising a little bit here with changes in the credit markets and how you see the pipeline shaping up for '16 and beyond? Martin Flanagan : Yes, so I'd say the effort that we started three years ago broadening our fixed income capability, probably almost four years ago now is really proving to bear real fruit and as you said, if you look across the fixed income performance it is very, very strong. And we're seeing growing demand all channels, all regions within fixed income and some of it is still not at the level that we anticipate because some of the capabilities don't have three-year track records. So getting close but we're starting to get new commitments on them simply because the performance is quite frankly institutions in particular looking for another high quality provider of fixed income capabilities. So not just the performance but we do think it's -- we're not seeing the highest level of contribution, yes from that area. So we're very positive on it. Loren Starr : It's only growing for us. I mean, it's such a big market and we're still underpenetrated that our opportunity to continue to grow, even if there is some rate impacts. I think they is significant. Chris Shutler : All right. And then may be a last one topic. The DOL fiduciary standard, just given the increasing thought that that's going to through; I just want to get your latest take there on. And realizing that the final rule is not out, what could be the impact to Invesco's strategy and may be any impact on expenses that we should think about? Martin Flanagan : Yes, it's a good question, and again I think we're all -- we're imagining right, so it's hard to imagine. But what I can say and this probably gets back to some of these other topics that we talked about. The breadth of capability, depth of capability matters a lot. We think quite frankly high conviction managers in fundamental investing and factor investing is really important. We think we're obviously one of very few firms that has and do the range of those types of things. And quite frankly the other thing that Jemstep does it's an enabling tool for our advisory clients to get broader deeper relationships with their clients and serve clients that may -- yes, individuals that could ultimately totally disadvantage by the fiduciary role that's been put in place, so that's part of the work we\u2019re thinking of how Jemstep can help us and our clients with a rule that we don't know exactly what is going to be at the moment. But so that's how we've been thinking about it and so hopefully that's helpful. Operator : Next we have Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Alex Blostein : Bigger picture on the expenses. When you take a step back, I understand that the initiative may have been in the works for some time but the revenue probably accelerated some of that. But when you take a step back and you look at your fixed expense base versus the variable expense base, to achieve that kind of 3% to 5% organic growth, what kind of inflation and investment do you need to see in your fixed portion of the expense base to achieve that target? Martin Flanagan : Nothing more than what we have quite frankly so. Loren Starr : And we\u2019re just leveraging in many ways capabilities that are in our view sort of not -- and we can scale much more than they are today and taking capabilities that are some are focused in a particular region and unlocking them on a global basis, we can use existing sales people, we can use obviously existing teams. So there is no sort of new infrastructure that we necessarily need to put in place to support that activity. It's more a matter of coordination and education and sort of making sure that our teams, our sales teams in particular understand these products and can articulate the benefit to their clients. Alex Blostein : Got it. And then I guess along those lines, when you think about the product dynamic and the sources of organic growth that we've seen in the industry this quarter and frankly for the last couple quarters, European retail, UK retail has been a source of strength for you guys, for BlackRock to some extent, for Threadneedle to some extent. So some of the bigger US players. What -- when you take a step back, how has the competitive dynamic evolved in that market? And I guess more importantly, are you seeing share gains from other firms, or is the pie kind of still growing from whether it's bank deposits coming into the investment products or some of the captive asset managers just continuously losing market share? Martin Flanagan : So is this in particularly in the UK? Alex Blostein : UK and the European market. Martin Flanagan : So if you look over the last four years and let's do kind of Europe first, I mean it has been really the independent global asset managers largely U.S. that have been continuing to take greater share on accounts. I know there are some other good competitors -- very good competitors that participate but that has been the fact for whatever reason. And over the last number of years as you've seen, I mean we just continue to make stronger and stronger inroads on the continent, we still think that is the case, we still have, we think quite a way to go to penetrate the market and that continues for us. In UK it's really quite different. I mean it is really competitive markets; very few, very few non-UK firms are successful in the UK. And it is really that the heritage of our presence in the UK is why we're so strong there and again it just continues to be competitive, but we're very well placed there and we think we will continue to do well. But that would probably be another market that largely driven by regulatory developments and really what I would say what's starting to happen here in the United States, very difficult to be a smaller firm, and I think we're strong just going to get stronger in UK that's going to be the case in the United States too. Operator : Next we have Mr. Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Sir your line is open. Brian Bedell : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Most of them have been asked. Just this one on the solutions asset Marty, if you want to talk a little bit more about that. I guess first of all, would you consider that Rhode Island wins one of your best successes in the solutions effort? And how do you think you might be able to leverage that, whether you will use this as a template to further broaden the effort across your sales force. Martin Flanagan : Yes, so Rhode Island would be the highest profile in the United States I would say. But again we're seeing -- one of the components of being able to do that, I mean it is really those combination of broad range of capabilities and from our point of view high conviction factor and fundamentals. So we have both of those and I think that is actually really important if we\u2019re going to be successful in solutions and it\u2019s continuing to carry on through us in each of the regions so the U.S., Asia-Pacific, frankly China in particular, and on the Continent in particular. And so will this continue to go down that path and there is growing opportunity in the area. And again I think it's you really have to be a broad gauged set of offerings to be successful and that's where we start and then the overlay of very some talented people that can do the solutions work for the clients. Brian Bedell : And would just say in terms of the effort going forward on this and your 3% to 5% organic AUM to organic growth targets, would just say solutions is a very substantial part of that? Martin Flanagan : So it is hard to when we, probably like you and everybody else we do our looking forward to try and understand where the strength will come. It's -- it will be a contributor for sure and a growing contributor over the two or three years out from where we are right now. So that's another reason why have such confidence in sort of the 3% to 5% range. Brian Bedell : Okay. And just may be just lastly, on the solutions side, do you feel that's more fixed income oriented or really completely broad --or I should say fixed income alternative oriented or really completely broad across your asset classes? Martin Flanagan : It's been 100% broad across the asset class utilizing anything from as I said really factor based capabilities two alternatives. So it\u2019s client dependent but it has used the full range of capabilities in most cases. Operator : No further questions sir. Martin Flanagan : On behalf of Loren and myself, thank you very much for your time and look forward to talking to you next quarter. Have a good rest of the day. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Martin Flanagan : Thank you, this is Marty Flanagan and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today is Loren Starr, Invesco's CFO and we will be speaking from the presentation that's available on the website, if you're so inclined to follow. Today I'll review the business results for the first quarter. Loren will go into greater details of the financials and we will open it up to questions. So let me begin by highlighting the Firm's operating results for the first quarter which you will find on slide 3. Long term investment performance remained strong during the quarter. 72% and 76% of active managed assets were ahead of peers on a three-and-five-year basis, respectively.  Strong investment performance and our continued focus on meeting client needs were not enough offset the impact of the volatile markets, particularly in January/February. Non-institutional and active demand where offset by volatility among retail and passive capabilities which led to long term net outflows of one $1.3 billion during the quarter. Market volatility and net outflows put pressure on the operating margin during the quarter which is 37.5%. During the quarter we returned $238 million to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. In addition, reflecting continued confidence in the fundamentals of our business over the long term, we're raising our quarterly dividend to $0.28 per share, up 4% from the prior year. Assets under management were $771 billion at the end of the first quarter, down slightly from $775 billion at the end of last year. More indicative of the results during the quarter were the average assets under management which were down $36 billion during the first quarter as compared to $778 billion at year-end. Operating income was $307 million in the quarter versus $356 million in the prior quarter. Earnings per share were $0.49 versus $0.58 in the prior quarter. And as noted earlier, we increased the dividend $0.28 per share and also purchased $125 million of stocks during the quarter. Before Loren goes into detail on the Company financials, let me take a moment to review the investment performance and flows during the quarter. Turning to slide 6 now, you will note investment performance is strong in the quarter with 72% of assets in the top half on a three-year basis and 76% were in the top half on a five-year basis. One year results partially reflect the underperformance of energy and financial sectors earlier in the year which impacted some of our valued portfolios. We've seen both of these sectors begin to recover somewhat in March and April and consequently possibly impacted the performance here to date, in fact with some very strong performance. On page 7 you will see positive active flows were experienced during the quarter were not as [indiscernible] to passive capabilities. Active flows were driven primarily by alternative capabilities, as we saw strong growth in real estate including both direct and REITs, a global targeted return. Those in the passive capabilities declined during the market volatility in January and February. They recovered in March, but not enough to returned to positive territory for the quarter. It's important to note that although passive flows were negative they were reduced by $1.5 billion of deleveraging from Invesco Mortgage Capital. As a reminder, there's no revenue impact related to those flows. Again we saw strong institutional flows during the quarter, in spite of the volatility which continues a series of positive institutional flows going back nearly two years. Client demand trends remain consistent, with particular strong interest in fixed-income real estate and GTR. Retail flows were impacted by the macro environment as investors weighed their options during the volatile quarter, despite seeing outflows in many equity mutual funds in the U.S. and EMEA, we saw continued strength in retail alternative capabilities, specifically GTR and real estate securities. As noted, our global target of assurance capability continues to attract strong flows globally, achieving $2.3 billion in net flows during the quarter across EMEA intuitional, across border, into the UK, retail, Asia-Pacific and North America. Despite some challenges in the first two months of the year, we still feel good about the momentum of our business. Flows in March were much better than January and February and we're experience solid flows in April. We continue to see strength across our global business, in particular within Asia-Pacific and EMEA. Before I hand the call over to Loren, let me say a few words about the new fiduciary rule released by the U.S. Department of Labor in early April. Ultimately, we believe this fiduciary rule is good for investors. That said, we continue to be concerned about the potential for unintended consequences of a rule that proposes such dramatic changes within the industry. It's well known that many investors are not saving enough to maintain their standard of living during retirement. The DOL Rule, it was intended to ensure that retirement savers get better advice by expanding the types of retirement investment advice covered by the fiduciary protections. We said all along investors are best served by using advisors who can help and assist -- to help and assess their risk tolerance, savings horizons and other factors to develop a portfolio that help them achieve their investment objectives. The key outcome of the new rule could be greater confidence in the advice that investors are receiving. Investors have been through a lot in the last seven years since this national crisis. Anything that builds confidence could encourage them to save more for retirement and seek advice that helps them achieve their investment objectives, that is good for investors and would also benefit the industry as well. The DOL Rule is long and complex. The rule and its related documents are more than 1000 pages. We're working to understand how our distributor partners are interpreting the rule which will help us support and assist them. We believe the recent acquisition of Jemstep, the market-leading provider of advisor-focused fiducial solutions, opens up further opportunities to provide meaningful support to our clients. As we engage with our clients and seek to understand how they will approach adopting the new rules, we will look, too, for opportunities for Jemstep to assist our distribution partners. We believe that Invesco's very well positioned to our clients as the DOL Rule is implemented. Because Invesco puts our clients first in everything we do and has tremendous experience in addressing regulatory topics, we view this as an opportunity to further deepen our relationship, provide new capabilities that enhance our business. I would like to turn it over to Loren to review the financials in more detail. Loren Starr : Thanks, Marty. Quarter-over quarter our total AUM decreased $4.1 million or 0.5% and that was driven by dispositions of $3.6 billion, negative market returns of $3 billion, outflows from the QQQs of $2.6 billion and long term net outflows of $1.3 billion. These are partially offset by inflows from the money market of $3.8 billion and positive FX translation of $2.6 billion. Our average AUM for the first quarter was $747.5 billion which was down 4.6% versus the fourth quarter. Our net revenue yield came in at 43.8 basis points and that was a decrease of 1.4 basis points versus Q4.  Currency mix reduced the yield by 0.7 basis points. One less day in the period reduced the yield by 0.4 basis points. A decrease in performance fees and other revenues together accounted for the remainder of 0.3 basis points. Now I'm going to turn to the operating results. Our net revenues declined by $68 million or 7.7% quarter-over quarter to $818.1 million which includes the negative FX rate impact of $12.6 million. Within the net revenue number, you will see that investor management fees fell by $78.5 million or 7.8% to $930.3 million. This reflects the lower average AUM, the changes in AUM product and currency mix and one less day during the quarter. FX reduced fourth quarter management fees by $16.1 million. Service and distribution revenues declined by $9.9 million or 4.8%, reflecting lower average AUM during the quarter. FX decreased service and distribution revenues by $0.2 million. Performance fees came in at $15.5 million in Q1 and they were earned from a variety of different investment capabilities, including $9.1 million from UK equities. Foreign exchange reduced performance fees by $0.6 million. Other revenues in the first quarter were $24 million. That was a drop of $5 million due to lower transaction fees from real estates, as well as a decline in new IT rollovers. Foreign exchange decreased revenues by $0.1 million. Third-party distribution service and advisory expense which we net against gross revenues, fell by $28.7 million or 7.6% and this movement was in line with lower revenues derived from retail AUM, foreign exchange decreases expenses by $4.4 million. Moving on down the slide, you will see that our adjusted operating expenses at $511 million decreased by $19.4 million or 3.7%, relative to the prior quarter. Foreign exchange decreased operating expenses by $6.5 million during the quarter. Employee compensation came in $340.3 million, an increase of $1.5 million or 0.4%. This was driven by a normal seasonal increase in payroll taxes which was largely offset by a reduction in variable compensation. FX reduced compensation by $4.3 million. Marketing expense decreased $9.2 million or 26.2% to $25.4 million. This drop is due to a lower level of advertising, literature, travel and client events during the quarter. These expenditures were deferred in light of the volatile market conditions that we were in. Foreign exchange reduced marketing expense by $0.2 million in the quarter. Property, office and technology expenses came in at $81.1 million in the quarter. That was an increase of $0.7 million over the fourth quarter, driven by additional outsource administrative expenses. FX decreased these expenses by $0.9 million. General and administrative expenses at $64.2 million decreased $12.4 million or 16.2%. This decline was the result of focused expense management during the quarter, as nonessential professional services and other nonessential discretionary spending was reduced or postponed. FX decreased G&A by $1.1 million. Continuing on down the slide, you will see that non-operating income decreased $2.9 million compared to the fourth quarter. Included in the first quarter were non-cash negative marks to March markets on inter-company loans of $7.1 million and $1.4 million on trading investments. These were slightly offset by a $3.4 million gain which was realized on our pound sterling U.S. dollar hedge. Just to remind people, as we've said in the past, we have in place a hedge through the end of Q1 2017 with a strike price of $1.4355. This is the pound hedge that we put in place. The Firm's effective tax rate on pretax adjusted net income in Q1 was 26.5%. That was down from 26 6% in the prior quarter which then brings us to our adjusted EPS of $0.49 and adjusted net operating margin of 37.5%. Before I turn things back over to Marty, I just want to provide a quick update on the business optimization work that we began to implement in Q4 of last year. As a reminder, as we stated, we expect to incur up to $85 million in expenses during 2016 related to these activities, with an expected run rate savings, however, of $30 million to $45 million through the beginning of 2017. In the first quarter we incurred $6.8 million of the $85 million in optimization costs. That was primarily in the form of staff severance costs and as previously discussed, these expenses do impact our U.S. GAAP P&L, but they are being excluded from our non-GAAP results. And also, just to finalize the point, we did generate approximately $2 million in permanent run rate savings in Q1 as a result of the optimization efforts to date which was in line with our plan. And so with that I'm going to turn it back over to Marty. Martin Flanagan : Thank you Loren. We will open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. First one is from Craig of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Craig Siegenthaler : Can you provide an update on the U.S. equities business? I'm just looking here at slide 18 and looking at some of the performance across some of these capabilities and I just want to see if you maybe have any plan to sort of get some of this performance stronger here? Martin Flanagan : Good follow-up question. So, that was my point. Actually, if you look at the value portfolios, they have had quite a bit of exposure to energy and financials in particular. And the year-to-date performance actually has been quite stunning and that's really started in the last couple of weeks here, where things like comstock is ninety-percentile, growth and income four percentile, American value three-percentile, so really, really very strong. So strong teams, really do a good job with their philosophies and it is a high conviction approach and yes, the number are coming in really strong. Craig Siegenthaler : Got it. And then just a follow-up question for Loren. And Loren, I know there's a lot of moving pieces here and it is always tough to anticipate data, but the operating margin's always depressed in the first quarter due to a few items that we all know about. But A1 finished the quarter much stronger and you have those initiatives in place. So I'm wondering, do we have a shot of getting the margin back to the 40% range with stable market share? Loren Starr : We certainly would hope to see margins improved through the course of the year. Obviously there is a lot of moving parts, lot of volatility, we've got the pound and the currency topics which have been bouncing around a little bit. So I'm not going to put out a number in terms of what I think margins could be. Obviously, the inherent strength of the business is there and as markets stabilize, currency stabilizes, we should continue to see the very positive trend of incremental margins working in our favor to pull up our overall rate and sort of, margin overall. But it will depend ultimately on what the markets do through the rest of the year. We're, as you know, still at the level of assets below where we were on average for last year and so I would say we're still catching up to where we were last year in terms of overall margin potential. Martin Flanagan : There is absolutely nothing in the way of us exceeding 40% margins where they were again. And I think that the issue, as Loren sited, it is a timing issue more than anything else with markets. But I think also very importantly, regardless, even though the market has come back some and flows are picking up again, we continue with the optimization programs. And we're going to finish those and again we'll just be net better off because of all of those activities. Loren Starr : And just to remind people, the optimization program is operating through the course of 2016 and we do not really get to the full run rate benefit until we get to the end of the year which we talked about the $30 million to $45 million potential. We're going to see some continued benefit through the course of this year, but again, $2 million here, $3.5 million, $4.5 million, you know, it's going to kind of begin to scale through the course of the year. But it's still not at a level, I would say that's going to be the most dramatically move the margin picture. Operator : Next question is from Glenn of Evercore. Sir, your line is now open. Glenn Schorr : Two part on the follow-up there, with ending AUM over 3%, better than average and April positive end-year, positive comments on flows. I look at the revenue decline in the quarter, year-on-year and half of that was performance fees. So the first question is if you could talk through what we should expect from here over the progression of the year on performance fees? I know they're tough to predict, but it was half the decline in revenues in the quarter, so I think that might have a big influence on the margin in question. Loren Starr : So you get to one of my favorite topics, Glenn, predicting performance fees which again, I still will continue to profess, I'm not very able to do that. Generally performance fees are lighter through the last half of the year, their the heaviest in the first quarter and so you sort of see the heavy performance recorded already. So my expectation of performance fees through the remainder of the year, as I often said, is sort of place-marked, earmarked, when we're thinking about our planning, somewhere around that $5 million a quarter which is an estimate that assumes a lot of different things kicking in across the globe, but no one thing driving it. We would hope to see the other revenue line improve somewhat because the volatility in the first quarter was pretty extreme. And so as I mentioned, in transaction fees and real estate rollovers, in the UIT business, were really slowed down by that degree of volatility. If we get to a more stable and that's a big if, but if we get to a more stable market environment that line item should be closer to, sort of, that $30 million to $35 million number through each quarter. Glenn Schorr : And on the expense side, if you look at comp marketing and G&A oil declines, in line with non-performance fees revenue or better, I know this is a softy question, but how much of that is response to the weak revenue environment in 1Q versus more run-rateish type levels? Loren Starr : So the optimization work is what's going to drive a permanent reduction and so that's stuff, I don't want to say real, but it certainly -- and there is work we can do and we have done in first quarter and that we're going to continue to do through the rest of the year, in terms of trying to manage our discretionary expenses to lower levels. Some of that you can defer for a reasonable period of time, some of it you cannot defer for forever. And so we do have some seasonal costs related to marketing that will be a little bit heavier in the first and the fourth quarters, as they always are. And so it's just good to know that we want to continue to be present and then continue to be able to work with our clients and have client events as we've always had. That's important and it helps the business, it helps the growth of the business and we don't want to differ those expenses for a year, for example. So I think the other thing that we see in the second quarter versus the first quarter would be some of the impacts around salary increases and differed compensation which are typically, you get a differential of about two months' worth of impact in the second quarter versus the first quarter and between those two items, that's probably somewhere around an increase of $5 million to $6 million. So again, there are some things that we're going to manage and we're going to continue to apply a very thoughtful and disciplined approach to our hiring and to our discretionary expense management. I don't want to give guidance explicitly quarter-to quarter, also because just given the volatility of markets and FX, it really becomes quite difficult for us to give useful information. Operator : Next question is from Bill of Citi. Sir, your line is now open. Bill Katz : I want to come back to Jemstep for a moment. One of your peers is out there as well with their own platform, they have actually signed up a few third-party distributors to accelerate the opportunity there. Can you talk a little bit about how you plan to leverage the platform and maybe synthesize that with your comments around the DOL? Martin Flanagan : Bill, we're very excited about it and we look at it differently than the other, you want to call it technologies, robos out there, it was actually developed for the advisors themselves. And it is an open platform and it can use everything, all vehicles from ETFs to mutual funds and those are the limitations of some of the others. And ours is to be supportive of the advisors, not to compete with them and so there is no direct-to-consumer element to it and that was by design. And so we're able to just have a much deeper relationship with our clients, all the thought leadership that we have is an element also, delivering our solutions capabilities to various different clients through that, so another very good venue there. And again the combination of the high conviction fundamental and factor based capabilities, whether they are mutual funds, ETFs, UITs. So we think it is also going to broaden our channel, our exposure, in the RIA market and that has been sort of an early indicator and quite frankly, the level of interest has been quite surprising. And I think frankly somewhat driven by the DOL also, because they are looking for technologies to help serve their clients and it is a market that really needs tools like this. Bill Katz : This follow-up for Loren, on just margins overall I think you talked about -- maybe it was in the press release or maybe it was your prepared comments -- that G&A was a bit on the softer side as you delayed some items. How do you think about that on a go-forward basis? And then stepping back, pretty wide range on the optimization between, it was $30 million to $45 million, what would define the higher end of that range in terms of things to be done from here incrementally? Loren Starr : So on G&A, that is a line item that we probably in some ways are best able to manage. It has to do with travel and entertainment and use of professional services and so those are things that are easier for us to slow down since they tend to be not as business critical as some of the other things around marketing for example. So we would hope to see continued success in terms of managing that line item. Although I would say there may be some things around some of the regulatory side that could drive certain needs and that could drive some cost in the G&A around risk management and other compliance efforts. But I still think that is an area we're putting a lot of focus on to manage and maintain somewhere around were run rate level in Q1. In terms of the broad range of the $30 million $45 million, there are still several of these initiatives that are going through the finalization of their planning phases. And so we don't have clear line insight of the ultimate impact and so that's what is driving that spread. Again, I think we're hopeful we're going to get to the higher end of that range, but we want to be thoughtful and not commit to it until we're more certain which we'll begin to get more certain as we get through the course of this year and we will provide that feedback to you as soon as we know. Operator : Next is from Michael of Sandler O'Neill. Sir, your line is open. Michael Kim : First Marty, you mentioned solid flows in April. First, I just want to be clear, does that imply solid net inflows? And then I'm also assuming that refers to the Firm-wide total, so any color on magnitude or some of the underlying drivers behind that? Martin Flanagan : You're a good skeptic, so thank you for the question. So yes, I meant inflows. Total net inflows is about $3.7 billion right now and $1.9 billion are long term flows. The institutional pipeline, again and you're going to get tired of hearing it, but it is a good news story, it is an all-time high, again, so that is another area of ongoing strength for us. I will say we're in that season where, that's today, what the flows are, this is a month where there is all that rebalancing throughout the industry. So we don't have line of sight, who knows what happens between now and the rest of the week, right?  So it could be a little noiseful, but I will tell you the quarter, if it stays on this path, will be a good quarter. But it could look a noisy, you know, month to month, just because of all the industries are rebalancing which is pretty typical and will not be unique to us. A very different environment, I'd say right now, than just where we were in January/February. Loren Starr : In terms of what is really being quite successful right now, Michael, we're seeing continued things around real estate, fixed income alternative, global asset allocations, multi-asset products at quant, are all highly featured in our institutional pipeline. And then the other -- regionally, we continue to see really strong flow momentum, both on the retail and the institutional side in Asia-Pac in particular. And then another note, just in terms of ETFs. ETFs are positive in every single region that we're operating in terms of positive flows and so we continue to see the interest in that capability being at a high level. Michael Kim : And then maybe one for you, Loren, sorry for kind of the narrowness of the questions here. But you called out some expenses that were sort of deferred or postponed or maybe some non-essential costs that maybe fell by the wayside. Just so I'm clear, are those items part of the business optimization plan or are the incremental to, sort of, the $30 million to $45 million of savings you've identified? Loren Starr : Yes, that's incremental. What you are seeing in the first quarter, the expense reduction, only $2 million of that has to do with business optimization, as I mentioned. Everything else is related to us just managing expenses in a fairly disciplined and try and differ what we can differ. We're going to continue to do, as I mentioned, through the course of the year. The business optimization's going to continue to roll and help on top of that activity to improve our overall expense management. Operator : Next is from Brennan of UBS. Sir, your line is now open. Brennan Hawken : My first would be on regulation and Marty, you referenced unintended consequences which is certainly fair as a risk here. But do you have an estimate that you could size of how much of your AUM is in retirement accounts currently in therefore, at least at this stage, given what we know, the most clearly impacted by this DOL final rule? And then, based on what you saw happen in the UK that just went through, RDR, what lessons did you learn by going through that? And I'm guessing that had something to do with the unintended consequence comment and how does that put you in a position to be better prepared for this rule here in the U.S.? Martin Flanagan : We're all in the advice business, being good fiduciaries is a critical thing. And putting clients first is absolutely essential and the industry of trust matters a lot. And so at that level, the notion of fiduciary ruling having better outcomes for end-clients, that is a great thing. I think we're all supportive of it. But it's really the magnitude of what has been included that went way beyond that notion. And what we learned with RDR and it's just an absolute fact, there are more unadvised individuals because of RDR right now and there probably will be individuals that need advice the most and the totality of the cost has gone up and I think that is a really bad outcome. And I think there's a lot of -- and you can see that happening here. That said, so what are the lessons learned that we had from that is be aware of that. We also see, that is also why we went down the Jemstep route. We know we can help clients with tools like this, advice more accessible for those that could be hurt frankly from the rule. And again, that is not the intent of the rule, that's what we think as possible. And also, very importantly, how we position the firm. And I think this is what's being missed in the conversation. What money managers are going to do well and we might be challenged. If you are an index hugger, active management, I would say you are in trouble. If you have high conviction fundamentals and factor based capabilities like we do, I think you are positioned very, very well. And if you look at the work we have done, when you look at high conviction actives, you do get better returns through market cycles, but it is not just excess return, you have better down-site capture. You also have better risk-adjusted returns and I think that's really the value proposition that collectively we need to make clear. It has been a beta run since 2009, largely with lots of government intervention and you start to look at quarters like this where all of a sudden you see active managers outperform the S&P by 300 basis points, 350 basis points that is pretty impressive. So again, I think you have to have high conviction fundamentals and the factor base, we believe very, very strongly in the combination thereof. We think positions us very well. And much of that would, as you would say, come out of lessons learned that we learned out in the UK. Tried not to be long-winded but-- Brennan Hawken : And then follow-up, just a little bit more ticky-tacky, I think you'd said that the ETF flows were positive across regions. We're you talking about 1Q? And it looked like passive redemptions have been accelerating here over the last several quarters, so is that [indiscernible] driven? What's driving that? Can you help us unpack and square those two statements a bit? Loren Starr : I will answer that, because it was my statement I think. So I was referring, positive in every region and that's April, so I was really referring to the April numbers. However, I would say in the first quarter, the first two months were not great month for our passive or whatever, ETF offerings, but I would say March was a record in terms of our sales. So it really came back strongly and as I sort of indicated, it's continuing strong into April. The passive category that we show, Marty mentioned it, got very much affected by the deleveraging of IVRs. So it is really is not the fill of noise in our numbers, because the deleveraging has no impact on revenues and even though we count and as an outflow, it's just really part of how their managing that [indiscernible]. So I would not read too much into the first quarter passive outflow story, really just understanding that we do believe that our ETFs business is very well-positioned and it is gaining momentum. It is the most diversified set of smart beta offerings and we're gaining share in smart data year-to-date, so we feel very confident about our ability to continue to grow that business. Operator : Next is from Ken of JPMorgan. Sir, your line is now open. Ken Chow : Couple for Loren. Maybe first, when we think about the management fee rates for active and passive funds, both were down a lot for the quarter, I think maybe largely expected, maybe the magnitude was off a bit. Maybe can you first talk about how the fee rate should recover given the bounce back in equity markets, foreign markets, various currencies? Should we recover a lot of the way or part of the way or all the way, any color there would be great? And then if you could maybe flesh out better for us places where the mix changed in 1Q that maybe had the most pronounced impact on the fee rate declined this quarter? Thanks. Loren Starr : Yes, so I think we will begin to see recovery of the net revenue yield and particularly as we get into the last half of the year versus the first, there is some day-count stuff that just happens normally and you always have that benefit of the last half having more days than the first half. So I want to make people aware of that, it is no secret. In terms of the mix, obviously we're having some reduced performance fee expectations coming into Q2 versus what we realized in Q1. Some of that will be offset by hopefully higher other revenues which will help move the fee rate up. And I think we also will see the success of our ETF business, the success of our fixed income business, a lot of that is in the pipeline. They tend to have lower fee rates, so there will be probably some degree of mix issue that's working a little bit against the higher fee. The flows that we have been getting into EMEA and U.S. retail have been more subdued and it can be a driver of fee rate mix. And I would say that is going to be a little bit of a question mark, particularly as we get through the whole Brexit thing and understanding what happened in the UK, that may have some impact, we don't know. It hasn't any impact on flows per say that we can identify yet. But it could have some impact on flows. Based on our modeling and our thinking, we expect to see the fee rate drive up further each quarter as we move through the course of the year. I think the positive elements generally around mix still exists. And I would say that on the institutional pipeline, even despite what I said around fixed income coming in, overall the fee rate on the products that are coming far exceed the fee rate on the products that would be leading, so again a positive element on the fee rate. FX will also have a big impact, too and I think we saw a pretty big impact on FX in the quarter, 0.7 basis points and so that was with UK down 5% quarter-over quarter, the pound. Just to understand that those dynamics are probably one of the big drivers of fee rate issues. And hopefully that does recover and we get to break and we get stabilization of the pound. Ken Chow : And then on the other revenue obviously down a bunch for the quarter, can you maybe help us on an outlook for this? There is a number of components, real estate and UITs are one, how should this line be growing over time? And maybe how should it be growing compared to something like the management fee line? So obviously both will move up and down depending on market conditions, but should the other revenue be growing faster or slower over time? And then maybe more near term in terms of an outlook. Based on your guys' views on real estate activity and maybe what you are seeing more idiosyncratically in the UIT markets, how should we think about that line item maybe for the rest of the year? Loren Starr : So I think it will grow, certainly off of what we view as a pretty low base in Q1, that now that I mention it, should pick up. Generally our real estate business has been growing well and so that will as a theme help allow that line item to grow. And I say particularly as it's seeing success in Europe and Asia, that's where a lot of the funds actually do have transaction fees and that work in the U.S., some of the products that are managed by our real estate team aren't able to generate transaction fees so that will be a U.S./non-U.S. mix. But we think the outside the U.S. is an opportunity for the real estate business and still has a lot of opportunity to grow at a faster rate even than on the U.S. side. The UIT business, we would hope to see that grow. It has been a very competitive market, particularly because it is somewhat transactional when people decide to roll their UITs, if you do get volatility they're just going to wait and see. And so we would want to see a market stabilization which would allow our ability to roll those things more rapidly and generate more of the revenues as well. But we think that the UIT business has a lot of opportunity to grow and so we would expect to see between those two elements that other line item grow. Again, on an organic growth basis, we should be able to grow in that 3% to 5% level that we talked about before. Operator : Next is from Chris of William Blair. Sir, your line is now open. Chris Shutler : I think early last year there was a really good story around cross-border, some of the European products are flowing very well. It seems like performance there has softened a little bit on a couple of products, others are still very good. The environment has clearly gotten tougher, so maybe just talk about how you're feeling about cross-border, that product range and the growth outlook for the remainder of the year? Martin Flanagan : We still feel a very important part of our business, we still look at it as an engine of growth over the next few years. It's the magnitude of change and the impact to the Company has been very positive the last few years. Clearly with the market uncertainty, you then you do some of the macro-environment there, whether it be bright 50, some of the concerns on the continent, it did definitely slow down the quarter. That said, we just feel very well-positioned. We look to continue to gain market share. With regard to performance, somewhat of a similar story -- some of the U.S. portfolios I mentioned, there's some of the exposure in some European portfolios were in financials and some energy and so there was that little bit of a drag per period, but again, they are very, very good managers, excellent and highly regarded. I would classify it more as market uncertainty than lack of confidence in the investment team. Uncertainty dwindles some, it will never go away. I think we will be back on that growing path. Loren Starr : Our product range in Europe, still more than half of the assets are in the first quartile, so it is very strong. And when you look at the second quartile, on the five-year basis, it is more than 90% of the assets are beating peers on a five-year basis. So we think there is plenty of opportunity for us to be able to satisfy our clients' needs with the products that we have. You're right, some have soft a little bit relative to the end of the year, but it is still overall exceedingly strong. Martin Flanagan : Not just retail, but again EMEA in particular is another area where the growth prospects for the institutional business are very, very strong. Early days of success from what we're anticipating over the next couple of years. Chris Shutler : One other one on PowerShares. There was some talk last year I think of going through a bit of a -- I don't know what to call it, a repositioning or rebranding type of exercise, much better on factors. I know you have done some of that stuff there, rolled out some new product, but it's been I think fairly targeted to date. So I guess the question's just, do you feel like you need to be more aggressive there in making changes to that business? It looks like if you exclude the Qs, over the last year through March the flows have been fairly minimal relative to pretty favorable factor up for the industry as a whole. Martin Flanagan : Good question, I would answer it two different ways. It is one of the areas that we have invested in quite strongly over the last number of years, because we anticipated, as Loren talked about, the factor base element of it, it's a growing part of the industry. We're a leader there with some very broad, long-dated track record and so the investments have been meaningful. With regard to the flows, I think what you have to look at is how narrow the flows were within the factor based ETFs. And probably from September through the end of February is about as narrow as you've ever seen.  And what we're now seeing, as Loren was talking about, why are the flows picking up the way that we're? We're seeing a broadening of interest in the range of capabilities that we have. So we look at it as an important subset of that whole factor base that we have as an organization and we feel we're absolutely on top of it. And I think you will start to see it again in the flows here as we move through the year. Operator : The next question is from Dan of Jefferies. Sir, your line is now open. Dan Fannon : First on EMEA or Asia, you continue to have great flows there, the $3.6 billion or so, the only region of influence. Can you talk about the concentration, I guess, within those flows, either through the distribution areas or products or how diversified those flows are? Loren Starr : In EMEA, generally we have seen huge success with our GTR product, both institutionally and on the retail side. And that has been probably our primary driver of inflows in the region. So it has been probably a little bit concentrated to your point in that capability. I mean we still think there's some very, very strong capabilities, like our Quan capability for example, I think it is called structured equity, doing very well.  This current environment in the first quarter was an anomaly for everyone in terms of what behavior you would expect. And hopefully we will begin to see more take-on in the broader sales picture than just GTR. But GTR by the way, I just want to minimize that point, is doing very, very well. It is outperforming some its competitors so it has really been a success for us. And the other thing I would also say, I know your question is just on EMEA, again I can't say how happy we're that our Asia-Pac business has been really, really strong. So the outside the U.S. which is both Asia-Pac and EMEA, has been very diverse in Asia-Pac in terms of what's being taken on through equities alternatives and fixed income. Martin Flanagan : And I would just add that, again, it's not a concern about GTR success. We think it's a positive and again Loren made the point before, if you look at the range of capabilities in EMEA and the very, very strong performance and the reputation of the teams, it is not a concern as far as I'm concerned. Dan Fannon : And then I guess to follow-up on the optimization, I think you said $2 million was realized this quarter. Can you give us a kind run rate or path through the year to think about how the rest of that is going to flow through or the piece of that benefit? Loren Starr : It's just going to step up each quarter. And so the $2 million would probably get to more like a $3.5 million, then $4.5 million, $5.5 million, as you work through the course of the year. Those are sort of rough numbers and so timing could be a little bit off. But that will get us ultimately, as we get into 2017 and that run rate of $30 million to $45 million which we feel very confident and whether we get to $45 million, we'll let you know as I mentioned, as we get through the course of the year. Operator : Next question is from Eric of Royal Bank of Canada. Sir, your line is open. Kenneth Lee : This is Kenneth Lee on for Eric. Just had a question. There was previously mentioned that they tend to do a share repurchase at perhaps elevated rates this year. Just want to get a better handle on potential amounts that you guys could tend to think about, whether there's any kind of restrictions in terms of the cash balance that you have on hand in terms of your onshore or offshore? Just want to get a better handle on how to think about that. Thanks. Loren Starr : In terms of where we're at the end of the quarter, we had total cash of $1.455 billion -- what's tied up in the UK subgroup, as we've talked about from a regulatory perspective, is $651 million. And so sort of the free and clear is that $804 million. Q1 is always a very heavy cash need quarter because of taxes and bonus payments, so we fell below sort of our self-imposed target of $1 billion, but we're not concerned about that. We're still going to continue to be targeting a very healthy capital return in terms of dividends and buybacks as a percentage of our operating cash flow to shareholders. So in terms of our Q1 buyback which we talked about, that was up 63% versus what we did Q1 in 2015, so quite a step up, $125 million. But down a little bit versus the fourth quarter due to just generally the lower operating cash that we're generating now because our asset levels were affected by what happened to the market. But in terms of percentage payouts, we're sort of in line with what we were thinking about in terms of last year and the percentage of cash flow. But because our overall operating levels have been impacted by markets, the total levels may be somewhat smaller. If you look at what we paid out, it'd be probably more in line with an $80 million quarter run rate which gets us at that same payout rate that you've seen in the past. But with that said, we're going to continue to be very opportunistic. If we see further impact on stock price which we think is unwarranted, if we get through some of the Brexit and understand the dynamics there, we may feel more able to commit more capital. Again, it's one of these things that we feel very well-positioned to return capital, but we're being a little bit cautious just given the volatility in the market right now. Operator : Next question is from Robert of KBW. Sir, your line is now open. Robert Lee : You didn't think you're going to get through a call without a Brexit question? So I guess I'll ask one. Aside from the currency hedge -- it may be obvious on how you think about contingency planning for it. I mean, how do you -- besides obviously huge unknowns, if it happens or what happens after happens, how can you prepare for that? I know it is maybe less about where products are registered, but operationally what are some of the things you try to put in place? Martin Flanagan : It's a good question and needless to say, there's a team of people that have been working on it just in case that happens. And the good news, just as you were pointing to, the way we have our product ranges set up right now, we're in a very, very fine shape. And also the way that we have our operations is also set up in a way that we will not be impacted negatively. There is a small exposure. If we sort of extrapolate, I think it's a couple billion dollars of some assets that we think could sort of get caught up in the crosshairs. But again, this is scenario planning, so exposure's high. So from that point of view, we're very well-placed. The issue is, if it is an outvote, it is going to be the stated time, they have until mid-2018, that they would still be a part of the EU. I would say most people that are very involved in this will tell you the likelihood of trade agreements and the like are going to take longer than that. It's just hard to assess what the psychological impact on investors would be. That said, we just think relatively, we're very well-placed to deal with it as it goes through. And I think really just getting past the referendum is going to net positive regardless of what the outcome is. Robert Lee : I guess maybe this is maybe a presentation question or what not. But could you maybe give us a sense -- in the past as AUM, what proportion of that is not fee generating or manager fee generating? Clearly last quarter there were noise and flows around de-leveraging of basically non-fee assets and clearly you break out the triple Q flows which don't generate managing fees, but neither do UITs and other things. So if we're really trying to look at kind of the pure asset base there that's generating the manager fee revenues, what would that be today? And maybe the one request that may be a helpful metric to think about providing going forward? Loren Starr : Okay, so I think when you look at, the cues, that is about $38 billion, the IBR leverage is somewhere around $20 billion and then the UIT business which does generate revenues when they get rolled, but once they have been put in place they don't -- that is about $18 billion. So those are the big chunks that you'd have to add up to figure out what is non-revenue-generating. Robert Lee : And then maybe just one last modeling question. I mean understanding a lot of moving pieces in comp and whatnot, if we think of it the first quarter here, was there anything in there -- I mean obviously there is always some seasonality in the U.S. -- but beyond maybe some modest seasonality there, is there anything in there that we should think of maybe that falls away next quarter outside of the expense initiatives that are in place? Or should we be thinking that all else equals is kind of a reasonable run rate? Loren Starr : In terms of the Q2 through Q1 impact, you have obviously payroll taxes falling away, so that is a benefit of some $15 million, $20 million. But then you've got some offset, as I mentioned, in terms of dollar increases and differed compensation and sort plus $6 million. We obviously are beginning to work through some of the optimization things. And so you will get some continued run rate benefit going -- it's probably a benefit of $3.5 million to $2 million if that does translate, another $1.5 million benefit. Now some of that make get offset if we actually have a higher level of assets and revenues, some of our intended compensation will scale up with our operating income, as it always does. So all those things together, you're probably -- hopefully, comp will actually be back up with the benefit of higher asset levels and market driving intended compensation ahead. Operator : Next question is from Michael of Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is now open. Michael Yule : Just curious under what conditions you think Invesco can grow organically? Your business closely resembles another in the industry, yet they grow consistently off a higher base. And I know you're targeting 3% to 5% organically to grow and flows sound like they are pretty strong in April. But I'm just curious under what condition can we see Invesco grow consistently from here? Martin Flanagan : I think if you look, historically we've been one of the most absolute consistent growers throughout all the different market scenarios. I think what we have learned, if you look at the last quarter again, when you are in a January/February environment it is just very difficult. When you get more to an environment that we're in now where I guess there's still plenty world uncertainties, a Firm like us, you will growth. And you'll see it both institutionally and retail and again as both Loren and I brought out, you can see looking at different parts of the world right, again, each region is actually growing. You don't need a lot, it's just where you have a massive uncertainty that it is very difficult. Loren Starr : And I think you've said in the past, Martin, too, but when you get an equity-led market which I don't know if we're going to see that anytime soon. But if we do get an equity-led market, we will probably be able to grow much more quickly than you've seen us do in the past because a large percentage of our AUM is equity. Again that would be the converse of what we've been in, right? Just volatility. Michael Yule : And then just a follow up on operating leverage, you cut expenses nicely about 9% or so year-on-year in the quarter, but revenues fell about 11.5% or so. So just curious how you're thinking about operating leverage here and what level of market return -- A, on growth, do we need to see in order to see positive operating leverage? And can you improve margins at flat AUM levels? Loren Starr : We've said that when you get no market benefit, so if you just stayed flat to where we're on an average asset basis, the second quarter to first quarter, that organic growth would allow us to see revenues improve and so we would be able to get incremental margins up sort of 50%. And if we had a market that's helping us grow and FX I would say as well, incremental margins could be much higher to 65%. So we would hope to see, as Marty had talked about, our operating leverage begin to work in our favor as opposed to work against us as assets are recovering. And we absolutely will see that happening, particularly as we manage to maintain a fairly tight control on the expense side. So that would be our hope, is to get us back to that 40% and hopefully this year just through organic growth and expense management. If we have market on top of that, we should be able to do better than that. So there's nothing that stopped us from generating very strong operating leverage on the plus side if you have positive markets plus FX plus organic growth working in our favor. Operator : Next question is from Brian of Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is now open. Brian Modoff : I'm sorry if I missed this, but the $1.9 billion in long term flows in April, what areas are those in? Loren Starr : So the $1.9 billion in long term flows were across a variety of capabilities, investment grade fixed income, we had bank loans, we had some aging equity. We had real estates, we also had PowerShares in each of the regions across a variety of capabilities. Probably a lot of it was low volatility offering and I think we did continue to see some positive flows in GTR as I mentioned which has been a big driver. Pretty diverse capability, maybe more heavily focused on alternatives than anything else. Brian Modoff : And just Marty, I guess a little bigger picture on the Department of Labor, it sounds like you have a very good sort of offensive game plan with the Jemstep product and the open architecture model and being able use your very wide product range, including the factor-based ETFs. But if you think about sort of the defensive nature that a lot of the asset managers will be going through that have high concentrations of active product, is there any type of plan to work with the advisors in terms of pricing class structures of the shares that you have now? And I guess if you could comment on how you think adviser behavior will turn out, post DOL Rule. And then sorry if I missed the assets in mutual funds and IRAs and 401(k)s. I'm not sure if you just -- Martin Flanagan : It's a good question and I think the reality is we've got to believe it's going to be taken by the distributors and how they are going to want to be addressing the rule. That said we're and I'm sure everybody else is wanting to be incredibly helpful to distributors as they work through the issues. That said, what I believe strongly is that there is a very, very important role for advisers. We believe that's the best way to get outcomes for clients and also believe strongly that high conviction fundamental capabilities and factor-based capabilities are what advisors want to do because they know that's how they can give a better value proposition to their clients. And just mechanically, the industry is pretty close already, through the range of share classes that will be available, that the vast majority, they will be an advisor-based plans. And these are stripped-down share classes that really you know what's going to be used. And so I would say money managers are -- I'm sure most everybody is well-placed in that area. But again, it is a little bit of -- time to take the lead working with the distributors on it. It is really complex actually, the role, but the high-level assumptions that we've all made are probably still in place. Brian Modoff : And sorry, did the mutual -- I don't know if you disclosed this -- the mutual fund assets in U.S. IRAs and 401(k)s? Martin Flanagan : We didn't. Again so much of our assets are in omnibus and quite frankly, if we just made the determination by coming up with a number, it'd probably be more misleading than helpful. We would probably have at industry levels or just slightly less than someone with regard to exposure. That is our estimate. Brian Modoff : And do you think advisors will factor in the help that you are giving them, including with Jemstep, in terms of thinking about the least conflicted and best product for their clients? And using, say Invesco products, in conjunction with the Jemstep offering as sort of the best low-cost, better-performing option. Martin Flanagan : Let me answer this way, again, we've talked about the range of capabilities. We think that is very important. Jemstep is open architecture which is very important. That's the only way we can be credible in helping our distribution partners and if it's important to them, it's important to us. That said, the other element is we have Invesco Consulting which has been a really, really important part of the value proposition we provide to advisors to help them work through all these different topics. That and the thought leadership in combination are going to be, we think very, very strong forces and us being into a position to -- be strongly placed to help our distribution partners do what they need to do. Operator : And last question in queue is from Chris of Wells Fargo. Sir, your line is now open. Chris Harris : The record institutional pipeline, wondering if you guys could speak to the size of that if possible? And then I know we have the State of Rhode Island Mandate in there, so maybe talk qualitatively as to how it looks excluding that mandate? Loren Starr : The good news is that the State of Rhode Island Mandate is not in this number. It does not include that. And so the record number, we're up 50% versus prior-year. We're up about 5% versus prior quarter. We've traditionally not and I think we will probably continue the tradition of not giving explicit numbers, because they can be misleading in terms the ins and the outs. And this is really what we have line of sight of in terms of the ins, but we don't have as much of a clear line of sight on the out. But in terms of indicative levels and the pipeline and the success you have seen on the institutional side which has been, I think you've it in every single quarter. We feel very confident that we will continue to see growth in terms of the sales or success in that channel. Chris Harris : I want to come back to one second I was asked earlier and that is regarding your long term growth targets, 3% to 5%. I'm not sure if you guys had really thought about it this way, but when you guys were thinking about that growth rate, what kind of level of growth were you thinking you would need in active equity in order to get there? In other words, can active equity sort of be flattish or negative and Invesco could still potentially hit that 3% to 5% target? Loren Starr : I think absolutely. Across every single market that we're looking at that and I think that is the point, is that it's the consistency. We will not be the fastest grower in the industry because that going to mean you've got the one product that everyone wants in that one market. And then because we have a very diversified set of offerings, some are entirely active, others are on the more passive side and so depending on the market that we're in, we should be able to grow at a more, I'd say, modest rate but a still very good rate of that 3% to 5%. And it could be in terms of those markets scenarios where active is an outflow and we're winning on the passive side. That's not going to be every market, but it certainly has been a current market where we're seeing the interest in passive being at a higher level than some of the active offerings. But again, you've seen our active and passive both actually succeeding in this environment. Martin Flanagan : And I just want to reiterate a point that Loren made earlier too. We feel strongly that the 3% to 5% is very, very achievable and that's really -- we have not been in, for a good number of years, a market that is kind to active and equity investing. And I do believe that is going to change. I know there's a lot of doubters, but it can persist this way and when that happens, I think you will be at the high end of the range. Operator : Next question is from [indiscernible]. Sir, your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Marty, just a quick one, two things just on the retail side of the business. When you mentioned the improvement that you have seen in March and April, just wanted to get a sense on the flows that you gave, is that more weighted towards retail versus the strength you have been seeing in institutional? And then diving into that, are you seeing an improvement in sales or some of the redemptions starting to improve? And then longer term, just any concern around some of the SEC proposals on liquidity and derivatives? Or just more manageable, but the industry will be going back and forth to try to figure out what is the right solution? Martin Flanagan : The flow is pretty well balanced, retail and institutional. Loren Starr : Although I would say the retail is a little more ETF flavored. Martin Flanagan : Good point. I'm sorry, what was the second part of the question? I got the third part. I can't remember the second part. Unidentified Analyst : Whether the improvement that you were seeing in March and April, like sales versus-- Martin Flanagan : It is gross sales picking up. So typically what happens in those downturns is the first thing that happens, people stop buying and that's where you get that -- so you're actually starting to see gross sales pick up which is a very important indicator, I would say a sort of sentiment. And then with regards to the various SEC proposals, my view is the indications I would say is that the SEC absolutely wants to get them done. They also absolutely want to get them right. And they are much more willing and capable of working with the industry to get the right answers and so again we'll have to see one by one. So that would say they are going to come, but I'd say they'll ultimately get to places that are workable and we will get to a relatively good spot. I will say again though, back to some yet earlier conversations, this does continue to put pressure on -- all it does is drive up compliance costs and you know, in a difficult market is it's very difficult for institutions to -- and these are not optional expenses. You do compliance costs in cyber and I think that's being a larger money-management manager, you'll be in a better place to be able to deal with those. So again, that will be a continued dynamic, I would say in the industry. Operator : And that's the last question in queue. Martin Flanagan : Well thank you very much and on behalf of Loren and myself, thank you for your time, your questions and your interest and we will be in touch soon. Thank you. Operator : And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Welcome to Invesco's Second Quarter Results Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen only mode until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded if you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. Now I would like to turn call over to your speakers for today Marty Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco and Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan you may begin. Martin Flanagan : Thank you very much. And thank you for joining us and as was just mentioned Loren Starr Invesco CFO is on the call with me. And we'll be speaking to the presentation that's available on our website if you're so inclined to follow along. And as we typically do, I'll give an overview of the business results for the second quarter. Loren will go into greater details on the financials and then importantly we'll open up to Q&A. So let me begin by highlighting the firms operating results for the quarter which you'll find on slides four of the deck. Long term investments performance remained strong during the quarter, 68% to 73% of actively managed assets were ahead of peers on a three and five year respectively. Strong investment performance and our continued focus on meeting client needs will retain the impact of volatile markets during the quarter. Strong client demand helped drive passive and institutional flows which led to long term inflows of $4.5 billion during the quarter. The adjusted operating margin was 38.6% an improvement over the prior quarter and during the quarter we returned $318 million to shareholders through dividends and stock buy backs. Assets under manage were $779 billion at the end of the second quarter up from $771 billion in the first quarter. Adjusted operating income was $330 million in the quarter up considerably from $307 million in the prior quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.56 versus $0.49 in the prior quarter. Also noted during the quarter, we've raised our quarterly dividend to $0.28 cents per share. And we also repurchased $200 million of stock during the quarter. Before Loren goes into details in the company's financial, let me take a few minutes to talk about investment performance and flows during the quarter. Turning to Slide seven now, our commitment to investment excellence and our work to build and maintain strong investment culture help us to deliver solid long term investor performance across the enterprise during the quarter. Looking at the firm as a whole 68% of assets were in the top half on a three year basis and 73% were in the top half on a five-year basis. On page eight, you'll see that flows into passive capabilities were quite strong, while flows into active capabilities were flat with $4.5 billion in total long term in flows. Flows into passive capabilities were driven by strong demands for Invesco power share capability. This was the second best quarter in Invesco power shares history with roughly $3.8 billion in net new assets, and the strong flows are helping us continue to gain ETF market share. This reflects longevity and the breath of the power shares offering as well as our continued focus on meeting client needs. We are well positioned in the current market environment through our low volatility suite, commodity suite, fixed income and bank low ETF. As you're probably aware, smart data strategies are growing at nearly twice the pace of the overall ETF market. Although this is prompting a wave of fund launches by competitors, our expertise in smart data and factor investing continue to differentiate us in the market and help us gain share. Although long term flows are flat on the active side. We saw solid demand for alternatives including real estate and multi asset capabilities as well as fixed income. Asia pacific demonstrated continued strength across retail and institutional with tremendous momentum continuing into the third quarter. A continued focus on delivering strong investment performance and bringing in our broad range of capabilities supply and contribute to the very positive results in the region. Globally, we also saw strong institutional flows during the quarter which reflects our continued focus on this channel and results in a series of positive institutional flows going back two years. Client demand trends remain consistent with particularly strong interest in fixed income, multi assets, real estate and our institutional pipeline remains very strong. So at the June the one, but not funded pipeline is up 15% on assets under management versus the prior quarter and the prior year. Retail flows are flat this quarter as investors weighed their options during some of the late quarter volatility. That said, we continue to see strength in fixed income, U.S. dividend strategies as well as retail alternative capabilities specifically GTR and real estate. Now let me take a moment and highlight the business in EMEA. Our number one position U.K. retail, our strong cross board of retail business and our robust institutional pipeline across EMEA all position us extremely well ahead of a potential Brexit. We've positioned our business over many years to serve clients who are located in a variety of countries across the region. Our people and fund ranges are organized to meet those local needs. We are well diversified across channel with U.K. retail cross border and institutional each comprising roughly a third of our business in the region. We are also diversified across asset class with assets spread across equity bond and multi asset capabilities. Lastly, with more than 1300 people in the region, we are well placed across the region with strong business in both the U.K. and on the continent. And our level diversification and our construct positions extremely well to deliver for our clients in EMEA. Investors across Europe reacted thoughtfully to the market filled volatility that occurred at the time around the vote. Since then clients have taken advantage of the market movements by utilizing a full range of Invesco comprehensive fund range to achieve their long term investment objectives. As an example we've seen strong movement in the capabilities such as our highly regarded global targeted returns fund which clients seeks to manage risks in their portfolios. With regard to flows, our business in EMEA has demonstrated good resiliency through the Brexit topic with flows improving when compared to the prior quarter pre the announcement of the results of U.K. referendum on June 23rd. For the month of June, up to the date that the Brexit vote we saw daily average outflows of approximately $78 million. Since the referendum vote outflows have subsided to a daily average of $13 million. Although it's still early days, we feel good about the momentum in our EMEA business and going forward were focus on staying close to our clients, managing our core business and executing our strategy while adopting to any changes that might be brought about by Brexit. Before I hand the call over to Loren, let me say a few words about the new DOL Fiduciary Rule. We're actively engaged with clients as they work to understand the impact of the DOL Rule on their business, you know, for the past couple of years our discussion with clients have intensified moving from clarifications and interpretations to practical application. We are in discussions with them regarding product implications, share best possibilities and how best to leverage Robo solutions such as Jemstep. Based on our early discussions we continue to believe our comprehensive range of capability positions us very well to help our clients as a DOL Rule is implemented. Additionally, given Invesco's tremendous expertise and experience partnering with clients to address regulatory topics. For example, our work and RDR in the U.K. we view this as an opportunity to further deepen our relationships, provide new capabilities and enhance our business overall. With that, I will now turn it over to Loren to review the financials in more details. Loren Starr : Thanks, Marty. Okay so quarter-over-quarter you saw our total AUM increase by $8.1 billion or 1%. This was driven by positive market returns of $10.7 billion. We also saw long term net inflows of $4.5 billion. I should note, of this $4.5 billion, $0.9 billion came from IVR leverage, which is classified as our institutional passive fixed income. We also saw the acquisition of our India joint venture get completed and that brought in $2.4 billion. We saw inflows from money market of $2 billion, these factors are offset by negative FX translation of $7.7 billion and we also saw outflows from the QQQ's of $3.8 billion. Our average AUM for the second quarter was $784.5 billion that was up 4.9% versus Q1. Our net revenue yield came in at 43.7 basis points which is 0.1 basis points lower than the prior quarter. Although this was a small change there were a variety of factors which impacted our yield and Q2. These included AUM mix and lower performance fees which reduced the yield by 0.7 basis points and 0.4 basis points respectively. These factors were offset by one more day in the period which increased the yield by 0.4 basis points. In addition, currency mix and the increase in the other revenue each contributed 0.3 basis points to net revenue yield in the quarter. Next let's turn to the operating results, Page 13. Before I begin, I'd like to point out that we've evaluated and taken onboard the SEC's new guidance on non-gap financial measures. Accordingly, you'll already noticed the changes that we made in the format of our second quarter earnings press release which now focuses primarily on the U.S. gap results. In addition, the U.S. gap period-over-period variances are now set out in detail in our earnings release. Both our earnings release and this investment presentation contain detail reconciliations between our U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP. And importantly there is no change to how we've calculated our non-GAAP measures relative to prior quarters. But since we've already provided the U.S. GAAP narrative in the earning press release, my comments today consistent with past practice will focus exclusively on the variances related to our non-GAAP adjusted measures. So actually let's turn to the next page that's titled non-GAAP operating results. You've seen that revenues increase by $38.5 million or 4.7% quarter-over-quarter to $856.6 million, which included a positive FX rate impact of $6.4 million. But then within that revenue number you'll see that adjusted investment management fees increased by $32.6 million or 3.5% to $962.9 million. This reflects higher average AUM for the quarter. Foreign exchange increased adjusted investment management fees by $7.7 million. Our adjusted service and distribution revenues increased by $5.7 million or 2.9% reflecting higher average AUM for retail products. Foreign exchange increased adjusted services and distribution revenue by $0.5 million. Our adjusted performance fees came in at $9.3 million in Q2 and were earned from a variety of investment capabilities including $5.5 million from our bank loan products. Foreign exchange increased these fees by $0.1 million. Our adjusted other revenues in the first quarter were $31.7 million and that was an increase of $7.7 million from the prior quarter and that was the result of increased transaction fees from real estate. Foreign exchange increased these revenues by $0.4 million. Third party distributions service and advisory expense which we net against gross revenues increased $1.3 million or 0.4%. This movement was in line with higher revenues derived from our retail AUM and FX increased these expenses by $2.3 million. Moving further on down this slide you'll see that adjusted operating expenses at $526.2 million increased by $15.2 million or 3% relative to Q1. Foreign exchange increased adjusted operating expenses by $4.1 million during the quarter. Our adjusted employee compensation came in at $347.9 million an increase of $7.6 million or 2.2%. This increase was driven by higher sales commissions and variable compensation cost, a full quarter of higher based salaries effective from March 1st, an increase in deferred compensation expenses for the awards granted in the first quarter. This was offset by a decline in the seasonal payroll taxes. FX increased our adjusted compensation by $2.8 million in the quarter. Adjusted marketing expenses increased by $3.6 million or 14.2% to $29 million reflecting the seasonal increase inclined events. FX increase adjusted marketing expense by $0.3 million in the quarter. Adjusted property, office and technology expenses were $82.8 million in the quarter, an increase of $1.7 million versus Q1 driven by higher technology cost. FX increased these expenses by $0.5 million. Adjusted G&A expense at $66.5 million increased $2.3 million or 3.6% and this was driven by professional services expenses when compared to the prior quarter and FX increased G&A by $0.5 million. Going on further down the page, you'll see that adjusted non-operating income increased to $15 million compared to Q1 and this difference was largely driven by higher equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates in the second quarter, but also the 7.1 million FX loss recognized in the prior quarter. The firm's effective tax rate on pretax adjusted net income in Q2 was consistent with the prior quarter at 26.5% which brings us to our adjusted EPS of $0.56 and adjusted net operating margin of 38.6%. And so finally before I turn things over to Marty, I just want to provide a quick update on our capital management activities in the quarter. As you'll recall from our recent announcement in addition to our ongoing share repurchase activity during the quarter we entered into a 150 million accelerated share repurchase program on June 30th. And as a result of this our end of period share count declined by approximately 1.7% quarter-over-quarter to 413.1 million shares. And with that, turn it back to Marty. Martin Flanagan : Thank you, Loren, let me just make a couple summary comments before we get to Q&A. We believe our ability to produce strong long term net flows this quarter reflects the fundamental strength of our firm. Our expertise across a broad range of fundamental and factor base capabilities and our focus on helping retail and institutional clients achieve their investment objectives. We feel good about the commencement of our business. We closed strong across the quarter as we help clients manage through the volatility we saw in June. Strong flows have continued into July with more than $8 billion of long term net inflows across variety of capabilities and regions. This $8 billion includes $6.5 billion that is related to the 529 mandate which was recently funded. As noted during our investor day and earlier this year, we were very well positioned to help clients be successful which in turn will enhance our market relevance strive growth and strengthen shareholder value over the long term. And with that Loren and I would like to take any question you all have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks good morning everyone. Martin Flanagan : Good morning, Craig. Craig Siegenthaler : So it nice to see the strong rebound in your fixed income flows. Can you let us know which products were the largest contributor to the bond flows and also can you help us think about the sustainability of the second quarter results into the second half? Martin Flanagan : Maybe I'll make a comment and Loren can talk more specifically. You know, as I just mentioned we just continue to see really strong, you know, really strong flows. And I think importantly, you're seeing as I said long term flows away from the 529 plan you saw more than $1.5 billion already. You know, the pipeline continues to be very, very strong. And the other element that we're seeing is again the power share data capabilities, the breath and longevity of the range. It's really kicking in and so this - we are right now it looks like it's going to continue quite strongly, you know, through the border. Loren Starr : I'll just say generally the growth in our fixed income is being driven by our U.S. investment grade capability which is pretty much I think also in our institutional pipeline showing up as a large contributor. I just want to remind people that in the flows this quarter there was about $0.9 billion related to IVR leverage which shows up in the fix income column. But we also are seeing a lot of interest even in power shares, fixed income, emerging markets, sovereign debt, Chinese fixed income, so are a variety of other fixed income capabilities factor into that. And each one is about roughly $0.5 billion in size [Indiscernible]. Craig Siegenthaler : And then on Brexit, I think the client reaction is significantly more muted than anyone was thinking about 30 days ago. But how are clients reacting in both the U.K. and continental Europe today following the vote? And have you seen a lot of that initial reactive activity dying down? Martin Flanagan : Yes. And, you know, like us, like by others, you know, very engaged with clients. I mean what was really interesting was you saw in our numbers, June, you know, that was probably the peak of uncertainty and you saw it in the flows being most negative here to date. Interestingly, a number of institutional clients were waiting until after the vote and what it really did was start to, in their mind it created clarity and the institutional mandate started a fund in quite, you know, in the 30 days past that. And we're also seeing retail investors making decisions on where to put their assets. And again, we point out GTR has been a real beneficiary of that. So people are looking to, you know, just relook at their asset allocation capabilities. The good news is the breadth of our capabilities put us in a position that we can be helpful to them in any which way. So, it is really days but everything we see, I frankly think its opening opportunity for a firm like us. We are positioned very strongly, you know, structurally for a Brexit. That means we're not distracted by trying to - having revamp product lines or anything along that way. And we can just really, really be focused on clients. And again it was a total over reaction in light of if you look at Invesco share price and again I take the results are making that point quite clear. Loren Starr : And the other thing kind of worth mentioning is I mean our teams have been really good in terms of being innovative and creating new product in advance of client demand and so we would expect to see other, I think, very interesting products hit the U.K. market this year towards the beginning of next year. I think there is an income oriented sort of GTR type of product that is being looked at, as well as some enhanced index capabilities and factor capabilities too. So I think all those are going to really help us even if we see continued sort of level of uncertainty around Brexit. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks for taking my questions. Martin Flanagan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Line is now open. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning. First, in terms of, maybe a couple questions to excess cash. What was the balance at the end of the quarter? And I've recalled that consolidation was a conceptual focus when that pool was being built. But I think product development and capital return have been higher priorities more recently. So how do you see that access cash level evolving and is a billion dollars the number you still want to migrate towards over time? Loren Starr : Ken, total cash at the end of the quarter is $1.45 billion and so the regulatory requirement element of that was about $660 million leaving us roughly $800 millionish of sort of capital. I mean, we're certainly within sort of tolerances around that billion. And so again I won't get fixated on that billion being sort of like this bright line that we have to sort of hit. And clearly we've been very opportunistic and we'll continue to be very opportunistic with respect to returning capital to the extent that we see our stock being valued in a way that we think is not commensurate with our true values. So, I would say look to our past sort of practices to evaluate how we're going to operate going forward. It will be very consistent. Ken Worthington : Okay, great. Thank you. And two little questions maybe one on the Rhode Island plan how's the transitioning gone? And how much money actually came over when it was first announced? I know it was about seven billion was that about what eventually moved over? Martin Flanagan : So, what came over was $6.5 billion and so those are combinations of your market impact and with the transition it is now completed the transitions in place. And everybody is very, very focused on expanding the capabilities through the retail channel. We think it's going to - it's a great plan and we think that we can help make it even more successful. So, we're executing as we speak. Ken Worthington : All right. Excellent. Then just lastly active equity net outflows were pretty large this quarter. Obviously it was a big risk off quarter. There was Brexit and other things. Maybe any observations you have on sort of the nature, either the lack of money coming in or the more money coming out that kind of drove that big net outflow this quarter? Martin Flanagan : Ken, the one thing I would just there's about 2.8 related to international growth. That was sort of the thing that we - I think we - people understand that there was one client who turned out it was a parting of ways, but that international growth capabilities performing extremely well. It's been a close capability and its one that I think is going to get filled up pretty quickly through the course of this year. So I would do that as a little bit one offish with respect to kind of the equity - the active equity outflow. The other elements are sort of somewhat consistent with past, what you've seen in the past. So I don't think there's anything that's sort of accelerating outflow, relative to that category other than that one element. Ken Worthington : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now opened. Alex Blostein : Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks. A couple of quick questions. I guess, first around the margins. Obviously we saw the adjusted margin improve sequentially given better revenue environment, but still down pretty meaningfully every year. So if we're seeing more range bound market which obviously feels like a big if right now, but under that scenario how should we think about the trajectory of the margin for the rest of the year? And then is there anything else you guys are targeting on the expense front to help drive margins higher in today's environment? Loren Starr : Yes, Alex, I'll take that. So I think our expectation even with markets being flat which is the way we normally forecast anyway, and even with the pounds being down where it is for the last half of the year we would expect margins to be on an upward trajectory, as we continue to grow organically and continue to work hard on the optimization work around cost. The firm has done I think a really great job of creating capacity for investment without having to add to cost, really through using as we talked about in the past, greater use of our own shared service centers, being able to leverage technology more effectively, streamlining, simplifying, a lot of our processes. So that work is going on as, you know, and we're on track with respect to the optimization which we've discussed provide some expense relief of roughly $30 million to $45 million by the end of the year. And to that run rate which is actually now beginning to flow through our numbers is something that has been very helpful, and just remind people, we had those acquisitions that came onboard Jemstep and Religare. And those expenses are being offset through this optimization whereas the revenues are showing up in the revenue line items. So we do think that, that's going to help further drive margin expansion. Our increments on margin continues to be at very high level and with that sort of 55% to 60% incremental margin, and our fee rate because of the mix that's coming in particularly around institutional being at our higher fee rate than what's going out. We'll continue to benefit from that. So I think all those factors to us that we can continue to see margins increase and, you know, get up to the levels that we've seen in the past without too much stretching. Clearly that's a factor of the market of course and what... Alex Blostein : Sure. Martin Flanagan : I might add a point though. I would say from my perspective where were really going to see the margin expansion is really on the organic growth. You know, we continue to be very discipline on expenses as we always have been as Loren just described. But I tell you for the 11 years I've been here I don't know that I know a time when I've seen so many of our initiatives sitting in front of us to have such an impact. You know, you're starting to see and institutional factor base smart beta solutions. And so our debate internally is, what is the wise move of investing in these to get the returns versus being very cautious. And again it's something we do all the time, but it's really that market relevance expansion of the business that sits right in front of us. And it's a very exciting time quite frankly for us. Loren Starr : I mean, just generally because I know people are quite curious. I mean in terms of guidance around expenses I mean we would see expenses sort of being roughly flat from the current level through the course of the year - based on sort of flat markets and FX. So that provides a nice back drop as we continue to grow the revenue line item. Alex Blostein : Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks guys. Martin Flanagan : Yes. Alex Blostein : Second question on the DOL. I understand it's still pretty early, but it seems like there is a lot moving pieces already happening on the distribution side of things and different kind messages from various distribution partners. What do you guys hear from some of the larger distributors out there, whether its warehouses or some of the more regional platforms and specifically as it relates to essentially payment per shelf space and how those conversations are evolving? Martin Flanagan : Yeah, so I would say, from my perspective, which is probably na\u00efve I thought there was going to likely be a uniform you know response, but in reality what\u2019s happened is each of those distributors are different. Their businesses are positioned differently and so they\u2019re all variations on the theme and that makes sense quite frankly. And what also -- it\u2019s -- there are ways to continue to be supportive of the brokerage business, but knowing that the movement is towards their advisory businesses. And so you know they\u2019re putting a DOL on the place you know along those lines and again that you know plays well to an organization such as ours where we have such a range of high conviction fundamental capabilities and the factor-based investing. And so it would be too early for us to be very specific on what the outcomes are but, as I said, it looks like you could see some changes to share classes. You could see some different changes in use of -- focus on asset classes and the like. So, that\u2019s what we know right now. But again, I would be getting ahead of our clients if I said-- Loren Starr : And the other thing that we also changed is maybe as a team is the use of fewer providers and so it\u2019s the ones who are probably -- have the broadest set of capabilities, good performance who will probably fare better to the extent that there\u2019s assets in motion as a result of DOL. We think we\u2019re probably you know as well-positioned as one can be in that environment. Alex Blostein : Yes, understood. Thanks so much. Martin Flanagan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Brennan Hawken of UBS. The line is now open. Brennan Hawken : Thanks, good morning. Quick question on the fee rate here and we saw the management\u2019s fee rate decline quarter over quarter. I know that you guys often speak to the revenue yield, but just hoping if it\u2019s possible to ask a question, cutting out some of the other noise and just speaking specifically to the investment management fees divided by AUM. What drove that? Was it mix and if so, should we think about that as being sustainable and I think last quarter you had given some indications saying that you expect the fee rate to improve throughout the year and is that still your expectation? Loren Starr : Yeah, so obviously the management fee rate does have -- is impacted by FX and then there are some factors there as well as overall equity component verses non-equity. And so when the market declines, you\u2019ll see some of that change. There's another element around our gross management fee rate, which people should be aware of. It\u2019s the RDR impact right, as we go to continue to bleed out the old fee rate and replace it with the net fee rate that has an impact on the gross management field. And so I\u2019d say that is sort of a permanent and sustained as we go forward. But it doesn\u2019t have any impact on the net revenue yield because commensurately our -- well the pain away goes away too. So, that\u2019s why it is -- you almost have to look at that net number to really understand the dynamic of that shifting mix But there -- in terms of the trends around what\u2019s driving our management fee, we still feel that it\u2019s quite stable. Maybe, I mean to the extent that Europe is a little bit slower than it\u2019s been in the past, its one engine that was driving that fee rate, which is probably not something you\u2019d look to be driving forward. But we are seeing continued engines around Asia alternatives, which is helping us continue to see that fee rate increase as well as the institutional mix generally being better. So, I\u2019d say the net revenue yield ex-performance fees, you know, quarter -- next quarter and going forward is kind of flattish to this quarter and so that would be -- so even with that FX, so I think with that FX down obviously that has a negative impact, but because the mix is positive, it\u2019s probably off setting it. So, hopefully that\u2019s helpful in terms of the modeling on the fee rate. A lot of dynamics underneath clearly have to have some impact, but generally, we expect to see that trend in terms of improving fee rates continue, but maybe at a somewhat slower pace. Brennan Hawken : Okay, got it. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then, I know that it\u2019s a --it\u2019s probably pretty hard to be -- maybe hard might even be understating it, but to be anything close to precise. But given how important the U.K. is to you all, is there a way that you could help us understand how you\u2019re thinking about the different things that might happen to your expense base and to your business based upon the handful of likely outcomes that have been thrown out there from a post Article 50 world? Martin Flanagan : Sure, so again take this -- reality as no one knows exactly, so let\u2019s do the more likely than not. The more likely than not is Brexit is going to happen and that you\u2019re going to end up with trade agreements between the continent and the U.K. that are mutually beneficial. It\u2019s going to take time to get there. That said let\u2019s get down to our business. Our business, as I was trying to highlight, we are already structured for a post-Brexit environment. We\u2019re a very strong U.K. business, very strong continental business, and we don\u2019t see any changes there. And for all a range of reasons and the impact on the business is going to be largely driven by the economic environment. And yeah, there is a scenario where it\u2019s less negative than everything that you heard. I mean, with the pound depreciating, that\u2019s actually the exporters in the U.K. are actually doing very well. So, I think, the reality is this is going to be very hard at a political level, but I would say our business is a business that is structured for the change and there is a need for asset management services and we just really don\u2019t -- the -- this industry being hurt to the degree that some other businesses might be where they\u2019re literally going to have to move people to different part of -- out of the U.K., out of the continent and you know vice versa. So, it is just not part of what\u2019s going to happen to us as asset managers. Now there are some asset management firms that are not structured like we are, and they\u2019re going to have to do some work to get positioned to be continually successful. But again, we\u2019re trying very hard to point out looking at the elements we talked about earlier -- it\u2019s a huge part of the world. It\u2019s a strong part of the world. They\u2019re clearly going through some changes, but I think it\u2019s a total mistake to think that the reach will not continue to be important and that it will not continue to be an important part of our business. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks for that color. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Glenn Schorr of Evercore. Line is now open. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks. Just a quick follow-up question on your comments on July. Besides the 5.29 [ph] funding, the bout 1.5 billion of inflows, does it have a comparable mix to what we show on the quarter, alternatives and fixed income in inequities on the out? Loren Starr : So, of the 5.29, the 6.5 -- about 2.1 is equity, 3.5 is fixed, there\u2019s 0.4 of money market and 0.5 of Alts. So, that\u2019s on the 5.29 component of the flows. I\u2019m sorry; did that answer your question? Glenn Schorr : No, I appreciate that though. That\u2019s a good follow-up. The 1.5 billion that wasn\u2019t a part of the 5.29, I'm sure it's a similar-- Loren Starr : I\u2019m sorry I thought you were -- so the 1.5 billion and that was just related to market and outflows and so I don\u2019t think -- I don\u2019t know how it -- where it came out of. Martin Flanagan : No, no, the question of the $8 billion, what\u2019s the 1.5 billion? What were the flows for the 1.5 billion? Glenn Schorr : Does it look like second quarter with alternatives and fixed income inflowing with equities on outflow? Loren Starr : All right, so of the 8 we have -- I don\u2019t know if we have all the detail right now. I think it\u2019s similar -- similar is what my experts are telling me. Okay, very good. Glenn Schorr : Okay. And then just curious, you alluded to everyone [Indiscernible], I think performance is good. It feels to me that this is a really good backdrop for that product. Has it gone into positive flows and do you think we\u2019re turning the corner and get positive flows just globally? Loren Starr : The [Indiscernible] has gone positive in the second quarter, but that was -- it was largely institutionally driven. Retail has significantly improved, so it\u2019s just very modestly in an outflow. So, I\u2019d say both on the retail and institutional side, very good sort of indication of this product. Sort of the better position now than we than it has in the past given the very strong performance. Glenn Schorr : Great. And just and one more follow-up, Loren if I could. The -- in the prepared remarks, you mentioned a bunch of things that are -- I wouldn\u2019t call turning the corner, but just things that are just doing well in general outside of maybe active equity or parts of active equity. So, is the 3% to 5% organic growth rate still cool? Can it happen without U.S. equities? I mean it looks like it can given everything else that\u2019s working. I just want to get that straight. Loren Starr : I mean we think it\u2019s -- I mean that 3% to 5%, obviously, is what we think we can do over time. It\u2019s been sort of more of a benchmark. I think for this year, we would like to see us at least enter that range. But given obviously what\u2019s going on in Europe, it\u2019s been a little bit of an unusual situation. So, I don\u2019t want to sort of promise flaws because that\u2019s always -- that\u2019s probably even harder than the promising performance fees. But we -- everything we say in terms of the institutional pipeline growing the fact that we have -- certain parts are business, particularly Asia is absolutely strong both on the retail and the institutional side. We see power shares hitting new records or close to records on flows. I think it's certainly reasonable for us to think that we could sort of get close to that 3% at a minimum. Glenn Schorr : All right. Excellent. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Chris Shutler of William Blair. Line is now open. Andrew Nicholas : Hi, this is actually Andrew Nicholas filling in for Chris. My first question is on GTR. Obviously, you\u2019ve had exceptional performance there across all time periods, particularly on a year-to-date basis and with respect to some of the strategies, largest peers. I was just curious if you could provide some color on how that pipeline is looking and that asset class as a whole? Loren Starr : So, I think the GTR pipeline is certainly featuring in a lot of the growth in a pipeline generally. That\u2019s the one that\u2019s you know probably up more than 20% quarter-over-quarter. So, it\u2019s just one that continues to be seen. I think it also with respect to some of the continuing products that it\u2019s sort of distancing itself even further, relative to other products. So, it had the ability to grow far beyond its current level, we would expect. And certainly is looked at I think and reviewed in the U.S. by consultants and then taken on as well. So, that\u2019s the important component of getting that completed for us to really fulfill, ultimately I think what could be the full potential as well as on the retail side in the U.S. where I think it\u2019s about 0.5 billion or maybe a little less, only 300 million or something like that. But it hasn\u2019t really been launched fully and it hasn\u2019t hit its two-year track record yet and so once it does that I think it\u2019s really going to have an opportunity to do a whole lot more than what we\u2019ve seen in the U.S. Andrew Nicholas : Great. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful color. And then on the DOL rule. I think general expectations are that the rule will drive flows to products that either have lower fees, very strong relative performance and/or a combination of both. I\u2019m just wondering if you have any thoughts on which of those two factors will play a bigger role in driving flows in a post-DOL world and how you think your product suite is positioned to compete on each front. Martin Flanagan : So, our view is this is that it's by less simple than your perspective. What our financial advisors are trying to do, they\u2019re trying to generate excess returns, risk adjusted returns over time and you cannot get there with cap weighted indexes. And so it really is a combination of high [Indiscernible] fundamental, good performing active as you\u2019re describing in combination with passive and where we think the combination is, is in smart data. And when you combine those together you get an overall -- the total cost is less and so that\u2019s why this element of being strong in solutions really matters for an organization. So, we just look at the position of the firm and having the whole range of capabilities and the ability to help with solutions and that\u2019s at a retail level, we take our position very well. I think the firms that are disadvantaged are those that are very, very narrow in scope and clearly, if you\u2019re a high class, narrow in scope, moderately performing organization, you\u2019re in trouble. Andrew Nicholas : Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Line is now open. Chris Harris : Thanks. Hey, guys. Hey, so a few quick questions on your U.K. pound hedge. Obviously, this position is significantly in the money. Regarding the accounting of that, is that a mark-to-market methodology or are we going to see gains as you start exercising that position? And then part two of the question is, given where the pound is today, how big of a step down in income can we expect when you have to roll that hedge? Loren Starr : So, I mean in terms of the U.S. GAAP, it\u2019s mark-to-market and then that\u2019s -- you\u2019re going to see that flowing through the P&L and you are seeing it flowing through the U.S. GAAP P&L currently. In terms of our non-GAAP disclosure, what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve backed out that mark-to-market and we are only bringing in what has been actually realized. And so this quarter that was a very small amount of money in terms of the impact. For the next couple of quarters, just based on the current rate, that\u2019s probably close to a penny EPS for each of the quarters going forward. So, in terms of what we would do if we were going to roll it, because we have it out through the Q1, I think we\u2019re going to be patient and think about whether we need to or want to. But I, obviously, again have to look at the cost first to sort of lock-in right now at current rates, or a discount to current rates because we\u2019ve been using out of the money puts. I\u2019m not sure if anybody would be too excited about a hedge 1.25 or something like that. So, it is something that we\u2019re going to continue to look at and evaluate as to whether we continue to roll this thing. But certainly we\u2019re going to hold on to what we\u2019ve got right now and continue to benefit at least from a cash flow and EPS perspective from the protections provided. Chris Harris : Great, okay. Thanks for clarifying that. And then a quick follow-up on comp. It sounds like there are a few discreet items that impacted the number this quarter. How should we be thinking about comp in the back half of the year? And I apologize if you addressed this in the comments earlier. Loren Starr : No, I think it\u2019s going to be roughly flat to current levels, so I think that\u2019s the way you can think about it, sort of flat. There\u2019s a little fluctuation here and there, but generally flat. Chris Harris : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Line is now open. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. Appreciate all the color from Brexit and the kind of commentary around flows thus far. I guess, is there any kind of negatives fall-out that you\u2019re seeing institutionally or certain regions whether you actually are seeing maybe some changes more to the negative that might be longer term or has it generally been kind of consistent across the board? Martin Flanagan : Yeah, I mean, it really has been consistent. And as I said, in the -- and let me make sure, this is in response to sort of the Brexit impact. Is that right? Dan Fannon : Correct. Martin Flanagan : Yeah. I mean, no, I mean it really did unleash, in particular, in the U.K. and on the Continent, people decided to move forward with the -- their intention to fund different institutional capabilities. And then if you -- as Loren said, if you just go to Asia-Pac right now, it\u2019s just very strong for us. And so there really has not been any impact that you could tie to that event or other uncertainty in the world. In fact, for us, much differently than that, it just the pipeline as we keep saying, it just keeps getting stronger and stronger and -- so, no we\u2019ve not seen that. Loren Starr : The only thing that I\u2019d say is probably around the DOL, there\u2019s probably more question marks just generally. Martin Flanagan : Yes. Loren Starr : And I think it was so the comment that was made are people -- certain clients going to sort of gravitate to using exclusively low fee product as opposed to active product and so whether insurance companies or others may choose to do something like that in the future, unclear. But if it happens, it happens obviously to industry-wide. As we said, I think we\u2019re well-positioned to operate in that world as we do have low fee tax deposits. Martin Flanagan : Yeah, but I would add though is that what is happening is the financial advisors want to generate excess returns -- adjusted excess returns that you just can\u2019t get in cap weighted indexes and so active is here to stay. And if you\u2019re good investor, you\u2019re going to do well. Dan Fannon : Okay, that\u2019s helpful, and I guess wondering if there has been any benefits from the Rhode Island win that you can talk about as that\u2019s been helping your pipeline or if that\u2019s kind of raised the profile for your firm within that channel and if there\u2019s been any benefits. Martin Flanagan : There\u2019s no question it raised the profile and it is helping very much and as I said, we\u2019re actually, it\u2019s a two different levels the solutions element, it\u2019s starting to kick in. Frankly, you would imagine, but it -- at the retail level and also in Asia-Pac, there is actually, Mainland China in particular just really growing opportunity. So, again, we\u2019d say its early days for us in that area, but again, we feel a very, very strong capability and there\u2019s an awful lot of activity around it. Dan Fannon : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Robert Lee of KBW. Line is now open. Robert Lee : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Martin Flanagan : Good morning. Robert Lee : I guess my first question is just maybe any update you may have or thoughts you have around the -- obviously the SEC\u2019s proposed different liquidity rules on 40 Act products and certainly that impact, ETFs. And I know you\u2019ve talked about this in the past, Marty, but current thoughts as maybe you\u2019ve been part of any interaction with the SEC on kind of what\u2019s likely. And given the explosive growth in smart data, ETF products and other products, do you think it -- there\u2019s any risk that it kind of inhibits some of the -- and then liquid Alts to some of the strategies that you\u2019re running out there? Martin Flanagan : I get if -- so, how is smart data inhibiting some of the strategies we\u2019re running to this -- can you help me? Robert Lee : Well, I meant just that if you have different liquidity or derivative requirements and different strategies, as proposed, is that going to inhibit how you run things? Martin Flanagan : Got you. Yeah, so, look as we said in the past and I think we all just saw it, so anticipate something coming out of the liquidity rule. The involvement that the industry has had is that we think there\u2019s going to be a commonsensical outcome, which would be a good thing. And if that is the case I -- it\u2019s going to be quite frankly an awful lot of work, but it\u2019s something that\u2019s very manageable for the industry. The derivatives rule, again, it\u2019s -- it is I would say the first notion of it was -- it would\u2019ve gotten in the way of a number of products for the industry and in particular, for us at a retail level, GTR probably would\u2019ve been very, very challenged in the proposed rules. We\u2019re sensing that we\u2019re going to end up with a better outcome, which will not get in the way of a number of our products. I don\u2019t want to be so definitive yet because it\u2019s not there. But I\u2019d say very good progress and being very thoughtful on really trying to help the SEC get to what they need and so the dialogue has been constructive. And so again I -- we\u2019ll see what ultimately comes out, but at the moment I\u2019d say it\u2019s trending to a commonsensical good, thoughtful outcomes on both levels. Robert Lee : And great, and maybe sticking with the regulatory theme, I mean, the business that we never really talk about is your money fund business. But come October you've got changes taking effect, the -- you have predominantly an institution business there. So can you maybe -- any update on how you think come October any sense of how clients are going to you know behave? I mean, obviously, you've seen prime to govi kind of movement anyway within the industry. But any concerns that that\u2019s going to -- I don't know, shrink that business and then in that context any rethinking of its strategic positioning within Invesco? Martin Flanagan : Yeah, good question. So, you\u2019ve already seen the number of money fund providers have over the last couple of years. You\u2019re probably going to see it again. And it\u2019s going to be a smaller number of firms that are committed to and successful in that area. So, we\u2019re actively committed to it. We\u2019ve done a bunch of work on the product line-up and you\u2019re going to see us, I think -- you\u2019re going to see the -- a very strong part of our business in growing and that, I think just in July there\u2019s been $4 billion of money fund in-flows already. So, yes we\u2019re anticipating that it\u2019s going to be a stronger part of our business going forward. Robert Lee : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Line is now open. Brian Bedell : Great, thanks very much. Hey, Marty, just to start-off with a question on the smart data franchise, obviously, you\u2019ve have a good you know relatively good first mover advantage in that. But as you do see more competition coming in to that market given the attractiveness of the product, what kind of steps are you taking to leverage that first mover advantage? And talk about to what extent you see that improving within DOL and can you leverage the -- I guess traction and leveraging the Jemstep platform with that as well. Martin Flanagan : Good question. So, we look at smart data as a subset of factor investing and again, I think very importantly I\u2019m repeating myself, but we\u2019re one of very few firms that have a factor-based capability that\u2019s been in business 35 years and the fundamental investing that we have. And so that combination of those around the world for us that put us in a unique position. So factor investing outside of the United States is much more an institutional business and it\u2019s growing in demand, both in the Continent and Loren mentioned that we\u2019re looking -- doing some things in the U.K. at the retail level. Actually, there and Asia-Pac is actually growing in demand. In the United States, it tends to be a retail focus and expressed as smart data through ETFs. And where we look at our strategic positioning and I think very importantly, then differently than a mutual fund where you can have 200 of the same XYZ funds competing it\u2019s very hard to see beyond really three ETFs of sort of the same color would be successful just because of the nature of the ETF with market makers and the like. So, first mover advantage matters a lot. The other thing that really matters, too, is the longevity of, so think length of track record. And if you look at the power shares line-up of smart data, any number of funds are 10 years old. And so when people are looking to invest or looking at the length of capability also look at the liquidity within it. And so those are very different dynamics than you would have with a mutual fund. So, the good news is people are coming in so it sort of -- it confirms the attractiveness of smart data. That said, it\u2019s going to -- it\u2019s a very, very competitive space to enter into to say nothing of how do you work in conjunction with active management within your organization. So, we think we\u2019re in a pretty good position. Loren Starr : I think, again, like any -- like you\u2019d imagine, I mean if we continue to launch very innovative and products in advance of competitors, so that\u2019s also part of our strategy is making sure that we have that first mover advantage. And just given the depth of our team and our connection to our clients, I think we\u2019re achieving that quite well. Brian Bedell : And is Jemstep part of this process. Is that maybe just an outlook for the new term or intermediate term horizon for the traction there? Martin Flanagan : It\u2019s a good question. I'm sorry. So, yes, still early days with Jemstep. It\u2019s proving to be a very constructive addition to the firm. It is an application so the -- if you want to call it the sales cycle is longer. There is a tremendous amount of interest in it and I think you said it right; it\u2019s sort of looking into mid next year that type of thing before you start to see an impact. But again, it\u2019s very much positioned to be helpful to our clients, not competing with our clients. So, it is direct-to-consumer and it is -- as I said earlier, it is -- we\u2019re having deeper conversations with clients because of the capability that we have to help enable them deal with the range of things that they\u2019re dealing with coming through DOL and the like. Brian Bedell : Great. And then, just lastly Marty, maybe just your perspective on this rising speculation of consolidation and the asset management industry broadly if active management continues to underperform and products need to be rationalized. Maybe just to review on whether you think that that will happen? And then to what extent you think you may participate either in acquisitions or even combining with other firms? Martin Flanagan : So, I\u2019ve not been in the industry for quite a long time. And it\u2019s been declared to consolidate for every five years it seems it really hasn\u2019t for various reasons that we all know. I would be in a camp consistent with others that it does seem very different this time and I -- one of it -- you could look at it as a maturing industry. But you talk about active management. My view is you go in cycles and we\u2019ve had this beta run from 2009 on with government intervention, which aligned the stars for cap weighted indexes, that\u2019s not sustainable. So, I think that\u2019s been overdone. That said it\u2019s here to stay. I think you\u2019re going to see greater growth of factor investing as we said. But active management you\u2019ll actually -- it will thrive. I think those individuals that are calling it dead asset class are making a mistake. So, that said, I think the other element that\u2019s really driving the notion of consolidation. It\u2019s the regulatory landscape; it is so costly to keep up with all of these, to say nothing of Cyberspace. So, its rising cost in a competitive environment and I think those are the dynamics that are going to you know also be changing -- be forces to drive consolidation. And luckily we\u2019re fortunate enough to be positioned extremely well. As we\u2019ve just been talking about on this call. I\u2019d say the business here has never been stronger. It\u2019s seemingly getting all engines are kicking in quite nicely and matched against the trends that are in place and I think that people that try to catch up with the trends, it\u2019s going to be very hard. You need to have started three years ago, five years ago, seven years ago, honestly. That said, we don\u2019t see a lot of gaps, but we will continue to pay attention to the marketplace, as we have in that past, selectively as things can -- if we can become a stronger organization by teaming up with another organization, we\u2019ll continue to do that. That\u2019s said, that\u2019s not our focus right now. Brian Bedell : Great. That\u2019s great color. Thank you so much. Martin Flanagan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Michael Carrier of Bank of America. Line is now open. Michael Carrier : All right, thanks guys. Hey, Loren, just two quick follow-ups. One is, just on the management fee you mentioned on the net basis given RDR, that that that\u2019s kind of shifting. I just wanted to get a sense on timing, meaning how much of that\u2019s played out verses how long we can expect to see that? And then I don\u2019t think you mentioned it, maybe just because there\u2019s no real clarity right now, but sometimes you give a little color on the performance fees in terms of the outlook. So, just any color there. Loren Starr : So I think the RDR impact is going to be largely completed by the end of this year. That would be my guess. So, you can expect that to be completely sort of played out. In terms of performance fees, you\u2019re right; I don\u2019t have you know full clarity. I think I would still say sort of roughly $5 million a quarter and for the other revenues, which is another element I think sort of again hanging roughly around $30 million a quarter is the right way to think about it. Michael Carrier : Okay, thanks a lot. Loren Starr : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Line is now open. Michael Cyprys : Hi. Thank you. Good morning. Just curious how you\u2019re thinking about the next phase in evolution of ETFs as a wrapper, particularly active ETF, both on the non-transparent side, which I think so far only make sure it has approval from the SEC. But also if more can be done on the transparent active ETF side as well. Martin Flanagan : So, we\u2019re one of the first firms to have exemptive relief or active ETFs and we launched them, I\u2019m going to say, in 2007, two of them. And I think what\u2019s in them is basically our C capital. So, there\u2019s a lot of conversation about active ETFs. They just really have not taken off. So, we have the capability to do it. We keep analyzing it. We\u2019ve just not seen that as a big -- lot of demand for it. Now, if you read the papers, you would think that\u2019s all that anybody cares about, so that\u2019s been our experience, so maybe we just have it wrong but that\u2019s our experience. With regards to different wrappers, I -- the -- if you look at net shares, it\u2019s interesting, but it can be 100% achieved by a share class and a mutual fund. If you use an R6 share class, you get the exact outcome via without the challenge of -- a different vehicle trying to get launched within a channel. And although it\u2019s creative, I think that\u2019s been the head wind for it. So, it could ultimately be successful, but again I think there\u2019s an easier way to get there. And you really need to do it in conjunction with your clients, i.e., think distribution partners. So, things will continue to evolve. I personally think the area that will continue to grow the most for IB, most additive is smart data because it is -- you get better outcomes with smart data than you do with cap-weighted indexes. So, I think that\u2019s really going to be where the gravitational pull is when you look at these ranges of capabilities that you just highlighted. So, that\u2019s our view. We could be wrong, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re thinking right now. Michael Cyprys : Okay. Thanks. And then just coming back to the flow side, active flow was a bit soft in the quarter. I know you mentioned meaningful redemption there, but if we just look at the gross sales, that\u2019s been just a bit weak. So, just curious how you\u2019re thinking about reaccelerating the pace of gross sales on the active side, what sort of strategies or actions can you take, whether it\u2019s with distribution partners or with investments in sales teams and so forth? Martin Flanagan : Yeah, look, the reality is we\u2019re still in an uncertain market. If you just play back the year, look at January, February, what happened -- you look around at what\u2019s happened with Brexit and the knock on, that tends to be the big driver. If you look within our flows, we\u2019ve had tremendous flows in U.S. dividend stocks, which is consistent with this sort of -- I want yield, I want some growth, but I\u2019m somewhat concerned about the environment. If you look at the value capabilities, I feel really good about the teams and how their managing, what tends to be in those are you know energy and financials, which had been hurt again in the volatility. So, my basic view is that you continue to ensure that you have high quality teams that can deliver over a market cycle and I think that\u2019s really the important thing. You can\u2019t look quarter-to-quarter or year-by-year calendars don\u2019t matter, market cycles matter. And you\u2019re going to get excess returns with strong active management and I think when the psychological environment moves, I think that\u2019s where you\u2019re really going to see the gross -- the net flow has actually pick up in those active capabilities. So, again, I think you have to segment them to the different styles. I think that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving it right now. Michael Cyprys : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that\u2019s the last question in queue. Martin Flanagan : Well, thank you very much. On behalf of Loren and myself, I appreciate the engagement and the questions and we\u2019ll be speaking with you next quarter. Thank you. Operator : And that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Welcome to Invesco's Third Quarter Results Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen only mode until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded if you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. Now I would like to turn call over to your speakers for today Marty Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco and Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan you may begin. Marty Flanagan : Thank you very much and thank you for joining us on our third quarter call. As is our practice, I will review the business results for the third quarter and then Loren will go into greater details about the financials and then we'll open up to Q&A after that. So, let me begin by highlighting the firm\u2019s operating results for the quarter and you will find this on slide 4 if you happen to be following the presentation, which is available on our website. Long-term investment performance remains you know continued very strong at 68% to 79% of actively managed assets, we are ahead of peers on a three and five year basis respectively. Our continued focus on leveraging our broad investment capabilities provide meaningful solutions to client contribute to solid operating results during the quarter and what I think all of us would describe as a difficult business environment for money managers. Strong investment performance helped drive robust long-term net flows of $1.2 billion during the quarter, reflecting solid retail and institution demand across both active and passive capabilities. And total flows during the quarter were just over $19 billion. Adjusted operating margin was 39.7%, an improvement over the prior quarter that reflects our continued focus on running a disciplined business. We also returned $176 million shareholders through dividends, buyback during the quarter. Assets under management were $820 billion at the end of the quarter, up from $779 billion in the second quarter. Adjusted operating income was $399 million in the quarter, up from $330 million in the prior quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.60 this quarter versus $0.56 in the prior quarter and as noted earlier in the year we raised our quarterly dividend to $0.28 per share, which is up nearly 4% from the prior. We also continued our stock program during the quarter. And before Loren goes into detail on the financials let me take a moment to review the investment performance inflows for the quarter. Turning to slide 7 now, our commitment to investment excellence and our work to build and maintain a strong investment culture helped us deliver solid long-term investment performance across the enterprise during the quarter. Looking at the firm as a whole, 68% of assets were in the top half. On a three-year basis, 79% were in the top half on a five-year basis. On page 8, you\u2019ll see the quarterly long-term flows of $12.2 billion were quite strong across both active and passive capabilities. Flows in the passive capabilities were driven by strong demand from Invesco PowerShares capabilities which has an all-weather line-up that\u2019s well positioned to meet client demand in any type of market. This was the second-best quarter for Invesco PowerShares in its history with roughly $4 billion in net flows and strong flows are helping us continue to gain ETF market share. As we noted during or recent Investor Day, strong passive flows reflected our longevity in ETF market, our deep experience, our comprehensive range of factor and smart data capabilities and our significant track record of innovation. Results on the active side were equally as impressive with solid demand in multi-asset given an income capability, fixed income and other capabilities such as real estate. I will focus on delivery and strong investment performance in bringing our broad range of capabilities to clients contributed positive results in Asia-Pacific with strengths across both retail and institutional channels. Globally we saw institutional flows during the quarter, which continues a series of positive institutional flows going back more than two years now. Client demand trends remain consistent with particular interest in fixed income, multi-asset and real estate and are one but not funded and qualified opportunities are at all-time high. Retail flows also our strongest gross sales rebounded nicely and redemptions moderated during the quarter. This includes a $6.5 billion Rhode Island 529 mandate. Before I hand the call over to Loren let me say a few words about how Invesco is positioned against the changes being brought by the DOL fiduciary rule. We actively engaged with clients as they work to alignment platforms that demands fiduciary rule as we make clear sense of rules approval the key decisions reside with the distribution platforms but we are actively supporting them. The market has gotten an early scare from [indiscernible] Merrill Lynch and last night from Morgan Stanley, but I believe we are still in a very dynamic period with regard to how we\u2019ll play out. It is clear each distributor has a different business mix and we will implement the rule in a manner that will meet its client needs. Based on the discussions we are having with clients we continue to believe that our comprehensive range of capabilities, our distribution expertise, our market leadership all positions us extremely well to help our clients [indiscernible]. If the shift is towards passive as some believe, a decade of ETF experience, our comprehensive range of factors and smart data capabilities, our scale, our significant track record of innovation all put us in a very competitive position. As mentioned during the investor day there are low barriers to entry but very high hurdles [indiscernible] in the EFT business, it will make it difficult for latecomers to do well. Now I will turn the call over to Loren to review the financials. Loren Starr : Thanks very much Marty, quarter over quarter our total assets under management increased 48.6 billion or 5.2%, this was driven by positive market returns of 23.6 billion and we also saw long-term net inflows of $12.2 billion which included as you know $6.5 billion related to Invesco\u2019s Rhode Island 529 plan win. We also saw inflows from money market and QQQs of 5.9 billion and 1.1 billion respectively, these were offset by negative FX translation which amounted to $2.2 billion. Our average AUM for the third quarter was $814.1 billion that was up 3.8% versus the second quarter. Our annualized long-term growth rate in Q3 was 7.1% and that was up from 2.6% in the second quarter. This measure represents our long-term flows in the quarter divided by the beginning of period long term AUM which excludes the institutional money market assets and the QQQ assets. Our net revenue yield came in at 42 basis points which was 1.7 basis points lower than the prior quarter. The change in mix largely driven by currency reduced the yield by 1.1 basis points. This was primarily a result of declining pound sterling rate which was 8.4% lower on average during the third quarter compared to the second quarter. Also, we saw a decrease in other revenues which reduced the yield by 0.7 basis points and lower performance fees in the quarter further depressed the yields by 0.3 basis points. These factors were offset by one more day in the period which increased the yield by 0.4 basis points. A little bit of guidance here, looking forward to the fourth quarter we would expect our net revenue yield to be roughly in line with the third quarter level at 42 basis points assuming consistent market and FX levels in line today. So moving onto slide 12 as we\u2019ve done before we provide the US GAAP operating results for the quarter, my comments today however will focus exclusively on the variances related to our non-GAAP GAAP adjusted measures which can be found on slide 13. Slide 13, you will see net revenues decreased by 1,9 million or 0.2% quarter over quarter to $854.7 million which includes a negative FX rate impact of $18.5 million. Within the net revenue number, you will see that adjusted investment management fees increased by 19.8 million or 2.1% to 982.7 million, this reflects higher average AUM for the quarter partially offset by the impact of currency on our AUM mix. FX decreased adjusted investment management fees by 23 million. Adjusted service and distribution revenues increased by $10 million or 4.9% reflecting higher average AUM for retail products. FX decreased adjusted service and distribution revenues by $0.1 million. Adjusted performance fees came in at $3.8 million in Q3 and were earned from a variety of different investment capabilities including $2.3 million from bank loan products. Foreign exchange decreased these fees by 0.1 million. Again some guidance here, in Q4 we'd expect performance fees to be in line with our historical guidance at 5 million in the quarter. Adjusted other revenues in the third quarter were $19.3 million and that was an decrease of 12.4 million from the prior quarter primarily due to a decrease of 7.3 million in transaction fees from real estate and 2 million decrease in transactional sales charges from our UIT products. Foreign exchange decreased these revenues by $0.1 million. Some guidance here looking forward to Q4, we would expect to see this number increase in the range of $23 million to 25 million. Third-party distribution services and advisory expense which we net against growth revenues increased by 13.8 million or 3.9% and this movement was in line with higher revenues derived from our retail assets under management, FX decreased these expenses by 4.8 million. Moving on down the slide you\u2019ll see that adjusted operating expenses at 515.4 million decreased by 10.8 million or 2.1% relatively to the second quarter. Foreign exchange reduced adjusted operating expenses by $8.2 million during the quarter. Our adjusted employee compensation came in at 339.1 million, a drop of 8.8 million or 2.5% and this was due to lower variable compensation on performance fees. Foreign exchange decreased adjusted compensation by 5.1 million, adjusted marketing expenses fell by 2.2 million or 7.6%, 26.8 million reflecting fewer client events held in the quarter, FX decreased adjusted marketing expense by 0.3 million in the quarter. Our adjusted property office in tech expenses were 82.1 million in the quarter, a decrease of 0.7 million over the second quarter and FX decreased these expenses by 1.2 million. And then adjusted G&A expenses at 67.4 million increased 0.9 million or 1.4% and this was driven by cost associated with several new product introductions. Foreign exchange decreased adjusted G&A by 1.6 million. Again some guidance from Q4, we would expect to see these expense line-items roughly flat with the third quarter other than marketing. We expect marketing spend to increase in the range of 32 to 35 million which is seasonally consistent with prior years. Continuing on down the page, you will see that our adjusted non-operating income increased 9 million compared to the second quarter. This was primarily driven by 4.9 million again realized on our pound sterling US dollar hedge as well as due to mark to market gains in our seed money investments in the third quarter. Firms\u2019 effective tax rate on pre-tax adjusted net income in Q3 came in at 26.5% consistent with prior quarter and guidance here looking forward to the fourth quarter; we believe our tax rate will increase slightly to 27% largely due to the currency impact on the mix of our earnings. And this brings us to our adjusted EPS of $0.60 and adjusted net operating margin of 39.7%. I would say just generally as you probably would expect that foreign exchanges had a real impact on our operating results as reported in US dollars. Just to quantify that for you, when we look at our Q3 versus Q2 results, our operating EPS was resulted $0.018 lower as a result of foreign exchange as well as our margin being impacted by 0.3%. Looking at year-over-year, Q3 to Q3, the numbers are larger obviously, EPS is down $0.034 cents due to currency and our margin is done 0.7% as a result of FX only. So, with that before I turn over to Marty, I would also like to provider a quick update on the business optimization work that we implemented in Q4 of last year. We made very good progress on our optimization efforts and have generated approximately 14 million in annual run rate savings by the end of the third quarter. Some of the bigger opportunities are ahead of us however. But we are confident that we will be able to achieve the targeted rate savings number as we've discussed of 30 to 45 million in 2017. And with that I would like turn it back to Marty. Marty Flanagan : Thank you operator, could you open up it for questions please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Robert Lee with KBW. Please go ahead. Robert Lee : Marty can you maybe breakdown I guess a little bit more color on kind of the retail flow trend, I know I think you mentioned Asia Pac but kind of give some sense of what you're seeing Asia, US versus EMEA and then maybe are we getting any sense that ahead of the overall implementation that\u2019s starting to - at this point starting to change kind of investor behavior or activity levels in the US. Marty Flanagan : Good questions. So I\u2019ll make some comments and ask Loren to come for some of the more specifics. So Asia-Pacific in particular is having a tremendous year both retail and institutional and it is also very broad base there. EMEA continues to be strong for us, we've had that the Brexit and some of the challenges on the continent. Generally it is lower than what we had seen previously but the UK would have really come back from that reserve, the Brexit low but again not robust that inflows as we saw a year ago. But again I think we feel we are on track. In the States with regard to DOL rule, it\u2019s hard to point to the behavior with anything to do with the DOL. I think it\u2019s still more the active passive debate that\u2019s really probably driving behavior more than anything right now. Will it change going forward, it will definitely put an awful lot of money in motion in the US retail channel, there is just no question in my mind as people make the changes from brokerage to advisory and as brokers narrow the platform of money managers and so what that sets up there will definitely be winners and losers and again I think those firms with the breadth of capabilities of both active and passive capabilities are going to be the ones that do well lot of it. Loren you want a little more. Loren Starr : I mean just a little bit more color, I mean in Asia Pac we are seeing significant flows coming in, particularly into Japan [indiscernible] has a big winner there. We are also seeing China mutual funds flows in our joint venture providing good lift and that\u2019s been pretty consistent. In continental Europe net flows continue to really be a little bit mix but our GTR product in particular just every quarter continues to grow both in the UK and in continental Europe. So that\u2019s a continued trend and we are very excited about some of the new product introductions FYI in terms of income oriented products that is similar to GTR product. In the US, it has been sort of a mix of things we are seeing very strong take on products like our diversified dividend product, our core bond plus fund is doing very well and then certainly ETFs, very strong flow into senior loan products and another fixed income products. So I think we are third most successful ETF provider in fixed income year-to-date in the US. So that\u2019s a trend. And then some of that in the [indiscernible] has been some outflows in some of the other products that are more value oriented that have seen performance tick down a little bit. Hopefully that gives you some good color. Robert Lee : And maybe just quick follow-up and second maybe with the DOL theme. I mean obviously there has been all those focus of whether it\u2019s\u2019 due to the mutual fund business and brokerage versus advisory. I would expect that if more money moves to advisory as I think broadly expected that benefits, the SMA business. So could you maybe update us on kind of how you feel about your positioning in the SMA business is that a part of the business that you\u2019ve you know how big is that for you and do you true feel like you have the right offering there or you need to invest in that in those strategies. Marty Flanagan : So a good question. So we have an SME capability have for a long, long, long time like many people. So again it\u2019s not limited to at all a limitation for us. So we would like to look at it as another vehicle offering to deliver our investment capabilities and again that would be I agree with you it is a need that firms are going to have, they don't have it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Craig Siegenthaler : I have a follow-up on the DOL rule, and I\u2019m assuming I probably won't be the last one in this call either. But I'm just wondering are you actually seeing brokers strength the numbers, partners they work with just yet and I'm also wondering what key components of Invesco's platform do you think the firm will you think will help the firm remain large at the main US brokers and in some cases you think you actually be able to increase your share? Marty Flanagan : I don\u2019t want to get ahead of what announcements have been made and not been made because I'm not sure what's public and what's not, it does seem and it's only been different firm by firm. So I think that\u2019s the first point, I think so often when we have these conversations we think it is going to be a generic outcome and it\u2019s not. And as I said, if you just look at where Merrill Lynch is going where Edward Jones seems to be going and where now Morgan Stanley seem to be going with all the public information you can see that they are taking different approaches to it. That said, the firms that are going to do well which we have been suspecting and again it seems that we are getting early confirmation are those firm with broad ranges of capabilities that are strongly performing they are going to - they\u2019ll do fine in this. We\u2019ve put ourselves in that category. Those firms that actually have ETFs a long track record of ETFs, they\u2019ll also do well those are capabilities that are in need and I pull a third element into where again it is different firm by firm by but those firms that can take the capabilities whether it be a mutual fund or an ETF vehicle and help rate solutions for clients and this is even at the broker level are going to do well. The other element that people are talking about I think and I think we all get in the right context the price sensitivity it is real, the way that the financial advisor is going to meet that need is really a combination of active and passive capabilities that will drive down the overall effective key rate for their clients which is a good thing. And again I think specifically vehicle by vehicle, you need to be competitively priced. If you are selling at a premium price and if you are very strong performance, you\u2019d probably, hopefully can keep it there but there is going to be real pressure there. If you\u2019re at a premium price or not performing well you are in a lot of trouble. And we do believe that the platforms, they will be narrowed and they will be - and again each firm is going be different and we look at ourselves as being on the right side of those outcomes. Operator : Our next question is from [indiscernible] with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : I can\u2019t help myself either, on DOL, can you give us a sense of what percentage if you have it, I know it\u2019s tough given the omnibus relationships that you have with your distributors, what generally if you have it, what percentage of your retail is bucket into brokerage oriented qualified accounts versus advisory? Marty Flanagan : I don't have that right now but again I'd still come back to the point you're probably making is if you\u2019re brokerage it\u2019s going to go away its\u2019 all going to go to advisors and you're going to be a loser and I don't think you can make that draw that conclusion from what we are seeing. Again just look at Morgan Stanley in the announcement today they're going to keep the advisory and brokerage both open and again I think it doesn't really matter how our capability is there whether it\u2019s in the brokerage channel or in the advisory channel, you have a good capability, you\u2019re going to continue to be there. So, again I know I\u2019m not getting the specific number you're talking about I just don't have it here. Unidentified Analyst : Stepping back there seems to be a bit of a pickup of M&A discussion you've seen it in some of your markets alright with Janus Henderson [indiscernible]. What\u2019s your sense of how the industry deals with this excess capacity muted active flows and some of the regulatory changes, would you anticipate a big wave of consolidation and what kind of shape and form you think it takes and what\u2019s Invesco's role in that? Marty Flanagan : A good question, look, you've been around the industry a long time and so by now there is a declaration of massive consolidation for a couple of decades. I would say the reality is the environment we are in now which support that notion more than never before. And I\u2019d say much has been driven by the regulatory environment principally and just the ever increasing cost you then have things like cyber security areas where we all spend a lot of money where we never did before. And then the extended period of active passive movement which again I would also say it is when you read about in the paper every day it's probably going to far right, it\u2019s not going back to where it was but it would moderate and I do believe there will be very strong place for active capabilities too. And again we are in a position of we take the answers active and passive. So we are well placed regardless. So, I think what you\u2019re going to have happen in the M&A front is you were firm a without scale I think you\u2019re going to need to do something and so I think you are going to see the likelihood of combinations of undersized firms is probably higher than it\u2019s ever been before. And the other point though is somebody has to be a willing buyer and not everybody is going to be willing buyer of some of those firms. So, I think what you\u2019ll see is organic growth coming from firms that really are not well positioned in this environment. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Michael Carrier : Hey Loren, maybe just a couple for you on some of guidance that you gave. So one is just on the other revenues, the rate or the level you gave is a little bit lower than where our expectations have been. So just - is that just fourth quarter, we\u2019re heading into \u201817, I know it's lumpy and hard to predict, but just wanted to gauge kind of what's driving that. And then I think on the expense side, you gave a lot of color on FX in terms of how that's impacting the revenues, the expenses and then the hedge and the non-op, and I know you\u2019ve got the efficiency program in place to lower the run rate, but if we\u2019re continuing to be in this environment, is there any other levers you can pull on the expense side or how much can be offset by FX, pulling that down, just to try to manage through this volatile FX backdrop? Loren Starr : So, good questions. So, on the other revenues, that was specifically just for Q4 guidance, we don't think it\u2019s really a trend. Obviously, it moves around, it's hard to predict and we've seen that line can be somewhat volatile based on timing, just in terms of transactions happening, they can lump up in a particular quarter or be a little bit absent in the quarter. And then certainly when there is more volatility uncertainty in the markets, you can see that number, there is a slowdown, there is a component of our UIT sales that has slowed down, just in line of - in respect to the DOL, uncertainties. And so I think that is something that should hopefully begin to be more clear as to whether that's the true run rate or whether it can come back. But I think right now, we\u2019re looking quarter-to-quarter on that line item. So that\u2019s it. In terms of expenses, is there more to be done, I mean, there is always more that can be done. We\u2019re continuing to look beyond some of the things that we identified in the optimization to see if there are other sort of larger opportunities that can be realized into 2017. As we all know, when we get into our - looking out three years and understanding the need for our incremental margins to be where we want them to be, we have to continue to look and find ways to organize ourselves in a way that would provide that outcome. So I would say there is more to come on that to the extent that we can identify them, but certainly in the near-term, in terms of the optimization, we are eagerly going after those. Michael Carrier : Okay. And then Marty, maybe just as a follow-up and the question on M&A in the industry. I guess has anything changed for you guys, meaning it seems like you've done things in the past that have kind of created the business mix that you have. You've been more focused on either launching products, small things on the side and then capital management, whether it\u2019s the dividend or the buyback. Just is there anything that you see shifting in the industry that would cause the firm like you like that has scale to think that you need to become bigger or do something that\u2019s maybe not - that hasn't been the default over the past couple of years? Marty Flanagan : So I would say, like always, we continue to pay attention to what's available in the marketplace and the way that we look at it really has not changed, is it filling a skill gap for region, those types of obvious things, we\u2019ll continue to do that. There are fewer gaps now than we\u2019ve ever had. I mean, and it gets back to the comment to Bill's question and others in the DOL. We think we've put the firm in a position where client demand is right, whether be alternatives, passive capabilities through factor investing ETFs, et cetera. The institutional business continues to be a huge opportunity for us and the like. That said, we\u2019ll continue to pay attention to what's going out there. I think it's again just my opinion, those firms that are narrowly focused are going to be dramatically more challenged than those firms that are global in the retail market, the institutional market and have a broad range of high conviction fundamental factor-based capabilities. So, but again, we\u2019ll continue to pay attention. Loren Starr : Michael, maybe one more point because I know your question with legitimate, but I think we\u2019re spending more time honestly thinking about ways that we are going to grow revenues as opposed to we\u2019re going to be in a position where we\u2019re having to cut costs, so we\u2019re continuing to invest around new product introductions, continue to strengthen our capabilities. As Marty has mentioned, I mean we think we are well-positioned to actually succeed in this environment. And so that\u2019s really been our focus and being able to grow organically in that 3% to 5% range I think should provide us with the ability to continue to expand margins going forward and we are not sort of looking defensively to protect ourselves. We are, I think, thinking about the opportunities to grow in this market. Marty Flanagan : So let me stay on that, because I think this is what is different today than prior challenging times when there is a pullback, I mean the traditional playbook was market pullback focus on cutting expenses where we can do that with an eye to making sure that you don't just vanish the firm. That was really more an environment. We thought it was competitive five years ago and 10 years ago, but it\u2019s nothing like today and that's just competitive, but the market shift. So we feel again we\u2019re uniquely placed with the capabilities we have that it would be stupid of us not to continue to invest and grow the ETF business or the institutional business or the solutions business and I think to your point earlier, the most dangerous thing you can be doing, if you are a narrowly focused firm, challenge right now is to be not investing in the future, and I think that's where a lot of firms are finding themselves having to do when I think that's you\u2019re confirming about outcome as far as I am concerned. But you have to be disciplined, right, and that's why we\u2019re very, very disciplined. We\u2019re always looking to be more efficient, more effective and while at the same time invest for the future. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dan Fannon : Thanks. I guess Loren, you talked about a flat fee rate for the fourth quarter. I guess if we think about the ins and outs with regards to products from a kind of a flows and your backlog and what you guys are seeing strengthening, can you talk about the direction of the fee rate based on that ex kind of markets and currencies? Loren Starr : Yeah. I mean it\u2019s all positive. So we\u2019re continuing to see institutional pipeline at a much higher revenue yield coming in and what's coming out in terms of the mix generally of the products on the retail side. Asia, China, very positive relative to the overall fee rate for the firm. So, that which would make you think while the fee rate must be going up has been offset obviously due to the FX impacts because obviously the pound has declined even further from where we were in the third quarter and that's why it\u2019s in this flattish kind of range. But again, the trends that have been there for a long time are still there in terms of the types of products that we\u2019re offering more alternatives, I think that it do support a higher fee rate are absolutely still there. And so we feel that it\u2019s not necessarily a situation at all where we\u2019re going to see the mix being anything but a positive for us. Other than the FX which we can't control and certainly in our operating results, you are seeing that and so people shouldn't read too much into the US dollar numbers. Dan Fannon : Great. And then I guess Marty, the comments around each of the brokers or the warehouses coming up with different solutions, I guess just from a servicing perspective and how you guys are dealing with that, it seems like that\u2019s a burden on the industry to now have to deal with all the various different platforms in a, not in a uniform way and so that seems like costs, that seems like more investment on your guys side. I guess, is that the right way to interpret that? Marty Flanagan : So it's a good question. Here is my view on it. So at one level, there is no change from the standpoint of those firms have always had brokerage business and advisory business and the movement to advisory has been a trend and the desire of the broker, the distributors for a number of years. So, the industry is already set up to serve that way. Now again, I\u2019d come back to in this environment, what - there is an awful lot of work to comply with the DOL and so it is firm like us that have the depth of capability through wholesale, Invesco consulting that can help make the move, because they are real moves that with their client base. So again, we have the resources, we have the capabilities and we can help them make those changes. I think the biggest concern that I think everybody has heard over more recently was a real concern that there is going to be a large proliferation of share classes, because each distributor wanting to serve the clients in a different way and I know this is no great insight, but it seems to be the industry is coalescing probably on a couple of share classes which would be some costs associated with it, but I mean that\u2019s very doable. And I think it\u2019s much better outcome for both we and the end clients. So again I think what I would do is go back to the firms that have resources and capabilities to support their clients through this change are going to be in a better position than those that don\u2019t. And again this gets back to the part of the questions about scale and M&A. I mean, if you can support your clients beyond just an investment capability, you\u2019re at a disadvantage. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Hey, thanks, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Sorry to add to the extensive row of tequila shots, that are the DOL questions, but I had a couple more for you, sorry. Not asking for attribution here, but thinking broadly in the dialogs that you\u2019ve had with your partners and obviously they are at a greater depth than we\u2019re seeing out in the press and such, can you give us a broad sense or even a range of how much you expect that the wealth management product shelf could end up shrinking for commission accounts? Loren Starr : It's hard to answer that question. I would say what is a truism across-the-board, you would get the feedback that the pace to advisory account will pick up at a material rate driven by the DOL, but again I think that's consistent with the direction of travel that has been in place and, but again, you see cross currents in that, right. So Morgan Stanley has, I think, they are going to support both channels, right, but that said, their advisory business has been growing quite dramatically and it will continue to. So it\u2019s hard to size, but I think if you look back five years from now, the predominance of assets will be in advisory. I think that's a fair conclusion to draw. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Well, okay, that's fair. Good enough. And then thinking about maybe down the line where this might lead to potential cost-cutting opportunities and of course understanding that this isn\u2019t a near-term thing, right, because you just highlighted earlier how you\u2019re going to need to be there to support your partners as they go through this transition, but ultimately beyond near-term, this is probably going to lead to some pretty substantial differences in distribution dynamics, you guys do tend to have a pretty large wholesaler team. And so when you think about how those selling dynamics in to this channel might change, what kind of expense cut opportunity could that lead to if we end up seeing a channel that is more focused on home office and less on the field, can you help us try to frame what kind of opportunity ultimately that might lead to from an expense cutting perspective? Loren Starr : Yes. So interesting perspective. I think the answer is more along this line. I don't think the demand for support is going to go down, it will probably only go up. But it will be different and so if you go back 10 years ago, if the role of a wholesaler was to, here is a great fund and here is why you should put it in your portfolio, it has a great long term track record, it is in that grade, the nature of the support is going to be very different and the field support if you want to call it that will be much more of individual\u2019s focus on solutions and how - as they are working on their asset allocation, how do you help them build a portfolio range of different investment capabilities, the range of different vehicles that would meet their need. So it would be a very different type of support. So what you can\u2019t size right now is it doesn\u2019t stay the same, but just different skill sets or is there a sort of a size issue that you're talking about and I\u2019d say it\u2019s too early to conclude whether or not there are real cost savings there. My instincts would be the demand for the support is going to be there, but it\u2019s going to be different. So the cost savings opportunity might not necessarily be there, which then gets you back to the prior questions that again if you\u2019re not a firm with resource and capabilities to support the client, you\u2019re extremely disadvantaged in this environment going forward. Brennan Hawken : Okay, great. Well, a lot of uncertainty, but thanks for the color and helping us walk through that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Blostein : Thanks. Just sticking with the theme, so Marty, one of your earlier comments, you mentioned refocus on the management obviously is one of the pretty critical criteria is the shelf space. For instance, people kind of rethink would stays in and stays off. So, can we drill down a little more into that? We obviously haven't seen any aggressive fee cut reductions from the active community yet. Do you anticipate that's coming and I guess more importantly, thinking through Invesco's product lineup, which products could be more susceptible to fee cuts and I guess do you anticipate yourself make any reductions to secure shelf space? Marty Flanagan : So, again, it's - in the light of the environment and from a macro view, I think that's a good question. I think the reality is, if you look at the larger firms right now, their fees are already very, very competitive, because they have the scale to have lower fees. So I don't sense that there is going to be a massive - within those firms, I don't think, you are going to see much of a change. I think the firms that are disadvantaged are again back to, if you don't have scale in your asset levels, your fees are almost by definition, higher and you are disadvantaged. You got to solve that one where the other and there is no lesson to solve that. So again, specifically, and again, we do, like everybody else, see all the time. We know they\u2019re very competitive and we also have the added benefit too of adding the factor-based capabilities, so we can actually help also drive down the blended fee rate within these four financial adviser and we also have solutions capabilities that we have in that portfolio too. Alex Blostein : Okay, thanks. And then just a second question, I guess about the robust solution offering you guys bought a couple of quarters ago, can you talk a little bit about the opportunity I guess to leverage that, as the distribution dynamics evolve, I\u2019m not sure there is a way to expand that or more of the B2B concept or is this still going to be largely targeted on that directly working with the client. Marty Flanagan : Yes, no, so early days. We are thrilled with Jemstep and it is focused on reporting our business partners. And again, I would put this in the context again of firms need more and more tools to help clients meet their needs and it is definitely going to help us with that. We see that already with the interest in it and it\u2019s frankly additional tool that will help clients with things like onboarding in a more efficient and effective way with their asset allocation, if it is open platform. So again, it is very supportive what they\u2019re doing and we think it is important development for us. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi, there. Just a quick follow-up on a lot of this. I'm curious in terms of the factor base of ETF world specifically, as the business evolves, you gave us some good stats on the importance of first mover advantage, but when you talk about code supporting your distribution partners, how important is the established 3 to 5 year track record in terms of not just being on shelf, but actually getting the flows because what we are all seeing is a huge proliferation of products being put out by everyone [indiscernible] these days, but given your presence, how much is that 3 to 5 year track record advantage? Marty Flanagan : It's huge. Look, I think again, go to the macro point that we\u2019ve all talked about, don't extrapolate your knowledge on mutual fund development with ETF development, right. So there is a limit to how many ETFs there can be within, as you want to call it, a certain segment and it is typically three that are successful. [indiscernible] US Equity income fund, I don't know how many there are in the category, it's probably I don\u2019t know, 400 or something. So there is an inherent limitation right there and the other thing, you\u2019re looking at real track records with these factor based ETFs that have long track as opposed to extrapolating, back testing type experiences and no one needs to take that risk when you have a broad range of capabilities. The other elements that again, we\u2019ve talked about and others have talked about, it's the total cost of ownership of those ETF's and it's just not the fee, it\u2019s the liquidity and those firms that have a presence, they\u2019re going to get the backing to create the liquidity, which is going to drive down the total cost of ownership also. So we have founded it to be a realism that the breadth of product, first mover advantage, but, by the way, the long track records really matter a lot, and I think as we have said before, the barriers to entry are very low that the barriers to success are very high. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate that. Just one follow-up, you mentioned in your comments on Japan, the success in selling some REIT product there as you look for yield. Can you talk about just real estate demand in general, you\u2019ve got a big real estate business, but I didn\u2019t hear too much of it in the puts or takes in terms of the current environment? Marty Flanagan : Yeah. No. It continues to be, as we look forward in that sort of institutional pipeline and qualify, it has been high demand globally. So again, I think it\u2019s one of the best teams in the business and they continue to be doing very, very well and we don't expect that to end any time soon. Operator : Thank you. Our last question is from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Michael Cyprys : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So, Marty, if I could just follow up on your point earlier on the price sensitivity is real, just curious how Invesco is planning to deal with that over the next few years, particularly as DOL goes into effect, it just seems like there is more money shifting in to passive and lower fee products, just how do you think about competitively pricing active management and the elasticity of demand? And just the second point there is just given your scale, how do you think about the opportunity to be more aggressive? Marty Flanagan : Yes. Look, again, those are broad questions, hard to answer broad questions like that, because it gets very specific, so how I would answer it is, we look at where we are priced, our prices are very competitive and they tend to be very competitive with again those firms that have a certain size and have very competitively priced products. And with solid, especially good performance, they\u2019re going to continue pretty well. I don\u2019t know how to answer it other than that. I think what you could see probably in future is I do think that the stronger only can get stronger. More money is going to go towards those firms with more money, more breakpoints, these will drop, but again, that would be a continuation of what's been in the past. Again, I just think it's the smaller firms that are under lot of pressure. Loren Starr : I think their impact is probably going to be the share class that gets introduced, as we've seen sort of both costs, share classes that are stripped down, don't have transfer agency costs, all these things, I mean that's going to be the biggest sort of near-term impact, but I mean obviously the management team is going to get looked at as well. Marty Flanagan : Yeah. Actually Loren does bring up a very good point. I don't know how much attention has been paid on it, but part of it in this low return environments, this active, passive movement that we've talked about and have seen dramatically active managers in packaged products have been at a real disadvantage just because of the expense ratio where frankly, it is a pass through a lot of expenses, whether they would be 12b-1, [indiscernible] and you are probably on average at a disadvantage and average fund of probably about 45 basis points every year and as these pure share classes come out, that's going to be benefit for active management also and the competitive returns vis-a-vis passive funds. Michael Cyprys : Okay, great. Just last follow-up here on DOL, you mentioned more money moving from brokerage to advisory, can you talk about how you position to capture those flows and maybe you can elaborate a bit more in terms of marketing and sales efforts there that you are putting in place to capture that and also vehicle delivery changes? Marty Flanagan : Yes. So I mean, it is vehicle and again everybody is going to solve that. I don\u2019t think that's going to be much of a competitive advantage one way or the other. You\u2019re going to respond to your partners as you\u2019re going to need. Again, I think the thing that\u2019s going to be differentiating is those firms that can help their partners make the shift from where they need to from brokerage to advisory and again it gets to firms like ourselves that have things like Invesco consulting, broad field support, thought leadership to help them work through those changes and again a broad range of capabilities. So we think we\u2019re positioned very well for that and with the money involved, we like the money in motion. That\u2019s going to be good thing and we think we are going to be a net beneficiary of it at the time we get through the other side. Michael Cyprys : Okay, thank you. Marty Flanagan : Okay. Well, thank you, everybody very much and we\u2019ll talk to you next quarter. Have a good rest of the day. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

Operator : Welcome to Invesco's fourth quarter results conference call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I would like to turn call over to your speakers for today, Marty Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco and Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin. Marty Flanagan : Thank you very much and thank you for joining us this morning and if you are so inclined, you can follow along using the presentation that's available on our website. And today, I will provide a review of our business results for the full year and for the fourth quarter 2016. Loren will go into greater details of the financials and then, as our practice, Loren and I will answer any question you call may have. So, let me begin by highlighting the firm's operating results for the full year which you will find this on slide four. Long-term investment performance remains strong ending the year at 72% and 75% of assets, ahead of peers on a three and five year basis. Strong investment performance and our focus on providing outcome oriented solutions to clients contributed to long-term net inflows of $12.7 billion and an organic growth rate of 1.9% for the year. Total net flows for the year were $22.9 billion dollars versus $2.5 billion in 2015. This result was driven by the success of our liquidity business and represents an organic growth rate of 3% for Invesco during 2016. Adjusted operating margin for the year was 38.7% and we returned nearly $1 billion to shareholders during 2016 through dividends and stock buybacks. Assets under management were $813 billion at the end of the year, up from $775 billion at the end of 2015. Adjusted operating income was $1.3 billion for 2016 versus nearly $1.5 billion in the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for 2016 were $2.23 versus $2.44 in the prior year. We continued our stock repurchase program, repurchasing $535 million worth of stock during the year. Let's take a look back at a number of our achievements over the past year, all of which are intended to strengthen our ability to help clients achieve their investment objective and further advance our competitive position. Driven by strong client demand and a compelling suite of capabilities, Invesco PowerShares continued to gain share in ETF market throughout the year. Long-term net inflows for our ETF business totaled $9.3 billion and we have seen the strong broad-based inflow of momentum carry into the first few weeks of 2017. Early in the year, we completed the acquisition of Jemstep, a market leading provider of advisor-focused digital solutions. This acquisition represents our investment and our partnership with the advisory committee and highlights our efforts to participate in involving technology within our industry. We continue to expand our solutions efforts, which bring together our full capabilities to provide outcomes that help clients achieve their investment objectives. One result of the strategy was winning the Rhode Island 529 mandate of $6.5 billion, which was funded in July of 2016. We also continue to invest in our institutional business by refining our global strategy, strengthening the team with additional experienced talent and more effectively aligning ourselves for opportunities in the market. This work contributed strong institutional flows during the third and fourth quarters, building on nearly two years of positive institutional flows. For the full year 2016, institutional long-term net flows totaled $11 billion. On slide seven, we turn to highlights from the fourth quarter. Long-term investment performance remained strong during the quarter at 72% and 75% of actively manage assets were ahead of peers over three and five years respectively. The adjusted operating margin was 38.9% and we returned $264 million to shareholders during the fourth quarter through dividends and stock buybacks. Assets under management were $713 billion at the end of the fourth quarter versus $820 billion at the end of the third quarter. Adjusted operating income was $336 million in the quarter versus $339 million in the prior quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.59 versus $0.60 in the prior quarter. Our quarterly dividend was $0.28 per share, up nearly 4% from the prior year. Before Loren goes into details on the financials, let me take a moment to review our investment performance and flows during the quarter. Training to slide 10. We continue to strengthen our investment platform to provide the global expertise and support minimizing distractions for our investment professionals, so they can focus on delivering investment results. Our strong investment performance reflects these efforts, 72% of assets in the top half of peers on a three-year basis and 75% in the top half on a five-year basis. Now as you see on slide 11, active long-term net flows were impacted by a $2 billion sub-advised mandate from insurance client previously disclosed. Passive long-term net flows were impacted by outflows from UITs of $1.5 billion during the quarter. As we noted, this was primarily for short-dated equity trusts that a few of our key distributors have removed move from their platforms ahead of the implementation of the DOL fiduciary rule. Long-term passive net flows were also impacted by an outflow of $1.3 billion, reflecting a reduction in leverage in our mortgage capital business IVR. This move was in support of our portfolio management strategy. However, the $1.3 billion does not earn a management fee and it does not impact revenues. If you back out the impact of these three items, total long-term net flows would have been more than $2 billion positive, reflecting the continued momentum in our business. As noted earlier, we continued to invest in our institutional business throughout 2016. As a result of our focus and investment, institutional quarterly long-term flows for the third and fourth quarters were quite strong, extending a series of positive flows that stretch back more than two years. Solid performance of our institutional business was not enough to offset the impact of redemptions within retail. Retail quarterly long-term flows reflect the impact of the sub-advised mandate and the UIT outflows noted on the previous slide. Institutional flows during the quarter reflect IVR outflow, as noted on the previous slide. Without this, IVR leveraged institutional flows would have been quite strong. At the end of the year, our institutional pipeline was up 22% quarter-over-quarter. As importantly, the fee rate on these assets was well above the overall net revenue of the firm. In January, we have seen flows of more than $1.6billion so far with diversity across all geographies as well as active and passive capabilities. So now I would like to turn the call over to Loren. Loren Starr : Great. Thank you very much, Marty. Quarter-over-quarter, our total AUM decreased $7.3 billion or 0.9%. This was driven by a negative FX translation of $14.8 billion and long-term net outflows of $2.7 billion. These factors were somewhat offset by market gains of $6.4 billion and inflows from the QQQs and money market of $2.7 billion and $1.1 billion respectively. Our average AUM for the fourth quarter was $809 billion. That was down 0.6% versus the third quarter. Our annualized long-term organic growth rate in Q4 was negative 1.5%, again based on the reasons that Marty just gave. If you look at the adjustments provided around some of the large client redemptions, the organic growth rate would have been closer to 1%, but that was still down from 7.1% in the third quarter. Our net revenue yield came in at 42.7 basis points, which is 0.7 basis points higher than the prior quarter. Elevated performance fees and other revenues increased the yield by 0.7 basis points and 0.2 basis points respectively. Net revenue yield was also benefited by year-end contract adjustments and third-party service and distribution expenses, which increased yield by 0.6 basis points. These three positive factors were somewhat offset by the impact of FX on the mix which acted to decrease our yield by 0.8 basis points. Moving on to slide 15. As we have done before, we are showing you our U.S. GAAP operating results for the quarter. However, my comments today will focus exclusively on the variances related to our non-GAAP adjusted measures which will be found on the next slide, slide 16. Net revenues increased by $9.1 million or 1.1% quarter-over-quarter to $863.8 million, which included negative FX rate impact of $17.7 million. Within the net revenue numbers, you will see that our adjusted investment management fees decreased by $17.6 million or 1.8% to $965.1 million. This reflects our lower average AUM during the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of 2016 along with the impact of changes in the AUM product and currency mix. FX decreased our adjusted management fees by $20.3 million. Adjusted service and distribution revenues decreased by $4.3 million or 2% and was reflecting the lower average AUM for the products that received these fees. FX decreased adjusted service and distribution revenues by $0.2 million. Our adjusted performance fees came in at $17.9 million in Q4 and these were earned from a variety of investment capabilities, including $5 million from our U.K. investment trust, $4.9 million from real estate, $4.2 million from our global asset allocation strategies. FX decreased these fees by $0.6 million. So going into 2017, a little guidance here. We expect performance fees to follow a similar pattern to 2016 with Q1 fees about $15 million to $20 million driven mainly by our U.K. investment trusts and then moving to a roughly $5 million to $7 million per quarter for the remainder of the year. I would remind everyone that forecasting our performance fees unfortunately is not a precise science. Our adjusted other revenues in the fourth quarter came in at $23.2 million and that was an increase of $3.9 million from the prior quarter. This was primarily due to an increase of $5.3 million in transaction fees from real estate, offset by $3.8 million decrease in our unit investment trust revenues. Foreign exchange decreased our overall other revenues by $0.2 million. Again, looking forward to 2017, we would expect other revenues to decline to $12 million to $15 million per quarter through the year. This is due to two factors. First, we continue to see pressure on our short-dated equity UITs as a result of the early adoption of DOL rules and we do expect that pressure to continue on into 2017. The second factor is a structural change in the way our real estate products are priced with more performance fee based accounts being used than pure transaction fee-based accounts. In future years, we would expect increased performance fees, however, to help offset some of the impact on other revenues. Moving on down in the P&L. In Q4, our third-party distribution service and advisory expenses, which we net against gross revenues, decreased by $13 million or 3.6%. That was driven by lower retail AUM at year-end and contract adjustments. FX decreased these expenses by $3.6 million. So before turning to expenses, let me try to summarize all the revenue guidance I just provided in terms of yield. Looking into 2017, we would expect to see our net revenue yield, excluding performance fees, decline by approximately one basis point year-over-year. This net one basis point decline is due to a negative 1.5 basis point impact, one basis point of that is from foreign exchange and another 0.5 basis point is from other revenues, which I then expect will be partially offset by a positive 0.5 basis point impact from asset mix and flows. To breaking that down even further by taking into account day count, our net revenue yield excluding performance fees should fall to 41 to 41.5 basis points in the first half of 2017. In the second half of the year, this range would increase by 0.5 basis point to 41.5 to 42 basis points. As a reminder, these yields that I am guiding you to, all assumes flat markets and foreign exchange from today's levels. So next, let's get into expenses. Moving down the slide, you will see that adjusted operating expenses at $527.8 million increased by $12.4 million or 2.4% relative to the third quarter. Foreign exchange reduced our adjusted operating expenses by $9.2 million during the quarter. Our adjusted employee compensation came in at $337.9 million. That was a decrease of $1.2 million 0.4%. Foreign exchange decreased our adjusted compensation by $5.5 million. Again looking ahead to 2017, seasonal payroll taxes and a one-month impact from base salary increases will lift Q1 compensation by approximately $20 million. This should then drop-off in the Q2 and level out to roughly $345 million per quarter into the last half of the year, based again on flat markets and foreign exchange as well as the revenue guidance that I provided. Our adjusted marketing expenses in Q4 increased to $8.6 million or 32.1% to $35.4 million. This reflected the seasonal increases in advertising, client events and other marketing costs in support of the business. Foreign exchange decreased our adjusted marketing expenses by $0.8 million. Looking forward into 2017, we would expect our marketing expense to follow 2016 with roughly similar levels as well as seasonal quarterly seasonality. Our adjusted property, office and technology expenses came in, in Q4 at $85 million. That was an increase of $2.9 million or 3.5% over the third quarter. This was due to higher outsourced administration software costs. Our foreign exchange impact on this line item decreased expenses by $1.2 million. As some large technology related projects come into service into 2017, including investments around data and cyber security, we would expect to see property, office and technology expenses increased to approximately $88 million per quarter. Next, our adjusted G&A expenses came in at $69.5 million. That was an increase of $2.1 million or 3.1% quarter-over-quarter. This increase was driven by cost associated with several new product introductions and other product related costs. Our foreign exchange impact on this line item decreased G&A by $1.7 million. Looking into 2017, we would expect G&A expenses to be roughly in line with 2016 levels, around $65 million to $67 million per quarter. Continuing on down the page, you will see that our adjusted non-operating income increased $0.3 million compared to the third quarter. Fourth quarter included a $7.8 million gain realized in our Pound Sterling, U.S. dollar hedge. The firm's effective tax rate on pre-tax adjusted net income in Q4 was 27.7%. This increase in rate was driven by the FX rate movement impact on our profit mix as well as by gains from our foreign currency hedge contracts. Looking forward to 2017, we believe our tax rate should stand at roughly 27%, which then brings us to our adjusted EPS of $0.59 and the adjusted net operating margin of 38.9%. So next, let's turn to slide 18 where I will spend a little time just providing more color on the impact of foreign exchange on our results. We have presented our 2016 results on a constant currency basis by restating the 2016 amounts using the average foreign exchange rate for 2015. As you will note, the FX impact has been significant removing $109.6 million in net revenue and $55.9 million in operating income from our 2016 results. The FX movement has also had a material impact on many operating metrics, driving a 40 basis point decline in our adjusted operating margin and a 0.7 basis point fall in our net revenue yields. As you know, we are protected against some of the negative currency impacts to cash flow into EPS through the use of our Pound Sterling and Euro hedges. These hedges are in place through the end of 2017. We will consider whether to extend them based on our ongoing review of the Brexit situation as well as based on the overall cost of hedging. So at the risk of beating a dead horse, let's just go to the last page here on 19. We hope that this slide is going to help with your modeling the impact of foreign exchange on our financials. And what we show here is the impact of a 10% appreciation or depreciation, both the Sterling as well as on Euro on our operating results. So on the top part of the page, you will see that our adjusted operating EPS or unhedged EPS would flex by plus or minus $0.07 based on a 10% appreciation or depreciation of the Pound. This of course is hypothetical since we are in fact hedged. The adjusted EPS, the hedged EPS would decline only $0.02 under a 10% depreciation scenario for the Pound. It would appreciate $0.06 under a positive 10% move. Our adjusted operating margin would be plus or minus 30 basis points and our net revenue yield excluding performances would move plus or minus 0.8 basis points. The impact of the Euro on our financials is much less than it is based on what happens to the Pound. A 10% appreciation or depreciation of the Euro would have only a plus or minus $0.02 impact on our unhedged EPS. On our hedged EPS, again, the reality for 2017 no material impact on the down scenario of minus 10%, we would see plus $0.02 on an upside. Our adjusted operating margin would be plus or minus 10 basis points and our net revenue yields would move by plus or minus 0.3 basis points. So hopefully that's helpful. And with that, I will turn it over to Marty. Marty Flanagan : Operator, can we open it up for questions please? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Michael Carrier of Merrill Lynch. Your line now is open. Michael Carrier : All right. Thanks guys. Loren, maybe first, thanks for all the guidance, just given the lower level on the other revenues that you guided to, just wanted to get some sense on are there any maybe expense offsets for those types of revenues? It seems like maybe the G&A line being flat, like in terms of your guidance there is some there, but just wanted to get a sense if that does come in at the low end of that? Is there anything that can be done to offset that? Loren Starr : We are continuing to focus on optimization opportunities. Those impacts are in fact reflected in some of our expense guidance. It is possible that we could do better than we are suggesting here. So that's obviously some potential positive upside. There is some potential positive upside on performance fees as well. I mean we are guiding based on what we know, but again there are definitely positive potential surprises there which would be very accretive to our incremental margins and to earnings. Overall, I think we are very focused on continuing to invest behind the business. We think it's important that we do continue to position ourselves competitively, particularly given the rapid changes that we are seeing in the environment. But we are obviously going to continue to be very focused on expenses to try to provide a result that you would view as acceptable. Michael Carrier : Okay. And maybe as a follow-up, Marty or Loren, just on the DOL fiduciary rule, just as the industry is moving forward, just wanted to get some sense on where things are trending? How you expect it to impact? Whether it's fee rates, revenue shares? Anything that you are starting to get some color? How you guys are positioning for that as we approach? Marty Flanagan : So my view is similar to yours. It sounds like others. I think there is some anticipation that the DOL rule will get delayed, I don't know anybody in the industry, whether it be money manager or distribution partners that are slowing down, right. So the movement towards advisory, it is in place and it will just continue, right. It would be a mistake not to think that is the case. The feedback that we are getting from our distribution partners. What they are looking to do is to work with firms with a broad range of capabilities and that have good performing capabilities and also competitive expense ratios. And so on each point, more specifically what is of interest, the focus on how to combine active and passive capabilities within the channels and an evolving focus on how to use factor capabilities. ETFs, in particular. So we are positioned very well from that point of view, both solutions and with our capabilities and factor. The other topic is a keen interest now in looking at the use of alternative capabilities within the retail channel now. That's been a topic for a number of years and as we have talked in the past, it did not move as fast as anybody in the industry thought for a number of reasons. One being distribution partners getting organized around it. Secondly, how to use it within the financial advisor and there was a lot of regulatory focus surrounded also. So that seems to be an evolving focus. So we look at ourselves as we think we are positioned really quite well with this as we look forward. Now again, there is going to take some takes and puts and we have talked about UITs. UITs are something that you have already seen the negative impact to us. The good news is what we are starting to see is a greater focus on the use of ETFs in the place of UITs. So again, it's going to be some evolving, how we partner with our different distribution partners, but again, I would say, at the moment, we feel pretty good about it. Michael Carrier : Okay. Thanks a lot. Marty Flanagan : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Your line now is open. Ken Worthington : Hi. Good morning. Marty Flanagan : Good morning. Ken Worthington : First I want to talk about your marketing objectives for the coming year and your allocation of marketing dollars. Are there any meaningful changes as we think about 2017? Areas where you are increasing or decreasing marketing spend, either by regions, asset classes or even products? And if so, can you give us some flavor with regard to what you are thinking? Marty Flanagan : Yes. Interesting, Ken. So its an area that we are actually putting a lot of focus on now as an organization and just strategically what should we be doing. And I think the reality is of where the market is going, brand recognition actually matters a lot. And I would say that's somewhat different than years gone by. Maybe it's a reflection of more competitive maturing industry. So our focus globally is extending the brands because what you get with that is quite frankly your reputation precedes you and you do end up doing better in the retail markets, in particular. We are very strongly placed in the U.K. brand recognition. EMEA also has been improving dramatically as in the United States. We are probably not where we want to be. That would probably be the weakest brand reputation vis-\u00e0-vis the other parts of the world. So again, we are just trying to refine that and continue to focus on enhancing that reputation of the firm. Ken Worthington : Thank you. Invesco's U.S. active equity retail franchise has been pretty consistent outflows with the exception of maybe IBRA and diversified dividend in recent years. I would say performance wasn't great. It wasn't bad and value was out of favor. 2016 seemed to change both the prominence of value investing and the relative performance of many, if not even most, of your U.S. active equity funds. What are your thoughts about the U.S. equity retail business as we think about 2017 and 2018, given both that increase prominence of value investing and the significant improvement of the kind of the former Van Kampen funds? Is there hope or expectations that what's been in moderate but pretty consistent outflows has a chance of turning around? Marty Flanagan : Yes. We are. So our basic view as we talked before this, but one step higher, is sort of this, debate about is it active, is it passive and our basic view, it's both. I mean that is the reality going forward. In the retail channel active and passive is going to be used. Good news is, we are very well positioned for that dynamic. Then specifically, it has been a headwind for U.S. equities, value in particular, over the years, for the reasons we know sort of from 2009 on that sort of beta run. I think the world has changed, right. I have always been a believer in active. It does play an important part in somebody's portfolio. Again I am probably preaching the choir here. So that said, I think when you start to see the relative outperformance in quite a material way, it will be used in U.S. portfolio and we would look to, as you suggest, just absolute relative strength of the value franchise, we would expect that the advisors would start to more actively use those capabilities. Ken Worthington : Thanks. And just lastly, Loren, in terms of UITs, what kind of AUM do you have in UITs right now? And any sense of the scheduled maturity of products in 2017 versus what was scheduled to mature in 2016? Loren Starr : Yes. I mean we have about $9 billion in equities, $8 billion in fixed income UITs. In terms of the maturity, the equities tend to mature more rapidly. So they are probably more like an average 18 months maturity level. So you can assume kind of a book that's every 18 months is going to go away. So you can just take that $9 million and assume a bleed out, at worst case, right where it goes way in 18 months. Ken Worthington : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Glenn Schorr of Evercore. Your line now is open. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thanks very much. I guess it's a combo question. You talked about combining active to passive. And I am curious if we can get a little more color into the, sounds good but how do you actually do it? How much is it relying on Jemstep? How much is it wholesale in the channel? How much is your solutions effort? And will we see that in PowerShares flows overtime as you combine the two? Marty Flanagan : Great question. So it's beyond theory, right. And so when we have been talking about where we have been investing and what reasons, the solution buildout is an important one for us. Actually the immediate focus has been actually on U.S. retail and that might be different than some other focuses. That's because of the dramatic changes going on in the advisor channel. So it's really having solutions experts matching off their home offices to help build different models and solutions for the advisors and then out to the field helping with the models. And it's starting to take shape. I think it's going to be an important way that the business is changing going forward. It will result in greater ETF sales. There's little question in my mind about that. Jemstep is also, it's been a year since we closed, it is actually being really introducing us to a really new channel of distribution. It's advisor focused, it's not direct. I want to make that very clear. So it's partnering with our advisors, but the inquiring of firms that we are working with, our firms that we never had relationships before. So I would look at the financial impact to that and the flow impact probably in latter part of this year starting to kick in because you have to think of it, it is an application installation and we are well underway in a number of areas. So it is a combination thereof and within Jemstep, it is actually using our models that advisors can use. And again, it's not closed, so actually they can use their own models, et cetera, et cetera. So it's a combination thereof, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Okay. I appreciate that. And then a follow up on your flow commentary, the $2.7 billion of outflows but $2 billion inflow, if you exclude the three one-offs. I take a step back and I see you guys haven't had an outflow year since like 2008 and gross sales in the quarter were actually up 7% year-on-year. So maybe just a high level, which products do you think are going to drive growth? I saw Asia was really good in the quarter. What do think is going to drive growth besides what we just talked about in terms of PowerShares? Marty Flanagan : Yes. So you are going to get that, so to the extent of my power comments, that will continue. The other area where you are seeing real success is the institutional business and I would say regionally, like all three regions. We are at different stages of success in the different regions but we just continue to see, as we said, the pipeline just continues to strengthen and so we will just continue to see greater impact institutionally around the world. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Thanks very much. Marty Flanagan : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Your line now is open. Dan Fannon : Thanks. I guess if you could just kind of build on the last question and talk about maybe the U.K. specifically where obviously Brexit and some of the macro factors are out there and kind of an overhang for probably gross sales but then you have seen performance within that franchise also on a shorter term basis come in. And what's your outlook as you think about 2017 for that segment? Marty Flanagan : Let me make a comment and then I am going to turn it over to Loren and he can be more specific. Quite frankly, the EMEA capability within our firm is very, very strong. And I think it's been looked at more, I think, from investors as more of a liability than an asset, which is exactly wrong. We just look to continue to improve our position and we think even with the conversations of Brexit we continue to look to 2017 with things stabling and then moving into growth as we go forward. But, Loren, do you want to add? Loren Starr : Yes, I mean just a little color. So one thing I would say, in particular of the roughly $1.6 billion of long-term inflows that we have seen through January, right, more than half is coming from EMEA. So the region is very, very healthy. We are seeing cross-border again coming in. We are seeing very strong institutional inflows. The U.K. retail situation has always been somewhat an outflow just given the size of the book and it's not a growing area of demand, but it certainly would be more than offset by the flows coming in through the rest of the region. So the opportunity that we believe that exists in EMEA is significant. It's one that people should not see as being sick or damaged or impaired through this Brexit situation and it's one that we feel we are very well-positioned to continue to flow in. So hopefully that gives you a sense of how we feel. Obviously, the Brexit topic is a bigger topic around currency and we been talking about all that but in terms of the actual business and the flows coming into the U.K., it's pretty much not yet seen itself having an impact. Dan Fannon : Great. And then I guess following up on the UIT segment and as well as the performance fees. And I guess in the context of thinking about incremental margin for the overall business, it's my understanding that the UIT business is very profitable for you. As you think about the incremental margin outlook on a combined basis for the firm, has that changed at all as we think about UITs being lower and performance fees being maybe pushed out and lower ongoing other the revenues up front? Loren Starr : No. I think because, as Marty suggested, we are seeing the opportunity to substitute UITs with ETFs and the incremental margin on ETFs are certainly at the same level as UITs. So there should be no degradation due to that particular factor. Overall the biggest impact on our incremental margin this year 2017 is everything to do with just FX having a depressive impact on our net revenue yield. The mix is going to be positive. We are seeing positive net revenue yield lift due to our mix. We don't expect that to change. And so overall we think we are going to be back in that guidance area that we have talked about in the past in that 50% to 65%, again, but that assumes flat markets and flat FX year-over-year which has certainly not been the case. Marty Flanagan : And in an interesting way, this refocus on UITs or how they are being used in the retail channel actually is turning out to be an opportunity for us longer-term from the standpoint of we are having much deeper conversations with the advisors on how to use ETFs and how to build their books. So we ultimately see that as a much more important opportunity as we look out into the future for us. Dan Fannon : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Brennan Hawken of UBS. Your line now is open. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to start out maybe following up on some of the questions on the U.K. So we have seen the FCA take a closer look at pricing for asset management products in the U.K. Can you maybe give your perspective on where you see that going and whether or not you see that leading to pricing pressure and how we should think about it? Marty Flanagan : Yes. Look, it's still early days. Everybody is now responding to the initial report. There is an absolute focus really on value for money and we come out very, very strongly through that analysis. So we sit in a good position because of that. We are very engaged like others in the marketplace. The firms that are at risk are and again it was sort of a direct focus on people, sort of benchmark huggers charging active fees is an area that is probably never a good idea to do that. I don't think people were really focused on doing that on purpose but that's really a real big pressure point and we will just have to see where we come. There's really probably not going to be any direct feedback until much later in the year, probably nine months from now, I would guess. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Great. And then can you size for us the sub-advised portfolio? And was the loss of the sub-advised mandate, was that a BA related mandate? And the rest of the sub-advised portfolio, what portion is BA? Loren Starr : Let's see, I am not sure if I have exact numbers in front of me but our overall sub-advised book is probably under 10% of our overall exposure in the retail space, maybe 15% to 10% out of $170 billion mutual funds. So that gives you a sense of the overall exposure. This particular client was an insurance client. I don't know if we have all the specifics or have provided much specifics around that but it is one that the fee, it was not the highest fee business for us. So again, it's not relative to our overall net revenue yield that's going to be accretive in terms of its loss. I don't think there is a trend here on sub-advised, per se. Obviously there are some big changes that need to happen here and there as certain clients decide to change the way they manage their portfolios. But at this point, I don't think there's something where we are saying there's that risk a lot of sub-advised assets. Brennan Hawken : Okay. And then just one follow-up for the UIT, just to help us think about what the role rates are. For this quarter, when you had the investors roll off into the next series, what percentage of investors did you see opt to roll into the next series? Just help us gauge that $9 billion over the next 18 months? And what portion, at least based on early days, might actually roll off? Loren Starr : Yes. It's actually been a little bit better. In the fourth quarter, things actually improved somewhat. So again, it's sort of a dynamic situation. So we are painting somewhat of a bleak picture on the UIT business in terms of the equity outflow, but it is still a pretty dynamic discussion. And one quarter, I just don't know if there's a trend line I can actually point to, to allow you to model this effectively. It is something that we are continuing to monitor. And so because it's moving around quite a bit, I think it's probably wrong to assume the worst case scenario that I talked about before. Just as another level of information, I mean the fee rate on the equities are roughly 55 basis points. So that's on the sale but then you have to take that number and sort of divide that by an average life of one-and-a-half years. Brennan Hawken : And you guys recognize that not up -- I thought you have recognized it upfront. Loren Starr : We do. We recognized it upfront. But just in terms of how the fee rate yield shows up, we are taking that upfront number and we are dividing it by the overall assets that are in place in the book. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks for the color. Loren Starr : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Bill Katz of Citi. Your line now is open. Bill Katz : Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate you taking my questions. So Marty, you mentioned that in the retail channel that the distributors are a little more focused on expense ratios which we are hearing from a bunch of your peers. And BlackRock cut some pricing, T. Rowe announced this morning, I did speak with them, they have had some pricing cuts as well. When you look at your retail footprint, putting aside the passive business, how do you sort of look at the active business? Is that an area that might need some, how does this stack up when you look at the expense ratio? Could there be any strategic moves here to try and increase volume by bringing pricing down perhaps? Marty Flanagan : Yes. So a couple of things. It is an area of focus. It has always been an area of focus for us. And if you look at what we have done over the last decade, we have re-priced our retail funds downward to the point where, Loren correct me, about 90% of our assets are below median and two-thirds are in the lowest quartile of expenses. So we are placed very, very strongly. Historically, this is not a new topic for us. So we think we are placed very nicely. I also think it's a mistake to think that the first thing that people are looking for is expense ratios. Low expense ratios with bad performance is, it's I don't care how low it is, you can give it to somebody, it's not going to be a factor to drive growth. And still, the primary focus is investment quality. Is it going to generate the returns for the clients in the portfolio? And I think people, don't forget that, that is the driver. I don't think price cuts are going to change the flow dynamic. What I would say, though, if you are above median and not performing well, that's not a good place to be. Bill Katz : Okay. That's probably an understatement. Okay. So the other question I have for you is that in the $1.9 billion, $1.7 billion or the roughly $2 billion of flows this quarter, I appreciate the EMEA in the institutional side but from a product demand perspective, what are you seeing? And then maybe the broader question, if you have time, is everyone sort of hopes that active makes a comeback, is there any real-time dialogue with the distributors in the U.S. in particular that's arguing that you are actually seeing any kind of pickup in active demand? Because from the industry level data, we really are not seeing it. Marty Flanagan : Well, I can just think of a number of conversations that I have been in. And there is a very strong interest, beyond interest, a very important part of the strategy of the distributors to use active capabilities. And in particular for us, the discussions are as high as they have ever been into understanding how to use alternative active capabilities. So I think you are right though from whenever you want to think this started, but the end of last year or so December on, just beginning to see a really strong outperformance of active. It will be taken up, I do believe. But if you look at history, it's always trailed. It doesn't start exactly when you should be doing it. Loren Starr : And in terms of what's really working for us this last quarter in active, we saw the outcome oriented types of products are doing very well, like GTR was probably one of our largest winners. I think it was roughly $2.4 billion of long-term net inflows into that capability. Our diversified dividend capability, so the yield oriented equity capability, $1.4 billion. We saw real estate, bank loans, CLOs as well all being positive in the active space. And then obviously the detractors, the outflows were related to some of, as we talked about, the big sub-advised client as well as there was about $1 billion of just a disposition related to a real estate holding. And this was all talking about 4Q right now, just to be clear. Going into next year, as I said, I think those trends are continuing and we are seeing similar take on of that type of product. Marty Flanagan : And I would just come back to, if you recall, more than three years ago we launched a broad range of alternative retail mutual funds. And if you remember the conversation at the time, we thought the wise thing to do was a broad introduction, knowing that you needed three year track records largely before you start to get traction. We have hit that three year mark and I think in hindsight I think that's going to look like it was a wise thing to do at the time. Bill Katz : Okay. Thank you for taking all my questions today. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Your line now is open. Alex Blostein : Hi guys. Good morning. A couple of questions. So just going back to the DOL conversation, So I understand that it doesn't sound like a lot of people are pausing with implementation, but thinking through the potential reversal of the rule, who knows whether or not it actually happens, but playing that out through the P&L for you guys, are any of the revenue challenges that you highlighted on the other revenue line, I guess due to potentially some DOL changes, could they potentially reverse? Or do you think this is more of a permanent phenomenon? Marty Flanagan : Look, I think it's a mistake not to think it's a permanent phenomenon, right. Our distribution partners prefer the advice model and the DOL was already moving that way. The DOL was the impetus to advance it. So in some ways, I think I don't believe the fiduciary rule is going away. I think there could ultimately be some modifications and the SEC syncing up a synched definition of the fiduciary rule which would be a healthy thing in some elements of the rule that could be better dealt with could get addressed during that process. So that's our view. Alex Blostein : Got it. And then around some of the expense guidance, particularly I wanted to touch on the higher cost of data. So Loren, you mentioned that you guys are expected to spend a little bit more there in 2017. Can you give a little more color, I guess, like what are the focus of your spending there on? Is it more reactive, meaning that data providers are just charging more? Or is it proactive where you are just finding actually more value and more expanded data services? And how you are incorporating that in your product offering? Loren Starr : Yes. So maybe I was not very clear it in my term data. So it has more to do with actually the systems and our overall management of data through the firm in terms of our investment book of records having one system as opposed to multiple bespoke systems. So it has really been a redo, a revamp of how we manage data through the firm really giving us even more effective efficient with our information, less manual processing, more straight through processing. That's been a major investment. It's not really the cost of data which, of course, does go up every year. That's not what we are talking about here, per se. Alex Blostein : Got it. All right. So it feels like more temporary. And then a last one for me on the hedge. Can you remind us again I guess when the hedge expires and how we should think about that going forward? I understand you guys have a hedged for still a couple quarters but what happens after? Loren Starr : Yes. So right now the hedges are in place through the end of 2017 and so if we were to do nothing there would be no further hedging after that. So as I mentioned earlier, we are going to continue to look at opportunistically whether it makes sense for us to extend those hedges, either both in the Pound and Euro or maybe just the Pound and that will be based on our risk assessment of Brexit and obviously the cost of the hedges as an insurance policy. Alex Blostein : Got it. Great. Thanks very much for taking the questions. Loren Starr : No problem. Operator : The next question is from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Your line now is open. Brian Bedell : Hi. Good morning folks. Loren Starr : Hi Brian. Brian Bedell : Marty, maybe if you just come back to the active passive comment, I appreciate your comments around that momentum into January. Maybe can you just talk about how that's changed say, pre the Trump administration, as you think about how advisors have been thinking about potentially changing portfolio allocations to comply with DOL earlier in the fourth quarter? Has that changed significantly since the Trump win and into this year? And then also your comments on the alternative side that's been more brewing longer-term, I believe. Where are you seeing that really perk up much more recently? Marty Flanagan : Yes. So again, it's hard to decipher exactly what the impetus was. I would say this, the advisors looking more to build broad portfolio allocations for their clients has been something underway for a number of years. I think DOL moved it ahead. And then this rally, if you want to say from election day on, has by the combination of all of those three have really put a focus on, I want to use active and passive, I want to understand how to use factor within that with active, I also want to understand how to build alternatives into this asset allocation. So it's all those things coming together. And there's always been a belief too and it was Ken's question earlier, I think it was Ken, that over the long-term active, even U.S. active equities is a value add for multiple reasons, risk adjust return, downside protection, et cetera, et cetera. So it's hard to point to one thing as the impetus to this but there is a very, very focused effort on using the broad range of answers to build these asset allocation capabilities for the advisor community. Brian Bedell : Great. And then maybe Loren, if you could parse out the flows for January a little bit more, if it's possible into, I assume it excludes QQQs, but just between active equities and fixed income and alternatives and ETFs? And then on the GTR, I think that's $19 billion in assets, if I am right. Can you talk about your view on the U.S. distribution of that? I know that's been an area that's been building. Loren Starr : Sure. So I mean within the number, the $1.6 billion, we have got some puts and takes as you imagine. The passive PowerShares, I mean you have got that number yourself, if you go to the website but we are seeing more than $1 billion on the traditional in terms of inflows, long-term inflows. So that continues to be a high growth area for one that we don't expect to slow down at all. In terms of what is in demand, it has been largely around fixed income and alternatives is where we are seeing most of the interest, as I mentioned, on the active side. We are seeing multi-asset being about $0.5 billion positive in the number. And Asia continues to see growth but largely around fixed income, both bank loans and core fixed income offerings. So around real estate as well that continues to be an area where we see flows coming in. So hopefully that gives you some good enough color in terms of what's driving the flow picture. Brian Bedell : And then just I guess on the active equities, are they still outflowing at a similar pace as December in the fourth quarter? Loren Starr : Yes. There has not yet been a sea change at on the flow picture. It's pretty much business as usual unfortunately. Even though performance is strong, we still see outflow. The only other place, as I mentioned earlier, where we are seeing very strong inflow would be diversified dividend which is well in excess of $1 billion in the last quarter. Brian Bedell : And GTR for January, if you have got that? Loren Starr : And GTR for January was about more than $0.5 billion. Brian Bedell : Thanks so much. Loren Starr : No problem. Operator : Next question is from Robert Lee of KBW. Your line now is open. Robert Lee : Thanks and good morning everyone. Just curious, I know you have had over this past year some efficiency initiatives in place and you have talked about in the release about starting to see some impact. But as we look forward and given some continued maybe revenue headwinds, whether it's from FX or whatnot, do you think there's much more you can do on that front as we think ahead to like next year or the year after? Or do you feel like you have pretty much gone to the well? Loren Starr : Never have we gone to the well. So there's always opportunity. We can only do so much at one time. So obviously we have got some sequencing has been a continued move to improve use of technology, reducing manual, the need for manual work, using our global centers more effectively, more efficiently. I think themes like digitization and robotics are huge opportunities for our industry in aggregate. And we are running after them quite heavily but it's still early days in terms of seeing the full benefits of those technologies finding root. So I think there will be an ongoing, there has to be an ongoing focus for driving efficiency through Invesco as well as the industry for us to maintain profitability. And I think it requires some investment to get there. So that's kind of the flip side. But we have been making those investments over the last several years and we feel we are very well-positioned to continue to drive our expenses as a percentage of our assets under management down as we have seen continuously over the last many years. Marty Flanagan : And, Rob, I would probably add to that. The other perspective is where we see ourselves positioned as a firm and where we see the future of the industry, we think we are aligned against very well. And so through these savings we have been reallocating, creating capacity to continue building up solutions, the global institutional business, the PowerShares business, those things that are absolutely making a difference. I think what the other side of it is, you could stop doing that. And I think it's the most dangerous time not to be investing to the demands in the marketplace. And I think those firms that have stopped investing, they are going to find themselves competitively at a material disadvantage. And the good news is we have been after this for a good number of years and we are really seeing the impact along the way. Robert Lee : Thanks. And maybe a follow-up question. One of the I guess theoretical impacts as firms look to prepare for the DOL rule, whether it happens or not, as you said, it's happening, is that it would continue to kind of spur demand for SMA accounts versus funds. So I am just curious if you are actually, I mean obviously it's been a trend for a while but if you are seeing a change in that dynamic and if you think of your own flows how you would characterize funds versus SMAs? And maybe just also update us on your thoughts about how you are positioned in that part of the retail market. Marty Flanagan : Yes. So we have the SMA capability. There's many firms. And, again, it is an area that will continue to be a focus with our distribution partners for various different types of investment capabilities that they are trying to make available to their clients. So I would say it's a continuation of what's been there in the past, quite frankly. Robert Lee : Okay. And then maybe just one last question, if I could, on capital management. Two accelerated share repurchases this year. As we look to the coming year, how much of that should we think maybe pulled forward share repurchase that maybe next year would be, I don't know, lower than average or something? But how should we think about your appetite for share repurchase in 2017 given what you did this year? Loren Starr : So a great question. We are obviously operating with our normal capital priorities that have been in place for years. First call on the capital would be seeding products. Next would be dividend growth, modest single-digit growth followed by stock buybacks. And so that's the process were in place. We want to maintain roughly $1 billion of cash in excess of what's required from a regulatory capital perspective and we are sort of largely there, plus or minus a couple hundred million. So our focus this year or last year was certainly being opportunistic on the buybacks because we saw what we thought was an over reaction obviously to the whole Brexit news and certainly the DOL impact on our franchise we thought was overblown. So we are going to continue to operate with those types of triggers in mind, opportunistically going in perhaps at a higher level because we have the financial flexibility to do so. But I would say our preference, obviously, is to be back into a more normal approach around our capital management. And we do have some pretty, I would say, sizable seed capital needs coming into next year as we continue to see our client demand for alternatives grow. We need to seed some of those capabilities or co-invest along some of those capabilities and so that will be probably, again as I said, our first call on capital. Robert Lee : Great. Thanks for the color. Thank you. Loren Starr : No problem. Thanks, Rob. Operator : Next question is from Chris Shutler of William Blair. Your line now is open. Chris Shutler : Hi guys. Good morning. It looked like the passive yield was up quarter-over-quarter for, I think, the third consecutive quarter. Maybe just talk about the drivers there and what you are expecting? Loren Starr : I think that was largely because of things like IVR leverage which was a big outflow and had zero fee impact. So it's more noise than anything else. There's nothing really going on, I think per se, in the mix. Although I would say the one thing is, there's been a pretty significant drive-up in the use of bank loan ETFs. And bank loan ETFs are at a much higher fee than the overall average, I think sort of up in the 60, 70 basis point level. Chris Shutler : Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess on the 0.5 basis point of help that you are expecting in the fee rate in 2017 just from mix. I just want to be clear, so that's based on existing mix in AUM? Or does that include your assumption where flows are going to shake out? And given the outflows you have been seeing in equities, are you expecting that to continue and just be offset by alternatives? Just trying to understand what's in your expectations. Loren Starr : Yes. So that's actually based on a very detailed bottom-up, built-up forecast, region-by-region, product-by-product, institutional retail, equity fixed income alternatives across the globe and so it represents our expectation. It reflects our pipeline of won but not yet funded products which, Marty had mentioned, has a much higher fee rate than the firm's overall average. It reflects obviously the increased client demand we are seeing around alternatives and I think we are also seeing obviously growth in places like EMEA and Asia-Pac where they tend to have a higher fee rate. So that's what's driving the overall fee rate improvement. Chris Shutler : Okay. And then can I just ask one more real quick one. In the other revenue that you guys talked about, what's driving that change in the real estate contract structure to be more performance fee versus transaction fee? Thanks. Loren Starr : Yes. So I think clients are just more interested in seeing this back-end loaded type of fee as opposed to the transaction fee. And so we are just responding to the client trends that are in place where I think the clients would rather not be paying transaction fees. Chris Shutler : Okay. Thank you. Loren Starr : Yes. Operator : Next question is from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Your line now is open. Chris Harris : Thank you. How do you guys think your platform is positioned for a sustained period of higher U.S. interest rates? And part of the reason I ask is, there is a perception in some circles that you guys have a lot of dividend income producing products that would really be negatively impacted by that? Marty Flanagan : If you look at, I think you are quite focused on that diversified dividend fund which has been so successful. But if you look at the value suite, there's three elements to it. That has been an area where there's been a lot of focus. There's a deep value capability which is performing very, very well, somewhere between diversified dividend and deep value that's also performing very, very well. So we are positioned, I think, extremely well as you look forward. Chris Harris : Okay. Very good. And then you guys have a much lower tax rate than many peers and you guys do have a distinctive corporate structure. Any thoughts on how tax reform in the U.S. will flow through to you guys? I assume there would be some benefit but maybe you could help walk us through the puts and takes there? Loren Starr : Yes. Well, we don't know fully, obviously, what's really happening but what we would benefit from would be the lower tax rate in the U.S. on our U.S. business, which is clearly the largest part of our operating income right now. So that would be a direct benefit to us. There would be no, per se, benefit to us relative to the business outside the U.S. since we are currently living in a territorial tax regime based on our domicile. So I think it would be limited in terms of what it offers us perhaps relative to other pure U.S. based firms. And as we have mentioned, we are free to bring back dividends without any tax consequences and we do so. And if there was some tax repatriation element, that would not provide any sort of immediate new opportunity for us. We do it all the time. Chris Harris : Got you. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Your line now is open. Michael Cyprys : Hi. Good mourning. Thanks for taking the question. Just curious if we could turn to M&A for a moment. Just wondering how your thinking on M&A is evolving just given the tough operating environment. To what extent would it make sense for Invesco to drive a bit more scale efficiencies in the business maybe with some M&A bolt-ons and even large-scale M&A here? Marty Flanagan : Yes. Again as we have discussed this in the past, it is a reality now that scale does matter more than it really ever has historically in the asset management business. The good news is we have some good scale. That said, if you could find asset management complementary to what we are to improve capabilities, that has always been our primary focus and get scale at the same time, that would be ideal. So again, we just continue to be open minded to those opportunities. I would say there's nothing blatantly obvious at the moment as we continue to look at the marketplace. Michael Cyprys : Okay. And maybe if we could just turn to your Asia business for a moment, seeing a lot of success there. It looks like the AUM in your Asia-Pacific is up about 26%, year-on-year or so if my numbers are right. So can you just talk about how you are thinking about building out your business in Asia? What inning do you think you are in terms of the build-out? And what's left on your to-do list in terms of, is it more product focused or distribution? And how do you see the business in five years from now? Marty Flanagan : Yes. Look, it's a very important part of our business. It is really, as you say, now generating an important contribution to the firm. And the focus really right now is on distribution excellence. We feel we have the capabilities in place, very, very strong management team leadership and we would imagine that it will continue to be a more important part of the business in five years from now. And I will stand at that. Loren Starr : And in terms of products, we have seen already great take on of products like real estate and fixed income. I think we are seeing growing product take on multi-manage and multi-asset allocation products. So that's a newer theme that is coming in and generally just around the alternatives overall is something where we see more and more opportunity for us in the region. Marty Flanagan : And I would just add, we really strongly believe we are uniquely positioned in China, both at a retail level and institutional level and we think that the future is very, very positive there for us. Michael Cyprys : Okay. If I could just ask one last one there just on Asia. Any sense in terms of the breakdown in terms of countries that are larger or smaller than others in terms of contribution to AUM there? And any particular ones where you see more outsized growth? Loren Starr : I mean I think our biggest contributor would be China generally, probably followed by Japan would be next and then you get into much smaller, Taiwan and Australia. So those would be the two big ones. Michael Cyprys : Super. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Patrick Davitt of Autonomous. Your line now is open. Patrick Davitt : Hi. Good morning. Thanks. I just have a quick one on the bank loan trend. And from the data we can see, it looks like retail is taking a lot of flow share and on the other end of the spectrum it looks like we have seen some institutional outflows from kind of traditional separate account vehicles broadly. Are you seeing it become or the ETF structure become more popular with institutions in that asset class in the Trump rally inflows there? Loren Starr : Yes. I mean I don't know if we have seen the institutional outflow that you are talking about. We have seen actually strong take on and again this comment though is on a global basis. So globally there's just no question that bank loan, separate accounts, definitely in growth mode. In terms of our U.S. presence, I think it's still been pretty positive but ETFs have been clearly taken on at a much higher pace in the U.S. than any other region. So maybe de facto, your comment is correct because we are seeing that BKLN grow quite a bit. Patrick Davitt : Is that flow institutional or retail? Loren Starr : It's a little bit of both, I would say. Our presence has historically been more retail than institutional. And so I would say it would most likely be mostly retail just because of our install base. But we know that there is some institutional buyers of that product as well. Patrick Davitt : Okay. Thank you. Loren Starr : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our last question at this time is from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Your line now is open. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks for taking my follow-up. Just one quick one. Loren, on the third-party distribution expense, that's been moving down a little bit more than the assets and the advisory fees. So that sounds like it's been helping results relative to some other areas. So just if you can give us some color on the trajectory of that line in 2017? And what some of the big factors in moving that are? Loren Starr : Yes. I think there was a little bit of movement down this quarter that had more to do, as I mentioned, sort of around contract adjustments at year-end, which tends to happen, true-ups and things of that nature around some of the distribution arrangements and new ones coming in, getting signed. So the trajectory is pretty stable. I don't think there's a major change in terms of that number relative to our net revenue yield in aggregate. So it is one where from the U.K. obviously the RDR impacts are fully through. And so we have seen the pay way sort of go away on that part. But in the U.S., which may be more the point that you are getting to, there's nothing material changing on that line item. Brian Bedell : Okay. And is it the base, the $351 million base, would that be actually higher ex the contract adjustments then? Loren Starr : Yes. That's right. Brian Bedell : Do you have a magnitude of that? Loren Starr : I am sorry. Brian Bedell : That's okay. That's all right. No, thanks so much. Loren Starr : Okay. Marty Flanagan : Well, thank you very much for joining us and I am sure we will be talking to people soon. So have a good rest of the day. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Welcome to Invesco's First Quarter Results Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now, I would like to turn the call over to your speakers for today, Marty Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; and Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin. Martin Flanagan : Thank you very much, and thank you for joining us today on the call. Just to point that out, that's Loren Starr, Invesco's CFO. And we'll be going through the first quarter results, and if you're so inclined, you can follow along to the presentation which is on our website. As is our practice, I will do a review of the business for the first quarter. Loren will go into greater detail of the financials. But also today, with us is Andrew Schlossberg who leads our EMEA business; and Dan Draper who leads our PowerShares ETF business, and they will help provide an overview of our efforts to further enhance our client offerings. And then of course, we'll get into Q&A. So let me begin with the first quarter. So if you happen to be following along, I'm on slide four of the debt. So let me highlight the first quarter results. Long-term investment performance remained strong, ending the quarter at 69% and 83% of assets ahead of peers on a three and five year basis. Our strong investment performance and our focus on providing outcome-oriented solutions to clients contributed to the strong long-term net inflows of $1.8 billion and an organic growth rate of 1% for the quarter. Adjusted operating margins for the quarter was 37.7%, and we returned $150 million to shareholders during the quarter through dividends. Based on strong fundamentals of our business, we're increasing our dividends to $0.29 per share. This represents a 3.6 increase over the prior period. Assets under management were $834 billion at the end of the quarter, up from $812 billion at the end of 2016. Adjusted operating income was $327 million for the quarter versus nearly $336 million in the prior quarter. Adjusted EPS for first quarter was $0.61, up from $0.59 in the prior quarter. We did not purchase any stock during the quarter instead using the available cash for the transaction \u2013 transactional discuss in just a few minutes. And before Loren get into the details of the financials, let me take a minute to review the investment performance and flows. I'm on page seven now. We continue to strengthen our investment platform to provide global expertise and support minimizing distractions for our investment professionals so they can focus on delivering investment outcomes to clients. Our strong investment performance during the quarter reflects these efforts with 69% of assets in the top half of peers in -- on a three-year basis, and 83% in the top half on a five-year basis. You'll see on page eight, passive flows are strong during the quarter while redemptions offset strong growth sales in active assets during the quarter. Flows into passive capabilities were driven by strong demand for PowerShares ETF with net inflows of more than $2.5 billion globally for the quarter. Although long-term flows were slightly negative on the active side, we saw strong demand for alternative capabilities, including senior loan products with more than $3 billion in net flows and GTR with nearly $2 billion in net flows during the quarter. Retail flows were solid during the quarter, reflecting continuous strength in PowerShares and GTR. Our pipeline of one, but not funded institutional opportunities remain strong, but the timing of those are spread out over the next several months. We saw solid demand for GTR in our senior loan products during the first quarter, continuation of recent trends. So with that as a backdrop, let me turn to Loren to review the financials. Loren Starr : Thanks very much, Marty. Quarter-over-quarter, our total AUM increased $21.9 billion or 2.7%. This is driven by market gains of $23.1 billion. We saw a positive foreign exchange translation of $4.1 billion. Our long-term net inflows came in at $1.8 billion and we also saw inflows from QQQs of $1 billion and these factors were somewhat offset by outflows from the money market \u2013 institutional money market product of $8.1 billion. Our average AUM for the first quarter was $829.8 billion, that's up 2.6% versus the fourth quarter. Our annualized long-term organic growth rate in Q1 was 1% compared to negative 1.5% that we saw in the fourth quarter. Our net revenue yield came in at 41.8 basis points and our net revenue yield excluding performance fees was at 40.9 basis points, which was in line with the guidance we provided on last quarter's earning call. Two fewer days in the period reduced the yield by 0.8 basis points. We also saw a decrease in other revenues, which accounted for the remaining 0.1 basis points. On slide 12, we provide the full U.S. GAAP operating results for the quarter. My comments today, however, will focus exclusively on the variances related to our non-GAAP adjusted measures, which will be found on slide 13. So let's go to 13. You saw, in 13, net revenues increased by $3.3 million or 0.3% quarter-over-quarter to $867.1 million which included a modest negative FX rate impact of $0.3 million. Within the net revenue number, you'll see that adjusted investment management fees increased by $8.5 million or 0.9% to $973.6 million. This reflects our higher average AUM during the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, partially offset by the impact as we've discussed in the past of fewer days in the first quarter. Adjusted service and distribution revenues decreased by $2.7 million or 1.3%, again reflecting higher average AUM offset by lower service revenue and fewer days in the quarter. FX increased adjusted service and distribution revenues by $0.1 million. Our adjusted performance fees came in at $17.7 million in Q1 and were earned from a variety of investment capabilities, including $12 million from bank loan products, $3.3 million from real estate and $1.2 million from our U.K. investment trusts. Adjusted other revenues in the first quarter were $20.8 million, a decrease of $2.4 million from the prior quarter. This is generally due to $2.6 million less in transaction fees from real estate which was offset by a $1.6 million increase in unit investment trust revenues. Largely driven by higher-than-anticipated UIT revenues, this line item came in above our stated guidance, if you remember, of $12 million to $15 million per quarter in 2017. Next in Q1, our third-party distribution service and advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues, decreased $5.1 million. Moving on down the slide, you'll see that our adjusted operating expenses at $540 million increased by $12.2 million or 2.3% relative to Q4. These amounts were generally in line with the guidance that we provided on last quarter's call. Foreign exchange reduced adjusted operating expenses by $0.6 million during the quarter. Adjusted employee compensation came in at $361.2 million, an increase of $23.3 million or 6.9%. This was generated by a normal seasonal increase in payroll taxes as well as retirement costs and one month impact of higher base salaries. Our adjusted marketing expenses in Q1 decreased by $10.4 million or 29.4% to $25 million, reflecting seasonal reduction in client events and other marketing activities. Our adjusted property office and technology expenses were $85.6 million in the quarter, an increase of $0.6 million or 0.7% over the fourth quarter due to higher outsourced administration costs. And then our adjusted G&A expenses at $68.2 million, decreased by $1.3 million or 1.9%. The G& A decrease were driven by lower professional services expense. Continuing on down the slide, you'll see that our adjusted net operating income increased $18.5 million compared to the fourth quarter. This increase was primarily due to earnings from our real estate partnerships and lower mark-to-market gains on our seed money investments. The first quarter included a $7.8 million gain realized on our pound sterling U.S. dollar hedge, which was similar to what we saw actually in Q4 as well. Moving to taxes. The firm's effective tax rate on pretax adjusted net income in Q1 was 26.6%. The first quarter tax rate included a 0.4% rate decrease related to our excess tax benefits on share-based compensation related to divesting of our annual share awards which then brings us to our adjusted EPS of $0.51, and our adjusted net operating margin of 37.7%. So before turning things over to Marty, I just want to mention a few additional items. The first is related to our pound hedge. Given the recent run-up in the pound, we took the opportunity to extend our pound hedges through the end of 2018. As a reminder, these hedges are in the form of put-option contracts designed to hedge approximately 75% of our pound-based quarterly operating income out of U.K. and are all set at the same strike level of 1.25% -- I'm sorry, $1.25. Additionally, I'd like to provide an update on our business optimization work that began in late 2015. Given the size of the opportunities, including potentially the outsourcing of back-office functions, we expect the optimization work to continue past the original targeted completion date and to incur \u2013 we will incur additional cost of approximately $38 million through mid-2018. However, in terms of reporting and consistent with our past practice, an approach with dealing with material and one-off expenses, that $38 million related to the incremental optimization charges will be adjusted out of our non-GAAP presentation and are all detailed and tracked of course, in each quarter in our U.S. GAAP reconciliation within the earnings release. At the end of the first quarter, we have recognized approximately $28 million in run rate savings due to optimization with the additional work being performed as we speak that we expect to exceed our high-end of the initial targeted savings range, which we describe as $30 million to $45 million. We expect to come in with a run rate savings of approximately $50 million once these efforts are fully implemented. And we believe this additional optimization work will help make Invesco an even stronger company, further increasing our effectiveness and efficiency of our operating platform but informally will allow us to continue to fund our most crucial strategic initiatives. Next I'd like to just quickly turn to MiFID II. So on the regulatory front, one of the questions that frequently comes up is Invesco's planned approach on the implementation of MiFID II slated for early 2018. As you may know, we're a very strong believer that research is a key contributor to our investment process and results. Our preferred approach, with respect to MiFID II, will be to use commission sharing accounts, or CSAs, to fund the research payment accounts contemplated by MiFID II to the extent permissible under the final rules. Note that there are still a number of legal and regulatory inconsistencies, which regulators must address, together with potential competitive developments which create uncertainties to \u2013 regarding the degree to which our preferred approach may be fully implemented. And while it's possible that we will be required or possibly choose to purchase certain research on a hard dollar basis, we are monitoring developments in this area closely. And ultimately, we expect to be able to clarify our approach in any financial impact to our business as we get closer to implementation date and as the current regulatory uncertainties are resolved. Buybacks. For the last time, I want to provide an update on \u2013 it was around our capital allocation policy and specifically buybacks. We do not purchase \u2013 repurchased any shares in Q1 given the seasonal cash needs in the first quarter along with the upcoming need to seed new products and obviously given the recently announced acquisition of Source, we elected not to repurchase shares in the quarter. I would like to point out though that this should not be viewed as a change of our capital priority, and we will continue to maintain opportunistic \u2013 remain opportunistic around our timing and the extent of \u2013 to the extent of repurchasing shares. This also has no impact on any other capital priorities of the investment, dividend growth or the strength of our balance sheet. And with that litany of things, I'm going to turn it over to Marty. Martin Flanagan : Okay, thanks, Loren. So we want to get back to the announcement that we made today about the combination with Source. And as we've discussed before, here we are intensely focused on helping clients achieve their investment objectives and it's really through our comprehensive range of active passive and alternative investment capabilities that's been constructed over many years to help institutional and retail clients achieve their investment objectives. We believe our ability to provide meaningful solutions to clients for a broad array of capabilities and vehicle is inherent strength of the firm and sets us apart the marketplace. And with that as a backdrop, I'm going to hand the call over to Andrew, who will speak to the EMEA business, and then Dan, who will highlight the strengths of our investment. Andrew? Andrew Schlossberg : Thank you, Marty. This is Andrew Schlossberg and I lead our business here in EMEA. And I'll pickup on page 16 of the materials that were distributed. As many of you know, we have a strong and highly regarded position across the markets here in EMEA. We built that platform through our investment reputation here over many, many years, maintaining a strong and consistent investment culture that's been built by the depth and tenure of our investment teams here, clear philosophies and consistent processes. And all of these has enabled us to deliver top-tier returns for our clients with 88% of our client AUM in the region performing in the top half of peers over the past five years. As a result, we've developed a diverse all-weather products range that is well positioned to meet client needs across asset classes and markets, and our brand, as such, is highly rated in the region and our market penetration has expanded over time. We're currently number two in the U. K. retail market, and we're growing in Continental Europe, where we've been \u2013 where we're ranked in the top 10 within 8 of the markets on the continent. We continue to see growth despite \u2013 in the region despite the volatility of Brexit and other macro headwinds. Notably, our net flows in the region here in EMEA have actually \u2013 were actually up $2.1 billion in positive net flows since last June 23, 2016, in the U.K., when the Brexit referendum was announced, so growing at a decent clip. Furthermore, the diversity and the strength in our business has allowed us to achieve March ending AUM this year as measured in British pound that's set a high watermark for us in the EMEA region as a whole and in each of our respective client channels across institutional U.K. retail and across other retail businesses, respectively. I call your attention to page 17 in the presentation deck. And core to our long-term strategy is really being focused on markets and channels where we believe we can be highly relevant while maintaining a close proximity to our clients and innovating with the broad range of capabilities that will meet their demand. And over the past five years, we've been able to maintain our quality while growing, as I just referenced to high watermarks, and diversifying our business as you can see on this chart here. Notably, you can see on the left-hand side of the chart that we have maintained leadership in the U.K. which has been a dominant position for us, while also expanding our AUM in EMEA ex with the U.K. from 45% five years ago to 60% of our regional client and AUM today. Furthermore, as you'll see in the middle part of the chart, we are more evenly balanced between fixed income and equities, and we've rapidly grown our multi-asset and alternative capabilities in the region which now represent nearly one-third of our assets under management for clients in the region. Finally, you'll see on the right-hand chart that from a client channel perspective, we've increased our relevance in the institutional markets and we've broadened our retail strength beyond just the U.K. to even more robust pan-European retail profile over the last five years. And while \u2013 I'll say while we're pleased with the strong foundation that we've built, we believe there's exceptional growth potential in the region for asset managers that are focused on being truly active and factor strategies asset managers that provide exceptional in-market client service and maintain scalable platforms to manage through dynamic markets, no doubt, in this part of the world. So with that, let me hand it over to Dan Draper, who will expand a bit more on our factor and ETF profile in particular. Dan Draper : Thank you, Andrew. I'm Dan Draper, and I head up the PowerShare ETF Business. Based on more than 40 years of experience, Invesco is a market leader in factor investing and then as you'll see on slide 18, we have more than $175 billion in assets under management in terms of factors. We're the fourth largest ETF provider globally, and have significant market positions in quantitative strategy and unitrust businesses. Our expertise, product breadth and global profile provide a number of key competitive advantages. First, we're diverse. Time-tested and have across in our investment strategies. Number two is we have experienced product specialists and tremendous field wholesaler depth and three, strong global profile with key strengths in key markets. If you move over to slide 19, I really want to use this chart to compare kind of growth and give you some idea of the EMEA ETF growth market compared to the U.S. And as you'll see, the EMEA ETF market is one of the fastest growing areas in asset management today. And as you'll see again on this slide, basically the growth trajectory in EMEA ETF as you see on the left chart and then we overlay that with the historical growth in the U.S. on the chart on the right hand on slide 19, you can really see a very common pattern. There may be an approximate seven-year lag in that chart on the right but you can really see the growth that has been experienced. So it's overall, ETFs in EMEA have grown at a 23% compounded annual growth rate since 2005. And as Morningstar states here, it's projected to reach $1 trillion by the end of the decade. I think with that, I'll turn it back to you, Marty. Martin Flanagan : Thanks, Dan, thanks, Andrew. And so now let's talk about Source within the context that Andrew and Dan went through and we'll open up to Q&A. So you saw the announcement this morning. We did sign a definitive agreement via Source, a leading independent ETF specialist focused in EMEA. We're very excited about the opportunity which we believe will meaningfully enhance our ability to meet client needs across the globe and specifically in EMEA. Source brings to Invesco additional expertise across the entire ETF chain, strong talent in London and on the continent, and I guess specifically the transaction $18 billion of Source-managed, assets under management plus $7 billion in externally managed funds. The combination of Source and Invesco significantly benefits clients by further expanding the depth and breadth of our factor-based strategies and ETFs, adding to the comprehensive range of investment of active passive and alternative capabilities Invesco offers in EMEA and across the globe, enhancing Invesco's expertise and ability to meet needs of institutional and retail clients in EMEA with the addition of dedicated underground ETF specialist spanning sales, marketing, capital markets, product management and development. Strength in Invesco's position in EMEA, while achieving additional scale and relevance in a growing ETF market globally that Dan just addressed. And as you can imagine, our focus over the past several weeks is really just been getting to signing the definitive agreement. Our focus today and over the next few days will be engaging with clients of both firms, speaking with all of you, reaching out to regulators, index providers and others to bring them up to speed of our plans. We'll then turn our attention to the integration of the two firms, building on Invesco's significant expertise in bringing companies together for the benefit of clients, employees and shareholders. And as I mentioned, we're all very excited about this opportunity. We think it's going to meaningfully enhance our ability to help clients across the globe and meet their investment objectives. And with that as a backdrop, I want to open it up to questions. And again, so is myself, Loren, Andrew and Dan will all be available. Operator, can you open? Operator : Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Carrier of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Michael Carrier : Thanks guys. You\u2019ll meet me Marty. Just first on the Source transaction, a lot of things that you said makes sense in terms of the product distribution. Just wanted to get a sense, when you think about Invesco's positioning in factor in smart beta, it seems like you're already one of the leaders to why maybe couldn't you do what you're thinking of the opportunity is with Source without it? Meaning is it \u2013 the products are really differentiated, is it more the distribution within Europe on that they have a better penetration and to that where you can increase your kind of foothold in that new geography? I just wanted to get a sense because it seems like you already have a pretty good new traction there. Martin Flanagan : Yes. So I agree with the points. I think one of the strengths that is becoming more evident is we have a 40-year track record in factor-based investing, and PowerShares is now over 11 years has been a meaningful contributor to us. As Dan pointed out, and Andrew, I mean, the ETF business actually in \u2013 on the continent is quite different. And we've been making efforts over the last number of years; more recently, turned our attention there. It's just a very different market and what Source does is it rapidly advances our presence there from where we were with scale, lots of talents. I think it would take us multiple years to get close to what Source offers on day one. And we think it has every elements of the great success that PowerShares brought to us over a decade ago. Michael Carrier : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then as a follow-up, Loren, just on, I guess, some of the line items that sometimes you provide a little bit of guidance on anything on the expenses, I guess, we get normal seasonality, and then maybe G&A and then the other just given maybe the dynamics in the UIT market in terms of the outlook versus what you guys were thinking last quarter, just any change there? Loren Starr : So I think you're going to see and you've seen it a little bit in the first quarter just normal flexing due to incentive compensation growing as operating income grows. You also saw, or you will see probably as we move into the second quarter impacts around foreign exchange, right? So those are the things that I'd say are going to happen just naturally and mechanically. In terms of the guidance right now, I think, we're sort of generally saying that what we put in place in the last quarter call stays right now. And maybe we'll be in a position to provide a more thorough and robust update midyear, particularly after the Source transaction is closer in terms of happening. So but I mean we're pretty much on our path to continue along the strategy that we've described in the past. And so there is no big change or need to adjust kinds at this point. I think around UIT business, where the only thing we got a little surprised on, on the upside was better revenues around UIT than we originally anticipated. I would like to \u2013 I'd like to believe although I don't at this point that that's a continuing trend right now. I think we're happy to see that, maybe we'll continue. It\u2019s still too early to say definitively that the UIT business is going to sort of pullout yet, the DOL rules are still very much in flux and now people are reacting to them are still in flux. But I would say that's probably a greater level of uncertainty around the revenue line item than we had in the past with some potential upside. Michael Carrier : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning. One of your competitors has been more vocal about steep rates and fee cutting in active management. So maybe how does Invesco see its positioning in terms of fees? And do you think Invesco's organic growth could be enhanced with some targeted fee reductions? And maybe is that something under consideration? Martin Flanagan : Yes. I'd say the headline that is active management is not easy, right? And I've made a comment that those that are strong active managers generating the returns that they're meant to will continue to do well. We are in an extended period of this beta run that we've all talked about. We still see great opportunity for active management, but let me get more specifically. I think from some of the fee cuts that you've seen, from the media in particular maybe the analyst community, very quick to extrapolate that price cuts is the answer to everything in the marketplace when I think when you actually look at it firm by firm, the price cuts announced by these firms have really been more substantial in nature relative to investment performance and the like and then in some just not being properly priced within the marketplace. And we believe the question is and always has been, our clients receiving value for money. And so we look at it, we have a spectrum from cap weighted indexes all the way through alternatives. And you pay more for value for money. And the only way that a client can ultimately generate excess returns, manage downside risk is with active. And so we think is really a combination of active passive and alternative is the right answer. I don't think the cut is slow. You have clients, and I think some and I think where you're going, Ken, some are future state of the industry where asset owners won't care about value for money. I just think that's false and it's the best way to generate returns for clients is a combination of active passive and alternatives. And I think within the context, value for many matters. If you're doing a good job, you're going to get paid for it. And that's not to ignore the industry pressures. And I think what I really focus on, Ken, is the enemy of active is not passive. The enemy of active is bad active managers. And so flushing out bad is probably a very good thing. And if you looked at our results over extended period of times, we've done a very good job generating value for money. Ken Worthington : Thank you. With Source, you're clearly focused on kind of focused M&A. As we think about the industry, maybe can you share your view on large scale M&A? We've seen a few examples of large-scale deals. They appear to be ripping out a lot of costs. I guess does large-scale consolidation make sense? And would you expect to see more of it over the next, I don't know, call it 12 to 24 months? And if we do see more \u2013 I'm sorry, and if we don't see more deals, what might be the leading issues holding back that sort of large scale M&A? Martin Flanagan : Yes. Look, Ken, you and I and many on the phone have talked about this. Since I've been in the industry, there has been declarations of massive consolidation. I do think though this time, there are a set of factors in place that weren't in place before where scale does matter, largely driven by the cost coming out of the regulatory environments and the low rate environments, cyber and the like. You have to be, as a firm, you have to be able to invest in the future. And I think a number of smaller-sized firms are finding that hard. They can \u2013 they're really just investing and keeping up with certain regulatory environments, cyber and the like, and you just lose your competitive positioning. So getting to your question, intellectually, you would suggest that large-scale combinations make sense. The reason why we've not seen lots of consolidation in the industry is because it's very difficult. We are fiduciaries and taking care of clients comes first. And clients have choices and done poorly, it becomes a melting ice cube. And so I think consolidation for solely to \u2013 for cost saves is not the answer to success. If two firms get together and they're poorly performing, not doing a good job for their clients taking costs up doesn't do anything; in fact, I think it could probably accelerate client departures. So all in all, I guess my point is, intellectually, it makes sense. They're very difficult to do. I think there'll be fewer and farther in between just because people are wise enough to know how difficult it is. And I come to one more point and then I'll stop. We've been in the management team here for decades has been involved in various combinations of some of scale and you have to have the expertise of properly pulling firms together. And I think the other thing to pay attention to if firms don't have a history of success; it's another warning sign as far as I'm concerned. Ken Worthington : Great. Thank you very much for all the color. Martin Flanagan : Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Patrick Davitt of Autonomous. Your line is now open. Patrick Davitt : Hey good morning. Thanks for taking my call. On Source, I have a couple of questions on source actually. Is there a lot of redundancy here? Or is there \u2013 is it \u2013 or do you feel like you really need the double platform in Europe? In other words, could we expect some expense synergies? And the second question is around the PIMCO-branded funds. To what extent do you have assurances those are locked up because I imagine they will beat you as more of a competitor? And do you think there's a risk that they want out of that, I guess, agreement post deal? Martin Flanagan : Yes. So let me make an overall comment then I can turn it to Andrew and Dan. And yes, we look at this as a tremendous opportunity. It feels like gap of expertise, on the comment for us, Dan pointed to the prospects of growth in the ETF market in EMEA, we believe that very, very strongly. We think the combination of the two firms together can rapidly expand from where we are today. I look at it a little bit analogous to PowerShares 11 years ago that you put the platforms together, and you can be very, very successful. So it's very much a \u2013 we look at it as a growth opportunity. And we think it's all the makings of PowerShares combination within EMEA. But with that as a backdrop, Andrew, do you want to pick up on it? Andrew Schlossberg : Yes, yes, sure, Marty. And just building up on what Marty was saying, it's clearly we're looking at this as a growth opportunity, not as a cost savings opportunity for us. And Marty mentioned some of the growth drivers behind this. Clearly the market is growing at a good rate and we think it's in the early stages of growth as Dan pointed out. We think there's opportunity to expand the distribution of Source and strategies through some of the market that I described and the positions that we have complementing what Source has. We see opportunity with the distributors server is that they want to do more business with firms that can bring a whole range of capabilities and frankly packaging vehicles as well which helps us with. And then the combination creates an even more scaled platform in the ETF space. And there are some efficiencies but more importantly, that whole ecosystem of how an ETF comes to market and how you scale, especially in a part of the market that we're in, where innovation matters, all those aspects are key and Source brings depth and talent there that will help us build what we've started here in Europe and complement certainly what we've done around the world. I think that as we look at \u2013 well, Dan, do you have anything you want to add to that? Dan Draper : No, I just think exactly what you described. What I would say it's crucial difference between Europe and U.S. again comparable growth rates. But the fact is that the institutional market demand really dominates in Europe versus the financial adviser and intermediate retail demand in the U.S. has really grown. So I think that's really where, if you will, the buy versus build or especially the inorganic approach to Europe, really something you have consider much more so as you're able to show up in the markets that Andrew mentioned at scale and have large enough products in front of institutional clients who can really buy into that. So I think that's a crucial difference. Martin Flanagan : And I think relating to the question about the partnerships that Source has, a big foundation of the ETF industry has been a series of partnerships. And PowerShares, as we built it over time, also has a number of partnerships that it works with across all parts of the ecosystem I described. And so we're just getting to know all Source partnerships a bit better and spending time with them and the team and we're going to look to develop and expand them on many different levels but it's kind of an early days in those conversations. Patrick Davitt : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question is coming from Glenn Schorr of Evercore. Your line is now open. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. Looking for a little more color on the institutional side, I think this was one of the lower gross sales and flows quarters for a while. I\u2019m curious if you're seeing trends like in-sourcing and going passive like we've seen in some other places? But also you mentioned the one but not yet funded pipeline is pretty good, and I don't know if you can throw numbers at that, but I'll appreciate it? Thank you. Loren Starr : Hey, Glen, it's Loren. Yes, the \u2013 I think of it as just sometimes as we've seen lumpiness in timing. Some of the elements within the quarter that I think kind of stood out on the downside, there was about $1 billion withdrawal with the commonwealth-related situation. So I don't think people understand that dynamic but that was kind of a one-off thing that hits EMEA and equities. We also saw about a $700 million Japanese passive real estate, a very low-fee outflow in the quarter. And then there was about $1.2 billion of quant outflow that cut across Asia-Pac and Continental Europe all in equities going active, so that's kind of a little bit of highlights on what just happened that took that quarter down. In terms of the pipeline though, I mean it's actually very robust. The revenue yield is definitely at a level we haven't seen in a long time. I mean, really, really high, highest that we've seen in the last five quarters for sure. And so the revenue run rate is right in line with what we saw last quarter. And so I think again, just in terms of timeliness, I'd say the second quarter is probably going to be much more robust than we saw in the first quarter just because of the way we report. Glenn Schorr : Okay. I just want to add, yes, so continues to be an area where I have just growing confidence in its contribution to the business in time for all the reasons we've talked about. So the leadership is in place, the breadth and capabilities that we have, so I just look at it as being really just a continued relatively rapidly more growing part of our business. And as we all know, we all wish things were neat and happened quarter-by-quarter, but it's just happened that way with institutions as you know. But the picture for the whole year looks very, very strong and we expect it to just and strengthening, and it will just get stronger next year too. Loren Starr : Qualified opportunities at an all-time high, which is again you can't bank those, but those are the ones where our team comes out and says the prospects seem quite viable and seasonal so. Glenn Schorr : Excellent! Maybe a follow-up is thankfully the exact opposite question on the retail side. You had 20%-ish growth sales growth over last year, then last year is we're a quarter, but still it's a good number here to high there as well. You mentioned GTR but I'm curious, A, what else drove the strength? And B, can it sustain itself? April seems like a good environment so far. Martin Flanagan : Yes, great question, Glenn. So we saw a variety of things kicking. Obviously, PowerShares generally continues to do very well so that's been a very strong contributor across a variety of asset classes variable rate prefer, we saw bank loans as well. We saw a lot of the strength in senior loans just generally I'd say the bank loan capability was in high demand as you can imagine in the quarter. But we continue to see strong interest in some of the products that are yield-oriented like diversified dividend. And GTR as well continue to flow very strongly. I think GTR, in total, is about $21 billion in size now. Again, both attractive as retail and institutional and continuing to find strength. Uni was another area where we saw high yield in Uni flow nicely. So those are some elements within the retail picture and one that I think has been good. I'd say on the flipside, just to explain, we did see some outflow in Inchinko that was the global, the U.S. REIT is about $1 billion out of Japan, actually $1.1 billion out. I think that's a temporary thing but that also sort of took a little bit away from the retail story. UITs, even though stronger, without $800 million again, so it has been an outflow and continues to be a little bit of a negative on the retail picture. The other thing that I would like to just mention since everyone expects it if I don't say it, it's a problem, is we are in positive flow through April. We have the latest April numbers. It's modest again it's certainly around $200 million in that range, a lot of which is driven a lot by PowerShares. PowerShares has been extremely strong through April. I think it's about $1.1 billion in aggregate, and that continues to flow, but also importantly, our cross-border business is doing very well in Europe, about $1 billion, and so some very strong elements within the second quarter shaping up. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Thanks very much Marty. Operator : Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. Loren, you mentioned a handful of reasons for the dry \u2013 or use of capital with regards to the seed and obviously to the acquisition. Can we think about I guess how should we characterize the buyback kind of you've been pretty consistent the last several quarters thinking about it going forward. Is this something we should be modeling or until the deal closes we should kind of see more of a pause? Loren Starr : I think the reality is I mean, it's probably a little bit of a pause I think we've talked about some substantial feeding, $200 million-ish net increase and then obviously this transaction which incidentally I know a question will come up, is substantially less than the number that's been discussed in the media in terms of the prices but there's obviously a real cash need to fund that. The good news is that it's all been drawn out of existing cash out of the European subgroup. So there's no need for us to draw down and finance that other than using existing capital in our European business that's already there. So I think the general message will be it is business as usual around our capital policy and our implementation of the capital policy other than sort of probably just first half of the year, and then we'll will take it off obviously and [ph] some more thoughts. The other thing I would say is we will continue to be opportunistic. But that doesn't mean we're not doing any buyback this quarter, forget about it, I mean, if we see opportunity, we'll absolutely be opportunistic as we always have been because we're not sort of living quarter-to-quarter, right, but some pause sort of restriction on use of cash. Dan Fannon : Great. And then I guess some follow-up on Source. Can you talk about the trajectory of growth in terms of flows? And then from an economic perspective, the difference in fee rates between, obviously, their managed AUM versus the externally managed AUM? And we might think about that from an economic perspective. Martin Flanagan : Loren, why don't you get the fee rates? And then Andrew and Dan, will you pick up on the growth opportunity? Loren Starr : Yes. For the fee rates, there's obviously a big difference between the Source-managed assets and the externally managed assets. So of the $18 billion which was Source-managed, that's roughly 30, 31 basis points in line roughly with kind of where PowerShares is. Again this is a very good fee. On the $7 billion externally managed, it's about six basis points that comes to Source, and so that averages about 24 basis points in aggregate across the $25 billion. And then in terms of the growth prospects, maybe Andrew or Dan can talk about it. Andrew Schlossberg : Yes, I mean I touched on them categorically before, but maybe just a few more specifics. I mean, the Source run rate growth has been good, it's been growing rapidly. We have a relatively small ETFs business here in PowerShares that also experienced its record growth last year in terms of net sales, so both have momentum. Our focus here, as I mentioned before, is to build on that momentum. The Source product line is 70-plus products, I think, and it's pretty well diverse across a number of asset classes. So part of the thing that appealed to us was it has some diversity across all sorts of unique access, smart beta, some active strategies and so we see it able to kind of weather through a variety of market conditions like PowerShares has over the last several years. A few things maybe where we see some opportunity immediately, in particular in the European markets, as I said where we have top position at Invesco, top 10 position in eight markets on the continent, good momentum and really sort of deep relationships with fund to funds and private banks through our increasingly larger users of ETFs and Source has done well there too. We view those as opportunities to accelerate together in the future. And you look at the U.K., where our adviser channel is quite strong across our business in the U.K. from an active and fundamental perspective, and we're going \u2013 we see factor strategies picking up in use of growth there, so we think there is opportunity there as well as the financial institutions in the U. K. So I don't know, Dan, if you have anything else you want to add? Dan Draper : I'll just add anecdotally that, I mean, you look year-to-date Source has contributed with our strong inflows, net inflows and they launched particularly commodity product at the beginning of the year and it's proven to be very popular. So we continue to see just ongoing growth in Source business. Dan Fannon : I guess just a follow-up, is there any numbers on the LTM or year-to-date just in terms of what the total flows are for Source? Dan Draper : I think we'll have to see what we can disclose at this stage and then we'll get back to you. Dan Fannon : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Bill Katz of Citi, your line is now open. Bill Katz : Okay. Thanks very much for taking the question. Just staying on Source for a moment, you mentioned in your press release that this was a deminimis to not material to earnings. I'm trying to counter that with franchise that seems to be growing and it's possibly for some synergies internally. So how should we think about the go-forward financial impact? And then I have a follow-up question. Dan Draper : Yeah, let me make a comment and turn it to Marty. Bill, we give Source a lot of credit for what they accomplished in eight years. They definitely -- they've created something very, very competitive in the market place, they did it very rapidly and so they were definitely in investment mode. And as I said, we couldn't have replicated anything like this in that period of time or short period of time. So we strongly believe that we are going to see contribution to the overall operating results in the not-too-distant future with the combination of source and Invesco. Loren, do you want to? Loren Starr : Yes, I mean, I think, we will probably be in a position to provide some guidance midyear, specifically around some of the elements, revenues and costs. I think it's obviously we need to develop a plan around the growth, but it is more of a revenue growth opportunity than a synergy discussion for sure. There's not an anticipation of that synergies being extracted because we really think that this is going to provide us with a platform to grow. So again, I think that that's why there's no immediate accretion expectations and it's really just how quickly can we grow the business which is obviously -- our expectation is to grow it rapidly. Martin Flanagan : And let me just add, I don't know how with -- Loren did make a comment I just want to back to it. So we did pay substantially less than what's being bantered about in the media and I think that's important. And we're not disclosing the details for competitive reasons which you don't know. That said, you will see the financial impact of balance sheet cash flows, et cetera, in the not-too-distant future after we close so. Loren Starr : Yeah, it will become a very apparent. Martin Flanagan : Yes. Bill Katz : Okay, great. And here's the follow-up just being within the U.K. just generally. Are you seeing a lot of pricing pressure, not to your point, some pricing pressure on the active and mutual fund business? We're seeing it in certain parts of alternatives and we've seen it obviously at the market can level of ETFs. Could you talk a little bit how you sort of see it playing out in the smart beta segment? It seems like you and many of your peers are incrementally focused on that space. Sort of wondering if there will be any reason to think that pricing will come down as competition picks up. Martin Flanagan : Yeah. Let me make a comment and then turn it over Dan and I do, Bill, I think that's a really good comment and I would just encourage everybody to really have to look at each instance specifically within the context of the firm and the action. I think the sweeping comments I think aren't necessarily helpful and again I just think any firm that is generating value for money, along that spectrum from cap weighted to alternatives, and they're competitively priced, they're going to continue to do fine. If you are outside of that band, you're going to be in trouble. And I don't think that it's always been the case, it might be more cute these days, but it's not going to change. But Dan, you want to pick up on that? Dan Draper : Yeah. Sure, Marty. I think just to differentiate from kind of the market cap for both beta space, and if you look where I think smart beta and factor products really found a strong place with fee-based advisers who are really focused on client outcomes and solutions. So I think that's what's interesting. If you take that kind of end solution which again a lot of regulators around the world are kind of pushing, that kind of fiduciary standard, then if you think about portfolio completion, it's really, as Marty said from the beginning, it's the kind of the products that add value in the outcome. So I think that along with the Invesco solutions business focusing on giving better asset allocation advice, that's where positioning smart beta products like low volatility or products that generate higher income or perhaps a better quality, this is really where I think the smart beta tilts, if you will, really start to have impact. And never say never but I think that's where once you look at the value add of those products compared to frankly just kind of a core market cap-weighted approach, that's really where you're getting either some combination of better returns or lower risks. And again, I think this is as the world moves to again this more kind of fee-based advisory type world, that's where the placement and use of those smart beta products really come into play. And I what I'd also just add at PowerShares specifically, we've been doing versions of smart beta factor investing before those terms were around for over 13 years. And so I think when you're bringing these kind of new one strategies rather than relying on back testing, you need to have the track record, the size, liquidity that investors are looking for when they're putting a solution together and just a reminder, over 70% of our U.S. smart beta range has more than a five-year history. Martin Flanagan : And let me, Dan is making a really good point and I think it's something to pay attention to. Dan's fond of saying barriers to entry are very low, that barriers are very high. And it's actually there are very few firms that have decades of experience in factor base investing, have the long track records, and people look at fees, but the liquidity of the products matter an awful lot. And so the incumbents are in a much stronger position to continue to be successful going forward. And again, I think that's a very important dynamic that maybe doesn't get enough attention in the space. Bill Katz : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Brennan Hawken of UBS your line is now open. Brennan Hawken : Thanks for taking the question. So I just wanted to follow-up on a question that Dan asked on the $7 billion piece that is sub-advised for Source. So do you \u2013 are there plans to adjust the arrangements with those external managers? Does Invesco have the capabilities to allow for those to be shifted to in-house management? Is that part of your plans? And when you move forward here? Martin Flanagan : Andrew, do you want to pick that up? Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah. And I think maybe in the release, we bifurcated the numbers just to give clarity. It's about US18 billion in managed AUM by the Source team and $7 billion in this \u2013 in the platform assets that are being referred to that are largely managed by PIMCO. And there's probably two things to keep in mind. One is the relationship between Source and PIMCO without getting into all the details, the revenue stream that's generated by Source in that relationship is relatively small. And Source plays a very distinct role around the product and PIMCO and other. And so those, as I said, the relationship and the discussion, we need to get into it more. And it's really our whole decision on the product line and the partnership is going to be guided by clients and by investors. And our focus is going to be on them in the first instance. And we'll work through the issues from there, but I did want to point out but it is a relatively small revenue source. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Appreciate that. Then on MiFID. Loren, you completely get that there's a great deal of uncertainty, regulatory and competitive. But is it possible maybe just to frame the issue? And appreciate that you guys want to use the RBAs as a solution, minimally disruptive, that makes a lot of sense? But if that turns out to be either competitively or from a regulatory perspective, not a viable outcome, what's the worst-case scenario impact for hard checks getting cut in payment for resource -- research rather to Invesco? Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah I don\u2019t think that that's a number at this point ready to sort of lay out because we don't think that's actually realistic in terms of happening. And it is something that's because it is just so dynamic, there's something that we would not expect to be that worst case is not even an outcome that we're focused on. I do think there are variety of outcomes within where we think is a likely outcome. And I'd say from completely not material to something that's a little bit more material, but we're not talking about $100 million we're talking about $10 million. And so right now, based on where we're seeing this landing, it's hopefully going to be in that latter part. And it is something where it's perfectly manageable within our current business as usual operating plan and budget. So that's kind of the message that we'd like to leave you with as opposed to a number that is we think is probably not the most [Indescribable]? Brennan Hawken : Sure. Great deal of uncertainty thanks for the additional color. Operator : Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Alex Blostein : Thanks hey good morning everybody, a question to Loren just around the fee rate dynamic. I guess at a high level, obviously, the active bucket as a whole, so a little bit of a challenging quarter this quarter again. But I guess taking a step back, it really does feel like some of the higher fee products are growing significantly faster than maybe perhaps some of the stuff that's out flowing even within the active equity bucket. So can you help us dissect that a little bit more kind of how the evolution of a mix shift within the active bucket could look like taking into account a, what you're seeing from GTR and the loan product, but also the comments being around the institutional pipeline. Martin Flanagan : Yeah. I think it's really a function of the value for money we're able to create a lot of value for our client and that generally allows us to charge a somewhat higher fee, right? So in terms of the solutions and the alternatives, capabilities, I mean, those are the fastest-growing parts of our business. I'd say geographically too, I'm very pleased to see cross-border product being picked up, Europe just generally feels much healthier and that's a very important part of our business and one that tends to have a higher fee. Where we don't really focus on a lot of commoditized capabilities, ones that are in price war or we're having to cut fees and so we're not really having to deal with that dynamic within our mix. So I think, I mean, for those reasons and then we build it from the bottom up in terms of the sales forecast, the products that are really interesting to institutions and to retail are either in the alternative capability, bank loans, some real estate, GTR, these are things that are unique and differentiated, not everyone has those capabilities, and we are very good at managing those products. And then on the retail side, again, I think there's a lot of interest in bank loan and other products that provide uncorrelated returns like GTR, plus if we are able to provide some of our ETFs factor-based, I mean, these are again not commoditized ETFs, these are the ones that have tend to have higher fees and as I've discussed kind of have more than 30 basis point type of fee; those are very good margin dynamics as well. The other point I would just like to mention on fee rate, which is important for people to realize because they look at our numbers and they kind of sense that there's a lot of pressure on fee rate, there's been about a two basis point drop over the last two years excluding performance fees. I'd say 70% of that is just due to foreign exchange. And as we discussed, the 10% improvement in FX particularly say around the pound gives us about a 0.8 basis point lift and we're seeing the pound beginning to improve. So I'm not saying that the pound is going to \u2013 on their way up, but we are seeing some very favorable things within sort of foreign exchange is actually going to be net helpful for our fee rate going forward. And \u2013 so it's mix and it's hopefully nothing negative on FX and more positive on FX, those things should help us at least achieve the guidance that we talked about, where we\u2019re reviewing the fee rate, pickup through the last half of the year, not do better. Alex Blostein : Got it. Thanks for the color. And then the second question just around comments you made around potentially some upside to the kind of the $30 million to $40 million number in costs or cost savings from the program you outlined earlier. I guess, one of the things you highlighted was potential outsourcing, I was wondering if you could provide more color on kind of the middle back-office, what specifically around this part of business you're looking to outsource. And is that kind of included in the $50 million of potential total savings, or that would be on top of that? Martin Flanagan : Yeah. I think, I mean, it goes back to 2015 when we started this thing where we benchmark a lot of our internal capabilities, and we wanted to see where we're operating kind of the best of the best in terms of the metrics. We challenge ourselves across any, I mean, there are a lot of different areas of the firm that got involved in this process, and they still are involved. And in certain cases we saw an opportunity to do better by centralizing to a single location, going to single processes using technology more effectively. And so that \u2013 part of that optimization work we did in certain cases say there are others who can do it better. And so, for example, we outsourced the private equity back-office, because we didn't think that we were going to be able to do \u2013 build the scale and be able to do it as cheaply and as effectively. So, I mean, that's the nature of the work that's being done. I think in terms of other large parts of the organization, looking at that, those definitely in scope. And I think that is absolutely part of the 50 million that we're talking about. I don't want to get into too much specifics right now because we're still in the midst of it. And then unfortunately, it's taken a little bit longer as all these large projects do to fully understand, but no question when we get to a point of announcement, you'll know about it as we sort of get to certainty. So hopefully, I know it does not exactly answer your question, but that's definitely part of it. Andrew Schlossberg : And maybe it's in the context of \u2013 we just look at process improvement generating efficiencies and effectiveness as a core activity of the firm, always has been, always will be, and there's no end date to things like that. And again, I think good progress to date, but we'll just continue to embrace the best talent and technologies available. Alex Blostein : Okay. Thanks for the answers. Operator : Thank you. Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks very much. Just one in the back, outsource again. Obviously, it's a play on at least the capabilities in Europe, but can you talk about whether there is actually a global dimension to this? Is there enough differentiation in the source product, or do you plan to keep the brand name separate? And then potentially market that globally throughout your franchise? Martin Flanagan : Andrew, Dan, why don't you guys take that? Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah, maybe I'll start, Dan, then you can pick up from your end. As I mentioned the product, the product line from Source is robust and diverse. Complements lots of aspects of what we do globally with PowerShares, I think it creates a set of building block products that we can take directly to our clients as we normally would. Also as the growth of solutions both internally here at Invesco and multi-asset strategies in general across the industry grow, ETFs factor strategies and in particular, the source of ETFs that Source and PowerShares have, we think we're going to be growing parts of those solutions. And so we see opportunity to leverage these building blocks that way. Dan, you might want to pick up on other growth opportunities on the ETF side and maybe the brand too. Dan Draper : Sure. I think in terms of just global synergies, you think that starting at a product range level we see a lot of potential, the combining on both sides whether it's in EMEA or actually back in the U.S. I think clearly the U.S. market is a little bit ahead in terms of smart beta and specifically factor investing. So clearly for us to be able to globalize a lot of our success and low volatility, quality, all those different factor and even factor combinations, high dividend, low volume what have you, as we've down to continue to take that and then you really look at the upscale distribution of Source, that's pretty exciting. And then if you actually look at Source, some very unique products on their side, for example, a leadership position in commodities within Europe, particularly in precious metals. And again, that's something where in we have a very big commodity platform in the U.S. but we don't have precious metals. So the product line synergies really work, we think, on both sides over the Atlantic. I think in terms of brand, obviously, we just signed the agreement a number of hours ago. I think clearly, we want to be able to kind of transition through that and really consider what makes the most sense. But I think absolutely, thinking from an Invesco perspective, we tend to really want to get the maximum efficiency and scalability from the global platform, most notably portfolio management products, capital markets, operations; all those areas we think are big differentiators and ultimately if executed well can really improve operating leverage for Invesco. Brian Bedell : That\u2019s great color. Thank you. Maybe and then just one question on DOL, Marty, maybe if you can talk, and if Loren also talk about what you're seeing given the shift or the delay of the DOL rule to June, and if you're seeing incremental different behaviors on advisers and more people rushing to meet that deadline in the second quarter. And then also Loren, you mentioned on the flow side in the second quarter so far, I think where you got $2 billion of inflows, I don't think you mentioned GTR in that, assuming they're inflowing what is then conversely outflowing to get to you back to that $200 million? Martin Flanagan : Yes, with regard to DOL, I don't know if I can -- those were great insights, but I think we pretty consistently, the 60-day delay was not very helpful, right? The people are anticipating that ultimately there will be delay, and the incoming Chairman of the SEC made a comment recently that the best outcome would be a comprehensive fiduciary rule for the industry. We are very supportive of that idea, but we're a long way from that. So ourselves and our distribution partners are continuing to be prepared for the fiduciary rule to go to in affect, some version of what it is right now. And again I think people are hopeful that there's something different, but it's just an awkward time for that. Probably more importantly though -- I think the most important dynamic to come back to is there is a movement that will not stop and that is the movement to advisory and distribution partners view that as the future, they view that as the best way to provide services to their clients and every money manager will participate in that movement. So we're managing our business accordingly. And I think that's probably the main headline that you should probably focus on. So behaviors will not change. Dan Draper : Yes. And I would say around GTR, particularly I think as we mentioned the GTR product has reached a year track record at the end of last year, which puts it into the position of being able to use in U.S. platforms having a lot of dialogue, lot of engagements on the product. I think there still unfortunately really the derivative rule that would inquire to understand is the product going to be able to be used in the current form. It's still not definitively -- yet, and so that's been a little bit of a headwind on moving forward, but there's a lot of enthusiasm and excited about being able to bring the product into the U.S. channel as soon as that becomes more and more -- so definitely they are waiting but again, there's general delay around regulatory certainties, is not going to help. Brian Bedell : And then just on the flipside, and it will be the balance of the inputs you mentioned I think PowerShares and I forgot the other one that was... Dan Draper : PowerShare is in the cross-border where... Brian Bedell : Cross-border that\u2019s right. Is the U.S. equity still outflowing then I guess? Dan Draper : US equity is in positive flow if you take the PowerShares, but yes, excluding PowerShares slight negative outflow. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks so much. Dan Draper : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Chris Shutler of William Blair. Your line is now open. Chris Shutler : Hi, guys. Good morning. Just two real quick ones on Source. So I know Source was started by a handful of large banks, Warburg, I think, had owned about half the company. Can you give us a rough sense of is there much AUM concentration amongst those former bank owners? Martin Flanagan : Andrew or Dan, do you want to take that? Andrew Schlossberg : Dan is going to go ahead. Dan Draper : Yes. I was just going to say, well, if you think about the \u2013 as you mentioned the five investment banks actually formed, and you're right, formed the company and then later Warburg Pincus bought a majority stake. I think if you look in practice, the AUM that would have been held and remember, these were the investment banking arms of these five investment banks that they would just normally hold maybe seeding and inventory for the trading and their market-making purposes. So aside from that, there wouldn't be strategic holdings coming from that, so just like not only those banks but other market-makers as well would normally hold some level of inventory for market-making purposes. Chris Shutler : Okay. And then just looking quickly at the product list on your website, it looked like they have maybe call it $8 billion somewhere in that range of S&P 500 ETFs, I just want to confirm those asses are not included in there AUM? Dan Draper : Those assets are included in their AUM. Chris Shutler : Those are, okay. And they're at like five basis points? Dan Draper : That's correct, that would be their core range of their profits. Chris Shutler : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Robert Lee of KBW, your line is now open. Robert Lee : Great. Thanks, thanks for your patience. I just have two quick ones. First, I mean, just going back to Source. Knowing that you can't talk about the financial arrangements with too much specifics, but just curious, is it reasonable to assume this is somewhat structured like you did with PowerShares? With a moderated front payment, but earnouts based on some aggressive asset growth targets? Martin Flanagan : I think you can assume as an upfront payment with some contingent earnout based on growth. I wouldn't characterize it exactly like PowerShares, but I mean, conceptually, yes. Robert Lee : And then maybe on a different topic. We all talked about the active to passive shift ad nauseam over the last couple of years, and could you maybe compare and contrast what you're seeing outside the U.S. as it relates to particularly in the retail channels? Maybe your thoughts on -- excuse me, the trends there? Chocking on my words. Martin Flanagan : Yes. I'd say the debate is most acute in the United States, and it probably is because of the relative size of the cap-weighted index providers in the United States. And but it is -- let me put it this way, what we are doing as a firm is we do actually believe that right answers are a combination of active passive and alternatives, and we'll just overlay that Loren was talking about, and we do think it's the way of the future, and it will be varying degrees in different markets. And probably again most acute in United States, probably followed by the U.K. The least along those ways would be Asia at the moment. Robert Lee : Great. That\u2019s it. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Michael Cyprys : Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for patience just wading out the questions. Just going back to the optimization work. Just curious how we should think about those savings flowing to the bottom-line versus, I guess, keeping margins flat or maybe even expanding that versus how you're thinking about investing in the business? Andrew Schlossberg : Yes, I think again we'll probably in a position to give you a bit more color about how that might mend itself. We've generated about, as I mentioned, roughly $30 million of run rate savings so far. You haven't seen a lot of that drop to the bottom-line that's because it helped to offset some of the acquisition cost associated with Jemstep and with our Religare business. So again, it is more likely than not that some of that is going to go to allow us to invest beyond our most critical investments while keeping expenses reasonably stable and flat. So that's really the greatest opportunity for us is to free up funding as we always have done, but in a much more significant way as the need to invest is probably greater in this market that we've ever seen before with so much opportunities and so much change. And so again, we'll give you more color as we probably get to midyear around what to expect and then Marty\u2026 Martin Flanagan : Let me stand a point again that we again talked about it at various times on these calls. And let's get back to it, Ken's comment earlier on the call about the M&A environment. This is probably the worst time for firms not to invest in the future. And the good news is we started investing more than a decade ago in alternatives and passive and in ETF business et cetera, et cetera. And so we've been able to continue to invest while still being very responsible in delivering returns for shareholders. And Loren raised a very good point so the efficiency that we gained, it is allowing us to continue to develop the business strategically today. And obviously one comment on Jemstep, we're relatively, so a year into it. The highlight, what I would say is we're going to be much more impactful than we probably imagined at the time. It is creating opportunities that we didn't even imagine. And again, it feels like it was all the opportunities for what PowerShares did for us 11 years ago when we bought it. And again, we'll be more clear later in the year on that. But you have to make those strategic investments and when you end up getting some of the outcomes, which might accrue with something like Jemstep, I think that's what creates competitive advantages for firms and the ability to do better jobs for your clients. Michael Cyprys : Great. Thanks very much. Martin Flanagan : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Chris Harris : Thanks guys for all the patients. Just a quick one. I wanted to follow-up on the active versus passive discussion ex U.S. You guys really do have a great chart in here on slide 19, just showing the growth of ETF in EMEA. And if we do expect that trajectory to hold and have a similar path as it's had in the U.S., what are the implications for your active business in the region, in EMEA? And I guess what I'm really wondering, is there a reason to think that this penetration in EMEA might not be as disruptive as it's been in the U.S.? Martin Flanagan : So what I would say for ourselves is, we have an absolutely outstanding set of investors in EMEA, I'd say some investors quite frankly in the world, and Andrew talked about the success and penetration, and that only happens because of doing a good job for clients. We look at this probably very similar to again what happened in the United States if these are complementary vehicles and products to active management, and all it did for us was strengthen our core business. And so we see our active business only getting stronger on the back of this. And needless to say, we're very excited about the future and the opportunity. Chris Harris : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And speakers, there are no more questions on queue. Martin Flanagan : Well, thank you very much. Thank you, everybody for your time and the questions, and as always, so we appreciate your time and your efforts following the company. We'll speak to you very soon. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Welcome to Invesco\u2019s Second Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objection, you may disconnect at this time. Now I would like to turn the call over to your speakers for today : Marty Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; and Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin. Marty Flanagan : Thank you very much, and thank you for joining us today. And I will give the highlights of the business review and Loren will review the financials, as we typically do, and then open it up to everybody\u2019s questions. So let me begin by highlighting the firm\u2019s operating results for the second quarter. I\u2019m on Slide 4 of the presentation, if you\u2019re so inclined to follow us and that is on the website. Long-term investment performance remained strong again during the quarter, ending with 71% and 78% of assets ahead of peers on a 3- and 5-year basis. And the strong performance contributed to solid retail inflows during the quarter, $1.4 billion. Retail inflows were offset by institutional outflows, which resulted in net outflows of $0.6 billion. Now, adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 39.3%, up from 37.7% over the prior quarter and we returned $119 million back to shareholders. Assets under management were $858 billion at the end of the quarter, up from $834 billion in the prior quarter. Adjusted operating income was $357 million for the quarter, up from $327 million in the prior quarter, which resulted in adjusted earnings per share, diluted earnings per share for the quarter of $0.64, up from $0.61 in the prior quarter. And based on continued strong fundamentals of the business, we\u2019re providing a quarterly dividend of $0.29 per share, which represents a 3.6% increase. And before Loren gets to the financials, let me spend a few minutes on investment performance and flows. On Slide 7, you\u2019ll note the performance over 1, 3, 5 and 7 years, and again, our commitment to investment excellence, and the work that the teams have done to build out a very strong culture, continues to generate very strong investment performance across the enterprise. And as I mentioned, 71% of the assets were in the top half on a 3-year basis; and 78% of assets on a 5-year basis. Moving to flows, you\u2019ll note on the active side, gross sales and redemptions were roughly in line with the same quarter in the prior year, but the second quarter did see continued improvement in the positive trends in net active flows, which you\u2019ll note on Slide 8. Flows continue to be strong in taxable fixed income and Core Plus Bond funds. Flows in the passive capabilities were offset for the first quarter, primarily reflecting continued weak demand in our UIT \u2013 with UITs and a single large low fee real estate redemption during the quarter. We did see, during the quarter, solid flows into PowerShares fixed income, and the Senior Loan Fund in particular. Retail flows were solid during the quarter, reflecting continued strength in certain of our PowerShares ETFs, as well as Global Targeted Return, European equities and other funds. We also saw strong inflows into our cross-border retail funds in Europe. Our pipeline of won but not funded institutional opportunities remains strong. The funding was slower in the quarter than we anticipated, and redemptions were in line with where they were in the prior quarters, which led to the $2 billion in institutional outflows. The outflows are largely attributed to a slowdown in sales in Asia and heightened redemptions at stable value as clients were changing their asset allocations typically within in the plan. Although the flow fissure was mixed for the second quarter, it\u2019s important to note that the composition of the inflows has been driven towards highly active capabilities and month-to-date, long-term inflows of more than $1.4 billion post June 30, reflecting a strength in our cross-border business in particular. And as always, we\u2019re early into the quarter. It could change, but so far, I think we\u2019re off to a good quarter with regard to flows. So Loren, do you want to...? Loren Starr : Yes, very much, thanks, Marty. So looking at our schedule on total assets under management, we saw quarter-over-quarter, total AUM increase $23.5 billion or 2.8%. That was driven by market gains of $13 billion, positive foreign exchange translation of $8.1 billion, we saw $2.8 billion of inflows into the money market capability. Also $0.2 billion of inflows into the QQQs. But these factors were somewhat offset by long-term net outflows of $0.6 billion. Average AUM for the second quarter came in at $849.2 billion, 2.3% versus the first quarter. And then looking at our net revenue yield, that came in at 42.7 basis points and our net revenue yield, excluding performance fees, was at 41.8 basis points, so that was an increase of 0.9 basis points over the first quarter. The positive impact of foreign exchange and the change in AUM mix added 0.7 basis points. One additional day added 0.4 basis points. These positive factors were then somewhat offset by the impact of a reduction in other revenue, which acted to decrease the yield by 0.2 basis points. Moving on to Slide 12, that provides our U.S. GAAP operating results for the quarter. As usual, my comments today will focus exclusively on the variances related to our non-GAAP adjusted measures, which can be found on Slide 13. Looking at Slide 13, you\u2019ll see our net revenues increased by $39.2 million or 4.5% quarter-over-quarter to $906.3 million, which included a positive foreign exchange effect of $9.1 million. Within that net revenue number, you\u2019ll see that our adjusted investment management fees increased by $54.3 million or 5.6% to $1.03 billion. This reflects higher average AUM as well as an additional day during the second quarter. Foreign exchange increased our adjusted management fee by $10 million. Adjusted services and distribution revenues increased by $4.9 million or 2.4%, reflecting our higher average AUM in the quarter. FX decreased our adjusted service and distribution revenues by $0.1 million. Our adjusted performance fees for the quarter came in at $18 million, and these are earned from a variety of investment capabilities, including $7.4 million from accounts managed by our U.K. team, $6 million came from our private equity business, $2.7 million came from our Asia Pacific investment teams. Foreign exchange increased performance fees by $0.3 million. And in the last two quarters of 2017, I will just update my guidance here, we expect performance fees to decline to roughly $5 million to $7 million per quarter, which, again, is subject to my usual caveat, that forecasting performance fees is an imperfect science, and certainly one that we don\u2019t have a huge line of sight to. The adjusted other revenues in the second quarter came in at $17.3 million, and that was a decrease of $3.5 million from the prior quarter. It was driven by lower real estate transaction fees, UIT revenues as well as other front-end load fees. Foreign exchange increased our adjusted other revenue by $0.1 million. Again, looking to guidance here, looking forward to the second half of 2017, we would expect other revenues to remain near the second quarter levels at $16 million to $17 million per quarter. Moving on down to the third-party distribution, service and advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues, that increased by $16.8 million or 4.8%. That\u2019s consistent with our increased revenues derived from the retail-related AUM as well as the additional day count in the quarter. Foreign exchange adjusted our third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses by $1.2 million. And before I move to the expense area of the P&L, let me try to summarize the revenue guidance I just provided in terms of net revenue yield. So looking at the second half of 2017, we have two offsetting impacts. We would expect to see our net revenue yield, excluding performance fees, increase by roughly 0.5 basis points, and that\u2019s driven primarily by the increase in day count, as well as the asset mix in the second half of the year. This increase, however, is going to be offset by the acquisition of Source assets, which will be dilutive to the firm\u2019s net revenue yield. As we had talked about, that\u2019s about $25 billion, and somewhere between 16 to 17 basis points. As a result, the overall net revenue yield, excluding performance fees, should remain actually fairly consistent with the second quarter level at 42 basis points for the second half of the year. Again, this guidance assumes flat markets and foreign exchange from today\u2019s levels. All right, so let\u2019s move to the expenses. If we move on down the slide, you\u2019ll see our adjusted operating expenses at $549.8 million, increased by $9.8 million or 1.8% relative to the first quarter. Foreign exchange increased adjusted operating expenses by $4.3 million during the quarter. The adjusted employee compensation line item came in at $360.6 million, that\u2019s a decrease of $0.6 million or 0.2%. This is driven by a decline in seasonal payroll taxes. That always happens first quarter to second quarter. But it was offset by an increase in variable and other compensation costs, a full quarter of higher base salaries effective March 1 and an increase in deferred compensation expenses for the awards that were granted in the first quarter. The foreign exchange impact for our adjusted employee compensation came in at $2.5 million. Looking forward, again, to the guidance, we\u2019re assuming AUM and foreign exchange flat to current levels. We\u2019d expect compensation to increase ratably to about $370 million by Q4. This increase in forecasted compensation costs includes the \u2013 several factors, including: The impact of the Source acquisition in the third quarter; investments that we\u2019re making behind some of our key strategic initiatives, including building out our institutional business, solutions, ETFs and Jemstep as well as resources that we are adding to meet the growth in regulatory and compliance requirements on a global basis. Our adjusted marketing expenses in Q2 increased by $4.7 million or 18.8% to $29.7 million. That reflects an increase in advertising and client events. Foreign exchange increased our adjusted marketing expense by $0.3 million. Marketing costs should stay roughly flat to current levels until Q4, at which point in time this could grow to somewhere around $36 million to $38 million, consistent with the historic seasonality that we\u2019ve seen in the past. The adjusted property, office and technology expenses were $88.7 million in the quarter. That\u2019s an increase of $3.1 million or 3.6% over the first quarter, due to higher outsourced administration and software costs. Foreign exchange increased our adjusted property, office and tech expenses by $0.7 million. For the remainder of 2017, we see property, office and technology costs coming in between $92 million to $94 million a quarter. This is due to the impact of large technology-related projects that have and are coming into service as well as the outsourced administration expenses driven by the activity within our European cross-border business which should move the activity. Next, we go to adjusted general and administrative expenses at $70.8 million. That increased $2.6 million or 3.8% quarter-over-quarter. The G&A increase was largely driven by professional services costs associated with the regulatory changes and compliance that we\u2019re seeing on a global basis. Foreign exchange increased our adjusted G&A expenses by $0.8 million. We would expect G&A as a line item to remain at similar levels as in the second quarter or slightly elevated levels for the remainder of 2017, somewhere between $70 million and $73 million per quarter. So finishing on the topic of expenses, I\u2019d like to emphasize that I do believe the organic and inorganic investments that we are making will serve as key business differentiators for Invesco, and therefore, are critical for our long-term success in what we see as a rapidly changing competitive environment. With that said, we will continue to be highly focused on cost optimization efforts in order to remain as efficient as possible and to help fund these investments. So finally, moving down the page, you\u2019ll see our adjusted nonoperating income decrease $10 million compared to the first quarter. This decrease was primarily due to the gain realized on our pound sterling-U.S. dollar hedges in the first quarter. And moving to taxes, the firm\u2019s effective tax rate on a pretax adjusted net income basis was 26.7%, which brings us to our EPS at $0.64 and adjusted operating margin, 39.3%. So with that, I\u2019m going to turn it back over to Marty. Marty Flanagan : Thanks, Loren. I do want to do two quick updates before we turn it over to Q&A. One on Jemstep and the second on our EMEA business. And many of you probably saw the news that the Advisor Group, which is a network of independent advisory firms announced a new platform for its 5,000 advisers they support. The comprehensive digital onboarding advice and data aggregation program for their financial advisers was launched in alliance with Jemstep, which is our adviser-focused digital solution business. We view \u2013 we view this as a further sign that Jemstep/Invesco combination offering digital advice platform as tremendous value-added technology in our sector and it is resonating in the marketplace. The platform extends to both advisers and their end clients to strengthen their relationship and will be used to support advisory and brokerage business models, which as far as we can tell, is unique in the marketplace. And as noted on previous calls, it\u2019s early days, but we do see Jemstep as having meaningful potential in the market for us. With regard to EMEA, we saw the fourth consecutive quarter of positive long-term net inflows in the region, which totaled nearly $3 billion in the second quarter, despite a large one-off sovereign wealth fund redemption. Quarterly gross flows for the region of $14.3 billion were the highest since the first quarter of 2015. Long-term flows into the cross-border retail totaled $4.1 billion for the quarter, and our Global Targeted Return fund remains in high demand, with inflows of $2 billion during the quarter. We did not purchase any stock during the quarter, instead reserving a portion of our available cash for the planned acquisition of Source, the leading specialist provider of ETFs based in Europe. We are making very good progress on the regulatory approvals and remain on track to close the transaction at the end of the third quarter. Net inflows into Source have been strong year-to-date. We remain focused on planning the combination of our two firms, building on Invesco\u2019s significant expertise and track record of bringing companies together for the benefit of clients, employees and shareholders. We really are excited about this opportunity and we do think the combination of our ETF with Source, in Europe, will really be a meaningful addition to the company. So with that, I will stop, and Loren and I will answer any questions anybody has. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question is coming from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning. First, I wanted to dig more into the institutional sales. So can you give us a little more flavor about the slowdown in Asia, and how the Asian-specific pipeline is looking and maybe where the conversions in Asia have fallen off? And then, why aren\u2019t you seeing the weakness in Asia being offset by conversions of the strong pipeline elsewhere? Then lastly, can you give us maybe an outlook for the second half of the year on the institutional side? Any conviction in moving back to positive sales there? Marty Flanagan : Yes, Ken, let me hit a couple of those and Loren can chime in. So just literally with regard to the won but not funded pipeline, that continues to remain strong and it is just a fundamental fact, we\u2019re not making the decision of when the organizations are going to finish their processes to fund. So we see it simply as a timing topic, nothing to do with a falloff in success of the business. Where it has gotten softer after a very, very strong 18 months is really in Japan, where it has been just \u2013 that big change in some of those big plans. We were a significant beneficiary of it, and literally was funding almost every single month. So at some point, that \u2013 it stops. So it\u2019s flattening off more than anything else. So those would be the two comments I would make. Anything you\u2019d add? Loren Starr : I mean, I do think we\u2019re still pretty optimistic about the overall story on the institutional side, for sure. The fee rate on flows are at a much higher level, continues to be sort of record highs on the aggregate basis points. And then, that weakness, as you suggest, is being offset in other locations. Europe is quite strong. So again, we \u2013 I think it\u2019s more just an aberration around just a confluence of things that happened in second quarter as opposed to a real inflection point indicating that something\u2019s at a whole new level of decline. So the thing that I would say is we have pretty good line of sight on the won but not funded, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m referring to right now. When redemptions happen, which they can, that\u2019s harder for us to predict. And so we did get caught offsided by one large sovereign wealth outflow in the quarter, which was pretty sizable, $1.2 billion. And those are hard for us to really see. We don\u2019t expect those to recur, but again, we don\u2019t know. Ken Worthington : Great. And then just on PowerShares, it looks like PowerShares is looking to launch some market cap weighted ETFs. Somewhat of a departure from the smart beta focus. Can you talk about what PowerShares is doing here and if there\u2019s any tie back here to Jemstep? Marty Flanagan : Yes, good question, Ken. So it is two things, it\u2019s not just Jemstep, but also solutions. And really, as we build the models, in line with what clients are trying to accomplish, they do use cap-weighted indexes in there. So it\u2019s not as a single solution but as a part of a total portfolio. And we\u2019re very capable of managing cap-weighted indexes, so it\u2019s for solutions and frankly, also into Jemstep, where a number of models have been built to give various choice to the different participants. So those are the two focuses there. Ken Worthington : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt of Autonomous. Your line is open. Patrick Davitt : Thank a lot. First question is just around the broader European kind of regulatory environment, particularly as so much of your growth is coming from that region. Do you have any change in position or more specificity on the impact of MiFID II on your business and/or profitability? And then, more recently, any kind of initial reaction to the FCA review and your positioning for their major proposals? Marty Flanagan : Yes, let\u2019s \u2013 with MiFID coming on, like everybody, it\u2019s been \u2013 an awful lot of work, heads down. We really see no different \u2013 we do not have a different point of view today than we have over the last number of quarters. It is more work, it\u2019s not going to dramatically change our business. I would say, this and also in combination with the FCA work, it ultimately does favor larger firms that are capable of working through these topics and frankly, can afford the additional costs to meet the regulations. Back to the FCA, it did make a number of recommendations. Some of the principal regulations we\u2019re already in line with. So one of them was to have a single fee. We did that a couple of years ago. So we\u2019re beyond that, and I think some of the areas that they\u2019re focused on, greater transparency and the like, some of the early suggestions, again, we are supportive of those types of things. We, like others in the industry, will be commenting during this period and try to help give greater guidance, but again, it is something that we feel very well-positioned. They were also focused in particular on really, what they would sort of call closet indexers. Needless to say, that\u2019s not even close to a topic for us, and the investment performance of our teams over a very, very long period of time is just really outstanding. So again, it\u2019s a burden for the overall industry, but again, with the idea of making it a better industry, which is we are very supportive of. But again, we think we\u2019ll be fine once we get through this. Loren Starr : And Pat, just to remind you, I mean, we did come out, I think it was last quarter, in terms of our position with respect to the use of commissions on research, and so we said that we were going to continue to focus on, within the \u2013 of our ability within MiFID II, to use CSAs to fund RPAs, which would mean that there\u2019s not a substantial impact on cost for us, as long as competitively that\u2019s still, and from a regulatory perspective, that still makes sense. The other thing is, just in terms of positioning, and we have a substantial number of people on the ground, have for a long time, in Continental Europe. So the idea of what would ultimately happen, in terms of having risk and foreign oversight of capabilities in terms of this passporting topic and so forth, is another thing that I\u2019d say we feel probably better position than most others in the region. So overall, I\u2019m not saying there\u2019s no cost there. There\u2019s probably some cost, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a substantial material cost at this point in time. Patrick Davitt : That\u2019s very helpful. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Michael Carrier : Maybe just one on the expense outlook and then just thinking about kind of the incremental margin in this environment. I just wanted to get a sense, it seems like some of these investments you guys are picking up or ramping up, like how much flexibility do you have there? Are you doing more, because the market environment, you guys have been a little bit more constructive? I just wanted to get your sense on how you\u2019re thinking about the margin in this operating environment? Marty Flanagan : Let me make a comment, and Loren can, too. So as we said, there\u2019s no question that the industry is going through quite a bit of a change. And clients are demanding different things from organizations. So simply having a range of capabilities perform well is not going to get you over the goal line, regardless of retail and institutional. And you absolutely have to have the ability to meet client outcomes with things like solutions. This movement into Jemstep to support our financial advisers, we think, is very, very important. Things like thought leadership, they are not optional value-added capabilities. And so we think it\u2019s really important that we continue to responsively invest against those, which we are doing. We think it\u2019s just making the firm much more competitive and better-placed for the longer-term. And yes, it does make it easier to make the investments in a strong market. We\u2019re trying to get them done as quickly as we can, but again, with very much a responsible lens on being financially sound during the process. Loren Starr : Yes, really not going to add much more to what you said, Marty, other than, I think, quantifying. In terms of incremental margin, I mean, I think we\u2019re probably at a level that\u2019s more in the 40% to 50% range incremental margin, as opposed to sort of the 50% to 65% right now, just because of our imperatives to make sure that we build out the capabilities that are going to be critical to our success and trying to do that now, but responsibly in the sense that we\u2019re continuing to find opportunities to save and to fund those. So you\u2019re going to see operating leverage, you\u2019re going to see margin expansion as we grow. All those things should absolutely continue to be in place, but maybe not quite at the level of lower investment type of positioning. Marty Flanagan : And I just might come back and add. Ken was asking some questions a few minutes ago. So we look at things like the institutional pipeline over quarter-to-quarter. That\u2019s not the way we look at it. From our perspective, we look out 1, 2, 3 years, and we look at it as a very, very important part of our future success. And as I said, I feel very good about the leadership in place. I feel very good about the responses we\u2019re starting to get from clients as we are dealing with them in a more robust way. And again, it is not a \u2013 the assets just don\u2019t go straight up. They are choppier, just by the nature of the long-term, our fee process, et cetera, et cetera. So again, that would be another area where we just think it\u2019s really important that we do a good job. Michael Carrier : Okay, all that makes sense. Just on capital, so post the Source deal, just wanted to get a sense, anything changing on how you guys are thinking about you know, kind of buyback activity, just given that we\u2019ve been in this lull between the deal? Loren Starr : So I think it is our capital policy and approach remains in place. Obviously, we smartly, I think, are pausing on the buyback just so we can fund this acquisition. The opportunity set for things in this industry around consolidation is at a high level, too. So I\u2019ll just generally say that we\u2019re seeing probably more inorganic opportunities than we have in the past. Certainly, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to do something else other than Source. But I think our general position is one of this is a unique and extraordinary time, and so we may continue to be thinking about the balance of cash to return, versus opportunities in the market that might not show themselves again, so. And again, it\u2019s a little bit hard to say exactly, but we are generally, I\u2019d say, back in our normal return mode post-Source. Michael Carrier : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Your line is open. Dan Fannon : Thanks. I guess, just another question on expenses. You have this business optimization plan that\u2019s also in place, where I think you in the press release, highlight sort of more run rate savings going into 2018 now. I guess, if we think about the guidance you\u2019ve given for the remainder of this year, how much of this is reflective of some of the new \u2013 the incremental spend of compliance and growth, but then you obviously have Source and you\u2019re offsetting this with some of these business optimizations. So I guess, is there a way to kind of bucket some of these in terms of categories of the incremental spend? Loren Starr : Well, I tell you, I mean, into the second half, certainly a substantial part of the expense pickup is just related to Source. Again, you probably have a reasonable sense of kind of the revenues and expenses for that business based on what you know about that business, so you can kind of do the math and see where that\u2019s breaking out. The optimization impact is going to be most felt in 2018, because we have some very large-scale projects that are not going to get completed until 2018. And it\u2019s only until that happens will we see sort of the remainder of the \u2013 to the full 50 run rate show up. So I\u2019d say, through the second half of this year, there\u2019s definitely some offset of the investments through optimization efforts, but not incrementally a lot. So I don\u2019t know if that fully answers your question, but I\u2019d say at least half of the expense pickup is due to Source and the other half is just due to the investments that we\u2019ve been making, generally. Dan Fannon : Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then, Marty, I think in the press release and in your comments, you mentioned stable value as being kind of a source of redemptions. Can you talk about that and why that wouldn\u2019t be, or are you anticipating that to continue to be a headwind, given some of the client reallocation in that bucket? Marty Flanagan : I don\u2019t. Look, I think it\u2019s just the normal course of people doing their allocations with their 401k plans and here we are, 2017 and what has been more or less an extended bull market and people seem to be in some of these plans, moving out of stable value into some higher risk/return products. Whether that\u2019s the right timing or not, I\u2019m not sure, but that\u2019s not my decision. I think what I would point to probably is the \u2013 and this is no new news to anybody following the company, but the headwinds of the UIT business, I mean, that continues to be one that is not immaterial when you look at the relative flows quarter-to-quarter. And again, we\u2019re just going to have to see where that goes as things settle out with the \u2013 as the platforms rebalance what they want to do in light of the DOL fiduciary rule. So I would point to that as the more topical area than stable value. Stable value, I think, will continue to be solid. Dan Fannon : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup. Your line is open. Bill Katz : Thanks for taking the question. Just a technical question before I get to the meat of the question. Did you mention that the marketing spend would be in that $38 million range in Q3 or it sort of tip-toes there by the end of the year? Loren Starr : Marketing\u2019s going to be roughly flat to what it was in the second quarter, and it\u2019s really just in Q4 where it goes to that higher level. Bill Katz : Got you. So the other question was, just sort of staying on the expense theme, what\u2019s the life of the incremental spend here? So I appreciate you\u2019re taking the incremental margin down pretty substantially, and I guess half of that is from Source, but is there a more structural change in the business model here, maybe for you and maybe the industry at large? Because it seems you already have some in terms of the investment spend. So when you get on the other side of this hump of spending, are you back into that north of 50% incremental margin or are you just now at a structurally less incrementally profitable point? Loren Starr : I think this is not a structural topic. I think it\u2019s more building around what we see as absolutely key points of differentiation in growth that we want to be ahead of as opposed to sort of running behind competitors and the industry trends. So I think we\u2019re doing a lot and we\u2019re really, I think, getting through the bulk of what we need to get through. It will probably persist into 2018, I\u2019d say, for us to get to sort of an equilibrium point, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a structural ongoing theme in terms of incremental margins for us. Marty Flanagan : Yes, I agree with that fully, Loren\u2019s comments. And again, I\u2019d just come back to we all thought it\u2019s been a competitive business, over our careers here, but I will tell you, I mean, this is a very different time. And if you are not investing for the future, in a very rapid way, you\u2019re going backwards. And so again, we are \u2013 we think we\u2019re being very responsible. We are seeing the results in very different areas and I think if you look at what we\u2019ve done over the years, we have a track record of the investments paying off in a pretty material way and that\u2019s what we think we\u2019re doing right now. Are they all going to be perfect? No, they\u2019re not. But we feel quite confident the vast majority of them will be very important to the firm. Bill Katz : Okay, and then also looking at some of the flow matrix, sort of focusing in on U.S. equity. You look at some of the slide decks and performance trends, they continue to be somewhat checkered. How are you thinking about that business in light of just the ongoing commoditization risk to passive. Is this an area that \u2013 is this an area you could accelerate on the investment spending side to potentially enhance returns? Is it just a timing or cycle issue, just sort of work through some weaker performance? Just trying to get a sense of what would alleviate that pressure point. Marty Flanagan : Yes, look, I feel really good about our investment teams. And yes, has there been a headwind in U.S. equities in particular? Yes. Do I think \u2013 I personally think it\u2019s an incredible mistake to be putting your 100% of your U.S. equity exposure into cap-weighted indexes. There\u2019s going to be some very disappointed people that have done that. And if you look at the U.S. value capability in particular, relatively underperforming, they are doing exactly what they should be doing, being 100% committed to their investment process, they will do very well. And when we saw the spike at the end of last year, after \u2013 if you want to call it after the election, through the end of the year, it picked up 1,000 basis points against cap-weighted indexes. So again, it\u2019s very easy to say it\u2019s different this time, and I just \u2013 we\u2019re supporters of passive and factor and active in a \u2013 very clearly, but I think it\u2019s a mistake to give up on active at this part of the cycle. Bill Katz : Got you. Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Your line open. Alex Blostein : So just staying with the expenses and the margin dynamic. Just one point of clarification. Do you guys expect to be at the 50% to 60% incremental margin in 2018? Or the investment spend that you are seeing in the back half of the year is likely to continue beyond that point? Loren Starr : Yes, I think the 50% to 60% is probably post-2018, based on what I just mentioned in terms of the higher level of investment and we\u2019re probably setting expectations, realistically, that would be in the more 40% to 50% for this year, next year. So that is kind of where we are right now. We haven\u2019t, obviously, fully completed our plan around what we\u2019re doing in 2018, and a lot obviously will depend on where the markets go and where the mix of products go. We\u2019re definitely, I\u2019d say, it\u2019s a good thing that\u2019s very helpful for us is the fee dynamic is working in our favor, with the strength that we\u2019re seeing in the cross-border business, and as Marty said, it just continues through July, very strong flows, that is very helpful. And the fact that the pound is now at 1.31 and strengthening, also is going to be extremely helpful for our yield. So that could actually help our net \u2013 my incremental margin discussion. But assuming flat markets and flat FX is what I\u2019m referring to. Alex Blostein : Right. Okay. And I guess, bigger picture question, so you guys \u2013 I totally understand why you\u2019re spending where you\u2019re spending and the segment changes in the space, but at the same time, the \u2013 a good chunk of the equity business in the U.S. is underperforming on a 5-year basis. I mean, U.S. core business is struggling. So I guess, why not pull back and create a little more of a cost reduction on that part of the business to fund some of the initiatives that you\u2019ve highlighted? Marty Flanaga : Yes, I think that could be just about the biggest mistake somebody could make, as far as I\u2019m concerned right now. They are high-quality teams, they are very, very good at what they do. And investors, our clients are going to do very fine with them through the market cycle, and that\u2019s how I feel. Alex Blostein : Fair enough. And I guess, just the last one, on Source. I don\u2019t recall if you guys gave us the amount of cost synergies that you anticipate to have from that business once that closes. Just kind of perhaps how long it will take to get that out of the run rate? Loren Starr : Yes, we have not provided a lot of transparency into the synergies topic. Again, in terms of the materiality, it\u2019s all going to be within our guidance that we\u2019ll obviously provide for 2018 and beyond. And certainly, some of it is already baked into the estimates that we provided you. It\u2019s mostly a growth topic for us, as we said in the past. There\u2019s definitely some overlaps that will allow for some cost take-out, but the real benefit for this platform is us growing through flows, and as Marty mentioned, it is flowing beautifully, right, very nicely. And so we think we can actually significantly improve flows out of that business. We are looking at a lot of new product launches, so really, the \u2013 it\u2019s going to be more of investing behind the business than taking cost out. So that\u2019s why we really have been focused on it. Alex Blostein : Great. Thank guys. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brian Bedell : Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just an update \u2013 some updated thoughts on DOL fiduciary rule timing, maybe both in how you think distribution partners are currently positioned and will react on the active mutual fund side, including financial adviser views. And your view of, to what extent do you think that clean shares will become much more dominant in the marketplace? And maybe just long-term views on whether the BIC gets restructured for January 1, 2018? Marty Flanaga : Let\u2019s see. So maybe let me try to put it in context of the big picture and I \u2013 and again, we\u2019ve said this before and other have. It\u2019s just very, very clear that the fund \u2013 the distributors are moving to a financial advisory model across the board and that was a direction of travel anyways. I think the DOL fiduciary rule really just sped that up. So I think everybody sees that clearly. The \u2013 I think with regard to the BIC, I think there\u2019s anticipation that it will be modified quite materially to ensure that financial advisers and investors have choice, because it really does get in the way of investors having choice, which means it gets in the way of people building robust, meaningful portfolios with a combination of active, factor-based portfolios. So I think that is important. I think I would put it in the category of people are hopeful that it\u2019s going to happen and it really needs to happen before we move into the next year. So I think the best top of mind on everybody\u2019s to-do list is we continue to try to support that change. Brian Bedell : And any commentary on clean shares and or T shares, I guess? Marty Flanaga : Yes, it feels like clean shares, over time, make an awful lot of sense. I think it\u2019s going to follow the transition to the advisory model where I think that would be a really good thing, because right now, mutual funds are disadvantaged from the standpoint that they are really a paying agent, so it makes the expense ratio really inflated when you look at it vis-a-vis something like an ETF, because you are literally paying for service and distribution costs in that model. In the advisory model, the overall fee is what is paying for the financial advice and the mutual fund within it would have the clean share lower expense ratio, and frankly, would be on a more level playing field with things like ETFs. And again, vehicles are not ways to meet investment objectives, but they are \u2013 they have different attributes which are helpful to different situations. So that\u2019s probably where it\u2019s going to end up, but it\u2019s probably going to take a couple of years to get there, I would guess. Brian Bedell : Okay, that\u2019s great color. And then, just maybe your updated views on large-scale M&A. First of all, it was interesting, I think, Loren, what you talked about, potential opportunities or the market getting to a point where there, looks like there might be more opportunities for you guys to acquire things. And maybe just some commentary about what you may need to fill out an already, pretty diversified product set. And then, broader picture for Marty. You commented on this before in the past, so just maybe your updated views on large-scale consolidation in the active \u2013 or in the asset management industry. Given active performance actually has improved this year so far, but keeping in mind like what you said in terms of investing for the future, if you\u2019re not doing that, you\u2019re falling behind. So do you see that, I guess, environment for large-scale consolidation even more appealing now, than say, 6 months ago? Marty Flanaga : Yes. Let\u2019s see. I still believe the likelihood of more combinations and meaningful combinations is more likely now than probably any time in my career for all the dynamics that we all know that we\u2019ve been talking about. It continues to be difficult to do successfully. And \u2013 but I would say, firms that combine when they both are strong, much better likelihood of outcome. I think it\u2019s those firms that are two struggling firms and you put them together, that I think is a very difficult situation, quite frankly. So the good performance might actually enhance some of these combinations or the likelihood of them. But again, I think it\u2019s really the firms that are U.S. retail-focused firms that are midsize are probably the most challenged, and with all the dynamics that we\u2019ve been talking about. So yes, we\u2019ll just have to see what happens and it\u2019s hard to predict and it always takes longer than anybody would imagine. But Loren, would you add something? Loren Starr : Yes, and the only I would just say is when I was talking about \u2013 I wasn\u2019t necessarily referring to large-scale opportunities, because I think we\u2019ve talked about those are hard to do, there\u2019s a lot of risk, there\u2019s a lot of complication. So I think the types of things that are most attractive to us would be things like Source, that are smaller, that we could plug in, gives us a platform or capability that we didn\u2019t have before and that we can grow quickly. So that\u2019s really, I think, in terms of what we would be thinking about more, than large-scale. Brian Bedell : Okay, its great color. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And now we have Chris Shutler of William Blair. Your line is open. Chris Shutler : Given that expenses are a popular topic today, maybe just summarize the major incremental investments that you\u2019re making. I think you mentioned institutional solutions, Jemstep, there may have been others I missed. Can you just walk through those one by one and give us a few more details on each of them? Loren Starr : Yes. So I mean, and Marty, you can pick up on the theme, building our institutional business is something that we\u2019ve been talking about in the past. You know, I think we have been more retail-focused as a firm and for us, in terms of getting to being seen as a premier institutional player, requires a lot of dedicated support and infrastructure, risk and analytics and reporting and a variety of infrastructure that we just didn\u2019t have in the past. That really, [indiscernible] manager, there\u2019s a whole infrastructure around building that out. Thought leadership is another kind of element. So that\u2019s \u2013 handful of the people, but very capable and good people, that help drive that cost. Solutions is another area that we talked about and that is, again, a very \u2013 an area we\u2019ve been in, but really haven\u2019t built a lot of strong capabilities around, particularly around the technology, and as I mentioned, the analytics for us to be able to sort of go off and really, almost like in a lab, figure out how to solve our clients\u2019 problems through a variety of folks that are a lot smarter than me, PhDs and others, that are thinking about those issues. So that\u2019s really that group and that appeals to both the institutional side, but also the retail side. And then they are very helpful, in terms of thinking about Jemstep as well, in terms of providing models and solutions to the retail clients. ETFs was the other area that you \u2013 we mentioned, and that\u2019s more inorganic, and obviously Source, for us, but certainly, the ability to take some of those capabilities and port them over to the U.S. and think about the digital platform and being the best-in-class provider of smart beta and differentiated ETFS is still kind of what we\u2019re trying to do and being \u2013 not be a distant fourth but be a strong fourth, at least a bit in that space. And Jemstep, they\u2019re really savvy in digital advice, which I think is going to continue to be a major opportunity and certainly, firms that have it are going to being differentiated from those who don\u2019t. So we need to have a state-of-the-art capability and it\u2019s one that requires a whole different set of skill sets, and so that\u2019s kind of the other big bucket. And the other one I mentioned, which you know, is the regulatory and compliance, which is just never-ending. Marty Flanagan : Yes, I\u2019ll just add a little color, just on the solutions piece. Again, I think it\u2019s a common word and I think it\u2019s misunderstood. I think people tend to think of it as dealing with large institutions. I mean, we look at it at 3 levels, as Loren was saying. So it literally is at the large institutional level, that\u2019s a fact. What has been surprising, the opportunity of solutions at the retail level, because as all the channels are moving, the financial advisers are moving too to be much more solutions-oriented or outcome-oriented with their clients. And our ability to build portfolios for them, whether they be in models or literally help them with their books through our range of passive, factor, active capabilities is really, really important. And so \u2013 and the third leg is Jemstep, right? And really, building these models for Jemstep is really quite important. And let me go back to, I just mentioned one group. So the adviser group of 5,000 advisers, so it\u2019s more likely than not, and I\u2019d say very likely by next year. So those are 5,000 advisers we\u2019ve never worked with before. It\u2019s very easy that we can be working with 20,000, 25,000 advisers next year that we\u2019ve never worked with before, because of things like Jemstep. So the combination of these things that we\u2019re doing is broadening our distribution channels, serving our clients in a very different way, which really creates the robustness of what the future could look like for the organization. Chris Shutler : Okay, and just one other one on the fixed income area. Looks like flows there in active fixed income been okay over the last few quarters, but I guess I\u2019m wondering why they haven\u2019t been better, just given the really \u2013 the terrific performance you have in that area. Is it investors adjusting durations in their portfolios or is there some other factor going on? Loren Starr : That\u2019s all, I mean, really, the biggest detractor from that category has been stable value. So that was substantial outflows this quarter. So it\u2019s a very low fee, 10 basis points kind of -ish. So again, when I think about the flows in versus out, our net revenue yield is, by far and away, moving up in that category. So I wouldn\u2019t take too much out of that stable value outflow. Chris Shutler : Okay, it make sense. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Chris Harris : Another one on the investments you\u2019re making. In a perfect world, how quickly do you guys think some of these investments are really going to start pay off and potentially start showing up in flows? Is it a short lead time do you think? Or is it sort of a multiyear effort that\u2019s going on? Marty Flanagan : I\u2019ll try to hit some of them. Institutionally, you\u2019re already seeing it. Solutions, it\u2019s happening. Is it at the level that we think it\u2019s going to be? No. It\u2019s early on. But you\u2019re literally getting payback. Jemstep tends to be the longer-dated one because, again, you\u2019re actually doing an installation of an application, which I think we\u2019ve all lived those experiences. It just takes time. And so that would probably be the timing, and I say you\u2019ll start to see, in each of those 3 different levels, flows will continue to pick up in the quarters ahead and next... Loren Starr : ETFs will be almost immediate, right, because we have Source coming online. Marty Flanagan : Yes. Chris Harris : Okay, great. And then a follow-up on the fee rate. Loren, I thought I heard you say the second half sort of flat with Q2. Is that correct? Loren Starr : Yes. Really, a result of these two dynamics. One, we\u2019re seeing the fee rate improve due to the mix and foreign exchange, so that\u2019s like a 0.5 basis point upward tick, which has been getting flattened out, just purely from the consolidation of the $25 billion, at 16 to 17 basis points of Jemstep \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, of Source. Chris Harris : Yes, okay. I mean, it would seem to us that Source would have overwhelmed the other positive, but I guess, apparently not. I guess, the fee rates sound like there\u2019s an incremental positive going on into Q3 that offsets the Source, I guess, is what the message is, is that right? Loren Starr : That\u2019s correct. Chris Harris : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken of UBS. Your line is open. Brennan Hawken : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. First, on clean shares and the outlook for this becoming a solution in the \u2013 particularly in the adviser broker solo channel. Who do you think or how do you think the sub-TA piece would be funded? And how have negotiations with your distribution partners gone on that point? Is that something that you think might have to be funded by the P&L of the sponsoring asset manager? Or would it be something that the distribution partners are going to be okay with losing that revenue source? Marty Flanagan : It\u2019s a good question. I\u2019d say you\u2019re ahead of really all the conversations and there\u2019s not a direct \u2013 it\u2019s not clear where everything is going to settle out. And I think much of it depends on where the DOL settles out. So again, I would just be totally speculating on what the structures might look like at the end. So wish I could be more helpful, I just can\u2019t right now. Brennan Hawken : Okay, that\u2019s fair, that\u2019s fair. And then, can you give us \u2013 I know that you guys have said that you expect pretty much everybody signed up for RPAs and it sounds like you\u2019re continuing to reiterate that point. So I\u2019m guessing that early-stage negotiations with clients are supportive of that. Is that true? Are there any early reads you can give us, particularly on the institutional side, in how that\u2019s going and what your expectations are for any application of some of these practices globally for Invesco? Loren Starr : So based on what we understand in Europe, which is where this conversation has been most focused and relevant, client reaction has been pretty much absolutely accepting of that perspective. We\u2019re not alone in terms of the global \u2013 a lot of the global managers have come out with a very similar statement. So it\u2019s actually been pretty much accepted. Ultimately, I think, when \u2013 the real trick will be in terms of the actual disclosures. And when it will ultimately get implemented, we\u2019ll have to see how all that goes. But certainly, in terms of the position, it\u2019s been accepted without much of a, any pushback. In terms of the global side, I don\u2019t know, Marty, if you think that we\u2019re thinking about doing that globally? I don\u2019t think at this point we\u2019re in a position to say what we\u2019re doing in the U.S. different than normal. Marty Flanagan : Yes, no, we\u2019re continuing down the path that we\u2019ve been on. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Mike Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Mike Cyprys : Hi, good morning, thanks for taking the question. Just coming back to the investment spend. You spoke about a lot of the challenges that the industry faces and the need to invest. So I guess, why not invest more than the amounts that you guided to? What was the thought process behind that? And what gives you confidence that you\u2019re investing enough to be successful and drive future growth? Marty Flanagan : Yes, look, that\u2019s the right question, we ask it all the time. And again, we think we\u2019re on the right topics. We think we\u2019re making progress on the right topics. And the fundamental base is just that. Are you investing enough and what we really constantly are doing is ensuring that we try to free up, reallocate dollars to the things that are making a difference. Loren has spoken in particular about the various areas that we try to create room for investments, and that is our process. Can\u2019t answer it specifically, because it\u2019s what we do each and every day. But we are thinking the way that you\u2019re thinking. Mike Cyprys : Okay, and if you were to expand the investments and the pace, what other areas could make sense? And then just on the regulatory compliance spend versus the others, how should we think about the split in terms of how much of the spend is going for regulatory compliance versus growing the business? Marty Flanagan : Yes, the majority of it these days is going for growing the business, which \u2013 and I think we\u2019re on the right topics. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re missing. We are investing on the things that we think are going to make a difference. The regulatory spend is no different than any other of our competitors. It just seems to be constantly an area where you have to invest in, and not just regulatory, but I would put cybersecurity in that category, too. I mean, there are areas that we just, 5, 6, 7 years ago, it was just not an area we had to invest at this magnitude. Mike Cyprys : I guess, what\u2019s changed on the regulatory side over the past 12 months? Because certainly, this has been a theme that you and others have been speaking about for some time in terms of driving spend. What sort of changed in terms of what you know differently today versus 12 months ago versus two years ago? Marty Flanagan : Well, part of it is, as the regulations come out, they\u2019re proposals, and you work through the process of having them put in place and then implementing them. So you\u2019re actually \u2013 you\u2019re now in the implementation stage of a number of these regulations in different parts of the world, and that\u2019s really why you\u2019ve seen the costs start to hit more recently, the last 12, 18 months, more in particular. And I\u2019d say the same thing. I just look at where we\u2019re spending money, on cybersecurity and security, generally, over the last couple of years in particular, it\u2019s just ticked up to a degree that, yes, we were spending before, but it\u2019s just at a different magnitude that you have to spend to stay ahead of the issues. You don\u2019t want to read about yourself in the paper, right? Loren Starr : Penalties, like I mean, that privacy rule, where, if you get it wrong, it\u2019s 2% of total revenues could be your fine, right. Pretty substantial element. So I think it is the regulatory \u2013 the number of regulatory changes plus, I think, the amount of resources that regulators are putting behind the asset management business now relative to two years ago has also increased, and so the level of being absolutely on top of it is \u2013 the bar has risen across the globe in terms of what is required. Mike Cyprys : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Kenneth Lee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line open. Kenneth Lee : Thanks for taking my question. I just had a question on the Source acquisition. My understanding is that ETFs right now don\u2019t have the same level of penetration in Europe as they do in the U.S. due to market structure. Just what sort of milestones do you see ahead before you see, like a meaningful increase in penetration in ETFs within Europe? Marty Flanagan : You\u2019re right. The penetration is not there in Europe. Our anticipation is that it will continue to see greater penetration in the years ahead. If you look at the history of the growth in the United States, and you look at the path where Europe is on now, it\u2019s some years later, but it seems to be following the path, with greater adoption. There was also an important evolution with the ETFs, too, where they were derivatives-based, and now there\u2019s more physical ETFs, too. And so you\u2019re broadening the potential users of derivatives in Europe, so we\u2019re anticipating that\u2019s going to continue to be a growing marketplace for ETFs and the penetration to \u2013 of ETFs to increase. Loren Starr : Yes, and probably even with some of the rules around MiFID II and the transparency on fees, and whereas there maybe not has been as much, and certainly, the idea of no inducements provided for manufacturers, distributors and how that gets implemented, feels sort of like RDR part two... Marty Flanagan : Yes. Loren Starr : In Europe in some ways, and we know that that\u2019s focused on just pure management fees. It will probably drive more adoption of lower-fee products, still within the hands of European retail clients as opposed to institutional clients who are using ETFs predominantly. Kenneth Lee : Great. That\u2019s all I have. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And now we have Robert Lee of KBW. Your line is open. Robert Lee : Thank you, thanks for taking my question. I have \u2013 maybe just want to go back to, Loren, your MiFID comments, because I may have missed some of it. I guess, two parts, and number one, is it still your expectation, I know it\u2019s still somewhat in flux, that you won\u2019t have to fund, outside of spending on systems and stuff, you won\u2019t have to fund it off your P&L at this point? Or how do you kind of think of that as a go-forward risk? Loren Starr : When you talk about outside systems, are you talking about...? Robert Lee : Well, reporting systems. I mean, I know you\u2019re spending money on the compliance side of MiFID, right, but I meant more just in terms of the commission side of it. Loren Starr : Well, the commission side, again, that\u2019s the part that we\u2019re saying would probably stay in terms of being paid through these RPA accounts funds and clients paid for, and transparency for research. So that\u2019s the current approach. So that would be largely sort of a continuation of existing P&L and practices other than sort of having those structures in place. So there would be no significant P&L impact to Invesco. Robert Lee : Okay, great. Just wanted to clarify that\u2019s your current thought. And I guess, if I look at flows, I mean, maybe thinking of them in a different way. You\u2019ve kind of, I think, talked to this, but if we look at the modest outflow this quarter in aggregate, what\u2019s the \u2013 how should we be thinking about that, really, from kind of a net revenue contribution perspective? So I mean, stable value, as you pointed out, is low fee. You\u2019ve maybe had some other things. So how should we be thinking of your expectation for the net revenue contribution of the quarter and also go-forward? Loren Starr : Yes, positive. So the net revenue, the flow mix dynamic, given the headline was kind of not great in terms of the net flow number, I was actually really pleased. If you peel that back and you understand what\u2019s flowing in terms of the strong flows coming into cross-border \u2013 into alternative opportunities which are certainly at a higher \u2013 being very active capabilities. So yes, when we were talking about sort of a 0.5 basis point pickup into next, the last half of the year, that\u2019s all due to the positive trend around the flow dynamic that we\u2019re seeing, even though it didn\u2019t really show up in terms of the headline flow number. The big outflows, as I mentioned, stable value, which was single \u2013 10 basis points, and we had the individual real estate passive outflow, which was a single point kind of \u2013 UITs as well, which is something that, I think we all understand that dynamic. It\u2019s something that continues to be a bit of a detractor to the flow story, but not one that I think materially impacts our yield. So overall, I\u2019d say that people should be looking beyond that headline number and focus on what\u2019s going on, in Europe in particular, because that is going to have the biggest impact on our net revenue yield. Robert Lee : Okay. And then maybe one last question, just kind of maybe bigger picture. The one place in U.S. retail that seems to have some positive trend is clearly the SMA business, whether it\u2019s model portfolios or whatnot. Can you maybe give us a sense of how you feel about your positioning in that business? Is that business a part of your retail business that you feel like you need to kind of make more investment in, that you have the right products in the right places? If you can maybe update us on that? Marty Flanagan : It is an evolving opportunity, there\u2019s no question about it. We have the capability with mechanical SMA structures. We also have the ability through \u2013 to build the different models, and like everybody, it\u2019s these models, I think, that are going to be taken up. In a number of the channels, there are opportunities right now without decisions being made, so we should do pretty well in that. But again, we\u2019re not going to know until decisions are made in those areas. So again, it\u2019s another area of growth as you look to the future. I think you\u2019re right. Robert Lee : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. And we have no more questions in queue. I would now like to hand the call over back to our speakers. Marty Flanagan : Thank you very much, on behalf of Loren and myself, appreciate the engagement and the questions and we\u2019ll be in touch. Operator : Thank you, and that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Welcome to Invesco\u2019s Third Quarter Results Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now, I would like to turn the call over to your speakers for today; Marty Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer; and Dan Draper, Global Head of ETFs. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin. Marty Flanagan : Thanks very much and thanks everybody for joining us. And I\u2019m going to spend a couple of minutes just on the results for the quarter. Dan is actually going to spend time to give further context around the acquisition of Guggenheim\u2019s ETF business, and Loren will go into the financial review. And of course, we\u2019ll open up to Q&A. So let me touch by hitting a few highlights for the third quarter results, which are on Page 4. Long-term performance continued to be very strong in the quarter. 67% and 75% of assets were ahead of peers on a three and five-year basis. This resulted in very strong long-term flows, $6.3 billion during the quarter. We saw this both in retail and institutional channels, and this resulted in organic growth rate of 3.4%; so all very strong during the quarter. The adjusted operating margin was up meaningfully during the quarter. It came in at 40.7% and operating \u2013 adjusted operating income increased 10% quarter-over-quarter and up 18.5% as compared to Q3 2016. So let\u2019s spend a few minutes on flows, and that\u2019s on Page 8. So we did see solid demand for both active and passive capabilities during the quarter. And as many of you know, we completed the acquisition of Source ETF business in August. Source has contributed to net inflows since the close of the acquisition, and it is going to continue to be a meaningful addition to our ETF business, our competitive positioning in EMEA and the greater ETF business globally. If you take a look at the active capabilities, growth sales and net flows were the strongest since third quarter of 2016. We saw solid flows with taxable fixed income and international equities as well as alternative capabilities. Taking a look at passive, we also saw strong flows in the fixed income commodity currency and international equity. So literally, by both active and passive, we saw very broad set of capabilities being in demand by clients. Taking a look at both retail and institutional channels during the quarter, on Slide 9, again very strong again on both channels as you will note. And as an example, this was the fifth consecutive quarter we saw net positive flows in EMEA, which were driven by nearly $3 billion of cross-border retail flows and strong institutional demand. And given that markets continue to test new highs, demand for risk mitigating strategies remain strong, particularly among institutional investors. And the pipeline of one but not funded institutional mandates also continues to grow and remain very robust. We did see strong flows into global target of return led by institutional investors, as you would imagine. And we also saw solid flows into European equities taxable fixed income and fixed income ETFs. So let\u2019s spend a couple of minutes putting context around the acquisition of Guggenheim Investments, and I\u2019m on Page 11, if you happen to be following. So as we have made very, very clear, we are intensely focused on helping clients achieve their investment objectives. And we built the entire firm with this notion in mind, the single focus on helping clients meet their needs. And so as you imagine, the investments that we make in the business are designed to position us ahead of client demand. And over the past decade, we\u2019ve continued to expand the comprehensive range of capabilities, which has resulted in a very broad and deep set of active, passive and alternative strategies. An example of this would be if you take a look at our factor investing capabilities, we have over $200 billion in factor capabilities and have 40 years of experience. It is a real strong part of the organization and continues to grow, and we expect that in the years to come. We also have focused on enhancing our client experience. And Jemstep is an example of that, which is our digital advice platform for advisers. The demand for the Jemstep application continues to be very strong and robust. And it\u2019s really our ability to draw on our comprehensive range of capabilities to provide solutions for our clients, which really differentiates Invesco in the marketplace and positions us for long-term growth. Turning to the Guggenheim acquisition, the ETF business from Guggenheim, it really strengthens Invesco\u2019s global ETF platform while also accelerating our growth in the quarters and years ahead. I would like to highlight a few of the elements of that on Page 12. The acquisition will expand the depth and breadth of Invesco\u2019s traditional and smart beta ETFs and further diversifying our offering while firmly placing us as the number two smart beta provider in the United States. We\u2019ll also provide additional scale that will strengthen our competitive position in the U.S. while enhancing our relevance in the growing ETF business marketplace globally. Lastly, the acquisition brings scale benefits that will begin from our existing platform in investments, distributions and operations, and the addition will also build upon the momentum in the ETF business to help drive further financial performance for Invesco. With that as a backdrop, I\u2019m going to turn it over to Dan, and Dan is going to talk about our positioning and how Guggenheim\u2019s ETF business will enhance that as we go forward. Dan? Dan Draper : Thank you, Marty. As we\u2019ve reviewed possible ETF acquisitions in the past, the Guggenheim ETF business has always stood out to us as a really complementary to Invesco, something that\u2019s been of interest to us for some time. So I think if you look at the business today and the ability to help us continue this global growth that Marty\u2019s talked about, the current franchise with Guggenheim\u2019s ETF business is about $37.3 billion in assets under management. About 60% of that crucially for us is in the smart beta product suite, which I\u2019ll go through in some more detail in a couple of further slides. Overall, they have 79 ETFs on the platform and their top five flagship products will help about half of those assets. If you look across their ability to help us, as Marty mentioned, really to continue to build out our solutions capability. This acquisition brings us multi-asset class ETF capability across equities, fixed income and alternatives. Also looking at kind of pricing and margin, very much in line with \u2013 especially in the smart beta space. If you look at the performance of the products, very strong performance. Around three quarters of their ETFs have Morningstar ratings of 3 or higher. And then I think also you just look at a very strong organic track record on the platform seeing the compound annual growth rate of 26.5% over the past five years. And also, we continue to currently see good flows. We had net inflows across the platform since we announced the transaction a few weeks ago. If you\u2019re following on the presentation, moving to Slide 14, this is really where the addition and I\u2019ll get into some of the additional products where a lot of the synergies come in. So if you look at Invesco\u2019s global ETF platform, with a high focus we have on smart beta and factor investing, this is really where Guggenheim has had one of the flagship ETF products in smart beta for a number of years, and that\u2019s the S&P 500 Equal Weight. So again, this will give us a leadership position in that category. Equal Weight is one of the simplest but, quite openly, one of the most effective smart beta strategies. And we\u2019ve been very interested in getting this S&P 500 Equal Weight exposure really for quite some time, but additional licenses were not available, therefore, this is going to be, we think, very, very complementary. Alongside equal weighting, we are also going to have the pure style ETFs, which again very complementary to our factor capabilities. And then we think in fixed income where today PowerShares offers the third most fixed income ETFs in the industry, the BulletShares is extremely important to us. These are defined maturity products, and they also are able to utilize self-indexing. And we want to continue that, but also leadership positions where we\u2019ve been first to market in fixed income areas like senior bank loan and others. We believe this is going to be extremely powerful and allow the ETF business at Invesco to partner even closer to Invesco\u2019s fixed income team. Also, you have additional leading CurrencyShares product that are listed there. If we move ahead to Slide 15, again, we feel that this acquisition is going to be very, very strong for us to leverage at Invesco. Particularly a number of key factors that we think where we can actually help accelerate the already fast growth of the Guggenheim ETF franchise, notably looking at our distribution capabilities really around the world that Invesco is able to offer. Also, Marty had mentioned the solutions capability, which is one of Invesco\u2019s biggest organic growth focuses at the moment, our ability to bring additional capabilities, customized solutions, particularly in the form of model portfolios, we really feel like these Guggenheim products will fit in very well there. Also, Invesco\u2019s very well-known consulting business, the ability to educate clients again around asset allocation and the utilization of important vehicles like ETFs. And increasingly, as we have more of those clients really looking to access our solutions digitally, this is where again we see a lot of potential synergies through these new ETFs through our Jemstep platform. Overall, we continue to see the very strong secular growth in fixed income ETFs. We believe that many investors who previously didn\u2019t really look at ETFs, particularly in some institutional segments, are really starting to see the benefit of the wrap [ph], or the ability to have a single ticker, a single icing solution for rebalancing a portfolio with individual bonds. And in particular, we think again having the maturity defined, our BulletShares line up to be much, much better for us to be able to engage with those types of clients. Also looking at the ability to manage the total cost of an ETF, we believe bringing our world-class capabilities and capital markets, working with a lot of sell-side firms, but again we\u2019re going to be able to bring that value through the acquisition. And overall, if you just look at the four years of factor experience that Invesco\u2019s built, and then also the 15 years of experience, particularly in smart beta ETFs, again we see this as extremely complementary in terms of the acquisition. Looking ahead to Slide 16, I just wanted to emphasize here. We continue to talk about the real importance of first mover advantage in the ETF space. And here\u2019s just a quick lineup of really where the PowerShares business has been of the pioneer in getting first to market across some really important categories, including our senior bank loan ETF, looking at low volatility, bringing the FTSE RAFI range into market over a decade ago, sovereign debt, looking at high-dividend, low-volatility alternative areas like commodities, looking at innovations like variable-rate preferred, and et cetera. So I think for us to have this strong track record and layering in a lot of the pioneering ETFs such as the S&P 500 Equal Weight from Guggenheim, I think it just demonstrates I think the type of innovation that we\u2019ve built and really what now Guggenheim is going to add even more to that. I think more demonstration is showing the $25 billion of net assets that we\u2019ve actually raised from new products since 2011, which is the third highest in the industry. So I think the ability for us to continue to build going forward and really add innovation to clients is going to be a crucial synergy in this ETF. We also continue to believe that the barriers to entry, while they may be low, we do think the barriers to success remain very, very high. Having first mover advantage, having legacy, having track record as well as a very strong brand, we believe are absolutely crucial to investors. And as I point out on Slide 17, you can see that since 2010 or I should say 98% of the U.S. ETF industry\u2019s AUM does belong to issuers who entered the market in 2010 or before. On a comparable metric, 96% of industry flows over the past 12 months also have gone to issuers who\u2019ve been in the market since at least 2010. And then as we go to our targeted segment area, which is smart beta, you see a very, very similar story where 94% of the smart beta ETF AUM again belongs to issuers with track records in 2010 or prior and again net flows of 74% over the same time period. And as you move to Slide 18, I think it really shows again our core focus around smart beta and factors, and this acquisition is going to help us increase \u2013 incrementally increase our market position there by 46% and can actually \u2013 puts us just under 20% of market share in smart beta. But importantly, having the largest number of products in that category with the longest track record of being able to offer again multi-asset class solutions, equities, fixed income alternatives, 70% of those ETFs having more than a five years worth of track record that we believe positions very well for growth in this really fast-moving smart beta segment. So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Loren Starr who\u2019s going to highlight the operating results for the quarter. Loren? Loren Starr : Thank you very much, Dan. So quarter-over-quarter, you\u2019ll see that our total AUM increased 59.2 billion or 6.9% and that was driven by the acquisition of Source ETF, which added 26 billion, including approximately 18 billion of Source-managed AUM and 8 billion of externally managed AUM. We also benefited from market gains of 15 billion. We had long-term net inflows of 6.3 billion, positive FX translation of 6.7 billion and inflows into our money markets capability of 5.4 billion. And these factors were somewhat offset by a small outflow from the QQQs of 0.2 billion. Average AUM for the third quarter was 890.8 billion, up 4.9% versus the second quarter. And our annualized long-term organic growth rate in Q3 came in at 3.4% compared to negative 0.3 in the second quarter. Before turning to net revenue yield, I just wanted to highlight one quick update on a change this quarter and how our long-term inflows are being reported. In previous periods, any dividends or capital gains that were reinvested in the funds were included in market gains and losses line item. So beginning in the third quarter and for future periods, these flows will now be included within our long-term inflows to conform Invesco\u2019s flow reporting with general industry practices. As you also note from the footnote on Slide 20, the amount included in the long-term inflows related to this particular item was 1.1 billion. So let\u2019s now next turn to the net revenue yield analysis. You\u2019ll see that our net revenue yield came in at 43.9 basis points and our net revenue yield, excluding performance fees, was 41.9 basis points. That was an increase of 0.1 basis points over the second quarter. Now looking at what the causes were, we had sold one additional day in Q3 that added 0.4 basis points and we also saw the positive impact of FX and mix added 0.2 basis points. So these positive factors are within somewhat offset by the dilutive impact of the Source ETF business, as we discussed in last quarter, which reduced our yield by 0.4 basis points. And we also saw a decrease in other revenues which reduced the yield by 0.1 basis points. So next on Slide 21 is our U.S. GAAP presentation. My comments today, however, are going to focus exclusively on the variances related to our non-GAAP presentation adjusted measures, which are found on Slide 22. Net revenues increased by 70.3 million or 7.8% quarter-over-quarter to 976.6 million, which included a positive FX rate impact of 13.4 million. Within that net revenue number, you\u2019ll see that our adjusted investment management fees decreased by 54 million or 5.3% to 1.08 billion, and that reflects our average \u2013 higher average AUM, an additional day during Q3 as well as incremental management fees from the acquisition of Source. Foreign exchange increased our adjusted investment management fees by 16.2 million. Adjusted service and distribution revenues increased by 6.3 million or 3%, reflecting higher average AUM in the quarter and FX increased our adjusted service and distribution revenues by 0.5 million. Our adjusted performance fees came in at a much higher level, obviously, 43.3 million in Q3. And they were earned by a variety of investment capabilities, but most notably 37 million from Invesco\u2019s mortgage recovery fund. Our FX increased adjusted performance fees by 0.2 million in the quarter. The adjusted other revenues in the third quarter were 16.7 million and that was a decrease of 0.6 million from the prior quarter. FX impact on adjusted other revenues was 0.2 million positive. And next, third-party distribution service and advisory expense which we net against gross revenues, that increased by 14.7 million or 4% and that\u2019s consistent with increased revenues derived from the related retail AUM and the additional day in the quarter. FX increased our adjusted third-party distribution service and advisory expenses by 3.7 million. Now let\u2019s move to expenses. As you move down the slide, you\u2019ll see that adjusted operating expenses at 579.2 million increased 29.4 million or 5.3% relative to Q2. FX increased our adjusted operating expenses by 7.3 million during the quarter. The adjusted employee compensation came in at 383.9 million. That was an increase of 23.3 million or 6.5%. And this was driven by higher variable compensation, primarily related to performance fees and as well a 5.5 million non-cash charge related to the company\u2019s UK defined-benefit plan. FX increased adjusted employee compensation by 5 million. The adjusted marketing expenses in Q3 increased slightly by 0.4 million, 1.3% up to 30.1 million in line with the guidance that we provided last quarter. FX increased our adjusted marketing expense by 0.5 million. The adjusted property, office and tech expenses came in at 93.7 million. That was an increase of 5 million or 5.6% over the second quarter and this reflected increased depreciation cost on long-term technology projects that were recently brought into service. FX increased the adjusted property, office and tech expenses by 0.9 million. Next on to G&A, the adjusted G&A expense came in at 71.5 million. That was an increase of 0.7 million or 1% up, in line with the guidance that we provided last quarter. FX increased G&A by 0.9 million. And then going on down the page, you\u2019ll see that our adjusted non-operating income increased 1.5 million compared to Q2 and that was driven by increases in earnings from our real estate investments that was somewhat offset by lower earnings from our private equity investment. And then moving to tax, the tax rate, effective tax rate on pre-tax adjusted net income in Q3 came in at 27.6%, a little bit higher than guidance. We do believe going forward that our tax rate should drop to again roughly 27%. That brings us to our adjusted EPS of $0.71 and adjusted net operating margin of 40.7%. So let me just quickly touch on business optimization. This is an ongoing multiyear kind of effort. As you\u2019ve heard, given the opportunity on a number of initiatives, including those around outsourcing or back office functions, we expect the optimization work to actually exceed our original target for run rate savings. We\u2019ve achieved the run rate savings in Q3 of 38 million and we expect to deliver an additional savings by the end of 2018 of a total run rate savings of about 65 million, which is up. And then finally, because I know we\u2019ll get questions, we\u2019ll just address it. Quarter-to-date, net flows through October roughly flat. We do continue to see very strong net inflows from Europe as well as from Asia Pacific. These were somewhat offset by outflows in the U.S. on the institutional side, largely quant, as well as some sub-advised U.S. retail early days, October we are obviously feeling very good about the flow picture. Marty had mentioned the robust pipeline. So again, we think the trend is going to continue. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Marty. Marty Flanagan : Operator, so we\u2019ll open up to Q&A please. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Mr. Brennan Hawken from UBS. Sir, your line is open. Brennan Hawken : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Wondering if you could maybe comment on an updated view on the impact, base it [ph] given the adjustment in applying via for the RPAs. And I know it\u2019s really, really short notice, but we did get a no action letter out of the SEC this morning. Do you have any early reads on that and what kind of relief that might apply? Marty Flanagan : This is Marty. I\u2019ll make a couple of comments and Loren can chime in. So it clearly is a moving target at the moment. We know where the end state is going to be. So from our perspective in Europe, the financial impact would be very manageable. The U.S., the early read is it looks like it\u2019s contained a MiFID topic to Europe, but that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a 30-month review so we\u2019ll have to see what happens there. But I take it back to a bigger topic. I mean it is an industry topic. I do think that the notion of paying attention to impact on capital markets has been missed in Europe. This will have a negative impact clearly on liquidity around small cap stocks, mid cap stocks, which is not a good thing. So hopefully, the U.S. will think of capital market impact and capital formation around this topic. And I\u2019d also say what it does is firms like us, we\u2019re financially very strong. We have 700 analysts throughout the world. We have every resource necessary to ensure that our analysts have everything they need. It will continue to put firms like us in a competitive advantage to smaller firms. It\u2019s just a real challenge, the onslaught of ongoing regulatory costs and cyber costs, et cetera, et cetera, on smaller firms. So as this evolves, again firms like us will just end up in a competitively stronger position. Loren? Loren Starr : Yes. In terms of quantifying, I think it\u2019s a very much moving target in terms of what the impact is. I think we\u2019ve sort of indicated it was not material, maybe tens of millions kind of without negotiations really taking place around the pricing. All that is sort of happening as we speak and therefore you\u2019ll have a clear view as we sort of get into 2018. But I do think even as we get through 2018, it\u2019s going to be a moving target because there is no expectation of setting sort of one price in the last \u2013 it\u2019s locked in. I think it\u2019s going to be an evolving topic over time. Brennan Hawken : Sure. That\u2019s all very fair. And then for follow-up, you made reference to the fact that this is going to of course disadvantage some of the smaller firms in Europe. I guess, do you think that\u2019s going to lead to opportunities for acquisitions as you see some of the smaller firms come under more and more pressure? And also more broadly, after \u2013 now that you\u2019ve completed two smart beta ETF deals, should we assume that you would have continued appetite in that space, or do you feel as though you\u2019re satiated at this point? Thanks. Marty Flanagan : I think I\u2019d answer the question this way. Our strategy continues to be no different than in the past. And our first effort organically \u2013 is to focus organically in organic investments. And we would then approach inorganically when we see an opportunity or a gap somewhere in the lineup. We see very few gaps within the organization right now regardless of investment capability or some of these platforms. The last two ETF acquisitions really put us in a very, very strong spot in the ETF market. And in particular, the factor and smart beta where we think there is the greatest value for clients at the end of the day. Look, we all have been talking about the impact of the changing dynamic. It is just the fact that if you are a smaller money manager anywhere in the world, you have pressures that are at a level that you\u2019ve never seen before and common sense would lead you to believe that there should be more combinations. They continue to be complicated to do because the fiduciary nature of the businesses and the people that are involved, et cetera, et cetera. So there will be more. The pace has probably been slower than what people have thought. But you could also see quite frankly organic growth for the more competitive firms pick up at the expense of smaller firms, quite frankly. Brennan Hawken : That\u2019s fair and helpful color. Thanks, Marty. Marty Flanagan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Bill Katz from Citigroup. Sir, your line is open. You may begin. Bill Katz : Okay. Thanks very much. I did join a few minutes late. It\u2019s been a busy morning, so I apologize if this is redundant. Loren, I was wondering if you could tie together your commentary that you\u2019re running a little bit ahead on the optimization with the pro forma impact of the margin contribution from Guggenheim investment spend MiFID and all that. How are you sort of thinking about the incremental margin both for '18 and '19 versus where we were at this time last quarter? Loren Starr : Good question, Bill. So we certainly had indicated on the last call that the Guggenheim impact itself was probably going to add 10 percentage points to our incremental margin. That\u2019s a very positive thing to the original guidance that we provided, which was in that 40% to 50% range. We\u2019ve also benefited from stronger markets, which has been helpful. Foreign exchange has generally been a positive impact as well. The MiFID II quantification, as I mentioned, is a moving target. And so at this point, I think we\u2019d be hesitant to sort of give real numbers around that. If we gave you the worst case, it would be probably a reasonable offset to some of the good things we were just talking about. We\u2019re hopeful that\u2019s not going to be that case. So our thought is that we\u2019d be in a better position as we get into year-end and maybe the next call or the one after that to provide much more solid guidance around incremental margins. But I\u2019d say the overall trend to incremental margin has been more positive than negative for sure relative to that original guidance. Bill Katz : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just a little surprised by your flow commentary for the quarter. Could you maybe peel that back a little bit and talk a little bit about maybe active versus passive and maybe go around the regions in a little more depth? Some of your peers are seeing a little more robustness and just given your product mix and your repositioning, I would have thought you\u2019d be a little bit better, all else being equal. So where are you seeing the weakness versus some of the strength? Loren Starr : You\u2019re talking about October, right? Bill Katz : Correct. I thought I heard flat quarter-to-date. Loren Starr : Okay, it\u2019s a partial month. So again, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into and I was hesitant to even talk about it. But I knew if I didn\u2019t, people would misread it. We\u2019ve actually seen very good strength into Europe. I think about 1.2 billion of flows just coming into EMEA on a long-term basis. We\u2019ve also seen very solid long-term flows into Asia Pac. So again, where is it coming in Europe, it\u2019s the same elements that have been flowing before well across a wide range Pan-European equity, corporate bond, GTR, all very, very helpful. Institutional pipeline in Europe is the highest it\u2019s been I think ever. And so they\u2019ve had really great success. And so we think that is an accelerating positive thing. Asia again had a little bit of a slow down as we mentioned earlier, but they seem to be sort of recovering from that into the third quarter. The U.S. in particular, we\u2019re just a little bit lumpy. So I talked about sub-advised. So there was one sub-advised termination that was kind of lumpy as one sub-advised client went to index, as we\u2019ve seen that happen a few times. So that\u2019s sort of episodic, not a trend, I would say. And then quant, we\u2019ve seen some outflow on quant in the U.S. but that\u2019s been offset by quant inflows elsewhere. So again, I think it\u2019s really just too soon a timeframe to really draw a conclusion about anything. And so as I said, we\u2019re pretty optimistic about the flow picture into Q4. Bill Katz : Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse. Sir, your line is open. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks. Good morning. Marty Flanagan : Good morning, Craig. Craig Siegenthaler : You guys have completed two acquisitions in a pretty short period of time. I\u2019m just wondering, are you still looking at building scale in the ETF space via M&A? And are there other capabilities you\u2019d like to add, maybe in the technology or alternative space? Marty Flanagan : As I just mentioned a minute ago, we feel that the combination of both Source and Guggenheim put us in a very, very strong spot and we don\u2019t see many gaps. And as Dan talked about, if you look at the number of ETFs that we have and really important the long-term track record really position us quite uniquely. And so the platform is very strong, very robust. And our ability to product development off that in response to client needs is very strong, and it does go back to this heritage of 40 years of factor capability and applying that to some of the work that Dan and the team does in product development. So we don\u2019t see much of a need to continue to participate in that market. If something obvious comes up, we pay attention as we always do, but it doesn\u2019t seem likely from that perspective. I did mention around technology like earlier. Jemstep continues to be \u2013 the demand for the Jemstep product is very, very strong. We will start to see probably impact from the middle of next year because they\u2019re long-duration installations as all applications are. It will be very, very supportive of our solutions business, our model business. And as I\u2019ve said, right now, we would estimate that latter part of next year, we\u2019ll probably be working with 20,000 financial advisers in the United States that we have not before. So that\u2019s the early indication of what\u2019s possible in time. And we continue to invest strongly in technology, things like predictive analytics and big data for our research teams, et cetera, et cetera. So we look at that as more continued evolution of use of technology than anything else. Its core to what we do and we\u2019ll continue to do that. Can I just add Dan? Would you add anything to that? Dan Draper : No, Marty. I think that\u2019s absolutely right. Marty Flanagan : Okay. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks, Marty. And then just as a follow up on pricing, there really hasn\u2019t been much fee pressure across your business as you look at the fee rate this year. And I think a lot of us were concerned that it could be a difficult year for fees, given the DOL rule. How do you think about product pricing? When would you consider reducing pricing? And have you been tweaking breakpoints to some of your products over the last year? Marty Flanagan : Yes. Look, it all starts by why is there not pressure because we\u2019re priced fairly. And I think that\u2019s really the way to think about it. If you are delivering the results that you would expect at a competitive rate, you\u2019re going to do well. And I think the way to think about it is just sort of imagine a continuum of investment capabilities and at one end, you have cap-weighted indexes. You don\u2019t get very much formed. They\u2019re an important tool in the toolbox, but you don\u2019t pay much. By definition, there\u2019s no alpha generation. If you go to actives, you\u2019re going to expect more alpha in outperformance. The fees will follow that and they would be higher than that end. In between the two would be factor and at the highest in alternatives. And so it makes sense that the more alpha you expect, the more you would be willing to pay a fair fee and that\u2019s how we think about pricing as an institution. And I think it resonates with clients. But it is just clarity of what clients are trying to expect and any firm\u2019s ability to meet that performance result over a market cycle, which is very important. Craig Siegenthaler : Thank you, guys. Thanks, Marty. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is open. Glenn Schorr : Thanks. Marty Flanagan : Hi, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Hello. A further question on the Guggenheim side. So I get and like the BulletShares, the pure style of the current ETFs and a lot of those products. And it\u2019s just a question on pricing on the Equal Weight side. Plenty of people that feel like it\u2019s not a race to actually zero, but that there\u2019s constant price pressure on that side. So I\u2019m just curious on how you get comfortable with the recent price adjustment as the right price for now. And I\u2019ll ask a follow-up, if I could. Marty Flanagan : Dan, you want to take that? Dan Draper : Yes, sure. Just to state upfront that obviously the two businesses as they\u2019re under regulatory review continue to operate separately. So kind of any pricing discussion adjustment on the Guggenheim side, that\u2019s really done by \u2013 there\u2019s executives in their fund board. So we\u2019re not involved in that at this stage. But that said, if you look since the price adjustment was made in our SP, which is that ETF you mentioned, there has been a positive response in net inflows into the product. But I\u2019d say overall, if you\u2019re thinking about \u201cpricing,\u201d we feel very strongly that you have to think about pricing in a broader context. Number one, outside of pricing is performance. Particularly more sophisticated, if you will, institutionalize clients always start with performance. And while indexes or ETFs may sound similar, quite openly, the actual difference is that in index construction methodology, rebalancing can lead to substantial differences. So as we always do with clients, we start with performance first. Secondly then when you get to cost, there are a couple of different areas of cost. First, move really to the entry and exit cost of an ETF i.e. liquidity and being able to work with our sell-side partners to make sure there\u2019s a lot of liquidity. And I think that\u2019s where the first mover advantage, the scale, everything we\u2019ve emphasized is crucial because you really \u2013 it take time to build the ecosystem. And as the AUM grows, the liquidity becomes really enhanced. When I think third, the other area of cost is obviously the annual management fee. And I think this is where \u2013 not just within ETFs but across Invesco, we\u2019re very diligent, always monitoring trends and making adjustments where possible. So I think looking at in total, that\u2019s where the ability for us with especially those clients who look at asset allocation, look at solution, those diversification benefits we have in the products around performance and risk, this is where we\u2019re excited. And then I think we also feel we\u2019re going to bring a little bit of enhancement we hope around capital markets and the liquidity, and then clearly we\u2019ll continue to monitor pricing. But right now we think we\u2019re in a good place and we\u2019re obviously excited, especially with the adjustment in the Equal Weight S&P 500 to really see a positive response from clients thus far. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate that. Another quickie on the equity side, it could be a super short timeframe, but if I did the math right, it feels like equities might have flipped back into inflows in September for the first time in a long time. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the great performance at equity income. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s something we can count on, but curious your thoughts on the equity side. Loren Starr : Glenn, I think you\u2019re probably picking up something that we are seeing, which is certainly a continued interest in a fair amount of our equity. If you\u2019re talking about in the U.S., it\u2019s probably going to be more on the PowerShares side than necessarily our value capability. And then in Europe, absolutely the case and we\u2019re also seeing that in Asia as well. So I think the interest in equity seem a little bit stronger globally and perhaps most in terms of the active most strong outside the U.S. Marty Flanagan : Glenn, I would just add. You\u2019re hitting on a specific topic, but there\u2019s something broader here. So it has been a very unique period of time since 2009, and we feel very strongly that this is a very important role for active investment management. Clients cannot hit the return objectives and manage their risk without the use of active, and it\u2019s really a combination of passive, active and alternative. That\u2019s how you create the best portfolios in these markets when it starts to turn like that, hopefully people will pay attention to it. Glenn Schorr : All right. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Michael Carrier from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sir, your line is open. Michael Carrier : Thanks, guys. Good morning. When I look at Asia and Europe, you pretty consistently have had healthy growth in those markets. In the U.S. obviously, it\u2019s been more challenging. When I look out over the next couple of years given what you\u2019re doing on the ETF side, on the technology side, it seems like the retail part of the market you should have more momentum. So I just wanted to kind of get your take on how much can that offset some of the core industry pressures that we\u2019re seeing going from active to passive. And then in the institutional side, it seems like it\u2019s still been healthy, a little bit spotty from time to time but just where you\u2019re seeing demand from the U.S. institutions across the product offering? Marty Flanagan : Yes. So, look, the U.S. is probably \u2013 market is probably going through the most changes in the retail market in particular. As providers are changing how they\u2019re reforming their businesses, it is a period of change. I think the important thing is the assets to manage are not going to go away. And so it\u2019s a transition period. And it is those firms, we believe we\u2019re one, that have the broad range of capabilities, good performing products and this range of active-passive alternatives, those are the winners. And so we think we are positioned very, very well. What are some of the headwinds that Loren has talked about? So UITs and some of the movements with the insurance company and the sub-advised, those are headwinds in, what do you want to call it, the intermediate term. But we look out in the next year and a half or so, some very strong things are heading our way. And again, we\u2019ve been talking about them. The solutions capability is real. It\u2019s meaningful for us. We\u2019re uniquely placed to be able to do that. Jemstep is an important tool for our distribution partners, is a very important tool along the way. And as Loren started to mention, the institutional capability region by region is probably as strong as it\u2019s ever been and that would include the U.S. The U.S. is probably behind Asia and Europe in its development for us. We feel very good about the team there. And the same thing we\u2019re seeing in one but not funded is growing quite materially. So we look at the U.S. as a very important part of our business and the opportunities are material, and we think we\u2019re managing to where we see the client needs are. Loren Starr : Yes. And in terms of the U.S. clients, I think it\u2019s around the normal things we\u2019ve seen in the past. Real estate would be a big continued draw. We certainly see continued interest in some of our fixed income capabilities including stable value, multi-asset capabilities as well and then increasingly GTR-type offering has been of interest. So it\u2019s certainly a third \u2013 at least a minimum, a third of our pipeline is coming from the U.S. and the rest from Europe and Asia. Michael Carrier : Okay. And then just \u2013 Loren, just a quick follow up on the P&L. So just anything \u2013 it seemed like the expense lines were fairly normal, ex-comp because of performance fees and then just the performance fee outlook. I guess just given which products have performance fees and given how strong the backdrop\u2019s been, any indication just going forward in terms of what to expect or any nuances whether it\u2019s fourth quarter or going into '18. Loren Starr : Mike, you know how good I am at forecasting performance fees. So yes, I think the performance has been quite good on the alternative side. The idea that we may continue to see some good performance fees into 2018 is something we would certainly support and offer up. In terms of the actual guidance and when they hit, very, very hard for us to really nail that down. I think obviously this one very large performance fee coming from the mortgage recovery fund I\u2019d say is a little bit unique and unusual and isn\u2019t something that I would necessarily say is going to happen again with certainty into 2018. But real estate bank loans continue to offer performance fees, as does some of the private equity offerings that we have as well. So I think the level of performance fees maybe ex what we\u2019ve seen in this particular mortgage recovery is certainly something you should build into the thinking for next year. And into Q4, again, I just don\u2019t have a line of sight that I can offer with great certainty other than sort of \u2013 I think we said 5 million to 7 million is kind of the guidance. And I know it\u2019s not helpful, but that\u2019s what I would offer again for Q4. Marty Flanagan : And I just might come back to your bigger questions and put in context of beyond a quarter. If you go back \u2013 as a firm, we\u2019ve been in net inflows since 2009 in total. And if you look at the strength of the organization by \u2013 if you look at flows by region, it has always rotated. 2009 UK was a leader; '10, '11, '12, the U.S. was the leader; '14, '15 Europe was; last year, Asia; back to Europe. It\u2019s a fundamental strength of the firm and you\u2019re starting to see it now with the organic growth rate above 3. And again if the market sort of \u2013 without a shock to the market, we anticipate \u2013 we see it growing and so you\u2019re seeing evidence of it this quarter. Michael Carrier : That\u2019s helpful. All right, thanks a lot. Marty Flanagan : Thank you, Michael. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Sir, your line is open. Ken Worthington : Hi. Good morning. My question\u2019s on ETF distribution. So can you talk about your expectations for how ETF distribution evolves and maybe how access to ETF distribution evolves, particularly in the U.S. and Europe? It\u2019s been sort of interesting to see Vanguard eliminated from a number of platforms, based seemly due to its unwillingness to pay platform fees. So talk about the evolution of payment for shelf space in ETFs, either directly or indirectly in the context of DOL rules, RDR, MiFID, so a lot of rule changes. And is there any extent to which having an active platform really helps secure or maybe even subsidizes distribution for ETFs. Thanks. Marty Flanagan : Let me take the last part of the question and then maybe Dan can pick up and Loren. So our basic view has not changed, right? We really believe strongly what are clients looking for and think of intermediary clients, whether it be a distribution platform or a consultant or a large institution around the world. A firm that has a depth of capabilities is much more attractive to those firms because it\u2019s easier to work with firms that way and the more you can get from firms like ourselves, whether it be thought leadership or a client experience that\u2019s differentiated. And so where that takes you is there\u2019s no question in my mind that as the business evolves, those firms that have a range of active, passive and alternatives are uniquely placed, and it does reinforce the ongoing success \u2013 distribution success of an organization. But Dan, do you want to pick up on your thoughts maybe on the ETF revolving landscape distribution? Dan Draper : Yes. Thank you very much, Marty. I think it\u2019s a great question. Let me just start from the top. I think if you look at kind of global regulations whether it\u2019s DOL, MiFID II in Europe, you previously had retail distribution review in the UK, I think all of those have clearly been net positives for ETFs for different reasons. As you look at distribution, I think it\u2019s really important to kind of separate out the U.S. market from, say, Europe and EMEA. In particular, the U.S. is heavily and always has been dominated by the wealth management intermediary space, particularly areas like RIAs. But what we\u2019ve now seen is with DOL in particular in the U.S., the stronger focus by many segments like the Wirehouses, for example, as the focus on more advisory accounts, fee-based moving there, and I think that\u2019s where Invesco\u2019s long-standing strength covering those clients, those home offices and having access, I think the ability to educate, position our products in those areas as more advisory business grows, not just wires but IBDs and other areas that we see. That\u2019s a huge advantage to be able to leverage those long-term relationships. I think overall in the U.S, we continue to see, as Marty said, the portfolio of model builders and others in this new fee-based world really focused on combining the best of active, passive and alternatives. So there\u2019s a huge amount to leverage and I think that we\u2019re obviously in the midst of adapting and working on that way at Invesco. If you move to Europe, Europe is very different. Europe, I would estimate probably has over 80% of the current demand for ETFs in institutional space. Now by definition, we would include discretionary portfolios to private banks in that institutional definition, but that\u2019s why scale is absolutely crucial in Europe. You have yet to see broad-based retail demand emerge for ETFs in Europe. I think MiFID II, quite clearly, with a lot of the focus on transparency of fees, but particularly for ETFs. ETFs were actually omitted from the original MiFID. By including ETFs, this is actually a big advantage. You\u2019re actually going to have \u2013 the requirement now for market makers to have pre and post-trade reporting, for example, of ETFs. So a lot more transparency around the liquidity, which is an important building block step to eventually getting bigger retail demand in Europe. So we think that\u2019s positive, but I think that\u2019s where the crucial step for us to buy Source to really get the bigger platform, because these bigger institutional investors in Europe, they have concentration limits normally. They need to have bigger ETFs, bigger platform, bigger scale before they can engage with the provider. So hopefully that helps with that overview. Ken Worthington : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is open. Alex Blostein : Great. Hi. Good morning, everybody. Marty, question for you guys around Jemstep. It seems like it remains a pretty big source of investments for you guys. You increased headcount there substantially, and Guggenheim I guess is supposed to further kind of enhance growth profile there. Can you help us better understand and really kind of track the progress you guys are making in that platform? I heard you say earlier 20,000 FAs and that\u2019s obviously a lot of access but anything with respect to assets that those FAs have that could come onto the platform, what percentage of those you hope to get Invesco product in and where that could go sort of over time, and when the platform is ultimately supposed to break profitability? It seems like an important element here without a ton of color yet. Marty Flanagan : We\u2019ve not colored it yet on purpose. So as we\u2019re moving through this from the standpoint of \u2013 again, the demand is very high. We are taking on clients. We, as an organization, do a much better job of telling you what the answers are as opposed to predicting, but here\u2019s what\u2019s happening. So you\u2019re seeing a pipeline that is growing and very strong and the challenge is the lead time. It\u2019s application install. So I think six months to nine months for a large institution, that\u2019s the tail. So you have to invest to get \u2013 to have the application come on line. It is open platform and can use a range of capabilities, ETFs for mutual funds. So it is a very attractive part of a digital strategy for a number of firms. And secondarily, it will be default models in those portfolios. And our \u2013 what we are seeing is more likely than not if you think of the relative market share of a firm like Invesco\u2019s model that a existing platform versus what could happen out of Jemstep, you could see materially different asset levels or market share of models on those portfolios. So we are anticipating an Investor Day first part of next year that we will give a much deeper communication of the strategy and where we are. Alex Blostein : Got it. Thanks for that. And then just wondering if you guys could give a bit of an update on GTR and sort of where things stand there? Obviously it\u2019s been a big growth initiative that could drive outflows for you guys outside the U.S. I think in the U.S., things have been a little bit slower. I think the product has a three-year track record right now, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been a big contributor to flows just yet. So maybe just speak to the reception and different channels to the product, what\u2019s sort of been the hurdles and what do you guys need to see to accelerate growth of GTR in the U.S.? Thanks. Loren Starr : Yes, we\u2019ve seen GTR really grow much more rapidly outside the U.S. than in the U.S. right now. Although I\u2019d say on the institutional side it\u2019s beginning to get rated and so we\u2019re actually quite hopeful that we\u2019re going to see growth maybe on the institutional side even faster than the retail side in the U.S. The take on has been extremely robust, as you know, over the last year and plus. We are in the midst of launching new product GTI, which is the income-oriented flavor of GTR in the UK and that\u2019s a fair amount of marketing is going to be put behind that effort in Q4, and we\u2019d expect to see some takeoff if the performance has been good. Asia has really been the door that has opened much wider now in terms of using GTR and we\u2019re seeing some big wins in places like Australia and China in terms of the use of GTR. On the retail side, I think the story around GTR is still excellent, but it\u2019s not probably as well known or understood as it is in the UK. And I think generally, we\u2019re seeing the product get through kind of the gatekeepers and get a better understanding of that, but it\u2019s still been slow, which has generally been the case I\u2019d say for alternative offerings in retail that we\u2019ve seen sort of a slowdown of the take-on of the alternative retail product. And so I think that\u2019s somewhat consistent with an overall theme in the U.S. as opposed to a GTR-specific story. Marty Flanagan : And I think the reason for that is by twofold. Some of the headwinds would\u2019ve been \u2013 what is the derivatives\u2019 role, what was the impact on a product like that. So the platforms were very cautious and slow to take it on. That was one of the headwinds. And then secondarily most of the platforms are focused on product rationalization at the moment, not product additions. And so again two basic headwinds that are somewhat intertwined there. But again, we think it\u2019s a very, very strong good capability and we anticipate in time we\u2019ll continue to have success in the United States too. Alex Blostein : Makes sense, great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Sir your line is open. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Can you talk about the early traction with Source and kind of what they contributed to flows? I know it was a link close for partial quarter. And then I guess from an integration perspective, can you talk about what you\u2019re doing with distribution with the three brands now and how we should think about the sales effort? How that might change? Loren Starr : Dan, do you want me to \u2013 Draper, do you want me to handle the flow part and then you can talk a little bit on the other aspect? Dan Draper : Yes, that\u2019s great. Loren Starr : Okay. So in terms of flows, it\u2019s been good, probably not off the charts good. I think they contributed about 0.5 billion in the last two months, which is about a 12% organic growth rate. I think there has been some degree of slowdown just as the integration has been going forward and the repositioning of the brand and so forth is being contemplated. There are a number of new product launches that are in the pipeline, which I think will help really sort of reboot the growth and the efforts there. So there\u2019s a lot of work that\u2019s being done right now to sort of improve the competitive positioning of the products and the lineup and really sort of accelerate the growth opportunity around Source. And certainly, some of the synergies that we haven\u2019t explicitly been talking about have taken place. And so I think in terms of the profitability of the business, as we originally said it wasn\u2019t really making money, is beginning to sort of all come into play in a positive way. So Dan, I don\u2019t know if you want to get a little more explicit about kind of some of the things that are happening around repositioning of the brand overall on a global basis. Dan Draper : Yes. So I think just to state upfront, I think clearly the intention, Invesco has one ETF business and I think it\u2019s going to be reflected through one brand. Guggenheim, for example, they\u2019re clearly \u2013 Guggenheim Asset Management will remain in mutual funds. UIT is another area. So that\u2019s probably the most apparent. So they\u2019re clearly keeping that name for the overall business. So you\u2019ll probably see a little bit more of a rapid transition. But again, we have kind of a longer lead time to closing into next year on that. The Source, obviously a strong brand within this space, but again we\u2019re in the middle of transitioning that into 2018. They\u2019re currently co-branded having Source and PowerShares. But again, you\u2019ll see a single brand emerge from that in 2018. I think, overall, looking at how Source, the integration, and Source actually had quite a strong pipeline even going into the sales process. So they continue to execute well, as Loren mentioned, net inflows since we announced and closed the deal on August 18, and those flows are fairly well diversified, commodities have been strong for them this year, picking up equities. What we really have been focused on is on product development. That\u2019s where the product development pipeline in Europe had slowed a bit during the sales process with Source. And particularly looking at fixed income, and we also launched our first joint \u2013 or not joint, but the first product since the close a couple of weeks ago in preferreds. There was no preferred offering and we were able to take kind of our U.S. capability and launch it in the usage fund in Europe, and that\u2019s gotten off to a really good start. I think you\u2019ll see us continue to fill up the new product pipeline with fixed income being a headline. So I think really continuing the momentum that Source has built with clients in Europe, I think getting more products to those clients is a big priority and then just continual integration in larger Invesco in EMEA. Dan Fannon : Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then Loren, can you \u2013 just looking at the balance sheet and thinking about capital return from a buyback perspective, as you look into 2018, how should we think about capital return? Loren Starr : Dan, thanks for asking that question. Again, I think as we described related to the Guggenheim acquisition and similar to what we\u2019ve done with respect to financing the Source acquisition, we\u2019ve curtailed the buyback program as we are building up cash right now in order to largely pay for the acquisition through the use of our credit facility and also through spare cash. So our thought is through the course of 2018, we\u2019re going to curtail the buyback \u2013 continue to curtail the buyback, still being opportunistic if certain situations present themselves. But largely, we want to make sure that our leverage ratios are going to be, by the end of 2018, in line with where they are pre-Guggenheim acquisition. So I would say, generally, put in minimal, if any, in terms of buyback expectations through the course of 2018 until those leverage ratios get back in line. Dan Fannon : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks very much. A question for Loren in the short term and then a longer one for Marty. Just on the fourth quarter, Loren, I might have missed some of these. But did you give \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you gave color on the non-comp expense outlook for 4Q? And then also what your overall fee \u2013 your core free rate, ex-performance fees, would be with a full quarter of Source? And then also just on \u2013 I appreciate the 1 billion of dividend inclusion into the total flows, but fourth quarter can be seasonally higher in that. I don\u2019t know if you have an -- Loren Starr : All right. So the last part of your question I didn\u2019t quite get the full thing. Let me get the first parts and then you can just clarify the last one. So in terms of the guidance, I think we\u2019re roughly in line with what we provided before. The only sort of deviation in guidance this quarter relative to last quarter was with respect to compensation, which was really due to the some of the outsized performance fees. So I think we originally said around 370, and so that\u2019s roughly kind of where we would expect. All the other elements are in line with what we prior guided, which again was, if you need it was, adjusted marketing was 36 to 38. We provided guidance on the adjusted property, office and tech of 92 to 94 and then G&A was in the range of 70 to 73. So all that is kind of roughly in line, barring some FX and other things, right, which obviously have a little bit of a inflation factor on those levels. So that was kind of your first question. Could you just make sure I cover the other two? Brian Bedell : Just the \u2013 for fee rate now that we have the full quarter of Source for the fourth quarter? Loren Starr : Yes. So I think we had said the fee rate was going to \u2013 in the second half was going to be largely in line with the second quarter. Obviously, it\u2019s slightly off. There was more money market and some other sort of passive lower fee product growth coming into play. So I think sort of in line with current levels ex-performance fees is probably the right guidance for now. Brian Bedell : Is it the 41.9 basis point? Loren Starr : Yes, exactly. Brian Bedell : Okay. And then longer-term question for Marty. I guess with the Precidian application and with the SEC sort of getting \u2013 moving a little bit closer, I think Legg commented last night they were a little bit optimistic on that. Always tough to predict what the regulators are going to do. But as \u2013 I guess broader thinking out loud a little bit but more broader, Marty, what\u2019s your view on active non-transparent ETFs? And if that does get approved \u2013 I think PowerShares is included in that application if I\u2019m not mistaken. But if that does get approved, obviously a different angle than the factor-based strategy that you\u2019ve embarked upon. But what would your view be on the potential growth for nontransparent active ETFs longer term for the industry? Marty Flanagan : Yes, I\u2019ll make a comment, but then I\u2019m going to ask Dan because Dan spent more time on it. Look, it\u2019s hard to predict. At one level, you could say \u2013 you can imagine a take-up there. I just point to our experience where the active ETFs that we launched now \u2013 I\u2019m going to lose track of time, maybe eight years ago, there is no traction behind them at all. And so all we can point to is our experience historically. But Dan, why don\u2019t you comment? Dan Draper : Thanks, Marty. So yes, we know Precidian very well. We had \u2013 we were included in an earlier filing. As you are aware, the SEC has asked them previously to kind of remove filings. So there\u2019s been a couple of swings, if you will, at this in the past. We continue to monitor closely and we\u2019ll be \u2013 remain engaged in those discussions. But I don\u2019t think we feel there\u2019s anything that\u2019s going to happen urgently in the development of that space. But clearly, I think \u2013 the ability for Invesco to participate in that if it evolves. One thing I would point out though, that if you do see nontransparent active evolve, you\u2019re still going to have the same kind of financial [ph] situation you have with active today where particularly some strategies are going to be capacity-constrained, because it\u2019s really being driven \u2013 or seeking out for around security selection. So I think that\u2019s where you see the predominance of ETFs really coming more from an asset allocation and particularly the larger products which are much more scalable. So absolutely could there be demand, should we, if you will, technology be approved? Yes, and we\u2019d clearly be participating in that. But I think, again, the big growth in ETFs and the large products that we see continue to be much more asset allocation-focused. But quite frankly, the transparency is much more of a requirement and the ability to go out and build more scalable products, that\u2019s the core of the range. Again, we\u2019ll continue to monitor and engage. But again, at this stage we don\u2019t really see the approval being imminent really in the short term. But again, we\u2019ll remain engaged and I think adjust our business model, if necessary. One thing I would say though is away from just the nontransparent active, we do see as we mentioned in the Guggenheim transactions, self indexing becoming a bigger part of our business. As Marty mentioned, we do active transparent. We obviously work with leading third parties and I think really for us to bring forward the self indexing piece we think is probably a more immediate growth opportunity that we\u2019re excited about. Brian Bedell : Okay, that\u2019s great color. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Chris Shutler from William Blair. Sir, your line is open. Chris Shutler : Hi, guys. Two questions. First on the equal weighted ETFs at Guggenheim. Can you give us a sense of what percentage of those assets today are in the retail or adviser channel relative to institutional? Marty Flanagan : Dan, do you know that? Dan Draper : Yes. I can\u2019t give you a specific number, but I would say a high \u2013 a very high percentage is going to be in what we\u2019d call the wealth management intermediary space, particularly in the hands of RIAs and some of the other platforms, home offices, what have you. But a very high percentage is retail today. Chris Shutler : Okay. And then secondly, a different question. On the UK equity franchise, maybe just talk about \u2013 they have great long-term performance but the one and three-year numbers are challenged. What are you seeing there from a flow standpoint on retail and institutional? I think it\u2019s mainly a retail franchise, but just give us an update there. Thanks. Loren Starr : Chris, it\u2019s actually quite benign. The flow picture is not \u2013 we haven\u2019t seen accelerated outflows at all. Sales may have come down just a bit. But overall, the levels of flows in that product, in those products are as good as they\u2019ve ever been in terms of history. So I think people understand the rationale. Mark Barnett and his team have described their position and why they believe some of the holdings that they have are smart and are going to ultimately pan out. And so they\u2019ve been through periods of underperformance in the past and have gone through that with significant outperformance following it. So I think people are being patient and not sort of reacting on a short-term basis. Chris Shutler : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next one is from Mr. Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is open. Michael Cyprys : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to circle back on some of the investments that you\u2019re making in the business, in particular on the institutional side if you could just update us on that front and how you see that business evolving over the next couple of years in terms of your positioning and some of the initiatives that you\u2019re putting in place? Marty Flanagan : Yes, so a little bit of a repeat. So the way that we look at the business is, first of all, you have to have a set of capabilities that the institutional market wants. And so over the last decade, that has developed very, very strongly; a lot in the alternative area, a lot in the fixed income area, strong performance, strong reputations. So that\u2019s the first critical building block of the whole thing. Now with the leaders that we have in place in each of the three regions, I think they\u2019re some of the strongest leaders \u2013 they are absolutely the strongest leaders we\u2019ve ever had and I\u2019d say they\u2019re some of the most talented people in the industry. And as Loren had spoke of, the won but not funded pipeline globally has really never been higher and it continues to grow, so I would use that as a proof point. We would say that we\u2019re not where we want to be or need to be, so we see it as a rapidly growing part of our business and it\u2019s beyond an aspiration, it\u2019s actually happening right now and I think we\u2019ll look back in three years from now and see if it would have been an important contributor to our success as an organization. Michael Cyprys : Okay. Maybe just circling back on performance fees outside of private equity and outside of real estate and those sorts of alternative strategies, can you just remind us how much AUM is subject to performance I guess in some of your more traditional strategies and how that\u2019s changed and evolved over the past couple of years? And then if you were to kind of look out over the next couple of years from here, how do you see that evolving, in particular with asset owners we\u2019re hearing seeking more performance fee structures and better alignments. Just curious and any color you could share on that front. Marty Flanagan : We don\u2019t have a large \u2013 if you look at percentage of assets, not very large at all. And this topic of performance fees, there are vehicles where it makes sense. There are others where it does not. You talk about alignment of interests and some of the things that are emerging, I think they do not align interests really at all. I\u2019d get back to my comment earlier. I think what you really need to have a fair competitive fee and what you really want to do is hold the manager accountable to their investment philosophy and process and measure them over a period of time. The issue with performance fees is that \u2013 how does the misalignment come, because they are based on various measures that are based on where by calendar quarter or performing against an index or a benchmark and it almost always goes counter to what you want the portfolio manager to do and what the organization to do. And the risk of the investment organizations, you would hope not, but making bad decisions because of the economics being so difficult in the downturn really I think is quite dangerous, personally. Loren Starr : In terms of the trend, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re seeing a significant trend one way or the other in terms of use of performance fees. Certainly on the retail side, not. I think on the institutional side as we continue to build out our capabilities, it\u2019s probably growing in line with our overall institutional business. So we may see more performance fees just generally as we become more institutionally-oriented. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something that has a philosophy where sort of saying let\u2019s deliver more performance. Marty Flanagan : Let me be clear. I want to clarify the point that Loren is on. There are vehicles or strategies where it makes sense and \u2013 whether it be in the number of the alternatives, in private equity, in real estate, it makes sense. You get the alignment. It makes a lot of sense. We do that. It makes sense, very supportive of it. To me it\u2019s this fulcrum fee notion that tends to happen in the retail environment that is really countercyclical typically to what you want to have happen. So thanks for the point there. Michael Cyprys : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Kenneth Lee from RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open. Kenneth Lee : Thanks for taking my question. Just want to focus on the Guggenheim ETF business. From the earlier comments, it sounds like the business is mainly focused on the retail side. Maybe tell us more about the opportunity for expansion to institutional customers? What would need to be done before you can start getting traction on that side? Marty Flanagan : Dan, will you take that? Dan Draper : Yes, sure. So I think just looking at kind of legacy strength and focus on distribution, I think that\u2019s \u2013 at Guggenheim, that\u2019s where you\u2019ve seen a lot of the strength and their success thus far. I think as Marty and Loren both have mentioned, I think the growing strength of our institutional business at Invesco I think just plays into that bigger, wider distribution opportunity we have taking this business in-house. So I think frankly getting more education, I think particularly in fixed income. So if you look at these BulletShares products, having a final maturity date on the ETF is very unique. Having an open-ended fund but with a final maturity, that allows for things such as asset liability matching, which clearly plays very strongly into the insurance space, for example. So I really kind of hope that we\u2019d be able to particularly get in front of some of Invesco\u2019s strong insurance relationships with the BulletShares existing products but perhaps even more importantly, building new products for some of those. And I don\u2019t want to limit that. I think the BulletShare also would have interest, particularly with endowments, smaller pensions, other areas in institutional. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re really keen to look for additional kind of synergies through that. I do think also if you look at the way that many institutions have been looking at factors really for decades or longer for us to really introduce some of this factor exposure in the ETF wrapper. So the wrapper may be new to them, but helping, again educating with white papers, research, overall thought leadership to institutional clients we think is pretty exciting. But I\u2019d definitely put my finger on the fixed income BulletShares as the area that we probably start with expanding and leveraging the institutional capabilities at Invesco. Kenneth Lee : Great. And just a follow-up question on ETF sales in Europe. It sounds as if post-MiFID II, there could be some material pickup in ETF retail sales due to the increased transparency. Would that be a fair statement or are there still some additional structural changes that are needed in the European market before we see more rapid adoption of ETFs? Thanks. Marty Flanagan : Dan? Dan Draper : Yes. So I think our view overall if you look at growth trends, we believe that overall AUM growth in Europe is probably seven to maybe ten years behind where the U.S. was in that growth curve, but obviously growing quite rapidly. As we have mentioned, broad-based retail demand is not yet present. I think with the MiFID II impact, we do think medium to long term, it will be significant, and ETFs will be a beneficiary. However, short term, if you look at \u2013 there was a regulatory change in 2013 in the United Kingdom, so retail distribution review had an impact, very similar, with transparency, eliminating conflicts of interest, for example, in certain product areas. ETFs did get a bit of a boost but it was fairly modest. I think it continues to grow. I think our expectation therefore for MiFID II is that this is a crucial cornerstone change I think particularly improving the liquidity. On-screen liquidity of ETFs will hopefully happen sooner under MiFID II. As I mentioned, there were no requirements for market makers in Europe to put up pre and post-trade reporting. So those indications are really important to encourage liquidity. So I think if you get liquidity moving earlier, then I think you\u2019ll get more confidence, more visibility for ETFs with retail investors and their advisers. So just to manage expectations, we do think it\u2019s a medium to long term, very positive. But short term, based on kind of the RDR UK experience, it will probably be modest out of the gate, but we\u2019ll continue to monitor. But I think this is where, again, having the scale platform that has been built largely through institutional demand in Europe that Source brings, that\u2019s really where, when the retail demand does come, they\u2019re going to be looking for scaled products, good liquidity with the track record. And that\u2019s where everything that we\u2019re doing now with the distribution business, ETF business in Europe is really crucial when that retail demand does come. Kenneth Lee : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Chris Harris from Wells Fargo. Sir, your line is open. Chris Harris : Thanks. Hi, guys. Just a couple of follow-ups on Jemstep. So things are going well there. You highlighted that. Yet Jemstep isn\u2019t the only platform of its kind, I don\u2019t believe. So can you guys talk to us a little bit about what differentiates Jemstep, why an adviser would choose Jemstep over another offering? And then related to that, as the market evolves, do you guys envision advisers coalescing around just a few of these digital offerings, or do you expect the market to be a lot more fragmented than that? Marty Flanagan : So the characters that are unique to Jemstep, first of all, the digital technologies are being adopted quite broadly all throughout our industries in different ways. The robustness of the Jemstep infrastructure is unique. It was eight years in development and that really becomes, all of would know being in this industry, the piping in the industry is complicated and it\u2019s necessary to be robust and strong. So that\u2019s one. But really, it is the open architecture nature of it so \u2013 and it\u2019s directed to advisers only. So it is not available direct to consumer. So there is no channel conflict. It is to support our clients\u2019 business, and that\u2019s very attractive. It also can use a range of vehicles, which is more unique, so ETFs, mutual funds and the like. Those are absent in most of the competing capability, and its ability to be embedded in an organization\u2019s infrastructure is unique. So it\u2019s not a black box. So those are some of the characteristics that make it unique. And so think of it as a \u2013 we\u2019ve all been through it. You are installing in an application and we all know it\u2019s hard work, it takes time. The notion that an organization would have more than one of these is hard to believe. And so there really is a first mover advantage to it and we think we\u2019re in a very strong position and just the demand would suggest that. Coming back to a prior question of how big can it be and the like, it\u2019s just a long tail. And we never put our chin out there to speculate about the possible impact, but it has all the makings of being a very, very strong contributor to the firm. Loren Starr : The one thing I would just add too, that really makes it even more unique is the fact that we\u2019ve got this incredibly robust offerings around models and solutions that we can bring alongside it. So it\u2019s just not a technology solution that is being offered, it\u2019s actually \u2013 some of the most valuable part is the ability to tailor models to the clients\u2019 needs at a very attractive price. And so I think when you add all those things in, in terms of the open architecture, the fact that we\u2019re integrating this into people\u2019s systems, and it\u2019s not a black box, and we\u2019ve got the models actually positions it almost in a way that is \u2013 does make it stand out as a unique offering. Chris Harris : Very good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question is from Mr. Robert Lee from KBW. Sir, your line is open. Andy McLaughlin : Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. This is actually Andy McLaughlin in for Rob. I just had one quick question, a lot of mine have been asked already, but I appreciate the update you gave on the business optimization. Kind of how should we think about those balancing between needed investments going into next year and what line items in particular might we see the optimization in? Loren Starr : So I think, again, in terms of the guidance on the ultimate need for investment, I think we\u2019ve already built-in into that guidance our need for investment. More savings helps offset some of the \u2013 or boosts the incremental margins. So that\u2019s a positive thing in terms of the things that help improve our incremental margin outlook. We still think we\u2019re in a situation as a firm and the industry that there\u2019s so much change going on that the need and the criticality of investing behind some of these trends are key for success in the future. But again, there\u2019s only so much you can actually invest in at once and do it well. So that\u2019s kind of some context to thinking why generally the things that we\u2019re talking about are helpful for our incremental margin story. In terms of \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, the other question that you had was -- Andy McLaughlin : Just kind of where we might see -- Loren Starr : \u2026see the savings. Yes, so because of the \u2013 a large part of it has to do with outsourcing really in looking at moving expenses out of compensation and then moving them into that property, office, tech, which is where we have all the third-party payments for outsourced services. And so it would really be a movement into expenses, into that category off of comp. Andy McLaughlin : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. I\u2019d like to hand the floor back to our speakers. Marty Flanagan : On behalf of Loren and Dan and myself, just want to thank you very much for your time and interest and look forward to engaging in the future. Have a good rest of the day. Loren Starr : Thank you everybody. Dan Draper : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today\u2019s conference call, and thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Welcome to Invesco's Fourth Quarter Results Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Today's conference call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now, I would like to turn the call over to your speakers for today; Marty Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin. Marty Flanagan : Thank you very much and thank you for joining us everybody, and if you are so inclined, you can follow the presentation that's available on the web site. So I will spend a few minutes reviewing the full year results and the fourth quarter results of 2017, give an update on where we are with the two acquisitions that we are involved in and Loren will go into the financial results and we will open up to Q&A. So let me start by talking or highlighting our firm's operating results for the full year, and I am on page 4 if you are following along. So investment performance continued to be very strong throughout the year, and looking on the back, a very strong investment performance, really our movement to focus on outcome oriented Solutions contributed to long term net inflows at $11.5 billion during the year. Organic growth rate was 1.7%. I do want to highlight that 2017 represents the ninth consecutive year of positive long term net inflows from Invesco, and I will come back to that in a minute. But again, the combination of all these efforts, performance, the capabilities and delivery for clients resulted in achieving record earnings per share for Invesco of $2.70 per share, that's up 21% year-over-year. The adjusted operating margin was 39.4% for the year, up from 38.7%. We did return $472 million of dividends throughout 2017. So if you turn to page 5, this is where I want to come back to, the consistency and the diversity of our long term flows, which really is in the context of nine years of net inflows. So this chart on page 5 shows the relationship between organic growth rate and the variability of that growth. The vertical axis is the average organic growth rate over the prior five years through 2017 and it's the public company peers. The horizontal axis was a standard deviation of those flows and it reflects the sustainability or the variability of the organic growth rate. So if you look at Invesco against our peers, it's evident that the diversification is benefitting Invesco. Invesco has the lowest standard deviation of flows of the group, reflecting a high level of flow consistency, and additionally, we are just outside the top third of the average organic growth rates of that peer group, something that we absolutely intend to close. Having strong and diversified sets of offerings and assets under management really does put us in a position to better serve our clients. But as a business, it absolutely makes us strong, by not being overly reliant on any one geography -- any distribution channel or asset class. So again, diversification is good for portfolio, it's great for business, and this is not a concept anymore, this is proven in these results. We do believe that this diversification of the business does lead to better flow consistency and represents a strong opportunity for us to reach that targeted growth rate of -- organic growth rate of 3% to 5% in the near future. And lastly, I do want to point out, despite our continuous inflows and the low volatility of those flows, Invesco continues to sell at a discount versus peers. We do not believe that our current valuation fairly reflects our ability to grow organically. As measured by history, well, what we think is based on the future potential of Invesco. So now let me turn to page 6 and take a minute to talk about the achievements over the past year, all of which were intended to strengthen our ability to help our clients meet their needs and further advance our competitive position. Investment performance is very strong during the year, as I mentioned. 64% of our assets, beat peers on a three year basis and 75% on a five year basis. And this was really what was one of the principal drivers, good performance over the past nine years, that generated the flows that we talked about and in particular, in this year, the record earnings per share of $2.70. But throughout 2017, we continued to build our competitive range of active, passive and alternative capabilities, that is really important for future success of any money manager. We did complete the acquisition of Source and announced the acquisition of Guggenheim Investments ETF business, both of which I will talk about in just a minute. In 2017, we continued to expand our Solutions business, which brings together the full capabilities of the firm to provide outcomes for clients. And again, this is a really developing and very important thing that we are seeing, that clients are looking for, from money managers. One of the things that highlighted or closed within the year, as everybody knows, was Rhode Island, about 29 accounts. But also importantly, we are seeing success with Solutions and traction within the Wealth Management platform, and our different opportunities in different parts of the world, institutionally also. Regarding our digital advice platform, Jemstep, we announced partnerships with a number of large enterprises in 2017, and we are well down the implementation path with several of them, and the sales and onboarding pipeline continues to be very-very robust. In particular, we saw strong demand from banks, which view digital advice as a really important means for them to strengthen the relationship with their clients, as they build comprehensive Wealth Management services. Jemstep differentiates itself by offering advisor-powered technology, enhancing human touch, not replacing it, but enhancing them. So the partnership with our partners is really very-very important and it works quite well. We also continue to drive savings through our business optimization program, delivering more than $43 million in annual run rate savings, as of the end of 2017. We will use the savings to offset the investments in key initiatives that help us better meet client needs, strengthen our competitive position and help us grow the business, as we look to the future. A handful of the initiatives I might highlight, for example, we have improved factor-based investing, which would also improve things like self-indexing and complement to our ETF business, with a continued effort to advance our institutional business globally and expansion in China, all of which we have talked about in 2017, or we will get further updates in 2018. So now let me take a minute to update you where we are on our acquisitions in 2017. Again, both of which we are focusing on expanding and improving our global ETF platform. Both of which, we think enhance our competitive position in the upper growing ETF business, and the EMEA platform has been -- helped with the closure of Source and Guggenheim, also here in the United States. Our EMEA ETF business totaling $27.9 billion at the end of 2017, up from $26 billion at the time of acquisition. This really is a strong result of our efforts to successfully manage the integration post acquisition, which typically we did not see any of the integration issues that often happen with acquisitions. The EMEA acquisition expands the diversity of our ETFs across equity fixed income and commodities, smart beta and active ETFs. So really complementary to our platform. We did launch 10 new ETFs in the fourth quarter, the point being, we looked to take advantage of the platform in a very rapid fashion. The Guggenheim investment ETF business continued to expand assets under management and it had strong performance within that platform. We still intend to close in the second quarter of this year, and again the Guggenheim platform will add equity fixed income, alternative ETFs, again enhancing the range of capabilities we have and also will be able to create client directed proprietary indexes through self-indexing capabilities. Spending a minute on the fourth quarter results on slide 10; you will see again, the strong investment performance helped drive assets under management to $937 billion, up from $917 billion in the prior quarter. We had solid retail and institutional demand, led by the long term net inflows of $4.4 billion, and organic growth rate of 2.3% during the quarter. Adjusted operating income was $399 million as compared to $397 million in the prior quarter. The adjusted operating margin was up slightly to 40.7% and we had earnings per share of $0.73. We did return $119 million to shareholders through dividends during the quarter, and the quarterly dividend remains constant at $0.29 per share. Talking about performance, why don't we turn to flows on page 13; we saw solid demand for active and passive capabilities during the quarter. Gross sales and net inflows of active capabilities in the fourth quarter, building on solid demand in the prior quarter. You saw solid flows in a taxable fixed income, international equity firms and domestic equity. Turning to passive, we saw strong flows into domestic equity fixed income, international equity ETFs and as noted in the presentation, our ETF acquisition in EMEA is contributing to net flows and building up strong demand for ETFs in that region. We did see very strong retail and institutional demand during the quarter, as you will see on slide 14. As an example, this was a sixth consecutive quarter of net positive flows for EMEA, led by strong institutional and cross-border flows. And as you can imagine with markets continuing, ever rising as they have over the last number of months, demand for risk mitigation strategy remains strong, particularly amongst institutional investors and the pipeline of one, but not funded institutional mandate also remains very strong. We saw strong flows in the global targeted return funds, led by institutional investors, and we also saw solid flows in the Pan-European High Income as well as commodity in emerging market ETFs. So again, the flow picture continues to be quite robust and ever increasing, as we look to the future. Let me turn it over to Loren, so he can give you more specifics and then we will open up to Q&A. Loren Starr : Thanks a lot Marty. So quarter-over-quarter, we saw total AUM increase $20.1 billion or 2.2%. That was driven by market gains of $14.9 billion, long term net inflows of $4.4 billion, which included $5.9 billion of reinvested dividends and capital gains in the quarter. We saw a positive foreign exchange translation of $2.5 billion and inflows into non-management fee earning AUM of $1.6 billion. These factors were somewhat offset by outflows from institutional money market products of $3.3 billion. Our average AUM for the fourth quarter was $930.3 billion, that was up 4.4% versus the third quarter and our annualized long term organic growth rate in Q4 was 2.3% compared to 3% in the third quarter. Before turning to net revenue yield as I do typically, I wanted to provide one quick update on the change in this quarter and how long term inflows are being calculated. Beginning with the fourth quarter, our flows and AUM of our unit investment trusts or UITs as they are known, as well as changes in product leverage are no longer going to be classified as long term, and instead are being presented with -- alongside with the Invesco PowerShares QQQ product, categorized as flows and non-management fee earning AUM. Since none of these products earn management fees, somewhere to the QQQ, we thought it was more accurately reflecting the nature of long term flows in AUM to exclude these products from those flows going forward. All prior periods have been restated to allow for a consistent presentation and comparability. So now let me get to the net revenue yield; our net revenue yield came in at 43.2 basis points and our net revenue yield, excluding performance fees was 41.3 basis points, so that was a decrease of 0.6 basis points versus Q3. The impact of a full quarter of results for the acquired European ETF business reduced our yield by 0.5 basis points, and we also saw a non-recurring reduction in service and distribution revenues in the quarter. That decreased the yield by 0.2 basis points. These were then somewhat offset by a positive impact of foreign exchange and on mix, which added 0.1 basis points. So ultimately, the mix improvement that was anticipated when we provided the net revenue yield guidance last quarter, did not fully materialize, to the extent that we had expected, as we did see higher outflows from some of our U.S. retail equity products, as well as a somewhat modest slowdown in flows, versus what we were expecting from our cross-border fund range in the fourth quarter. Let me move to slide 17, just quickly; that provides our U.S. GAAP operating results for the quarter. As is customary, my comments today will focus exclusively on the variances related to our non-GAAP adjusted measures, which are found on page 18. So let's move to that page; so net revenues increased by $28.3 million or 2.9% quarter-over-quarter. Just over $10 billion, which includes a positive foreign exchange impact of $2.6 million. Within the net revenue number, you will see that adjusted investment management fees increased by $37.3 million or 3.4% to $1.12 billion. This primarily reflects higher average AUM for the quarter. Then we had adjusted service and distribution revenue, which decreased by $0.1 million compared to the third quarter. Adjusted performance fees came in at $43.3 million in Q4, and were primarily earned from real estate and bank loan products. Going into 2018, we want to give some guidance here. We do expect that performance fees will be up versus our prior guidance, and we would say roughly $10 million to $15 million per quarter. Our adjusted other revenues in the fourth quarter came in at $18.4 million, that was an increase of $1.7 million from the prior quarter, and that was primarily due to increased real estate transaction fees. Looking forward to 2018, again providing guidance here; we would expect other revenues to remain at a similar level to the fourth quarter, at around $16 million to $18 million per quarter, through the remainder of 2018. Next, dropping to the third party distribution service and advisory expense line item, which we net against gross revenues, that increased $10.6 million or 2.8%, which is consistent with the increased revenues derived from our related retail AUM. Before turning to expenses, let me just summarize all the revenue guidance I just provided in terms of yield. Looking into 2018, we would expect to see our net revenue yields, excluding performance fees decline modestly, by approximately 0.5 basis points year-over-year to about 41 basis points. This decline is driven by our full year results from the acquired European ETF business, as well as inclusion of the Guggenheim ETF assets, that we would expect beginning in the second quarter of 2018, and that will reduce yield by roughly 1.5 basis points. These impacts will be somewhat, but not fully offset, by the improving foreign exchange rate that we are seeing, as well as the sales mix trends that is occurring in the business. Let me then move on to expenses; so moving on to the slide, you will see that our adjusted operating expenses at $605.7 million, that increased by $26.5 million or 4.6%, relative to the Q3 foreign exchange, with an impact on our adjusted operating expenses of roughly $0.9 million during the quarter. Our adjusted employee compensation came in at $376.3 million, that's a decrease of $70.6 million or 2%. This is driven by lower variable compensation and the $5.5 million non-cash charge related to company's U.K. defined benefit plan, which we recognized in Q3. Looking ahead into 2018, again providing guidance here, we would expect compensation expense of roughly $410 million to $415 million per quarter. The increase in the first quarter reflects the seasonality of payroll taxes, as well as the one month impact from the base salary increases, as well as the impact of higher foreign exchange. The seasonal taxes should then drop off in Q2, but they would be offset by the costs for the Guggenheim ETF business, as well as variable compensation being reflected. So note that this guidance of course is based on flat markets, consistent to foreign exchange and as well as the revenue guidance that I provided earlier around fee rates. So our adjusted marketing, moving to that line; in Q4, increased by $9.7 million that's 32.2% higher or $39.8 million. That was related to marketing campaigns, related to the acquired ETF business, as well as the cross-border funds and normal seasonal increases in advertising, client events and other marketing costs. So looking forward to 2018, we would expect marketing expenses to come in at roughly $32 million per quarter. Dropping down to the adjusted property, office and technology line item, that came in at $100.8 million, that was an increase of $7.1 million or 7.6% over the third quarter. This reflects increased outsourced and administration costs associated with MiFID II reporting, as required, and other regulatory compliance costs, as well as higher software costs. Looking forward to 2018, we would expect property, office and technology expenses roughly in line with the fourth quarter levels, around $102 million to $104 million per quarter. And next, our adjusted G&A expenses came in somewhat higher than we had guided. As we know, $88.8 million, that was an increase of $17.3 million or 24.2% more than Q3. The fourth quarter reflected an increase of $9.3 million, primarily related to regulatory -- preparing for regulatory changes. There were business growth initiatives, which included product costs and legal, consulting, and professional services costs within that line item. These increased costs also led to increase overall of $1.7 million in irrecoverable taxes as compared to the third quarter. In terms of the guidance, while we would expect to see our G&A run rate decrease, going into 2018, this decrease will of course be partially offset by the costs incurred related to the MiFID II hard dollar payments that we have talked about in the past. But overall, the guidance is that quarterly rate should be around $80 million to $83 million per quarter for 2018. So based on the guidance provided today and assuming flat markets and foreign exchange, we believe our margin is certainly sustainable at current levels into 2018 and our incremental margin target for the year, remains at that 40% to 50% level, consistent with our prior guidance. Looking into 2019 and beyond; we certainly believe that our incremental margin could return to the 50% to 65% level consistent with our historical guidance. So back on to the current results, going down the page, I will just quickly finish this out. You will see that our adjusted non-operating income increased $2.2 million compared to Q3, driven by mark-to-market gains on seed money investments. And then moving to taxes, the firm's effective tax rate in the quarter came in at 26.8%. As expected our 2018 effective tax rate will be impacted by the Tax Cut and Jobs act which was enacted last month. Given our domicile in Bermuda, we have always paid tax under territorial system in the jurisdictions where our income is earned, but we will benefit from the lower U.S. tax rate on our U.S. generated earnings, and therefore, our current analysis guides us to an overall effective tax rate for Invesco, that is going to be between 20% to 21% for 2018. This estimated rate could be impacted, as we continue to review of course, the rules, and if there are additional guidance provided on the legislation. Other point is just on the GAAP results; you will note that we had a onetime benefit of $130.7 million in the quarter, that was reflecting the revaluation of our deferred taxes at the new lower corporate tax rates. This amount of course was adjusted out for purposes of our non-GAAP results and our intention, just in general, as these questions come up, about the cash related to the benefit on the tax rate, is to use this cash to reduce our anticipated outstanding balance on the credit facility, which will be used to fund the majority of the Guggenheim acquisition, beginning of Q2. After the acquisition is completed and our leverage ratio is reduced to the pre-acquisition levels you see today, any residual excess cash will certainly just follow our stated capital priorities. And as a reminder, these priorities that we will reinvest cash back in the business, as needed through seed money and co-investments, but then it goes to dividends and finally, share repurchases. So that brings us back to the current quarter, [indiscernible] EPS to $0.73, adjusted operating margin of 39.7% for the quarter. And before I turn things back to Marty, I just wanted to offer an update on net flows as we have always done. In January, we continue to see significant strength in our EMEA business, as well as Asia-Pacific, both on the retail and institutional side. This has been somewhat offset by some weakness in the U.S. flows, largely in the retail space. But overall, we have seen through January 29, $1 billion of long term net flows. So we are not done with the month, and certainly there is an institutional activity that happens during the month. So that number hopefully could improve from the number I just gave you. And with that, I am now going to turn it over to Marty. Marty Flanagan : Thank you, Loren. So operator, can you open it up for questions please? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And speakers, our first question is from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning and thank you for taking my questions. I guess maybe first, in terms of ETFs in Europe, has MiFID II impacted the conversation on ETFs and factor-based investing yet? How is the conversation changing, now that rules are in place? And then can you talk more about the marketing effort that you are putting behind Source in the U.K.? And then maybe lastly, what are the lessons you have learned so far from Source, that you could apply to Guggenheim? Thanks. Marty Flanagan : Thanks Ken. So look, everything at the time of the announcement that we talked about, the landscape in Europe advancing, MiFID being very supportive of ETFs being even a more important part of the investing landscape, it's all in place. So we think it's going to result in a very important business for us. So nothing has changed there, we are just moving strongly ahead. As I mentioned earlier, the integration has gone very-very well. It's a very talented group of people. It really is complementary to what we have. So we think we are going to see the results that we talked about. And from a marketing point of view, again, it just expands what we have been doing as an organization, using a combination of active-passive and alternatives. So again, very-very supportive. Let me back up even more, before I come back down to it. As a firm, I talked about the flows and the consistency of the flows. We have a stated target of 3% to 5% organic growth rate. We are absolutely focused on driving gross sales to get the net flows that we want, and we are pulling every lever that you can imagine. So focus on distribution excellence, so not just limit it to Source, but throughout the organization, retail, institutional and also looking very much at the brand positioning of the firm and anything that we can do to further strengthen, ultimately outcomes for clients, resulting in net flows is what we will do. But again, Source becomes a very important part of our overall global ETF business, and again, nothing has changed from what we thought at the time of the announcement. Loren Starr : And the one thing I would mention too, is I know our institutional salespeople are extremely excited about the prospect of using ETFs within the Solutions context. It's something that is not really had available to them, and so, as we have added more resources around Solutions and being able to provide Solutions to institutions, the ETF business is absolutely factoring into those conversations. So again, it's a little bit early days to say, where it's going. But it's absolutely becoming a different part of the conversation than we have been able to have in the past. Ken Worthington : Okay. Thank you. And then Marty, you have highlighted a couple of times in recent calls, the investment made in Europe, Asia, and U.S. institutional sales. I believe that, Asia institutional sales have weakened somewhat, but we are not yet seeing kind of improved net or gross sales in the institutional side yet, at least it's not material, and it seems like gross sales are sort of flatlined around this $8 billion, $8.5 billion level. So is the good news coming? When the good news comes, what level of gross sales we should expect? Are you thinking like, 9, 10? Like how good is good when good comes? Thank you. Marty Flanagan : Yeah. So I am going to make a couple of comments and then turn over to Loren. So good is coming, and it's real and we expect the -- if you look out a couple of years, quite material. Our aspiration and intent is to have a very different set of outcomes net income what you are seeing, and from my perspective, everything is in place to have that happen. Again, it's things that we have been talking about. The factor capability, the alternative capability, the Solutions capability, the quality of the team and what we are and again, it's not a plan. We are actually executing the plan. So Loren, do you want to make a couple of comments? Loren Starr : Yeah. Ken, I mean, if it's any indication, I know we don't get into exact numbers, but our one, not funded pipeline is up 34% through the course of 2017. The fee rates is well above the firm's overall fee rate, up 35% higher than the firm's overall fee rate. I think again, good news, we have seen outflows have been a little bit of a topic around the institutional business. The things that we see in terms of termination are down 33% versus last year, so down significantly. And by the way, the fee rate on what is likely to terminate is about 45% lower than the overall firm's fee rate. So significantly lower impact in terms of the outflows versus the ones coming in. So I mean, based on what we are seeing, and by the way, that is robustly distributed across all our regions, both U.S., Asia and Europe, it's extremely good. The other thing I'd say that's even more exciting just to look at, is another category of things that we track around qualified opportunities. And so those are active dialogs that we are having with our clients and that is at an all time record, double, literally versus where it was last year, and probably the largest growth right now is happening in Europe and then Asia as well. So very-very exciting with what's happening. Lot of resources have been -- continue to be added to our institutional business, and it is certainly seeming to pay off. So again I can't tell you exactly which quarter. And again, the line of site to things flowing, which was a lot of things in the fourth quarter moved into the first quarter, just because we felt that might happen with some volatility, and I believe it is happening. So we certainly would expect to see some near term benefits from some of those mandates going into Q1. Ken Worthington : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Jeremy Campbell of Barclays. Your line now is open. Jeremy Campbell : You guys changed your influence to contemplate kind of reinvested dividends and capital gains. I am just wondering, is if you got to separate out what's kind of gross sales and what's reinvestments? I know you have the footnote from the total flow profile, but not really stratified on a product or active-passive basis and I think the incremental disclosure is probably pretty extremely helpful for us on the sell and buy side? Loren Starr : I think the first part of your question got a little bit cut off. But I heard your question about providing detail around capital gains and the reinvestments at a more detailed level. We can certainly look at that. Some of it is hard to actually obtain, because of -- we don't sell to third parties, and so getting the data that we just got, took a long time. So it is something that we can aspire to, to try to give you more detail. We did do that, of course, because we felt that it was more consistent with some of the largest industry peers that we have done, and we will look to see, if we can get more details, that's helpful. Jeremy Campbell : Sure. Yeah, I mean, even something simple as like, using what your old disclosures were and then adding that extra line to get to what you are defining as flows, now would be -- Loren Starr : Yeah we have -- absolutely. We are not trying to do anything cute [ph] by distributing this. I think we can get you more detail. Jeremy Campbell : And then I just wanted to know; I don't know if I missed this or not, but what do you guys expect for kind of full year MiFID expenses in 2018? Loren Starr : Well we said, in terms of the payment of hard dollars for research, we have said tens of millions, which is the quantification, not very specific, because it is a very dynamic and fluid discussion, as we go through this process. So I will leave it at that, other than, it is our hope and certainly early indications may prove out that it's not just a hope, that some of the costs associated with payments for hard research may decline over time, as the industry kind of corrects and adjusts and reaches an equilibrium level, in terms of pricing for research. Marty Flanagan : Right. I think the point is also though, the full impact is included in the guidance that you gave in G&A for this -- Loren Starr : Absolutely. Yeah. So we have included that tens of millions impact in the G&A line item, which is where it sits today and that's at a reduced level versus Q4. Jeremy Campbell : Great. And just finally, I guess, related to Guggenheim, how has that been perform as a Group, since we had our last call here, that talked about kind of the flows at AUM level? Is it kind of tracking in line with what you guys expected, as sort of like that compound growth? Loren Starr : It has certainly grown. I think it's at relatively $40 billion in size versus 27 something when we announced. Marty Flanagan : $37 billion. Loren Starr : I am sorry. $37 billion, excuse me. I think in terms of flows, since announcement, it's about $700 million of long term flows, which is roughly in line with where it was historically. I think it actually, prior to the announcement, it may have gone negative, and then it seems to improve a little bit. Obviously, there is not anything we can do to improve the flows right now. We certainly believe that once it becomes part of Invesco, we are going to be able to accelerate its growth trajectory significantly, and that is our hope and our plan. Right now, it's more than tracking, what we hoped in terms of a higher AUM level. Jeremy Campbell : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse. Your line now is open. Craig Siegenthaler : Hey, good morning Marty, Loren. Loren Starr : Hey Craig. Craig Siegenthaler : So just starting on Jemstep; and I know you already announced a few wins here and some of these wins are already on the path to implementation. But can you help us just on timing, when will the related business win start to show up in flows and revenues? Marty Flanagan : Yeah. So I think you have to look to 2019, right? So I keep coming back to -- it's very exciting. We think this is a strategic competitive strength that we are developing. We think it will be -- really enhance our business in the future, but again, these are just -- it's just low. I mean, from the standpoint of implementation, it is -- it is just the nature of what it is. But again, we couldn't be more excited about what's developing. Craig Siegenthaler : Got it. And then, it's also in the comment in the slide deck on Jemstep, that you know, the sales pipeline. You noted as especially robust among banks. I am just wondering, what is the characteristic of sort of the average bank in that pipeline? What does it look like in terms of size, client base, things like that? Marty Flanagan : Yeah. I would be a little careful, because the [indiscernible] announcement. But I mean from regional banks to very large banks, it is really quite broad. So it's, again, something that we think is a very important development for us and the partnership between ourselves and the banks seem to line up very-very nicely. Craig Siegenthaler : Got it. Thanks Marty. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Patrick Davitt of Autonomous Research. Your line now is open. Patrick Davitt : Good morning. There has been a little chatter about troubles with the new all-in expense reporting with MiFID II. I'd like to get your thoughts on that and within that theme, how you think you came out on those metrics? Marty Flanagan : Sorry, I have not kept up with the chatter. But what I can tell you is -- Loren Starr : Never heard about it. Marty Flanagan : [Indiscernible], because I have not heard about it. Sorry about that. I wish I had more color. I just don't. Patrick Davitt : Sure. And then just as a follow-up on the earlier color, all of the -- I guess, institutional pipeline data you just went through; is that just Europe and Asia or is that the total pipeline? Loren Starr : That's the total pipeline for all of Invesco. But as I mentioned, it's about a third in each region. Patrick Davitt : Great. And then, the $1 billion of long term net flows in January. Is there a lot of reinvested dividend and capital gains in that? Loren Starr : None. None that's reflected right now in that number. Patrick Davitt : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Bill Katz of Citigroup. Your line now is open. William Katz : Okay. Excuse me, apologize for the voice here, having a little flu. Just coming back to some of the expense guidance; parse out for us, how much will be contributed by Guggenheim versus how much is just sort of core investment into the business? And then relatedly, as you think about the drivers for the incremental margin to 2019, is it a function of bending down the expense curve or is it bending up the revenue growth? Just trying to get a better understanding of what the driver will be? Loren Starr : So Guggenheim is, as we said, is coming in at incremental margin about 85% we are assuming is coming in, really at the beginning of Q2. Total expenses associated with Guggenheim are a little in excess of $10 million for that period of time. So that's one element of the spending, and that's coming through. The other amounts of investment are sort of incremental to that, related to funding the growth in Jemstep, institutionals, factor-based, these are the things that Marty was talking about earlier, as well as further growth of our existing ETF business above and beyond just the Guggenheim business, to name a few. And that's ultimately what's driving down the incremental margin, by roughly, no more than 10 percentage points for the year. So hopefully, that gives you some color of what that is. I do think, revenue trajectory, because of the mix of the products that we are selling, also hope to accelerate the growth, is what's going to be driving our margin expansion going into 2019 and beyond. William Katz : Okay, that's helpful. And then Marty, just a question for you a little bit off the run from the [indiscernible] topics, but how are you thinking about the institutional cash business at this point in time? How critical is it to you and how you sort of think that that business, more broadly evolves for the industry? Is it more of a commoditized service or is there a real growth opportunity here? Marty Flanagan : Look I -- it's an important business for us. We think it's a growth opportunity for -- there is a need. There always has been a need, there will continue to be a need. But really what's happened then, though you know this well as anybody, the consolidation of the players has just been striking with the money fund reform. And so, they are just -- have lost track of the numbers, but down by 50% of the people, who have spiked down more than that right now. So to be in the business, you have to be really committed to it. You have to have some scale, and we think it's an important business for us, we do it very well. William Katz : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Brennan Hawken of UBS. Your line now is open. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question guys. First, Loren, a follow-up on your effective tax rate guide. Does the 20% to 21% here in 2018 include the impact of the share based comp accounting change that went into effect last year? Loren Starr : Yes it does. And good that you bring that up, because I do think there is typically a first quarter impact that you see there, and that will happen again this quarter. Brennan Hawken : Okay, terrific. And then if we were to back that out, what would be -- what sort of order of magnitude do you have embedded into that 20% to 21% for 2018, just so we can think about longer run run rate, ex that noise? Loren Starr : Well that noise always will be there, every year. So I am not sure, if it's something to factor in. So again, unfortunately, I don't have the exact calculation. Certainly [ph] something we could develop. But I can't imagine it's more than a percentage point. Brennan Hawken : Sure. And we can follow-up later on that, that's no problem. And then, the guidance, just a quick question here; so the revenue guide was better than we were looking for, expense guide maybe a bit worse. So I just wanted to -- being the optimist I am, I wanted to follow-up on the expense guide; it seems like the tens of millions that you spoke to, included in G&A, but I think you also referenced, and might just have not heard it correctly, that the property and tech line also included an uplift from MiFID. So was the idea that tens of millions guide was more purely to fund the research, and then incremental investment and expense for technology from MiFID was exclusive of that. So all-in costs is going to be a little bit above that baseline, is it the right way to think about that? Loren Starr : Well on the G&A, I mean, that's a run rate elementary [indiscernible] for research. Again, there may be some benefit over some period of time, as those numbers drop. But that includes the tens of millions. In the property, office and tech, this is really related to what we need to ultimately pay our third party provider, who helps us with a lot of the transfer agency services and so forth. And unfortunately that does not go away, that is a run rate as well, that gets just -- the cost of business has gone up due to MiFID II. So I'd like to reflect it in that guidance, that we gave you over $102 million to $104 million per quarter. So unless the regulations themselves change or get sort of -- made less stringent, I think that number is a good one. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Robert Lee of KBW. Your line now is open. Robert Lee : Great, thanks. Thanks for taking my questions guys. Marty, could you just update us maybe on -- you know, [indiscernible] larger intermediaries and others, that contain a kind of whittle down there, shelf space. I guess, Morgan Stanley is going through another round soon. So could you maybe just update us on how you kind of feel like you are faring in that, and also, maybe to what extent your ETF platform is helping you kind of sustain shelf space or giving you opportunities in those distributors? Marty Flanagan : Yeah. Your question almost summarized it very well. We continue to -- again, it is a fact, the big platforms are narrowing, who they are working with and the number of funds. So far, we have done quite well through that. We expect to do that in the future. That's not to say that our smaller funds or underperforming funds are going to suffer during that. But it tends to be a very-very small percentage of our assets under management. So you can contrast that to our ETF business. I think really what's important is, as you would imagine, we have a very strong conviction. I mean, the opportunity of factor and [indiscernible] smart-beta, and it has really not been fully embraced by the platforms yet. But we are already starting to see more of our ETFs, just really in the last quarter, start to go on to these platforms. So again, we are early days in the opportunity. And so we really do strongly believe that, the strength of the firm is really kind of a -- the range of the factor capability with our alternatives and traditional active capabilities to the platform. So far so good, we are confident about the future. Robert Lee : Okay. And maybe a follow-up on the Guggenheim transaction. I mean, as you pointed out, since you announced the deal, assets are up some, but at the same time, you have also had a decline in the go forward tax rates? Now that clearly will reduce the value of the tax yield, but can you maybe update us on how you are thinking about the incremental accretion from Guggenheim at this point, or does some of that get kind of priced away, so to speak, in terms of your purchase price? Just trying to get a sense on where that stands? Loren Starr : Yeah. I mean, it largely offsets one another. The value of the tax yield is half the value. Obviously, that was, like I think roughly $30 million in tax benefit a year. But obviously the value of the purely U.S. based operating income is significantly more. So it ultimately is not impactful to the full value of the business to us, if it goes off [indiscernible]. Robert Lee : Okay, great. And then one last simple question, I am just curious with the U.S. changing to a more territorial tax system, still benefit from being domiciled in Bermuda? Loren Starr : I mean, I think -- there is no impact really. They are both territorial. So it's an equal level playing field now, which I think is absolutely fine. Doesn't impact us, doesn't make us need to change where we are. Ultimately, I think we need to continue to look at what happened with legislation, understand it fully, before there is any reconsideration of do we like where we are domiciled or do we think about changing it. But it is something that certainly is on our radar screen. Robert Lee : Great. That was it. Thanks for taking my questions. Marty Flanagan : Thanks Robert. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Michael Carrier, Bank of America. Your line now is open. Michael Carrier : Thanks guys. Loren, just on the expense guidance, if I put that [indiscernible] to the outlook, it seems like the expense growth is maybe in the low double digits, call it 10%, 11%. Just wanted to break that down, and you gave us some color. But I am just trying to figure out, you have got the deals, you have got some of these investments, and then you kind of have your core run rate. And I know, 2019 is way out, but when I think about the core run rate of what you think the business needs, post the deals in some of these investments, is there any way for us to think about that versus maybe the elevated level that we are seeing in 2018? Loren Starr : Your estimates really look out in the future a lot. I mean, all I can say is, in terms of our forecast and what we see, the good news is, I mean, expenses aren't accelerating through the course of 2018. We think they are roughly stable and fixed. I think that's very good news in terms of the expansion that we would expect to see in margin through the course of 2018, without any further benefit of market or foreign exchange. So I think for us, as it has always been, we see a fairly large incremental margin, more fixed than variable expenses. We have said, we have stated, that we have invested heavily around certain things. This is building out a run rate. But I'd say, that run rate, we think we are going to manage it, so it's going to be roughly, sort of flat expenses through the course of 2018, and you know, you are into margins that are well above 30% by the end of that year. So I mean, no market increase from here. Michael Carrier : Okay. And then, Marty, just on the opportunities in Asia, and particularly with China. Just given the market continues to look like it's opening up more and more? How are you guys positioned and how do you see that playing out over the next few years? Marty Flanagan : Look, I think we are as well positioned as any manager in China. If you look at the institutional, you'd probably point to China as being one of the absolute strengths. We have multiple mandates with all the organizations there, institutions that we'd want. The joint venture is very-very strong in China, and it just continues to get stronger. We have the same view that you do. We look at the next three to five years, as a huge opportunity, and we have been there for almost 20 years now, and longevity and knowledge and experience really does matter in that market. And we think that's a very important opportunity for us and we intend to continue to pursue it. Michael Carrier : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Your line now is open. Brian Bedell : Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Just back on MiFID II, I think if I recall correctly, the tens of millions was based on the adoption for European clients only? And correct me if I am wrong on that, but if you were to adopt that globally, how would that impact the tens of millions run rate, and over what kind of, I guess, timeframe are you looking at that, as potentially nothing [indiscernible]? Loren Starr : I think the rate is, we have certainly looked at the potential of this regulation being applied on a more global basis and what that impact might be. Similar to what we did in Europe, when we saw this potentially happening, I mean, we had started to rationalize and effectively, optimize our use of research in advance of that. We are doing that right now in the U.S. and elsewhere. Again, without full view of this, actually will happen, but ultimately it could. So I think it'd be premature to put out a big number that really had no bearing on reality at this point. I mean, obviously it's more than my tens of millions. But I don't think it's anything that at all would be enormously material to our financial position, and if we see the sort of benefit of being able to take, what was a pretty large number when we first started in Europe and bring it down to something, maybe half the size. That would make me feel pretty comfortable, that it's not going to be a big deal to what happens in the U.S. Brian Bedell : In other words, it sounds like you are able to scale some of that investment essentially? Loren Starr : Absolutely. With the same rigor and discipline that we are using in Europe, we are now applying into the U.S. and there is more to come and more work to be done. I don't want to declare victory at all. But it is something that we believe and everyone agrees, it makes sense for us to do here. Brian Bedell : Okay, great. And then Marty, just maybe a broader question, just on factory based investing broadly. Obviously, there is a lot of compelling components of that, but more recently, we have seen a lot of the ETF flows really be abated now. I think it's about -- and once it's [indiscernible], it's about 20% of the ETF industry and you only captured about 10% of ETF growth in 2017 in January, according to our measures, more like just 1%. So I mean just broadly speaking, what do you think it's going to take to get factor based investing to become a stronger flow category broadly? Marty Flanagan : It's a good question. The flow, since, whatever, the market bottom in 2009 has really been cap-weighted indexes and we can all identify the issues with cap weighted indexes in this market too. I think back to this concern that I have and I think others, that too many people aren't understanding the risks that they are taking within the cap weighted indexes today. That said, that's your question. More and more what are we seeing clients do, and it doesn't matter if it's a retail client or a large institution. More and more, they are building their portfolios, with a combination of, just want to call it, cap-weighted factor based, [indiscernible] act as an alternative, and they are moving up the risk-return spectrum, and what correlates to that, is the level of fees. And so it is the way of the future, and that's very consistent with our effort and Solutions also. So it's really a combination of the breadth of capabilities we have, the Solutions capabilities put together, and really I mean, the clients, not just to build the portfolios they want, but just also be responsive to the totality of the effective fee rate that they want to build. So what we are seeing and coming back to what I said earlier, the bulk of, if you are going to say, in the ETFs in particular and the retail channel specifically, the platforms have been focused on cap-weighted indexes over the past decade. Every single one of them have turned their attention to factor they look at as an important tool and building blocks for their advisors going forward. But it is really having the muscle memory, and the skill to just wanting to intellectually understand it. It's another thing to put it in a manner, that financial advisors can build the portfolios that they want. So again, this goes back to our factor capability that I had mentioned -- sorry, the Solutions capability, and we are actually seeing success with it on the Wealth Management platforms, because there is a need to do that. And again, we are seeing this type of thing actually in China, some of the insurance companies are looking for organizations that can help them build these portfolios very holistically. So I'd say early days with the success, and again within factors in particular or smart beta with an ETF, by the time Guggenheim closes, we will be the second largest active player, very close to the top player, and we think it's again, an important part of our future. Brian Bedell : And do you think Jemstep could be a material contributor to flows in 2018, or is that also more like a 2019? Marty Flanagan : I guess, 2019. And again, so this is really -- the point is connecting all the dots. And what is Jemstep, it is open platform for the platforms. It really helps the -- helping the financial advisors within our partner clients, but also what they have asked for, many of them -- we have built many-many models, a combination of active and passive and just factor based alone. So again, it's going to be these models that are available on these platforms through Jemstep. So again, it's a combination of all of these things, but really, put us uniquely in a position to where we think our clients are moving. And I think it's very hard to turn a switch and catch-up to do all the things that we are doing right now. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Marty Flanagan : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Your line now is open. Chris Harris : Thanks. Can you guys remind us how your fixed income business is positioned with respect to higher rates? And then a related question to that, I believe you have a lot of income and dividend strategies. So how might higher rates affect the demand for those strategies in particular? Marty Flanagan : Maybe I will take the equity piece of line, and you take the fixed income. I think what you are seeing, largely, if you look at our value suite, it is from where it has been historically, a lot of investments in the dividend strategies. What you have seen with some of the markets with the relative performance falling off, that has been traded off to really the deep value capabilities, just getting much stronger. And again, we have said that all along. It is something that we have anticipated and we would anticipate the flows to switch accordingly. Though again, as you would predict, that's what we are beginning to see. Loren Starr : Yeah, I think in the fixed income discussion, we were fortunate that we have a substantial amount of our assets, money markets, bank loans, all on a more floating type of basis. So they don't play necessarily, significantly impacted by rising interest rates. I think the part of our business that is more long duration, would be in Europe, where we have the corporate bond offshoring. But they tend to position their portfolio with lower duration. So on a relative basis, as and when rates start rising in Europe, that would be well positioned. So there isn't any significant exposure. We do have some core longer term fixed income. And also there is none that could be effective. But it's not a substantial part of our business. The majority of our business is actually more short term and floating, than it is -- and stable value is not a component of that by the way, which is in excess of $40 billion too. So also that helps. Chris Harris : Yeah it does. And the other question I had really is just on your organic growth. I mean, you guys absolutely do rank very competitively versus peers. You pointed that out. But just wondering where you guys think you are in terms of organic revenue growth? That's a little bit harder for us to see? Loren Starr : Yeah. I mean, I think we have a lot of things moving around in our mix. But I do believe, that given the significant growth on the institutional pipeline as we talked about, and certainly our cross border fund range, which is the fastest growing part of our business, certainly one of the fastest growing part of our business, is at a much higher fee rate than the firm overall. Our mix impact on revenue yield is actually a positive. But obviously, we are sort of going through some large step function changes with these acquisitions, that cloud trendlines. But I would say, the overall mix of the flows of the assets that are coming in, will still provide a higher list on our fee rate over the course of the years to come than being driven by more commoditized multi-product. Marty Flanagan : Let me answer that; and the way to think about it for us as an organization, I mean, I was talking about this earlier. So if you just think about the continuum of investment capabilities from upgraded indexes being very low fee, so you get what you paid for, and factor higher fee, high conviction, active higher alternative higher fee again. And so, when you see the mix of our business changing, where with the acquisitions of Guggenheim and Source and to factor sort of lower effective fee rate, but it's the response of the clients and it is a much more scaled business, where there is limited capabilities at some point with active capabilities, you know you close them down. So it's really, we think what's important about our business is, a range of capabilities and the fees that we have, they are competitive fees, and I think that's the other point, right? So you need that competitive fees and you have to have that continuum to meet the client needs. So that's really what Loren is getting to, where if you just looked in at our overall fee rate, it's quite difficult to ascertain and that it really gets back to the thing that Loren has pointed out, is our overall margin, as we are building the -- Loren Starr : We have said this before. I mean, the fee rate is one measure. But I mean, obviously the margin on some of these lower fee products are as good, if not better than the -- from an overall margin. So it requires scale and growth, which is what we plan to do with these products. So there is really a lot of things going on, that will drive cash flow or value going forward, and we are not trying to maximize fee rate, as a single kind of objective, if we will, we would probably not be as focused when going into ETFs and some institutional areas. But we do know that if we get good scale and growth, these things are going to provide huge upside on our margin. Operator : Thank you. Next question speakers is from Glenn Schorr of Evercore. Your line now is open. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Just two quick follow-ups; on the whole MiFID cost conversation, I just want to make sure, have you seen any evidence, have you had any client dialog that would suggest it would take on a more global nature in the coming two years? Marty Flanagan : No We know what you know, right? You have seen the public dialogs. I think just back to what Loren said, it created a complicated situation, the MiFID regulation versus the U.S. regulation, that's where you had really all the debates, publicly. I would just come back to what do we do? We are a responsible consumer of research. We will continue to be. We are well aware of the possibility of becoming a global event. And it is something that we think we will do very well, and I'd come back to. The good news is, a firm like us, we are in a position to do quite well with changes like that. The bad news is, if you are not a firm with scale, you are really disadvantaged, and I don't think that's a great outcome, but it is a fact of the matter. So we really don't know what the outcome is going to be, but we are adopting all the techniques that we did during MiFID, globally for us as a firm. So I wish I could be more specific. Glenn Schorr : No, that's helpful. I appreciate Marty. The last one I have is, I am just curious on how the rebalancing dialog is or is not happening with clients and consultants after such a divergence of returns in 2018 between equity and fixed income. I know it's more complex than that. I am just curious, if it is hot and heavy right now, if we expect, given the growth outlook for people to have equity allocations run higher? Just curious what you see? Marty Flanagan : Yeah. It's a good question. I can't say that I have any -- I have not picked up sort of the energy that you are describing. But I think a lot of institutional clients, I mean, they tend to have a longer term view and to react to that quickly, to environments like this. But I wish I had some more insights, but I really don't. Loren Starr : The only thing I could say, I mean, this seems to be just an increased appetite. So both on the retail and institutional side on asset allocation products. Ultimately it provides the flexibility and the nimbleness to navigate through these changes, which certainly are current in different ways in different parts of the regions that we operate in. So that is factoring in a big way, in terms of our pipeline of one not funded and potential opportunities, and certainly in some of our sort of recent positive activity around the retail side in the U.S. and also, I think asset allocation -- Marty Flanagan : That's a very good point. That's probably a good way to expand your opportunity with ETR and the likes. So I guess at some level, outside the conversations, individuals are -- institutions are really -- sort of both want to [indiscernible]. Glenn Schorr : Right. All right. Thank you both. That's awesome. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Kenneth Lee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line now is open. Kenneth Lee : Thanks for taking my question. Just stepping back, looking at the flow volatility organic growth chart; how do you think about any potential trade-offs between attaining higher organic growth rates and the impact on flow volatility potentially? And relatedly, wondering if the shift towards increasing exposure to institutional clients, would potentially impact flow volatility down the line? Marty Flanagan : Yeah. It's a good question. We would look forward to that problem. But [indiscernible], our intention is this. So underlying -- the fundamental fact is, the global diversification of the institution, the global retail institutional channels and the asset mix, those are underpins that will not change and I think that is really what is going to continue to keep this low volatility. Our focus is really by -- if we do a good job for clients, driving the gross number up and that is our focus. I really don't think you are going to all of a sudden see a switch to a very volatile environment. Now we all do know, the good news is when you win a large institutional mandate, you are very excited about it and then when you get terminated, you are less excited about it, because of the banks. But that is just the nature of what it is. Loren Starr : I mean the other thing I would say is, we are obviously -- in terms of the low standard deviation, I'd say a function of just the breadth of the capabilities that we offer in different regions, and I would say we probably have one of the greatest breadth of capabilities of the peers that we compete with. And we also have very focused approach around managing the portfolio and the investment teams will close them down, when they see that performance is being impacted by too much growth. And so you are not going to have huge concentration of assets in any particular capability, just because of the nature of sort of diminishing returns to clients. So we do think, we will probably be always be at the low end of the volatility side. What we are really trying to do is, through greater capabilities and effectiveness on our institutional platforms and also, scaling the capabilities that we have on a more global basis, so we can move the growth rate up. Kenneth Lee : Great. And just one bit about the performance fees; I think in the past you mentioned that real estate bank loans, private equity, these kind of products generate a lot of the performance fees. Just wondering, what drove most of the fees in this quarter, and also what's potentially driving the potential increase in guidance or performance fees in 2018? Thanks. Loren Starr : Yeah. So in terms of this quarter, we saw mostly, coming from real estate. About half of it -- bank loans was -- about the rest of it between that and global asset allocation. So those were the primary drivers. In terms of the buildup for 2018 and the guidance that we gave, it's going to be a very similar profile. We believe it will be coming from the similar places we have seen in the past, and so, again, and we continue to grow each of these areas in a very nice way. Kenneth Lee : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Loren Starr : No problem. Operator : Your next question is from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Your line now is open. Alex Blostein : Thanks for taking the question guys. Just one around the product specific issue; the performance in the U.K. business faced some challenges recently. I know they had a tough 2017 as well. Can you remind us, I guess, when you look at the equity business in the U.K., what the asset base today, sort of kind of what are the fee rates channels, and more importantly, I guess the sensitivity, you think the customer base there could have to such a meaningful underperformance, albeit over the short term basis? Loren Starr : So I think on U.K. retail is about $65 billion in total, and that is not all equity income, I think maybe less than half was equity income. So there is about 30 of that. Also we have some other places where that -- those products and that team operate. But it has become a much smaller part of the overall business, and in terms of impact, it has actually been really stable in performance, even though it's a little bit challenged, has not really driven outflows in the business in any material way. I mean, just -- I think, more than offset by what's going on in terms of the cross-border situation. So ultimately, there is some underperformance in that equity income capability, but it is certainly not stopping the growth of the overall U.K. retail business, given the GTR capabilities, the fixed income capabilities, pan-European equity capabilities. So at this point, certainly not creating enough business topic for us. Alex Blostein : Got it, great. And then just bigger picture going back to the full discussion, and just some -- really more of a clarification. But I guess, when I look at your target of 3% to 5% organic growth, I am assuming that follows the new convention of disclosing flows and I guess, based on 2017 results, reinvested dividends at about a percentage point or so to the organic growth, the way you guys describe it now. So is apples-to-apples, is this really kind of 2% to 4%, if we were to compare that to the way you guys used to talk about [indiscernible]? Loren Starr : Yeah. I mean, it would put us probably at the higher end of our aspirations of that range, sort of immediately versus the lower end because of that. So yeah, we certainly factor that into our thinking about, trying to get into that target. I mean, we have not reached that target, even with the capital gains investment. So we are feeling, in terms of getting to that level. So that I mean, we still think 3% to 5% would be a good place for us to get to. Alex Blostein : But the 3% to 5% is with the reinvested dividends? Loren Starr : It is. Alex Blostein : Yeah. Got it. Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Your line now is open. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Just a follow-up on the institutional. I guess, looking at the slide on -- slide 14, I just want to reconcile this year, kind of the quarterly growth sales being down each quarter year-over-year. But if I recall, your comments generally being close to record backlogs or backlogs all being up. So just throughout the year. So just curious as to kind of what -- just kind of connect the dots there for us? Loren Starr : Well I think the flow picture, as I mentioned, we had a lot of one, but not funded business that probably is going to come into fourth quarter, that has -- that got moved into 2018, and so it was actually surprising how many things moved. And I think it was just a little bit of the volatility around tax rates and knowing what was going to happen versus not. So that's my explanation, is that there was uncertainty which caused a slowdown, which should then be offset by a pickup in Q1. Dan Fannon : Okay. But I guess that's the 4Q, but if I recall throughout the year, you guys did talk about kind of high or record levels of backlog, and the gross sales were down throughout the year. I guess, I am just looking at the year-over-year dynamic, so is -- are the funding periods across the board, just taking a lot longer to materialize? Loren Starr : I mean it's a good question. I mean, a lot of the funding will take six months, could be longer in terms of what they ultimately require to get done. So there has been some movement within the pipeline around timing. That was probably more than we had expected generally. So granted, I think we do not see as much materialize on the sales side on the institutional business in 2017, as we would have originally expected based on the pipelines that we were looking at. We could say, well that's maybe the case, and possibly it is, other than I'd say our themes seem far more -- feeling like they [indiscernible] that the business is going to fund in 2018. Dan Fannon : Great. Thank you. Operator : And your next question is from Greggory Warren of Morningstar. Your line now is open. Greggory Warren : Yeah, good morning guys. Just wanted to follow-up a little bit on the retail distribution platforms. You noted that you wouldn't have that much of an issue, but just kind of curious, how much pressure is there on you guys or the industry on, I would say fees and performance, especially with a lot of the calling we have seen in the last two years, both from Merrill and Morgan Stanley. And then just, on top of that, how much of your actual platform is really exposed to what's going on within that particular part of the business? You have 68% of your business in retail, but I know it's not that much, as [indiscernible] opposed [ph] to say, what's going on with U.S. third party platforms? Marty Flanagan : Let me try to address some of it. So what are the factors that the platforms are looking at, it's really what they determine of the asset classes that they want on their platforms. They are looking at the quality of the managers, the historical performance and the competitive fee rates. And that is criteria, generally that is used, and also, once they get beyond a specific, if there is a -- if they can end up using fewer providers, that is also a factor, so those are sort of the criteria that we are judged on and we have done quite well. Taking on top of just the fund-by-fund analysis and I am going to lose track of the magnitude. But the last update I had on some of the platforms, more than a third of the managers, in total have been terminated. So it's just not a fund consolidation, but a manager consolidation at the same time. So that has been so -- I'd be repeating myself a little bit from the prior conversation. So it is the totality of the offering, so it's just not mutual funds, it is ETFs, it is also alternative capabilities, all of which that we have. So again, if we continue to have high quality capabilities, and we conserve our clients, which I think we do well, and we will continue to be one of the firms that will do quite well out of this. I think the other part of the focus, where the focus has not turned to, those managers that remain on the platform will be net beneficiaries, because of the obvious, there will be fewer managers and money will ultimately go to the managers and remain on. Now, that's not going to happen quickly, because your math -- [indiscernible] your math, if you have been taken off the platform, the client is not forced out of their holdings, which is exactly the right way to do it. So again, I don't know if I am telling anything you don't know, but that's our analysis. Greggory Warren : No I was just kind of curious, if there was any real pressure at all on you guys on that side. And I guess to follow-up on that, you talked about the smart beta products being sort of a newer entry for you guys on a lot of these platforms. And I am just curious, you were kind of earlier to the market with a lot of these products, but there has been a lot of additional competing products that have come on the market, since you guys bought PowerShares in the beginning. I am just wondering, do you feel like you are appropriately priced relative to what's going on? I mean, the fee compression hasn't been dire, and that part of the business has been in plain vanilla index. But I just wonder if you guys feel you are well positioned with that product set as well. Marty Flanagan : We do. And I think going back to my comments. If you just follow the notion of taking the investment capability and what are the returns are those meant to generate, so you just follow that right? Cap weighted index, which you shouldn't get much for it, it doesn't do much right. It was an exposure, it's important, a lot of money is gone into it. Probably too much money has gone into it. And I think also importantly, just because you launch an ETF, doesn't mean you are good at it. And I think there has been a lot of ETFs that will just fail. There is a low barrier to entry, a very high barrier to success, and it's much more than launching an ETF. And if you look at our smart beta ETF, it's one of the broadest range of ETFs with long track records. So 10 year track records, and I think that's also what is important. And it's just not the fee itself, it's also the liquidity with the ETFs, and I think that also has lost on a lot of people. So it really makes it difficult for new entrants and so if you have a long track record and some liquidity, it's a really important set of combinations, when you consider what clients are ultimately looking for. And so I think that bodes very well for factor investing as you look to the future on these [indiscernible]. Greggory Warren : Perfect Marty. That's good insight on that side. I just had one quick follow-up too on the MiFID II stuff. How much of your AUM is -- because you talk about tens of millions in class, but how much of that AUM does it really sort of relate to? Does it relate to everything that's in Europe, U.K. and Europe exclusive? I mean, I know some of that is probably institutional, so probably not as exposed. But I am just sort of curious, how much of your AUM is really sort of exposed to the MiFID II rules, and that's going to cost you more to pay for the research? Loren Starr : Yeah. I mean, it's largely the European business, so you'd have to look at the full value of that AUM, which is hundreds of billions. Greggory Warren : So probably about -- you have $238 billion right now. So I'd assume maybe 5% of that is institutional, or is it --? Loren Starr : Probably about 10% that's institutional of that business. Greggory Warren : Okay, it's perfect. Thanks guys. Good quarter. Marty Flanagan : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. At this time, there are no further questions in the queue. Marty Flanagan : Great. Well thank you very much for everybody's time and happy 2018. We will be in touch soon. Operator : Thank you, speakers. And that concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Welcome to Invesco's First Quarter Results Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now, I would like to turn the call over to your speakers for today, Marty Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Thank you very much; and thank you, everybody for joining us. And if you're so inclined, you can follow along the presentation, which is on our website. And as has been our practice, I'll hit some of the highlights of the business during the first quarter; Loren will go into greater details within the financials of the quarter; I will then spend a few minutes really talking about some of the key differentiators of our strategy and put that in the context of growth opportunities; and then, of course, we'll open up to Q&A. So, let me begin by highlighting the operating results for the first quarter, and that's on page 4 if you happen to be following along. Long-term investment performance remained strong during the quarter. We had net inflows of $300 million during the quarter. We did see the impact of market volatility, impacting investor behavior, which impacted net flows during the quarter negatively. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 37.3% versus 39.6% in the prior quarter. We did return $120 million to shareholders through dividends during the quarter. And reflecting the strength of the business and the focus on providing returns to shareholders, we are increasing the quarterly dividend to $0.30, which is a 3.4% increase. Turning to page 5. You'll note the investment performance continues to be strong in a three and five-year basis, 68% and 70%, respectively. And although the long-term investment performance remained strong, we did see headwinds in one-year numbers, the short-term numbers being impacted by some relative underperformance in some of the larger strategies in the U.S. and the UK. Turning to flows. What we did see is quite a bit of demand for our passive capabilities, and which is very robust, with particular strength in our commodity ETFs, both in Europe and the United States during the quarter. On the active side, and in our retail business, the flow environment remained somewhat challenged with the uptick in volatility, which I mentioned, in particular, in the U.S. and UK equities, as well as outflows from our sub-advised REIT in Japan. As an offset, we did see strong institutional demand and solid flows in areas such as stable value, Global Targeted Return and a number of our quantitative strategies globally. With that, as a summary, let me turn it to Loren and have him go to more detail in the financial results. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Thanks very much, Marty. So, quarter-over-quarter, our total AUM decreased $3.4 billion or 0.4%. That was driven by market losses of $12.2 billion. We saw outflows from non-management fee earning AUM of $0.4 billion. These factors were somewhat offset by a positive foreign exchange of $7.9 billion. We saw our reinvested distributions of $0.6 billion positive. Inflows into our institutional money market products came in at $0.4 billion; and then, we had long-term net inflows of $0.3 billion. Our average AUM for the first quarter was $951.3 billion. That was up 2.3% versus Q4. Our annualized long-term organic growth rate for the quarter was 0.2 percentage points compared to negative 0.8 percentage points in the fourth quarter. So, before turning to net revenue yield, I just wanted to provide a quick update on a change this quarter to our presentation of AUM in response to investor feedback and to provide greater transparency into the composition of changes in our AUM. We reverted to our historical presentation of sales-driven long-term flows and presented reinvested distributions on a separate line item in our AUM tables. So, you will see that in the back. We have also restated the third and fourth quarter of 2017 to allow for a consistent presentation and comparability. So, now, let's turn to the net revenue yield discussion. Our net revenue yield came in at 40.3 basis points; and our net revenue yield excluding performance fees was 39.9 basis points. And that was a decrease of 1.4 basis points versus Q4. We saw two fewer days in the quarter. That reduced the yield by 0.9 basis points. The impact in the change in asset mix, and the growth, we saw a non-fee earning AUM reduce the yield by 0.7 basis points. And we also saw an impact of the new revenue recognition standard, which I'll mention a little bit later. And that reduced the yield by 0.2 basis points. And then we saw also a decrease in other revenues, reducing the yield by 0.1 basis points. So, all these factors were then somewhat offset by positive foreign exchange impact on the mix, which added 0.5 basis points. So, a lot of puts and takes there. Anyway, given the changes discussed above, and the continuation of changes in our asset mix, and our focus on strategically pricing our products remain competitively positioned with new and existing clients, we expect our net revenue yield for the remainder of 2018 to come in at approximately 40 basis points, which is about 1 basis point less than our original guidance. And again, this guidance assumes flat markets and foreign exchange from today's level. Slide 9 provides our U.S. GAAP operating results for the quarter as is customary. My comments today will focus exclusively on the variances related to our non-GAAP adjusted measures, which you'll find on slide 10. And before returning to these results, I just want to quickly touch on the impact of this new revenue recognition accounting standard that impacted our revenues and expenses. So, overall, this new reporting standard has changed the way we present certain revenue and fund-related expenses and has an impact on many of our revenue line items. The method we elected to adopt this guidance did not require us to restate prior periods. Our Q1 2018 results are presented under the new guidance, but the Q4 2017 numbers are presented under the old guidance. So, that will impact the variances quarter-over-quarter, as we'll discuss. We have included in the appendix a slide that shows the line item impact that the new standard has on our revenues and expenses for the first quarter of 2018. And as you'll note, the revenue recognition changes have reduced gross revenues by $19.6 million. However, the overall impact to our operating income margin and net revenues are immaterial. So, let's now get to the non-GAAP operating results on slide 10. You'll see that net revenue decreased by $46.9 million or 4.7% quarter-over-quarter to $958 million, which includes a positive foreign exchange impact of $16 million. The impact of revenue recognition reduced net revenues by $4.2 million. So, excluding these impacts, net revenue decreased $58.7 million, and let's get into the variance there. So, within that number you'll see that adjusted investment management fees decreased by $52.4 million or 4.7% to $1.07 billion. The impact of revenue rec reduced adjusted investment management fees by $53.8 million. FX increased these fees by $16.8 million. And so, excluding these two changes, our adjusted investment management fees decreased by $15.4 million quarter-over-quarter, which primarily reflects two fewer days in the quarter, which was partially offset by higher average AUM. Our adjusted service and distribution revenues increased by $28.6 million or 13.1%. Compared to Q4, the impact of revenue recognition increased adjusted service and distribution revenues by $32.4 million. Excluding these changes, our adjusted service and distribution revenues decreased by $3.8 million, which primarily reflects fewer days in the quarter. Adjusted performance fees came in at $9.1 million in Q1 and were primarily earned from real estate, U.K. equity, and bank loans products. The $34.2 million decline from the fourth quarter was driven by the large real estate performance fee recognized in the prior quarter. Adjusted other revenues in the quarter came in at $58.1 million, an increase of $39.7 million from the prior quarter. The impact of revenue recognition changes increased adjusted other revenues by $41 million. Excluding that change, our adjusted other revenues decreased modestly by $1.3 million. Next, adjusted third-party distribution, service and advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues, that increased $20.6 million or 7.3%. So, the impact of revenue recognition changes increased. Our adjusted third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses by $23.8 million. Foreign exchange increased adjusted third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses by $1.3 million. Excluding these two changes, our adjusted third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses increased by $3.5 million largely driven by some non-recurring reductions in third-party expense, which were recognized in the prior quarter. So, now, let's move to expenses. Overall, moving down, you'll see that our adjusted operating expenses at $600.7 million decreased by $6.7 million or 1.1%. Relative to Q4, the impact of revenue recognition reduced our adjusted operating expenses by $4.2 million. FX increased adjusted operating expenses by $8.8 million in the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenue recognition and FX, our adjusted operating expenses decreased by $11.3 million. Looking to the adjusted employee comp number that came in at $389.5 million, that was an increase of $11.5 million or 3%. Foreign exchange increased our adjusted compensation expense by $5.5 million. Excluding FX, adjusted employee comp increased $6 million, which reflects seasonal payroll taxes, as well as employee benefit costs, which was partially offset by decreases in our variable compensation costs. Our adjusted marketing expenses in Q1 decreased by $11.1 million or 27.9% to $28.7 million, reflecting again a seasonal decrease from Q4 related client events and marketing campaigns. Our adjusted property, office and tech expense came in at $101.3 million. That was an increase of $0.5 million or 0.5% over the fourth quarter. That was in line with the guidance that we provided last quarter. Foreign exchange increased our adjusted property, office and tech expense by $1.2 million. Next, going onto the adjusted G&A expense. That came in at $81.2 million. That was a decrease of $7.6 million or 8.6% quarter-over-quarter. The impact of revenue recognition reduced our adjusted G&A expenses by $4.2 million. Foreign exchange increased our adjusted G&A expense by $1.6 million. Excluding these two points, our adjusted G&A expenses decreased $5 million, and that decrease reflects lower legal and regulatory costs, reduced irrecoverable taxes in the quarter, lower travel costs during the quarter, while MiFID II costs were in line with expected levels in this quarter. And then, of course, they were not there in the prior quarter. Our adjusted non-operating income decreased $23.1 million compared to the fourth quarter, reflecting the difference in mark-to-market of our seed money investments compared with the prior quarter. The firm's effective tax rate on pre-adjusted net income in Q1 was 20.6%, in line with guidance. And that provides us with our adjusted EPS of $0.67 and adjusted net operating margin of 37.3%. So, before turning over to Marty, I just want to touch on a few topics. First, long-term flows in April. Overall, the flow picture has been a bit volatile with good growth opportunities, but we have also seen a spike-up in redemptions. Through the month of April, we have experienced net outflows in the current month of approximately $3.5 billion. That was driven largely by a single sovereign wealth-related outflow and as well as a sub-advised mandate that outflowed. It's not great news, but certainly, we don't expect that trend to continue through the quarter. On capital management, certainly something we want to touch on for 2018 now that we've completed the acquisition of the Guggenheim ETF business. The transaction was completed in early April. We funded it with a combination of approximately 30% cash and 70% borrowing on our short-term credit facility. As previously noted, our goal is to pay down the balance of that credit facility over the course of 2018 to bring our leverage ratios back in line with pre-acquisition levels. And after our leverage ratios are reduced to these levels that we should return to a share buyback that's consistent with our historical practice. And our current estimate is that will occur sometime in the fourth quarter. Let's move on to a topic we're all near and dear, is organic growth. So, I really want to talk about what to expect through the remainder of 2018 and then looking into 2019. The chart on slide 11 shows the composition of our flows over the last nine years. And I think it helps to explain why the diversification of our business is actually significantly benefiting us. Each region, you'll see, has been the largest annual flow contributor at some point during the last nine years. And the firm's diversification has helped to drive overall positive organic growth in each period. We see that diversifying our capabilities and our offerings in each region where we operate certainly allows us to better serve our clients and makes us stronger by not being overly reliant on any one geography, distribution channel, or asset class. Next, just turning \u2013 slide 12, this is a slide you've seen before. Looks at the relationship between organic growth and the consistency or variability of that growth for Invesco and its public asset management peers. On the vertical axis is the average annual organic growth rate for the five-year period 2013 through 2017. And then on the horizontal axis is the standard deviation of those flows to reflect the level of sustainability or variability of the organic growth. So, when viewing Invesco against this group, it's evident that our diversification is benefiting us. Invesco has one of the lowest standard deviations of flows in the group, and it reflects a high level of flow consistency. We've previously talked about the long-term target, however, of the 3% to 5% organic growth. And we'll cover that in more detail today in the areas that will drive that growth. But looking at the remainder of 2018, and given the overall volatility of markets, and given some performance challenges we (00:17:40) larger products, which have been completely a function of the market environment we've been in, realistically, we think our growth rate will continue to be around historic levels that we've seen for this year. But looking past 2018, however, as many of the critical investments we're making in the business start to gain traction, and as we generate increased flows, we believe that organic growth can move into that targeted 3% to 5% range that we had discussed with you in the past. And with that, I'm going to turn it over back to Marty, who will actually cover some of these growth areas in greater detail. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Thank you, Loren. And I'm on page 14, again, if you're so inclined to follow along. And so, I did want to pick up on our strategy and put in the context of the opportunities and competitive advantages that we believe we are creating. A number of you have been owners of the company for many years and following it for many years, so the foundational elements of the company are well-understood. I'd also say the key strengths are well understood. What is less understood is really four of the key growth drivers that we really think are improving our competitive position in a meaningful way. And I'm going to spend a few minutes on them today. So, ETFs being one; factors being the second; solutions; and finally, digital advice, which includes Jemstep. So, building these growth drivers continues to be a primary focus of our organization. And we really think it is improving our competitive advantage, which will lead to greater growth opportunities. And it's the combination of our comprehensive range of investment capabilities, our global presence, our focus in both retail and institutional channel that differentiates us in the market and positions us for growth and success over the long-term. So, over the next few slides, I'm going to just spend a minute on each one of these growth drivers, but importantly, show you how they come together, and that is really what creates a competitive advantage. Any firm might have one of these growth drivers; very few firms have all four of them. And the ability to put them together is really what creates the greatest opportunity in our mind. So, turning to page 15, turning to ETFs. Over the past year, we've meaningfully expanded our ETF business, which ranks as the fourth largest in the U.S. and globally. And in total, our ETF business has grown sixtyfold over the past 12 years. We know, and you know, being first to market has a clear advantage in the ETF space. We now have more than 50 funds, with assets greater than $500 million. We noted earlier in the year that we are moving to a single brand, Invesco, throughout the organization globally. And this is really going to enable us to strengthen our brand positioning and consolidate our marketing spend behind the growth drivers, which we think will actually be meaningful over time. We've been a pioneer of smart beta since 2003, and now rank as number second in market share in smart beta and assets under management globally, trailing the market leader by only $9 billion. With regard to this market share, the delta is less than 3 percentage points between ourselves and the number one position. Turning to factors on page 17. Our aspiration is to be a global market leader in factor investing, leveraging our significant expertise and experience, as well as our strong investment capabilities across both the retail and institutional channels. The existing and long-term market potential for factor investing is quite significant, in our opinion. However, as we have noted previously, saying you can do factor investing and actually delivering are not the same thing. You really need to develop and maintain special skills and the expertise to deliver the results that client expect from these capabilities. As importantly, you need to have the infrastructure and resources to educate financial advisors, RIAs, partner with institutions and others on how to use these capabilities appropriately within portfolios. And our focus on education is helping us deepen our relationship with platforms and key institutional clients, while also, over time, will broaden the market opportunity for us. Invesco has more than 40 years of experience in factor investing across a variety of investment teams, which has helped us build a solid foundation of client relationships and assets under management. We are intensely focused on executing an integrated global plan for factor investing that encompasses client needs, analysis, product development, and further expansion of our considerable expertise in this market. Turning to solutions on page 19. Our solutions capability is both a growth driver and an enabler within our business, as we continue to build out this important capability to help us better meet client needs and strengthen our competitive advantage. Our ability to design, implement and manage custom portfolios, investment solutions, leveraging our comprehensive range of investment capabilities is helping us enhance relationship with advisors and clients and strengthen product innovation. And I do want to make the point, you cannot be a credible solutions provider if you don't have the broad, deep set of investment capabilities which we have. Our Solutions team also supports our Distribution teams with investment and analytical expertise that helps them better partner with clients and deepen relationships. With our broad range of investment capabilities and vehicles, Invesco is one of very \u2013 a small number of firms that can truly be product-agnostic in developing outcome-oriented solutions to meet client needs. To build on this competitive advantage over the past years, we developed one of the strongest most experienced solutions team in the industry. The team is entirely focused on helping clients meet their investment objectives. Turning to digital advice. We are very much in the process of developing the full potential of our digital advice platform, Jemstep. Our position as one of the first digital solutions in the market for advisors and our focus on providing an open architecture platform are enabling us to build this capability meaningfully. As you can see on slide 21, we are live with a major bank in the U.S., as well as 20 smaller clients. We're onboarding two additional major banks, as we speak and a leading insurer during this year also. We're strongly positioned to be a market leader provider with banks and credit unions and are seeing solid emerging demand in the RIA channel. Our focus in 2018 and beyond is to extend this capability globally. A key advantage of our digital advice effort is it gives us access to much broader range of clients, while also providing opportunity to expand our distribution of our investment capabilities. So, we are currently pursuing impactful combinations of these key capabilities that will unlock disproportionate opportunities for Invesco by allowing us to serve key markets in new ways. And here's an example on page 22, if you're so inclined to follow. We're currently onboarding a firm with a network of more than 200 banks and credit unions. They selected Jemstep as their digital advice partner to deploy across the network. They selected our solutions team as a strategist for creating portfolios tailored to meet their client needs. Our ETFs are being used as the underpin for small account portfolios on a network. And lastly, Invesco Consulting, which works alongside the Distribution teams, will provide education and support to drive the adoption of the platforms. And it's our ability to bring these capabilities together to meet client needs in key markets and channels that's really a powerful differentiator and will help us grow our business in the future. This approach provides meaningful benefits to clients and helps us create new relationships and deepen the current relationships that we have. For 2018, our focus is on bringing together combinations of our growth drivers and our investment capabilities in a seamless and effective manner. This approach will enable us to focus the power of our global platform to help meet client needs and drive growth. So, some examples of the power of the integration of these different capabilities on our platform include : a combination of three regional institutional business with our solutions capability, which would enable us to become a leader in addressing the $30 trillion institutional market globally; bringing together multi-sector, our Asian institutional business, factor investing and solution, which would help us further penetrate the institutional market by bringing together the best of Invesco in solutions, factor investing and multi-sector capabilities; and finally, a combination of factor investing, digital advice, ETFs in the EMEA retail market, which would enable us to grow our UK digital advice business, with independent financial advisors and platforms by using next-generation individualized products, which is an emerging need in that marketplace. So, as I mentioned at the outset, it's really the combination of our comprehensive range of investment capabilities, our global presence, our focus on both the retail and institutional channel that differentiates us in the marketplace and positions us for growth and success over the long term. We are truly excited about the potential for the growth opportunities that these key factors and capabilities bring to the organization and to our clients. And we'll continue to update you as we make progress along. And with that, we'll stop; and Loren and I will open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. Okay. The first question comes from Michael Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks, guys. Loren, maybe first one, just on the expense line items, I guess, just curious, given some of the moves, any update on how we should be thinking about 2018 relative to like the guidance that you gave on the last call, just whether it's by line item or just overall how we should be thinking about the expense? Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. Good question. So, we would expect the guidance to be, I mean, largely intact except for compensation is going to flex down in the sense that revenues are down, competition flexes down, too. So, without getting too explicit, I think we'll see where that goes. But it's probably some $10 million less than we had guided previously. So, you're in more like the $400 million to $405 million per quarter range going through 2018. So, that's one change to the guidance in theory. And then, the other one would be G&A, which has the revenue recognition impact. So, $4.2 million has moved from G&A up to the revenue line items. And so, that would be a reduction of G&A by $4.2 million. So, those would be the two I'd point you to. Obviously, we will continue to look at trying to be more effective and efficient with our resources. And it really will depend on what sort of market environment we're going to end up in. It's been rather volatile. But certainly, people should understand that we are all currently flexed down comp in light of lower revenues. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, thanks. And then just a follow-up, Marty. I think you pointed out a lot that the investments being made, and you have a lot of the products that when we look at where the demand is you're seeing in the industry. Just as you think about transitioning from, say, 2018 to 2019 and beyond, Loren mentioned, you're sort of getting to that 3% to 5% new growth rate. Like how should we be thinking about what it means to whether it's like the fee rate and revenue growth in the next couple of years, and then also, like the incremental margins? So, trying to translate a lot of the investments in the strategic impact, and ultimately, to the financials longer term. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. So, look, we look at these with a high conviction that this is where any of the market is going. And again, just like many of us, just traveling world, being in Asia, being in EMEA, and obviously, in the United States, the time spent with the clients, more and more, is very clear to me that clients and platforms are dealing with fewer firms. Having strong investment capabilities is very important, but reality, I'd say, going forward, it's table stakes. And the greater traction that we're seeing is the broader range of capabilities that we have the, the engagements with solutions, and even large sophisticated institutions looking for us to partner with them with analytical tools, even though they have those capabilities, it's really a very different mindset that is emerging. And so, we see that those are the things that are going to continue to provide growth. So, the overall effect of fee rate though, I really put in the context is it's really going to be driven by where the clients are building their portfolios. And as we are moving much more towards growing the factor capability in ETFs, the relative fee rate is lower than alternatives or high conviction active, and so, the blend's really going to depend on where clients go. So, I can't give you a specific answer to where the fee rate goes, but what I do know the growth and profitability will continue to be \u2013 enhances our growth and earnings as we go forward. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. And, Mike, I think in terms of incremental margins, I mean, certainly for this year, we're probably still in the range that we've been talking about historically for this year, that sort of 40% to 50% incremental margin. Longer term, I don't think anybody sort of said we're changing the long-term view being closer to that 50% to 65%. Obviously, we will continue to sort of see how the market is shifting and changing. But certainly, what we're doing is we're trying to build scale in our capabilities, which has very positive incremental margin impacts by doing so and trying to get a little bit less subscale in some parts of our capabilities. So, overall, I think we're still quite optimistic on the incremental margin story. But that's changing landscape still with us getting into some new areas like digital advice, still brand new. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So, Marty, you highlighted that Invesco is top two in smart beta in terms of AUM. What we'd really like to see is Invesco rank top two in sales of smart beta. So, you're buying, you bought two positively selling firms, Source and Guggenheim, that helps. It doesn't quite get you to top three in the U.S. So, are the aspirations to be top three? And if so, can you give us maybe some more specifics on that path to break into the top one, two, or three? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. So, where our aspirations are, is really to be the leader in smart beta factor. We think that's where the greatest impact is for clients, where there emerging need is, that has been our focus, it will continue to be our focus. The last two, Guggenheim and Source, have been very, very important. Guggenheim's been closed all of the handful of weeks. The early responses are very, very positive. We are now in the mode of getting the range of those Guggenheim ETFs on the platforms. They were not broadly placed at all. That is the opportunity for us, which will drive the growth flows (00:35:05) that you're talking about. We don't drive that timetable, but we've met with all the important platforms as you would imagine. The feedback's been extremely positive, but I can't tell you what their timeframe is for making those decisions. But, outside of that, the interactions that we've had with the FAs has been very, very strong already. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. In terms of the April outflow number, $3.5 billion from the sovereign wealth fund and sub-advised. Can you talk about the regions that this is taking place in and maybe the asset classes of the outflows? And ultimately, what happened here? Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: All right. So, in terms of the region, the large sovereign wealth happened in our EMEA region. And the asset class was active equity, sub-advised U.S. active equity as well. They were not performance-based decisions; these were client-based decisions entirely. Our performance was excellent in these products. So, again, I think, for the sub-advised, different models being employed, going to index versus active. And then, in the sovereign wealth, I think it's very specific to the client's needs for our cash. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Okay. And then, a tiny one. Loren, based on Guggenheim's ending AUM and based on the fee reductions and the tax code changes, what do the IRRs look like for that Guggenheim deal now? Has it gone up, or has it gone down? Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: So, I think, again, early days to see, if we're going to change and maybe improve our growth trajectory, above and beyond what we have had originally modeled, because it's early days. I think we have a slightly lower IRR, just given some of the fee reductions that you heard about on the BulletShares. But that impact was probably just 1 percentage point of IRR, so still, solidly in the 20s. And then EPS creation probably nicked off $0.01 in 2018, as a result of that. And again, so I think, it's modest move off of those prior levels. Hopefully, we can make that up to higher growth. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Okay. Thank you very much. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Brennan Hawken of UBS. Your line is now open. Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Hoping you could walk through maybe in a little more specificity the factors that drove you to lower your expectation for the revenue yield from here? Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. No problem, Brennan. So, we have a few things coming through. So, starting kind of at the 41 basis points, which was our original guidance. It's really AUM mix in terms of growth in non-revenue fee generating assets as well as where we're seeing the flows, which are more recently biased to lower fee products. And so, that's about 0.5 basis point. The revenue recognition changes, which we talked about a little bit already, we think that's going to be about 0.3 basis points off of our original guidance, which had no rev rec impact there. Strategic pricing initiatives, just generally call that, pricing our products in a way that keeps them competitive. That's probably 0.1 basis point impact. Foreign exchange is about 0.1 basis points negative, too. So, if you add up all those things, you go from 41 basis points to 40 basis points. Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you for that. And then, when we think about fee rate, hearing about more competition, more pressure on fees, especially in Europe, in light of MiFID and some of the increased clarity \u2013 transparency there. What are your expectations for fee pressure in the region, and how do you think that, that's going to play through here on Invesco, broadly? How should we frame that as analysts and investors? Thanks. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. Our view really has not changed. I think, what we are seeing in the landscape is focus on value for money. And we still say, you have to be competitively priced. And what we are seeing in most regions of the world, but probably, to varying different degrees, a broader use from cap weighted indexes, to factors, to high conviction active and alternatives. And yeah, that's really what's going to drive the mix. And yeah, that's part of what we're seeing as an organization as we continue to bring factors up to a broader part of the footprint for us as an organization. So, I don't know that I can give you any greater insight than what you're seeing within the organization and what we've talked about historically. Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : No, that helps, Marty, for sure. I guess, I'm just \u2013 and certainly, at least you guys are positioned to a point where you have the factors, so you're in a good position to retain the assets to the extent that they become at risk. But, if we want to think about clients remixing their traditional active into like a smart beta solution, you believe you're well-positioned to retain the assets, although maybe continued fee pressure through mix is probably something that we should assume here, it seems as though, from that region, for you guys. Is that fair? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: I think, that's fair. But what you are still seeing though, and it's more pronounced in United States than in the UK, on the continent right now. So, you continue to see a very high use of high conviction active portfolios. We are seeing that still, so you've not seen that issue. The issue that you do see, probably UK, in particular, has been a very high degree of focus. And I'd say rightfully on sort of closet indexers that are \"active investors,\" and that is the most at risk group of money managers. We are not anywhere near that category. And so, from that perspective, we think we are very strongly placed. Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. That helps a lot. Thanks. And hopefully, you can, of course, pick up more share in smart beta than it was elsewhere, so. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: That's right. Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. I get it. Thank you. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: That's the intention. Yeah, thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. I just want to clarify, Loren, your comments about this year's growth rate. I think you said similar levels to thus far, so kind of slightly positive for the first quarter. Are you including April in that kind of trajectory of the year? Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. No question. I mean, I think April was an anomaly, we certainly don't expect that to be a monthly run rate. It was really specific to two events that we don't think are going to be recurring. We'll get into a bit of pipeline. Institutional pipeline is still strong, still at the high level. I think we have seen some creeping up of redemptions generally, and so I think that's sort of something that just keeps us a little less optimistic about getting to a higher level of growth rate than we've historically seen. Overall, opportunities still exist on sales. So, I think when you look at what to expect in 2018, I think, again just looking to more recent history, is probably the right basis point \u2013 or the right point of focus. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Look, I think you all are having your conversations with your clients, too. And what we are definitely \u2013 there's more unease and conviction and where equity markets are going in particular. And we have seen people get more defensive \u2013 or the conversations are more defensive than what we've seen historically. That can change as rapidly as it turned into that. And again, that is the one large redemption that Loren talked about that was exactly a result of moving to a defensive position. It's very hard for us, and frankly, impossible to predict those decisions. They tend to happen pretty quickly. And where we have insight into the positive pipeline, we tend to not to do a great job of, as we've been very direct historically, is when people make these other decisions based on our portfolio repositioning. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Got it. And then, just a follow-up on that, like the sub-advised loss. I think this is the second one at least you guys have flagged in recent months. Can you give us a sense of kind of how big that \u2013 broadly, the sub-advised U.S. book is? And is that something you expect to kind of shrink over time, or is that stable growth kind of any outlook within that? Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah, it's a great question. The overall sub-advised book is more than $30 billion, and so, it's not small. When I asked that exact same question, I think \u2013 the answer is that this is not a trend. This is really just specific clients who have made some things. And yes, there's been a few data points of it happening, but I don't think there's any expectation on our side that this is going to just sort of all go away. I think it is a factor. Several factors come into play in terms of these clients making these decisions. They're not all the same in terms of how they're being made. But, there is a handful of (00:45:13) of onesies and twosies that are chunky. So, that's our hope based on our best intelligence. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Got it. Thank you. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Yes. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Bill Katz of Citigroup. Your line is now open. William Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Could we come back to Jemstep for a moment? Can you give us a sense of how to sort of potentially size the revenue or the flows, and maybe even the timing of when you think some of the onboarding might translate into unit growth, and kind of think about some of the top line impact to that? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. So, the timing again has not changed, right. Where we will start to see an impact is 2019, and it's once these institutions are on the platform. And we'll have to give you greater insight into the impact. I would imagine it will be a relatively slow build, but what we are seeing, is what's really going to happen after these institutions, is the pipeline just getting that much more robust and much bigger onboarding into 2019. But we'll have to \u2013 as we get further into the year and have a greater sense of conviction, then we'll have that conversation. I would be uncomfortable in extrapolating that right now. William Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And this is a \u2013 so, a two-part, I apologize, but unrelated question. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: (00:46:42). William Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: On the $3.5 billion of \u2013 sorry to keep coming back to the same number, but the $3.5 billion, could you frame out the size of the one-offs, if you will? And then, where are you seeing the traction? And then a broader question is I'm sort of reading a lot about pricing pressure in the European ETF market. Sort of wondering if you could talk about how you think you're positioned in terms of where the business is today from a price perspective, and what kind of risk there might be from a sort of revenue degradation perspective? Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: So, on the $3.5 million, it was about $2 billion for the sovereign, $1.5 billion for the sub-advised, so that was kind of the mix, all decent fees unfortunately. So, the pricing pressure, I think, is probably more profound on the smart beta, in general ETF space. I mean, as we're looking at how we position products against some of the competitors, and it's not everything has to go to a lower price, but making sure that our product lineup, particularly like Guggenheim coming over, is priced so it's competitively positioned against similar products of similar size, is critical for success. And so, I'd say, that's probably where our focus is most on sort of strategically pricing product. I think on the active product, to the extent that we have capabilities that are good, there's probably far less need for us to think about changing the pricing on those products, because one, they're generally priced well and in line with competitors; and number two, there's value there in terms of the alpha that they have historically generated into sort of \u2013 buy flows or buy assets through lowering fees has not been our strategy. And I don't know, Marty, if you got... Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah, no. I agree with it. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. William Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you for taking the question guys. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Yes. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to start on Jemstep. And really appreciate the color on slide 12, so thanks for that. But how should we think about the net flow potential in 2019 from the six large financial institutions that should be live at some point this year? And I'm really just thinking about how should we frame this potential, because it's really a brand new source of business for you guys. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah, no. It is no question, it is \u2013 we believe it's really important competitive advantage for us. It is also consistent with what we've been talking about. We see the future is \u2013 being a strong set of investment capabilities is very important, but it's table stakes. And it's these types of developments is really what's going to create this competitive advantage and the necessity that's being driven as we look forward. So, again, Bill asked the same question. I really am not in a position to give you the potential sizing of the flow into 2019 at this point in time. The fact is, the institutions are large, and we would anticipate that we will be successful, as we serve them going forward. And yeah, I wish, I could give you more insights, but I would... Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Well, we have no data... Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: I guess, yeah. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: ...to base it on, really. So, I think we have a clear view that out to 2020 and kind of if this all kind of happens the way we think it is, I mean, we're talking about substantial amounts of assets with not so much penetration. I mean, even assuming modest penetration... Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: I mean we're certainly in the tens of billions, $50 billion \u2013 I mean, that kind of number of the assets being gathered through digital advice. How it gets there, because we don't have enough really to trend line anything, is what is the problem for us, Bill (sic) [Craig] (50:43), that, it's just too hard for us to guess. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And then just as my follow-up on the ETF approval process. The SEC is now allowing more asset managers to self-index, and also looks like there's a potential SEC ETF rule that could further lower the barriers to entry. I'm just wondering, do you think a more open policy from regulators could open the door to more competition, or is it sort of like what I think Dan Draper always says, that ETFs have a very low barrier to entry, but a much higher barrier to succeed. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah, we believe that very strongly, and I think evidence would \u2013 and the facts would support that. We've been at this now over a decade. Just having an ETF does not mean you're going to be successful, and the range of capability and the knowledge that goes along with it is really quite different. It is not a natural extension to whether it'd be historical, retail, distribution success or institutional success either. It is quite different. And so, will it bring on new ETFs? Probably. Do we think it's going to change our competitive positioning? I don't think so. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Glenn Schorr of Evercore. Your line is now open. Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC : Hi. Thanks. So, when looking at the pickup in \u2013 I don't want to call it churn, but just activity, lots of sales, lots of redemptions, pick-up, up and down, do you think that's mostly just a function of the obvious in volatility and people's changing macro outlook? And what I want to really get to is how much of it relates to the ins and outs related to broker/dealer channel shrinking (00:52:44) consolidating relationships, and focusing on model portfolios, things like that? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. So, my sense of it is, it's the right question. And if you look at the gross and the net in the quarter, the outflows, I think, it's much more related to the sentiment change within the quarter, just the magnitude of the change. And Loren's hit on a couple things that we've seen happen. I think to your point of the narrowing of the platforms in the U.S. in particular, that is going to put money in motion. But remember, being taken off the platform, or having your fund not available for future sales is not foreseeing immediate redemptions. So, I don't think that's \u2013 that's going to take time. The people that, and the capabilities that remain on those platforms, they will be net beneficiaries, but I see that being slower than you might imagine because of, again, the correct answer, not foreseeing a client out of a capability that they chose to be in. Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC : I appreciate that. The only follow-up I have there is, I think you and pretty much every other player that we all covered will talk towards the ability to try to cap \u2013 or the desire to try to capture flows as they move and client sentiment changes. So, as this is going on right now, you have this awesome relationship within the channels, if you will, are we capturing as much as you'd like? In other words, if people are selling out certain components of active equity, switching into fixed income, switching to risk managers, switching even into cash, like are you capturing that within the channel? Because $56 billion in, $56 billion out looks like a flat today, but there's a whole lot more underneath the cover. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. No, you're right. Look, I would say, the fact is we were \u2013 I would say, we are not capturing what we would want to. And so, how do you change that? And I think historical efforts will not change that at all, right. So, historical practices of being in front of a platform or an FA aren't going to change it. So, what will change it are things that we started to employ in \u2013 last year was really the pilot, and in really much more in action right now. And it's our use of predictive analytics, and it has been incredibly beneficial to us. And you can really start to see \u2013 actually, literally predict where FAs are going to be putting money, where they're about to redeem, and we are using that in a very positive way to do exactly what you're talking about. So, yeah, again, we're 12 months into it right now. Does it show up in the numbers? Not to the degree that would change your, as you say, the $56 billion in, $56 billion out, but we think it's that those types of things that will create the very different outcomes going forward. And again, I think it gets back to this topic that we have collectively been talking about the competitive environment. You need to have the financial resources and the wherewithal to invest in those technologies to be effective going forward. And I'm just not sure that the totality of the money managers in the industry is going to have that wherewithal. Those that do will end up being much stronger going forward, and we happen to be one of them. Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC : All right. Thanks very much, Marty. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Kenneth Lee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Kenneth S. Lee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : The targeted organic growth range of 3% to 5%. What's the expectation in terms of which asset categories could be either above or below this range? And specifically, which can be the biggest contributors toward that growth rate? Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: So, I mean, the good question, I think it's going to depend on what sort of market environment we're in. We're really looking at this more from a function that we have this broad set of capabilities that we can bring together in conjunction with sort of catalysts around digital advice, factors just generally \u2013 so, these are kind of general themes that cut across asset classes. And so, I would say, I mean, generally, we think passive is probably going to continue to grow at a faster rate than active. So, that's one aspect to the 3% to 5%. Whether it's going to be fixed income versus equity, versus alternatives that's a little harder to predict, although I think we're pretty well-positioned with both shares in particular to grow that asset class in the passive space. But I don't think we are able to really lay it out with that degree of specificity with any sense of certainty, other than kind of the active versus passive split, I think, is probably the most real (00:58:17). I think the other thing that we probably would say though is that we think alternatives will continue to grow probably at a faster rate generally than other sort of more traditional classes as been the history for us. And so, we're just looking at the trend line there that, that would continue to be an area of higher growth for us, not just in our real estate, but in commodities. Some of the Global Targeted Return types of products, we think will have a lot of opportunity to grow faster. And Marty, I don't know if you have any... Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah, no. I think what I would like to put in context is what Loren talked about earlier during the presentation, and where he showed the advantages of diversification going back to 2009. And this range of 3% or 5%, it's not unknown to us. We've been in the range over those periods of time. The other thing that's factual is that the consistency of our growth is very unique in the industry. What we want to change is have the consistency be within that 3% to 5% range. And I think, the clients are really going to decide where they're going to put their assets. The effort is to drive the totality of our penetration up with our clients, and there's many areas that we can be doing a better job of that, and whether it be the institutional parts of our business that we've talked about, a broader penetration on platforms, et cetera, and greater success in the broadening of the penetration of our ETF platforms in the U.S. and in EMEA probably, in particular. So, that's really what we think is going to drive it, in particular, it's the totality of the offering. And really, that's just being much more effective with our distribution capabilities. Kenneth S. Lee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got you. And I just have one more. In terms of the recent additions to the Global Solutions team, I wondered if you can talk specifically about efforts to gain more insurance clients. We've seen few other competitors picking interest in this area, and just want to see how you view the growth opportunity there. Thanks. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah, it is a real growth opportunity. And again, as you're saying, money managers are turning their attention to it. We have been quite successful in the area. It is also an area where if you look at the skills that we've developed internally over the last few years, a number of the backgrounds are coming from the insurance industry and having that specific expertise really, really matters. And again, it is an area where we have seen success, and we will continue to see success, and frankly, is probably going to be one of the relative areas of relative strength within our institutional business in particular. Kenneth S. Lee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Hey, Marty. Good morning, Loren. Good morning, guys. Wanted to go back to the Guggenheim discussion for a second with the recent fee rate reduction. So, understand you guys are trying to be more competitive as you position this product, but looking out, are we largely done? Do you guys still see any incremental price reductions that need to be done in either of that product or kind of your broader PowerShares brand as you're kind of getting ready to roll this out more broadly, especially with Jemstep? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. And Loren was talking about it. I think we have developed quite a strong discipline around pricing within the ETF capability. And again, it is back to the comment I made earlier. It is a very different set of capabilities. And frankly, in the mutual fund world, we feel that the BulletShares are really one of the very attractive elements of Guggenheim. And we're not trying to be the low-cost provider at all, but really focused on this value for money. And we think it is appropriately priced right now, competitively priced. We are looking at the whole range of our ETF lineup as we said we would post the acquisition. And you'll see probably some duplications and things like that, that will be addressed during that period of time. But nothing immediately in front of us, but we'll continue to look at the competitive positioning of our ETFs as we look forward. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And Loren, one for you. I guess , going back to the press release, it sounds like you guys are about 70% of the way through the cost-cutting program. Just kind of looking what's in the run rate as of the first quarter versus the total. I guess, is there room to do more given a more challenging obviously revenue backdrop and sort of flattish organic growth here? And then as we think about 2019, obviously, lots of moving pieces, but using your kind of typical methodology, but also taking into account that you are investing in the business still and Jemstep pipeline sounds pretty robust, Is 50% plus realistic for 2019 in incremental margin, or that might get pushed out? Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: So, on the cost opportunity side, we do think there's always further opportunity to do more. We continue to look at other things that are not currently in that run rate. I think in terms of the overall program that was put in place a while back in terms of optimization with the specific activities being identified, that is going to come to a close in 2018. We're really going to be, I think, done with the optimization program per se, but we are going to continue, I think, to roll through some fairly, hopefully, significant opportunities to continue to look at technology more effectively, potentially outsource other activities within the firm to the extent that it makes sense. Someone can do it better, cheaper, faster, whatever. Those are the things that we need to continue to be focused on. Use of robotics is another one that people are looking at obviously. It's an opportunity for lots of firms, not just us. So, I would say more to come on that one and should allow us to continue to grow with a good cost at a slower pace than revenues. And so, with that said, I don't think anybody internally has said that, that 50% to 65% goes away. And that 2019 opportunity may still certainly exist for us to be able to deliver at those levels. But I also mentioned, we have to get through 2018 to sort of get a clear view of where we are in 2019. So, not ready to sort of commit at this point that, that is locked in, other than there's nothing that implicitly says it can't happen. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yes. I understood. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Okay. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Good morning folks. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Hey, Brian. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Marty, maybe just to get back onto the factor-based and the smart beta franchise. Just in your view, obviously, we've been in a slower positive net flow environment for smart beta over the last year or so, given beta has done so well in the market. It's been up pretty strongly. But as you see this develop, and you're making a bigger effort, what do you think are the biggest drivers that can actually positively move that needle? And I'm thinking like, first of all, the market conditions that you've been alluding to, of people getting more conservative versus how you're positioning the smart beta versus active products, and then versus passive products. And it sounds like it continues to be more like a sold product rather than a bought product, so how are financial advisors perceiving smart beta as a better solution for them? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: You're on a really, really, really important point. If you listened to the commentary, you would think that \u2013 and I'll stay in the United States for a moment, because it's different than other markets. You would think that the adoption rate of smart beta factors is at a very high level; in fact, it's not. It's not at all, where it can be. And what we are seeing, and this could be whether it'd be platforms, financial advisors, or some institutions, the intellectual merits are embraced. The how to use it, how to implement factors in a portfolio and build portfolios extending again high conviction active alternatives and factors, it is not well-developed. And so, that's why I come back to how are we making an impact. There's a huge educational element of not just what it is, but how do you use it. That's where the Solutions team also comes into play, too, because we literally help people build model and analytics of how, in fact, to use them. And it's just not at the institutional level, it's actually at corner offices, FAS, where our analytics team is helping them determine how to build portfolios more effectively to create the outcomes that they want. So, the fact of the matter is, it is early days, and so, you're exactly right, it is \u2013 at the moment, it's not a bought capability, it's much more a learned or sold capability. And as the adoption rate goes up, I think, that's where you're going to start to see a much greater momentum in the flows in these areas. Factors outside of the United States, and in particular, in Europe, institutionally have been embraced much more holistically for good long period of time, and that's just at a different level now. I would say, at a retail level, it's probably similar to the United States. And quite frankly, there's still much greater appetite for active investing whether, it'd be fixed income and/or equities in the U.K. and on the continent. We have, frankly, the same thing for the retail channel in Asia. I will also tell you it has been a marked change of interest in the beginning adoption of factor capabilities in Asia, China, and Japan, frankly, in particular, from the interactions that we've been having. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's great color. And then, maybe a little different subject, as you think about quantitative strategies from the research side, you did talk about this a little bit in the presentation, obviously, there's been a reasonably decent push to embrace quantitative tools within research and different firms are implementing it in different ways. And if you can talk about how you're implementing it at Invesco. I know you guys obviously operate on a more decentralized base with teams sort of a lot of them doing their own thing. But how do you view your fundamental teams embracing quantitative strategies, and are you kind of trying to push that through within the organization? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. So, let me clarify a point. The investment teams, they are built by \u2013 under unique philosophies and processes, but it's all on a single platform. And so, the tools are available to all of the teams, and they're used in different ways. And the reality of the situation is every one of these teams, and if you go back to our quantitative team that's been since the early 1980s, they've always adopted new technologies to enhance their quantitative models, and that's exactly what's happening right now. And so, the adoption of the tools is really driven by each of the investment management teams. And it'll be no different than in the past, and they will continue to be adopted in that manner. So, I don't know if that's helpful or not. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: I do know \u2013 I mean, we are looking specifically at things like natural language as an opportunity to be able to go through some of the filings more effectively. So, that's work in progress right now. And I also know there's some exploration around the use of AI, specifically around macroeconomic views and the bets around macroeconomic events. So, I think it's all been explored. I think there are \u2013 the teams that are embracing them. But it's additive to their existing processes, as opposed to taking parts out. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great, and you're talking about the fundamental teams not the quantitative? Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Yes, this is all fundamental teams that we're talking about. The quantity teams have been doing this for a long time. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: For a long time, yes. Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning Thanks for taking the question. Just curious if you could update us on the Great Wall JV in China, how that's progressing, and your outlook there? And also, just given some of the recent regulatory changes in China, just curious how you're thinking about any sort of change to the JV structure, or how you're thinking about approaching China? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. I'll make a couple comments. We probably don't talk about it a lot. Or our China position, I'd say, is arguably one of the strongest in the industry. Invesco Great Wall continues to do quite well in the marketplace, and the penetration continues to increase. And back to some of the topics that we're talking about, the other thing, it's a very different market. And we are frankly learning a lot about using technologies and retail channels in China, because they are actually more advanced in many parts of the world. And that is one of the things that led to Jemstep a number of years ago. So, we also see other opportunities with some of the digital platforms in China. And again, we'll just have to \u2013 we'd be more specific here on that. Institutionally, we continue to be very, very strong, I'd argue, probably top three institutional managers, multiple mandates with everybody that you would hope to be there. As you say, the changing dynamics from a opportunity to change our 49% shareholding is top of mind right now. And as soon as we can have that change, it will be changed, which is also another real positive for us as an organization. And to your point, Michael, the bigger topic is \u2013 the opportunity probably has never been bigger in China just because of some of the developments that are happening there. And we feel extraordinarily well placed in that market. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah, I would just say, I mean, they're flowing really well. The products, fundamental and quantitative, fixed income, I mean, it's really doing well. I think, the overall joint venture is one of the largest and seem to be one of the most successful there. It's about $20 billion in size and rapidly growing. So, there's a lot of focus on kind of how do we continue to grow our opportunities with the Great Wall. And we also have a WOFE as well, so that is another element \u2013 that Wholly Owned Foreign Entity (sic) [Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprise] (01:14:16), I think, is what that stands for, which is yet another kind of element into the whole Greater China strategy. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: And I'd just add, I mean, as you know, as best we can tell, we're the only Western firm, where the name is led by Invesco Great Wall. And we also have management control of the JV, and I think that's also unique in the market. So, part of the success of the JV is we are able to utilize the capabilities of Invesco, whether it be investment disciplines and the like, that are probably not afforded to other JVs. And literally, we operate as a single organization in the market, and jointly going to clients, recognizing it as a JV even. So, again, we just feel we're in a very strong place in that marketplace. Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yes. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Chris Shutler of William Blair. Your line is now open. Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning. Just one real quick one on capital allocation priorities, just outline that, and where acquisitions fall in that mix right now? Thanks. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: So, obviously we just finished an acquisition, and so our priorities is really paying down the credit facility, as we mentioned, to bring our leverage back down to pre-acquisition levels. Once we get to that, which we expect to happen sometime in Q4, we would expect our normal capital priorities to kick back in, which really is investing behind the business, which would be mostly seeding products \u2013 have sort of contained needs there, roughly \u2013 historically, has been somewhere around $100 million, $200 million a year, then would be an ever-increasing dividend. And you saw what we did in terms of that increase, modest, but again, consistent growth in our dividend. And then the remainder could be allocated to buybacks, which again, is something that we're looking forward to, given the stock price, where it is. In terms of acquisition strategies, as I mentioned, I think our focus is really trying to leverage what has just come onboard between Source and Guggenheim. There are continuing opportunities that present themselves to us. And I think just as we've always done, we've been open to looking at those in terms of what they might bring, but has not been the key focus to our success at all. We think we should be able to grow organically, first and foremost, but we're paying attention as the industry is shifting and moving and certain things may be more interesting than others. And I don't know Marty if you want to add to that as well. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: No, I agree. No, you're right on the mark. Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: All right. Thanks, Loren. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Patrick Davitt of Autonomous Research. Your line is now open. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Hey. Good morning. Thanks. Apologize if I missed this, I had to step away during the Jemstep conversation. But are these new platforms a situation where there's \u2013 you'll be sitting next to other asset managers, robos, and the fee advisor chooses which one they want to use? And if so how do you kind of become the one that they choose, when I imagine there's some pretty powerful constituencies behind the other ones? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah, no. What we're talking about these clients, they pick one digital platform, so it is \u2013 think of you as an organization, you choose an application, you install the application in your environment, and that's really the point here. No institution wants multiple digital platforms; they want one to serve their financial advisors and their wealth managers and the like. And so, that's really the point. Being first to market and the penetration with the clients puts you in a very unique situation. You become a service provider to these institutions. It is white-labeled; it is open platform. But we think our decision to do that was, we think, very, very wise. No way would an institution want to not have open platform and not \u2013 an organization like us not recognize that we are their client, we are serving them. And I think that has served us very, very well to-date here. And I think Loren also made a point, depending on the institution, what we are seeing is they start to turn to an organization like us to provide models for their platforms. And again, this gets back to how do the models happen. It's a combination of being the digital advice platform; the combination of our Solutions team working with the client to determine what they want built for their clients; then using a combination again of our active factor capabilities, whether it'd be mutual funds and ETFs to build these models for the clients. And again that just really gets back to \u2013 you have to look at the totality of the offering. And you have the relative market share and time. We are modeling to be quite dramatically different to the upside and a traditional relationship to a traditional platform. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Great. That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. There was some news a week or so ago about a fee dispute with the enhanced income trust in the UK. Could you give us a total AUM exposure to those kind of trusts? And is this a trend we should worry about for all of them? Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: I don't think the exposure is large. I think it's probably $5 billion or less. Some of the other trusts have already gone through and have made some adjustments. This was a particular situation that I don't know if we can really comment too deeply on in terms of kind of where that dispute was, and seems more anomalous again than sort of a theme. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Okay. Thank you. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Robert Lee of KBW. Your line is now open. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and appreciate patience to a long call. I guess, in a way, maybe it's a more of a hypothetical question than anything, but is organic growth really even the metric we should all be focusing on really? Because if you think about it and you talk about your net revenue yield and there's pressures there, and we all talk about fee pressure in the industry. Clearly, there's a concern rightly so about the ability for any organic growth, for you and a lot of your peers, to translate into revenue growth. But really, isn't the real measure the ability to generate EBITDA and earnings growth from incremental flow? So, shouldn't we really be thinking about, and how do you think about really growing pre-tax operating income regardless of revenues maybe or increment \u2013 not regards of revenues, but regards to kind of incremental fee rates. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: I mean, isn't that really the conversation we should be having? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: It's a good question. And I guess, we collectively have talked down a path, it's been organic growth rate. And I think, what the organic growth rate does do, I mean, it is sort of a momentum measure, right, and penetration, so there is something healthy about it. But where I think the conversation gets lost probably is where you're going, right. So, we've been focused on our effective fee rate and what's driving that change. Where we see the bulk of our effective fee rate changing, it's really going to be the asset mix more than anything else. And what do we think is going to happen with \u2013 so if you start to dissect it, in a way, if you looked at this, \u2013 again the range of capabilities, over time where are the bulk of our assets are going to be? They're going to be in probably factor capabilities. Why would that be the case? Because traditional active, you're going to hit \u2013 we know that equity capabilities, in particular, there's a limitation to the size if you're going to generate alpha. So, when an investment team says no more, we shut them down. And I think that's the right thing to do. And that is \u2013 and I'd say, the same thing on alternatives, right. There's going to be a limitation to the size. And so, when we looked forward, we made the determination to fully service clients. We needed this whole range of capabilities and recognizing that you can build absolute scale and factor capabilities, while frankly, meeting client needs. So, that is really the conversation we've been having. And you're really pulling it out in a different way. And I think understanding that is really important and the implications. What's the point of it, if you look at our ETF business or factor business, it's lower fee, but it's finally profitable, right. And that is really what you're driving to, you're going to get scale, and you're going to get the profitability, and the earnings growth because of it. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. And I think, I mean, obviously, we're fiduciary and our focus is on our clients, and that doesn't mean earnings growth or profits don't matter, they absolutely do. And certainly, I spend a lot of time thinking about them myself. But, in terms of kind of the metric there, everybody internally is focused on, growth is really a measure. We've got a growth measure. Do our client want our products? I mean, are we serving our clients well? It's really a measure of health. And then, from that, comes revenues and profits. So, again, I think from maybe your perspective, I certainly get the question. I think internally, people would still find organic growth, sort of a very good measure of whether we're doing the right things by clients. Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: And I appreciate the color. Thanks. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we don't have any questions in queue. Mr. Flanagan, you may proceed. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Thank you very much on behalf of Loren and myself and the Invesco team. Thank you for your time and interest. And we will be talking to you soon. Have a good rest of the day. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating.

Operator : Welcome to Invesco's Second Quarter Results Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now, I would like to turn the call over to your speakers for today, Marty Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Thank you very much, and on behalf of Loren and myself, thank you for spending time with us today. If you're so inclined, you can follow the presentation which is on our website and I'll spend a few minutes reviewing the business results for the quarter, and Loren will go to more depth into the financials. And then today, we're going to talk about our competitive positioning in the context of industry trends and our key focus areas before we open it up for questions. So I'm on slide 5, if you happen to be following and here is going to be the highlights of our discussion today. During the second quarter, gross sales were up 32% from the same quarter a year ago, redemptions were up as well, however, which led to the outflows during the quarter. And I'll get into the details about the outflows in just a few minutes here. We completed two acquisitions during the quarter Guggenheim Investments' ETF business and Intelliflo, the number one technology platform for financial advisors in the UK which further strengthens our digital advice capability. We also continue to invest in growth drivers which are meaningfully strengthening our business and contributing to growth now and in the future. And Invesco is a highly differentiated investment management organization with numerous competitive advantages. And again in a few minutes, I will speak to that. On slide 5, you'll find a summary results for the second quarter. We continue to demonstrate strong long-term investment performance with 70% and 71% of actively managed assets in the top half of peers over three and five years. We achieved gross sales of $54 billion during the quarter, up 32% versus the second quarter of 2017 and gross redemptions were $62 billion driven by market dynamics which led to total long-term outflows of $8 billion during the quarter. Adjusted net operating income was $376 million for the quarter, up from $357 million in the prior quarter. The operating margin improved during the quarter, increasing to 38.7%, up from 37.3%. We returned $124 million to shareholders during the quarter through dividends. Our overall performance for the latest three and five year periods remained strong with areas of exceptional strength. When we look at our investment teams and the investment processes, the approach is to focus on generating outperformance over full market cycle. Where we are in this market cycle, it is impacting the relative performance of value-based equity investment approaches which is the expected. As you can see on slide 6, the outperformance of growth versus value stocks has expanded rapidly over the past 12 months, which is very typical at this stage of our market. This market dynamic places near-term pressure on fundamental active value based equities and in turn client demand for these capabilities and flows, which we are seeing in our value-based equity capabilities. Importantly, however, the current conditions have hampered the value based equity strategies in the short-term, but long-term investment performance as measured across the full market cycle remains solid. The depth, breadth and tenure for investment teams combined with the consistency of their investment philosophy and approaches give us a high degree of confidence that these capabilities will see significant and rapid improvements in performance when markets normalize. As mentioned earlier, gross flows were up 32% versus the second quarter of 2017. This is a near record for the organization. We saw continued strength in gross flows across retail and institutional as well as active and passive, all of which were meaningfully higher than the same period a year ago. During the quarter, demand for ETF capabilities was robust. More specifically we saw particular strength in our commodity ETFs, with nearly $400 million in flows for the quarter and year-to-date flows of $1.5 billion. We saw robust institutional activity with gross sales of 55% versus a year ago with broad based demand across a range of equity, alternative and fixed income capabilities. The higher level of redemptions relative to the prior year were largely driven by the growth versus value, market dynamic and our value equity products as well as a large sovereign wealth and sub-advised redemption that we highlighted in the prior quarter. We are highly confident the flow trend will improve assuming a more favorable market dynamics. I'm going to hand the call over to Loren, so he'll highlight the financial performance then I'll come back to highlighting the key differentiators that are creating a competitive advantage for Invesco. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Great. Thank you, Marty. Quarter-over-quarter our total AUM increased $29.1 billion or 3.1%, which is driven by the acquisition of the Guggenheim ETF business which added $38.1 billion. We saw market gains of $10.3 billion, inflows from non-management fee earning AUM of $0.9 billion, inflows from institutional money market products of also $0.9 billion and then we also had reinvested distributions of $0.7 billion. These factors were somewhat offset by negative foreign exchange translation of $13.8 billion and then as Marty mentioned long-term net outflows of $8 billion. Our average AUM for the second quarter was $973.9 billion that was up 2.4% versus Q1. Looking at the net revenue yields for the quarter that came in at 40 basis points and our net revenue yield excluding performance fees was at 39.5 basis points. That was a decrease of 0.4 basis points versus Q1. The acquisition of Guggenheim ETF business and the impact of foreign exchange on our AUM mix reduced the yield by 0.9 basis points and 0.3 basis points respectively. These factors were somewhat offset by one extra day in the quarter and a pickup in real estate transaction fees within other revenues and that increased the yield by 0.4 basis points and 0.3 basis points respectively. Going to slide 12, you'll see our U.S. GAAP operating results for the quarter and my comments today will focus exclusively on the variances related to our non-GAAP adjusted measures, which can be found on slide 13. You'll see that our net revenues increased by $16 million or 1.7% quarter-over-quarter to $974 million, which includes a negative FX rate impact of $11.2 million. Excluding this impact, our net revenues increased by $27.2 million. This increase primarily reflects our higher average AUM from the Guggenheim acquisition, one additional day during the second quarter and as mentioned higher real estate transaction fees. Adjusted operating expenses at $597.4 million, decreased by $3.3 million or 0.5% relative to the first quarter. Foreign exchange decreased adjusted operating expenses by $5.4 million during the quarter and excluding this impact, our adjusted operating expenses increased by $2.1 million. That increase was driven by seasonal growth in our marketing activities and higher G&A expenses largely from irrecoverable taxes. This increase was then partially offset by seasonal decline and comp expenses on lower payroll taxes and employee benefit costs those traditionally happens in the second quarter. Our adjusted non-operating income decreased $20.3 million, compared to the first quarter reflecting the foreign exchange mark-to-market on our seed investments during the quarter and as well as higher interest expense associated with the credit facility borrowing to fund the Guggenheim transaction. The tax rate for the quarter held steady at 20.6%, which brings us to our adjusted EPS of $0.66 and our adjusted net operating margin of 38.7% for the quarter. I also just wanted to point out that our head count increased by 181 employees to 7,315 employees, primarily reflecting the individuals on-boarded resulting from the Intelliflo and the Guggenheim acquisitions that closed during the quarter. Before turning things back to Marty, I just wanted to quickly provide a couple of updates and the first is on current month flows. Overall, the July flow picture remains rather choppy with strong sales and pipeline opportunities offset by elevated redemptions, many of which feel one-off in nature. Through the month of July, we've experienced net outflows of approximately $3 billion. This result is largely explained by two separate account terminations and a sell-off in commodity ETFs in U.S. and Europe. On a somewhat longer term basis, we are confident that our flow picture will stabilize and turn positive, driven by many of the focus areas of growth for Invesco. Additionally, we continue to see a healthy institutional pipeline of won but not funded business that will help accelerate our flows back to positive territory. So the next area of update I'd like to turn to is China, which is in fact a great example of a focus area growth for Invesco. We're seeing strong demand for our Invesco Great Wall joint venture or IGW as we call it. In June, IGW's Jingyi Money Market Fund was selected as one of seven money market funds to be included in YuE'Bao, which is the money market program administered by Ant Financial, which is an affiliate of Alibaba. The program, which serves as the money market platform connected to mobile payment services Alipay manages nearly $250 billion in AUM and represents a very exciting opportunity for IGW and Invesco. So since going live in June 14 of 2018, IGW has seen very strong flows and substantial growth in a number of client accounts on its platform. From the end of the first quarter of 2018, the AUM of IGW's Money Market Fund increased from about $80 million to almost $3.5 billion. We believe that IGW's new relationship with Ant Financial and its strong long-term investment performance across its many capabilities will provide Invesco with significant growth opportunities immediately and in the future. In fact, we expect that total flows including those into money market will be about $6 billion for IGW in Q3. Final part of my China update addresses our current approach of consolidating only 49% of IGW in our AUM flows and non-GAAP P&L. Given Invesco's leadership in the joint venture, the recent change in regulation allowing increased foreign ownership and our active dialogue with our JV partners around gaining an additional ownership interest we'll begin reporting 100% of IGW beginning in the third quarter. And with that, I'd like to turn things back to Marty who will provide additional detail on some of these key differentiators that are creating competitive advantage for the firm. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Great. Thank you, Loren. So I'm now on slide 15. And as I've said a few minutes ago, I want to highlight the macro trends that are transforming the industry, but in fact, these have been in place for some time and I think they're all quite well known throughout the industry. The point though that's important is that the pace of change or pace of the adoption of these macro trends is accelerating at a very rapid pace and it's literally creating winners and losers in the industry today. And it's really important to understand these trends in the context of our strategic positioning and our future direction. We've been developing and expanding our capabilities ahead of these trends for more than a decade and we continue to aggressively develop them for the future. I'm highly confident in our strategy, our ability to execute and the results they will generate in the near-term and long-term. And now let me just take a few minutes to put these into context of the macro strategy. Our key strengths and differentiators put us in a strong position to be a winner within the industry for many years to come. Our investment platform's comprised of broad diversity of high quality, well tenured teams with high conviction in their philosophy and processes. We've a comprehensive range of investment capabilities in vehicles with market leading presence and the fastest growing segments including alternatives/multi-asset, ETFs and smart beta. We have a long established global presence with deep client connectivity in key markets including fast growing markets for us such as China and EMEA. Our at-scale global platform drives efficiency and effectiveness while enabling us to commercialize key technologies for the benefit of our clients. And lastly, our market leading solutions capability draws on our comprehensive range of capabilities to deliver outcomes aligned with the needs of our retail and institutional clients around the world. Our core business is very healthy and strong which provides a strong foundation for future growth. We're investing in growth drivers that complement our core business, a combination that sets us up for strong and diversified organic growth, running a disciplined business enables us to reallocate investment in the areas where we see tremendous opportunity, which you'll find in slide 17. We began building the ETF franchise in 2006 with the acquisition of PowerShares and more recently have expanded our ETF capabilities with Source and Guggenheim. We are now the fourth largest ETF provider globally and number two in smart beta globally. We have 40 years of experience and expertise in factor investing, well ahead of competitors in this space. We currently manage more than $160 billion in factor strategies for range of clients around the world. We continue to leverage our factor expertise, most recently with the launch of eight fixed income factor ETFs this week. We've a market leading solutions capability that works with our distribution and advice teams to create customized portfolios for clients, drawing on a comprehensive range of products. Invesco was an early mover in digital advice market with our acquisition of Jemstep and we are aggressively expanding our capability with the addition of Intelliflo. As we mentioned in our first quarter call, Jemstep has gone live with a number of clients in the United States and in UK, Intelliflo is already the number one technology platform for financial advisers and we are seeing strong post-acquisition momentum. We're working to expand our digital advice capability globally. We continue to build our institutional capability investing in talent and resourcing and strengthening our client experience. We're seeing continued momentum in the institutional area with gross flows up 55% year-over-year. Our early entry into China provides a strong foundation for growth and one of the world's fastest growing markets. China is projected to account for half of the global AUM growth over the next decade. We're currently ranked four out of all foreign asset managers in China and we continue to build the business with the recent launch of the very popular Belt and Road Fund and as Loren talked \u2013 just mentioned, we are very excited about the relationship with Ant Financial and had very impressive platform. What truly makes Invesco unique is not any one of these capabilities or growth driver, but our ability to bring these capabilities and growth drivers together to meet the needs of our clients This unique combination is what defines our competitive differentiation. We're proactively investing in the business, building on our first mover and competitive advantages that drive sustainable broad-based growth in line with our clients in the industry direction. Our acquisition of PowerShares more than a decade ago, our decade long experience and factors, our first mover advantage in digital advice and our early entry into China demonstrate our experience, our commitment to clients and our focus on investing for growth. We're confident of our organic growth prospects and remain focused on executing for clients, leveraging our competitive advantage and investing for growth which we believe ultimately drives shareholder value. So with that operator, if you'll open up the call for questions, Loren and I will be happy to answer all the questions. Operator : Certainly speakers. Speakers, our first question comes from Dan Fannon from Jeffries. Your line is now open. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I guess, first, I mean, Marty, you mentioned highly confident about flows improving and we look at kind of slide 22 and some of the performance challenges and what you talked about with regards to where we are in the cycle. I guess can you give us a little bit about whether it's product region? We heard what's going on in July. I guess what gives you the confidence around flows improving in this kind of more immediate time period? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. So, Dan, it's a great question. And if you told me we would be in this part of the cycle with such \u2013 this concentration and having such a huge impact on the value versus growth in December, I wouldn't have imagined it quite frankly. The impact that you're seeing is because of the great success of these capabilities over the last number of years, clients have very high demand for these capabilities. Now, the exact opposite happens when you get to the structured periods and the point that we're really trying to make is that high quality teams, there's not demand for the capability right now, that's driving the current flow \u2013 large part of the current flows. But I think our point is the depth and breadth of interest of capabilities around the world and so many different channels and regions is very, very strong. And that tends to offset these things. But really what has changed, the magnitude of that changed. We've not seen in 10 years more than 10 years such a concentrated market impact. And again good part of our equity capabilities have been in volume, so again it's the broadness of the organization I think that's really pointing out and that the narrowness of where these redemptions are largely coming from? Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And I guess just to follow up on that institutionally is you guys mentioned a backlog and we've heard this before I guess if we think about the products and where that demand is coming, is there any differentiation from previous periods or is there an acceleration in certain products or regions that you could highlight. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah, good point. So it's never been broader, right. So you're seeing it in equity and what equities would you imagine that's largely factored capabilities institutionally outside of the United States. Real estate continues to be a very high area, alternatives beyond that, bank loans and things such as GTR continues to be an area. The institutions are continuing to look at risk parity as an area. So again it continues to be very broader than it's ever been that we're seeing. And the point to look at is the gross flows, what did happen in this quarter and frankly what we are seeing. The one large redemption in this quarter, it was really driven \u2013 it was an equity capability with good performance. But you are seeing clients start to \u2013 some of them are worried with some of the equity exposure with some of the topics of trade around the world and the like \u2013 we're not seeing a ton of it, but that's an example of one or two of those and they can make a big difference in the quarter. And I think that's really the point. Looking from quarter-to-quarter is very difficult always has gone, but if you look at the history of growth for us institutionally over the last couple of years, it continues to just improve. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: And the other thing, Dan, I would just mention is the pipeline of opportunities is at an all-time high in terms of fee rate, it's about 65 basis points across the entire pipeline which is well in excess of our overall fee rate. And the terminating pipeline, so to speak is at 24 basis points. So again when you look at it on a revenue adjusted basis even though the headlines are kind of large, really from a revenue perspective, we should feel and we do feel very optimistic about what the pipeline is bringing to us. And again the predominance that you said is broad based which it is, but there's a significant growth in alternatives which tend to be have a higher fee rate as well. Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thank you. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Thanks Dan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Good morning. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Hey, Craig. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Just given the detail around Jemstep on the last call with six financial institutions going live this year and I think it was five banks and one insurer. When should we expect Jemstep to start contributing to net flows? And how large is the underlying advisory AUA in the platforms that will go live this year or have already gone live? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: So again we continue to look to 2019 for the beginning of a level of contribution that would start to be interesting. So we've not moved off that our confidence, it just continues to strengthen along that. Quite frankly, I don't have the number of AUA of the institutions, but it would be \u2013 frankly, I just don't have it right now. So but it's a large number and an impressive number and that's what gives us confidence that you will see the success in 2019, right. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And just as a follow-up, did any financial institution sign up since the April call? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: We are in process of adding some financial institutions and again we're in the contracting period, so there's nothing we can say, but when we're through it, you'll hear about it. Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research. Your line is now open. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Hi, thank you. Good morning. The IGW consolidation, is that $6 billion you mentioned the total AUM that's been consolidated or new flow? And how should we think about the fee rate impact from consolidating that AUM? Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: So the $6 billion is \u2013 think of it as a new flow at 100%. We would be consolidating 100% of the AUM inflows going forward, which is, right now, the joint venture is about $22 billion in size. So there'd be another $11 billion showing up in our assets under management. Obviously, the money market is more at the institutional rate, but there is opportunity to do more than just money market on the Ant Financial platform which is at significantly higher rates obviously for active products, you're sort of closer to 75 to 100 basis points in that range. So it is something that it's a little hard to model right now because it's very much in flux. The immediate kind of opportunity is probably at the lower money market fee. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : So it's fair to say the vast majority of its money funds right now? Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: At this point, yes. Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. First on outflows, obviously, elevated this quarter and you mentioned market conditions is a factor. The way I see it is, I see more of a boom and bust cycle for Invesco occurring as you promote and rapidly grow certain products only to see performance falter at some point and sort of driving the bust part of the cycle. So we saw this with IBRA this maybe playing out in GTR diversified dividend. Do you see it the same way and are you structuring growth that might be more consistent and repeatable and ultimately have less risk of this sort of boom and bust cycle? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: It's a fascinating point of view. So I put in the context if we've had net inflows for nine years. And I'd say very few firms have done that. And I think what it does show is that the fact is clients do have different demands during different parts of the cycle. And as they see risk on, risk off, they build their portfolios accordingly and it is no different now. And what you're seeing with this value versus growth, you see where all the flows are going throughout the industry at a retail level because you can get clear line of sight. It is a dominant flow picture there, in particular within ETFs. And so I wouldn't call it a boom and bust cycle. I think it's driven by client demands. This current period might be most extreme because of where the market is though. I mean last time you saw something like this not at the exact level but would be the 1999-2000 period. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Okay. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then, Invesco I think recently lowered fees in Canada. Can you describe kind of the actions you took and why, and given Canada and Europe both are sort of higher fee regions, how should we think about the fee outlook for the Continental European market? Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: So Ken that was a fairly small asset base that got adjusted, so it was not material to any real \u2013 revenue impact. The reason that was done is because there was a discrepancy between similar products in the U.S. and Canada. And so they needed to bring that more in alignment because there was \u2013 we were creating sort of an unhealthy arbitrage opportunity that just need to be closed. So that was all it was pure and simple. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: So there is no sort of planned and other than kind of just making sure our product line up that makes sense. Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Thanks, Ken. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Campbell from Barclays. Your line is now open. Jeremy Campbell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Thanks, guys. Just wondered if you could dig in a little bit more on the retail side of flows, it looks like that was a big driver here in the quarter... Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. Jeremy Campbell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: ...it looks more U.S. and UK dominated. I know you highlighted the growth value dynamic. But maybe just additional color on where it's coming from, is it model portfolio, is it broker sold, what's kind of the view from the ground there? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. Now you just \u2013 you hit it right, I mean it's we are in the advice channel. So it's literally driven by investor \u2013 the large \u2013 where it starts really is fall offs in demand and that's what in terms of to drive up the net outflows because of that. And so there's \u2013 it's really a demand topic right now. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: And so just I mean I think in terms of overall magnitude, I mean again I think it needs to put in context, the biggest outflow in the quarter was the sovereign wealth outflow that we preannounced by far and away. U.S. value we've talked about it, it's as a category within the industry in outflow. It's certainly been a very difficult challenging market for that category. And so we're seeing about $2 billion just generally of outflow across value which is again is somewhat consistent with overall industry trend. Our UK equities which is again sort of a value oriented category is about $1.3 billion related to that category. International growth is about $1 billion and then there is an element which we've talked about in the past related to our REIT product in Japan which is a retail product, Yuexiu Reit and that was about $1 billion. So when you put that all together, I mean you really explain largely what is going on the outflow in the quarter. Jeremy Campbell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Great. And then on the capital side, I know you guys are focused on delevering after the Guggenheim deal here, but I guess with just the weakness in the stock in the sector at large. I mean, does that all maybe change your thinking a little bit to do maybe a moderated pace of delevering combined with a little bit of a buyback given here the valuation at the current levels? Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: I think we see the stock has been extremely attractive. We are clearly focused on reinstating our buyback program, which I think we've discussed would be in the fourth quarter. We are also trying to preserve our current credit rating and it is something where we have \u2013 we will view that if we were to sort of accelerate the buyback sooner than, before we get the leverage back in line that we would be attempting a downgrade which takes a long time to actually come back from. So we do understand the topic, but the time value here, we're talking about a couple of quarters at most before we can sort of crank up the buyback machine again. Jeremy Campbell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. I'm sorry if I missed this, but did you guys say which strategies the two July terminations came in, were they active equity or? Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: The two, one was direct real estate and the other was similar sovereign wealth outflow that we've talked about before, so similar topics. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. The Asian equity. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Asian equity? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. Jeremy Campbell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Your line is now open. Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Loren, I don't think you touched on this, but at the last quarter, you had updated an outlook for revenue yield before performance fees of being 40 basis points for the rest of the year. This quarter came in a bit below that. Is the 40 basis point outlook still something that we should use or should we revise that? Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. So revenues, there's day count noise within that, and so it kind of goes up and it goes down depending on day count. I think the probably somewhere between 40 basis points and 39.5 basis points is very safe in that range over the last half of the year. I do think as we get into 2019 where we continue to see some of the lower price product and our success in our ETF business expands, you're probably looking at sort of down to 39 basis points. Again, but importantly, and again it's an easy point to overlook, this is not because of fee cuts, this is because of the mix of our products and as we gain scale in these lower fee products, we're actually seeing incredibly attractive incremental margins. And so, we don't see anything wrong with the fee rates dropping as long as we're building scale in these products. And our margin on those products are at a higher rate than the firms overall, which is the case. So anyway, that would be our sort of updated guidance around fee rate, net revenue yield, excluding performance. Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. Thank you, Loren. And just following up and I know there have been a couple of questions on it, so sorry about coming back to it, it's just a little confusing. The growth versus value performance gap you all highlighted, it's not really all that new. I think that's part of the reason why there's some confusion. Also you guys \u2013 Invesco really has a quite a diversified offering, so it's not like we think about you all as really levered to one style versus the other. Is the idea here that, and Marty I think you spoke to it earlier, is the idea here that just the remixing away from value right now within Invesco products is what's so overwhelming? And therefore that's why it's noteworthy. If you could just flesh that out a bit, that'd be great. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah, glad you're asking if it's not understood. So I'll try again. So, it's really the magnitude of the change in the concentration, right. So if you look year-to-date, the amount of money going into momentum based growth products is enormous. If you want to use ETF as a proxy, whether it'd be cap weighted or even in smart beta, the vast majority of the money is going into a very few number of funds that are momentum based. So this extreme period, from that perspective, I'm not making any judgments about the merits of it, but that's what you're seeing and what we've had over the last number of years is great success on the value based capabilities. That's been the driver of flows for us in the U.S. retail channel, in particular when the demand for those comes off and you see such a magnitude of change of relative performance. That's when \u2013 and so literally it happened this year. I mean that's when you saw the change in flows, that's how quickly the sentiment changed from an investor point of view. And I think that's really the point that I'm trying to highlight, not that in fact we saw this. We all have been in the industry a long time, you know this is a natural thing that happens, but it's actually the magnitude of it right now in particular this year and how changed investor \u2013 retail investor sentiment in particular. Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, okay. Thanks for that additional color, Marty. Last sort of clean up for me, through July outpost to-date I believe, Loren, you'd said there's a sovereign wealth in the direct real estate. As far as given that there's sovereign wealth, it's a big part of it, is that outflow a lower fee item or is that more in line with the firm average, should we think about that when we start to model here the current quarter? Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Because it's active-equity and it's well-performing. I mean it's probably more in line with the firm's overall fee rate, which is unfortunate in terms of the impact. And the real estate \u2013 direct real estate is probably also at a similar fee rate. Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks for that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Carrier from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Right. Thanks, guys. Loren, maybe first one just on expenses, it seems like comp and I think property office tech, you came in a bit better. I know some of that's probably FX impacted. But maybe just any update for the second half of the year, given some of the guidance that you gave for the first half. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. So I think our guidance sort of largely stays intact. We've been maintaining good vigilance on our expenses and comp as part of that. Some of that is, I think just flexing down, the normal flexing down of incentives, sort of incentives in relationships to operating income, but we would say guidance that we gave earlier stays intact. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Got it. And then Marty, just one more on the flow outlook, so the growth versus value, look I understand that. When I think about some of the initiatives that you guys have been working on, so whether it's the broader sort of ETF platform and then when you combine that with some of the digital investments as you head into 2019, I'm just trying to understand how you guys think about maybe, the next 12 months, 24 months in an environment where some of those investments start to kind of contribute and produce more significantly. But maybe we still have this growth versus value issue going on... Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : ...versus obviously if that starts to shift and that would be more of a tailwind, but... Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I mean like can you see some maybe normalizing in these outflows just given some of those investments maybe scaling? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: That's the point I have been trying to make, so thank you I'll try to clarify. There is a high degree of confidence that the investments that we've been making and the strengthening of the business whether it'd be institutional and you can start to see the institutional capabilities that China is meaningful for us, the pace of change and our strengthening there is very, very strong. But then the same thing with these \u2013 the ETF platforms, we are now just getting through building up the range of capabilities that we want. Post acquisitions always it takes time to get capabilities on platforms that's where we're going through with Guggenheim right now. It takes months and quarters, not the day you've closed, doesn't mean you're on the platform. Those conversations are all going really very, very well. Literally in any range of model conversations with various platforms, so that's why our confidence is so high and you're going to start to see again whether it'd be Jemstep or Intelliflo start to have the impact to the organization next year. So I think the question that you're asking, let's assume that the market stays \u2013 the market dynamic stays where it is. Do we anticipate the likelihood of us generating flows beyond these redemptions we do. It's more likely in 2019 than it is this year because hard to call the market and we're not going to call the market, so we're going to anticipate that it plays out for another two, three quarters before you get some change there. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks a lot. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Katz from Citigroup. Your line is now open. William Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Couple of sort of tactful modeling questions and I might miss this like going on this morning. Do you guys call out the strength in the other revenue line this quarter, I sort of felt like that was a much bigger variant than maybe what the prior guidance was or I may be misremembering that and I do have follow up question. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. So that was related to our J-REIT launch in Asia which had significant amount of transaction fees associated with it. So it was related to a fund launch. William Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: So would you expect that to get back into the mid-teens type of level on a go forward basis? Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah, most likely. I think I view that as more of a one-off. William Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Right. Where are you, you mentioned in the press release by but I didn't hear it in the commentary this morning in terms of the global efficiency initiative when you sort of get to that sort of run rate of annualized savings, is that still a year end 2018 number at this point in time? Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Absolutely. And we're making progress. We're in mid implementation on some of the outsourcing and we're getting some of the benefits which again is allowing us to maintain expenses and guidance sort of roughly where we had them even despite some of these acquisitions that we've done. So we're feeling good about our optimization efforts and certainly would expect to see them continue on through into 2019. William Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And just one last one, and Marty, maybe if you, just stepping back a lot of folks of course and you've laid out previously, a long-term guidance of, or at least an aspirational goal of 3% to 5%. Can you sort of help us with the building blocks and how you get from sort of what's a little bit of a choppy view right now, sort of putting the way the style box issue for a moment? How you get from where you are today and really the industry at large to that sort of that low to mid-single digit organic growth rate? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. So Bill, it's not going to be any one thing, but it's literally going to be a combination of areas that we've been talking about, right. So we're continuing to see growth in strength and alternatives. We're continuing to see growth in factor capabilities and I put ETFs in that bucket, but it goes beyond that. You're seeing institutional clients outside of the United States look at that as a growth area. And then frankly when these digital platforms start to kick into, they're differentiated in the marketplace and it's really the breadth of those capabilities that will get there. And again I think you would have \u2013 markets are what they are. And again as I said before, if you ask me in December, if you would have seen the magnitude of growth versus value trade going on, I would not have seen it and if it hadn't \u2013 if it just stayed status quo our \u2013 we would be through that organic growth targets that we talked about. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: The other way to think about it, Bill, if you look at our current assets under management, I mean you could highlight that there's at least a third of our assets that are sort of growing at a high-single-digit double-digit rate in terms of ETFs, factors solutions digital. We talked about which are yet to come. If you really just do the math around taking that part relative to the rest of our core business which maybe growing at a more flattish, lower single-digit rate. You really get to that 3% to 5% quite quickly just in the handful of years as long as you can sustain the build out and the growth on these high growth areas which is clearly what we're talking about, what we're focused on. William Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks very much, guys. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Thanks, Bill. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr from Evercore. Your line is open. Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI : Hi, thanks. Just want to follow-up on the conversation around the pace of change speeding up and next-gen passes specifically. So I'm just curious what's going on, you've brought in the new platforms, you've built out products set, you've adjusted pricing where you need to. Can you talk about the conversations with the distributors or are you seeing in sales already, what's going on behind the scenes to give you confidence that that's going to start contributing, because if it does it could make a big difference offsetting some of the style box stuff? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. And so it's not limited to retail. Every conversation that I'm in institutional clients around the world, they're doing the same thing, they're narrowing the relationships. They want more from their money managers and not just the range of capabilities which is, I call it table stakes, a range of strong performing capabilities of our market cycles. But these elements have to be able to get into a solutions conversation with them, help them do analytical work, help them through any number of things, how do you think through factors, how to use factors, about leadership, the ESG, whatever it might be. There aren't a lot of firms that have that depth and breadth of capability in a range to do that. When you go to the retail channel, it's clear that everybody here understands the U.S. market very well. You are seeing that narrowing of those platforms and again that same dynamic is happening and it's beyond thinking of just a single product on a platform. Yes, that is the majority of what it is today, but more and more can you help more holistically with these platforms from a standpoint of helping build models, participate in building models, helping the successive factors in the retail channel is intellectually accepted, the magnitude of it is nowhere most of us think it's going to go. So the demand has to be created, the demand is going to be created through education. So do you have capabilities to help educate hand-in-hand with some of these platforms, again very few firms can do that. So those are the types of things that are creating real competitive advantages for the firms that have that, the breadth of those capabilities and the resources to compete in that way and that's very different than what it was five years ago. Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI : I think marketing spend was up a bunch year-on-year this quarter. Some of that is branding, some of that is selling what's working now. Is any of that targeted towards this, does it fall in under this education process... Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah, absolutely. Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI : And sales force and distribution arm and educators if you will, has that all been built out and your confidence is higher now because we're closer to the payoff? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: No question about it, right. And again what we are doing \u2013 and again you'll hear other firms talk about it, but what we are doing with digital capability is around marketing and education at a level that we've never done before. And that is the future and is pivoting from surpassed practices and past capabilities to the future. And it is being accepted in a very strong manner. Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thanks very much, Marty. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kenneth Lee from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Kenneth S. Lee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Looks like there was an increase in fund launch cost in the quarter, wonder if you could tell us what's in the pipeline in terms of new products and whether there's any opportunity for Invesco to participate in investor demand for private credit products? Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: So, just on the fund launch products, you read the U.S. GAAP release, good for you, that's related to the products that we consolidate. So that actually \u2013 that comment is only relevant for U.S. GAAP, it's a CLO related expense that gets consolidated out in our non-GAAP. So, but with that said, there are quite a bit of new products that are being looked at and probably the one that is most recent is we have eight new bullet share ETFs that were just launched around factor based or self-indexed and managed. So I think that's the one that we feel is going to have some very strong demand and uptake with clients who really haven't had access to these types of products in a real way and Marty, I don't know if you want to talk more broadly about new product introductions that we're looking at? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. It has again very, very focused on where we think in the retail institutional world, it is literally completing the build out of what we think is meaningful and desired by end clients both retail and institutional with factors and that's what you saw with this factor launch, you'll see probably a couple more of them probably ending in the first quarter of next year, that would be the end of probably what we think is the build out, it is on the back of Guggenheim and source and we think having the totality is important. And again, don't think if this just as ETFs by themselves, they are important part of our solutions capability and the models that we build for clients or helping institutions as they look to embed factors more broadly and some of their thinking in their portfolios. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: And then the other question about private credit? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. So within our alternative business \u2013 it is an area that we have some capability, it is not nearly as broad or deep as some of the big PE type firms. But again, I think the range of our alternative capabilities is strong and you've seen the success over the years. Kenneth S. Lee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got you. Thanks. And just one more bit in terms of housekeeping, it looks like there was a bunch of factors that drove the tax rate a little bit higher. Wondering if there is a more updated guidance for the tax rate going forward? Thanks. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. So again we're speaking to the non-GAAP financials which are probably more relevant. 20.6% was the effective tax rate which was steady to the first quarter and is consistent with our guidance going forward. So I'd use that as the non-GAAP tax rate, in terms of the U.S. GAAP tax rate that can move around quite a bit depending on the different products that we have to consolidate, so I find that number a little bit more difficult to provide guidance on that. Kenneth S. Lee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got you. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Bluestein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys. Question I guess around capital priorities from here, so you are responding to industry challenges clearly by making several acquisitions over the last couple of years. Do you feel that at this point the build out is generally done from an acquisition perspective and we should think about you guys returning to close to 100% pay out of net income starting 2019 or do you see opportunities for more deals? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. From my perspective, the acquisitions that we made over the last couple of years are from our perspective meaningful and important for the success of the organization going forward and meeting client demands. It is hard to predict the future. I don't see \u2013 generally you don't see the opportunities until they present themselves, right. So there's nothing obvious at the moment, but again we will continue to do what we've done in the past and stay to our capital priorities as we have said. But if there's something that comes along that we think will materially improve the competitive position in the firm we would clearly pay attention to it. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And that would be again in the areas of digital distribution and ETFs or something else? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Hard to predict quite frankly, because if you looked at the breadth of the firm right now, we think we have very competitive set, right now, you just don't know what the opportunities emerge. So I really wouldn't want to lock ourselves into a box, that has been the priority over the last couple of years and we think it's been very helpful. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: I would say, Alex, I mean put our plan, our current thinking is, yes, we'd be back into payout in terms of probably not at a 100%, but typically we've been sort of in that 70% to 80% range, because we do feed a fair amount of our new product launches and so there continues to be a pipeline of sort of organic needs around some of that capital, but we're certainly in terms of the thinking. We'd be back into buyback mode by the end of this quarter or end of fourth quarter. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah, got it. And then my second question I guess is just around the UK equity business, performance obviously remains pretty challenged, some of that is style driven, some of that had some specifics. I guess can you remind us what the AUM base there in UK equities, and what the revenue pool on those assets is today. And then I guess as we get kind of closer to Brexit, again maybe just a reminder, what percentage of your UK based product comes from the Eurozone customer base and if there is any sort of risk to that as we get closer to the end of the year? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Why don't I pick up on Brexit, and then Loren can follow up on the other. So look where it stands right now, the vast majority of the money managers are benefiting from sort of this validation model that is the case for us, and it would not materially change our business model, we'd end up with some more people on the continent, but not to a dramatic amount. And that seems to be the state of play as we move forward. So it's not nearly as challenging as it is for some of the investment banks with the pass-porting topics. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: And Alex, out of a total Invesco UK asset base of $136 billion, $27 billion is UK equities. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Shutler from William Blair. Your line is now open. Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey guys, can you talk about the Intelliflo acquisition and how you see it fitting into the digital strategy. It looks to me like more of an end-to-end complete platform where as Jemstep is I think more of a frontend, so is that fair? And could you help us just distinguish between those two assets and how you intend to leverage them in their respective markets? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah, very good question. So the UK market has changed so dramatically post some of the regulations and what you saw happening was the IFAs were starting to move to platforms to help with some of their investment decisions on funds that they were using and due diligence and the like. And so the center of gravity became these platforms. Intelliflo became obviously a very important one with 35% of the market share. It is an open platform, it will remain an open platform. That said, it is an opportunity for us to work with Intelliflo and create models through solutions and the like that would benefit the existing IFAs on the market and where a number of things right now. So it is very different, but it's a different market place, where we see the benefit coming together in time with Jemstep and Intelliflo is not just in some of the technologies but it'd be a combination of some of the platform benefits along with the frontend that we think will enhance our offerings in both our markets over time and we'll also look to some other markets around the world as we look forward here. Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Was there a purchase price for Intelliflo or any financial details or how much revenue profit et cetera? Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. So it wasn't a material acquisition relative to let's say Guggenheim. So we've not disclosed the nature of the magnitude of the transaction and that's really pretty consistent with our past practices. It's not going to be material to revenues and expenses being all impacted this year at least. Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks very much. Good morning, folks. Maybe just coming back to the net revenue, your comment, Loren, on the sort of migration towards that more 39 basis point area next year in terms of your assumptions on that. You mentioned that the pipeline of new potential wins more in the 65 basis point area. So I just wanted to see if your assumption of hitting that pipeline is within that 39 basis point, because I realize the ETF franchise and the money market business is going to dilute that. So if you actually do hit a lot of that pipeline, would there be upward \u2013 upside to that 39 bps or is that already in your assumptions? Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. Great question. So I mean the pipeline really goes out six months, nine months, since it's not all the way into 2019 typically they get funded. And so the 2019 commentary is a little bit uninformed in terms of what the pipeline is going to look like at the end of the year, so the guidance that I'm giving you taken with a grain of salt. It's not based on a ton of information other than sort of general trends of mix of where we see the growth and largely around ETFs in particular, and then to some extent money market as well. So I would say we could do better than that, it's quite possible. But we kind of think that all absent any other information, that's probably the right place to guide people. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe big picture question on the sort of the large chunky institutional outflows and this is obviously an industry issue we're seeing across the asset manager space and lot of it's not in your control because of the allocation decisions by sovereign wealth funds and pension plans. But you guys do have a very good menu of products and solutions capabilities to potentially be on the winning side of some of those things. So maybe, Marty, if you can talk about sort of how you see that outlook ,whether there's a chance you'll get some more wins like the Rhode Island 529 plan and then maybe sort of how you see it sort of from a risk perspective of pension plans doing more allocations away from your core products? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. It's a really good question. So what I can say generally is \u2013 and this'd be around the world, globally what we are seeing the finals that we are in and through quite a broad range of capabilities. The size of the mandates are dramatically larger than they have been over the past number of years. That's a very good sign that's going to continue. And within the pipeline, as Loren said and it continues to grow, it continues to broaden and continues to strengthen. We also try our best to determine what the redemptions are by doing all the things that you would hope, client engagements, the feedback they would have, how the performance is, all those things that you would think be normal factors and decision making. We don't do a good job in forecasting redemptions institutionally, more often than not or I think there's not \u2013 you'll get an immediate termination and it can be a corporate event, it can be an asset allocation decision, but just had at a pension meeting. So it is really hard to do it and we continue to try to get better at it. But it makes it hard for these conversations from a credibility point of view when you look at the one-offs that happened and clients are entitled to make those decisions and they do and they frankly should. So again, we try to do a better job, we'll continue to try to do a better job of it. It's very hard to get real insight into it. But what we do have a much better sense is the growing magnitude of the size of the institutional accounts and the breadth of them. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. I guess that would sort of say to the extent that you can and I guess when you move the sales force towards maybe in more proactive solutions sale, that would maybe get you into that conversation earlier, is that \u2013 or do you think that's kind of a moot point. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: There are actually two different things. So let me follow up, I see where it's going. So look, the whole firm, the sales force is changing how we're facing off with clients. It is not selling a product, it is a deep product relationship with the client trying to understand what they're trying to accomplish and meet their needs in a broad way, that is really what's going on. And compensation has changed to follow that approach as opposed to being sort of product specific to the total relationship of a client. So that's probably not unique to us, but anybody that has a broad range of capabilities or solutions capabilities is likely doing that. It still doesn't mean that you're going to get the insights into individual decisions that can happen. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Harris from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. I wanted to come back to investment performance because it is obviously so important. When I look at Invesco, I mean you guys have clearly significant scale, significant financial resources. You' think those would be really pretty material competitive advantages particularly relative to smaller asset managers. But it just seems like that's not necessarily translating into superior investment performance, at least on the equity side of the firm. And just wondering if you guys could maybe talk a little bit about why you think that might be and if there's anything you can do to perhaps address that? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Hard to address, because I disagree with it. So again it's back to the conversation that we've been having. So we do have in our equity capabilities a large value bias, and they have grown in size over the last number of years because of the very good performance. It's relatively underperforming where we are in the marketplace, and that has \u2013 when you look at the macro numbers, it paints the overall macro numbers. There's still very, very strong performance throughout the organization. So that's the best that I can do with that if you want to play back the tape 12 to 18 months ago, the numbers are very, very different and you wouldn't be even have asked the question. Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Well, okay. Let me just get a clarifying question here then. These performance numbers we're looking at, the AUM in top half versus peer group, doesn't that control for that? So like the growth numbers or versus growth managers and the value numbers or versus value managers or is that not necessarily the case? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: It depends on the peer group too. So if you look at within our \u2013 if you look at our growth capabilities, international growth capabilities, there's a value bias to it. So it will look like it's relatively underperforming those firms that are momentum growth investors. So if you want to say that that's a same style you can draw that conclusion. That is a shortfall of trying to simplify something by style boxes as an industry that's what we do. But when you look at the individual mandates, that's not how clients are investing or individual investors are investing through IFAs or financial advisors. That's really where the problem is. And if you compare our diversified dividend capability which is a value capability against comp stock which is a very deep value capability, people are making very different decisions about that. Those are in broad strokes value capabilities, that's where the flaws come in. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. Chris, I'd say the one thing that's probably self-evident though. We don't offer today currently as much growth, pure growth and momentum oriented products as others do. And I'd say that is right now showing up as a business challenge, because that's what selling as Marty said. And so you could certainly falter if you wanted to that we don't add as much of a balance in our mix of product to cover the kind of extreme environment that we're in today, because we do have a probably a higher concentration in value oriented products particularly in the U.S. than maybe others do. Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Marty, just wanted to circle back on your commentary before about some of the industry challenges, curious how you see the industry evolving in response to those challenges that you outline, what changes to firm structures and operations could we see? And do you think we could see more consolidation broadly, what sense a situation could it make sense for Invesco to partake in that? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. So \u2013 new license, everybody does a lot of thinking about these things. Look the way that we've been building a firm the way that we've built the firm and how we continue to evolve, we think is addressing that very, very directly. And we think broad breadth of the investment capabilities, is in a stable phase. They need to be able to perform over market cycles, that's not enough. You literally have to have a solutions capability to interface with these clients as all whether it'd be a retail platform or institutional platform is narrowing. What you also need under those things in our view is and you can see by we believe technology is an enabler not just operationally but very much for meeting client needs, that's why we're building those platforms. And we also believe that you do need scale to generate \u2013 to be competitive in this marketplace. If you ask me up at the level of scale you needed five years ago, I would not have thought that that was such a hugely important factor for success going forward. It is because of the demands on money managers going forward to do more than just manage money for clients and not just invest in investment capabilities but also in operational capabilities largely around technology. So scale becomes really an important factor as you look to success going forward, so if you make these investments going and we've all been talking about. Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And then just following up quickly on the solutions side, just wanted to dig in there a little bit more. Just curious how much in assets would you say Invesco is managing today and solutions mandates and can you talk about how you're expanding your capabilities on the institutional side of the solutions. It's a competitive market place, how are you approaching the solutions market on the institutional side, and what's differentiated with investments approach? Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah, so we probably \u2013 so there's been a build-up over the last two plus years. We have north of by 45 professionals in the solutions group differently than a number of our competitors. What they use is our range of capabilities, all right. So it is using our capabilities to meet client needs. Solutions probably gets over used because it's expressed in different ways. So we actually use it in the retail channel. It's started in the U.S. retail channel for us, working with if you want to call it corner offices and working with financial advisors, analyzing their portfolios, helping them determine how best to change their asset allocations to meet the needs that they want. So solutions by the name itself suggest that we take all the assets and manage them all, it's a misnomer. So that's what's happening at a retail level. Institutionally, it's somewhat of the same engagement where very sophisticated clients are working with firms like us and our solutions team to do analytics and looking at their portfolios to see how they might make changes to meet different outcomes they want to. These are sophisticated institutions. They have resources and capabilities. They're wanting to get different perspectives in making their decisions. That's what's different. So many of these interactions are not leading to taking over the totality of the assets, but broadening our relationship with them and expanding the number of mandates we might have with them from a pure solutions assets under management. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. I mean if you aggregate kind of that multi-asset and all those things I mean we're talking about $60 billion within that range. But again I think the biggest opportunity may be right now in terms of being an enabler ... Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: ... for our retail institutional business as opposed to if your standalone business that is creating solutions or doing LDI or something of that nature. Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And is that $60 billion on the institutional side or is that both? How do you... Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: That's both retail and institutional. Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And on the institutional side, is there a number that you're able to share... Loren M. Starr - Invesco Ltd.: ...half and half, somewhat maybe a little bit more retail than institutional. Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks very much. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Yeah. Thanks, Michael. Operator : Speakers, we show no further questions in queue at this time. Martin L. Flanagan - Invesco Ltd.: Great. Thank you very much for joining Loren and I and we'll be in contact next quarter and before that in various conversations. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now, I would like to turn the call over to your speaker for today, Marty Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco and Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin. Martin Flanagan : Thank you and thank you everybody for joining us and I appreciate you changing your schedule so quickly. Some very, very good news, we're going to talk about the transaction between ourselves Oppenheimer and MassMutual and also go over the third quarter results and if you're so inclined the presentations on our website if you want to follow along. [indiscernible] has been quite a bit of news in the market about this combination for a period of time, but before we get into the third quarter results, I really want to clarify some very important key points. The combination will result in Invesco being the thirteenth largest global asset manager in the world and the sixth largest manager in the US retail channel, both are very important when you think of the importance of scale and client relevance as we look forward. The financial returns are extraordinarily compelling. For the partial year 2019, we're expecting 18% accretion, in the full year 2020 27% accretion and post synergies we anticipate an additional billion dollars of cash flow for the combined company, so really quite extraordinary. We're also very excited that MassMutual can be a long time strategic shareholder of 15.5% equity stake in the $4 billion of preferred, but Loren get into details in a few minutes, but what's really important, MassMutual is not selling or taking every dollar, all the proceeds to the backing of the combined institution, showing their commitment and the excitement for the opportunity in front of us. And the other point I want to make, we're going to initiate today a $1.2 billion stock buyback which is also an important part of the discussion that we'll be having today. So with that Loren, you can talk through the financials, yeah. Loren Starr : Yeah, thank you very much Marty. So on Slide 7 you'll see a summary of the results for the third quarter and continued to demonstrate strong long-term investment performance with 63% and 67% actively managed assets in the top half of peers over the three and five years. Our year-to-date gross sales are up 16.7% versus prior year, market dynamics and some near-term performance challenges continue to impact redemption leading to total long-term net outflows of 11.2 billion for the quarter. Adjusted net operating income was 358 million for the quarter, that was down from 377 million in the prior quarter and that was driven by a lower revenue yield resulting from a change in AUM mix, the negative impact of foreign exchange and the impact of lower transaction fees within other revenues. Additionally, on expense side, we saw some elevated marketing and technology expenses this quarter. These items are also impacted our adjusted operating margin, which decreased to 37% from 38.7% in the prior quarter. We returned 124 million to shareholders during the quarter two dividends and we've made good progress in paying down the balance on our credit revolver in early October and we expect to have our leverage ratios buffer in line with our previous Guggenheim acquisition levels by the end of the fourth quarter. Moving on to slide eight, we highlight more in terms of investment performance for the quarter over the one, three and five years. As we've noted in past conversations, our investment processes and approach are focused on generating our performance over a full market cycle, so we typically see fluctuations between quarters. The current market cycle is impacting the relative performance of a number of large value-based equity investment approaches representing more than 10% of included AUM, but some of their recent market volatility and more favourable market condition, however, the teams have seen near term improvement as you would expect. As an example, diversified dividend is now in the top debt file [ph] on a quarter-to-date basis, and also our UK equity portfolios and international growth portfolios are in the top quartile. Let's turn to flows on slide 8. As I noted, while gross sales have been robust for the quarter up more than 17% on a year-to-date basis for 2017, we did see net negative flows during the third quarter as market dynamics weighed on redemptions and the net results. With a pockets of strength within ETFs with nearly 1.5 billion of employees in US ETFs and that included nearly a 0.5 billion of flows into our bullet share franchise winning new flows in these products based closed to nearly 1 billion. Commodity ETFs in Europe and then commodity ETFs in U.S. were weaker in line with industry trends, which led to modestly negative path for the ETF flows for the quarter. On the active side, the outflows were largest in the U.S., the U.K. retail equity products, which continue to face some of the challenges as noted earlier. Additionally, on the institutional side, we saw a two sovereign wealth fund up close with total nearly 2.5 billion. We also saw varying outflows from an Asian client in our bank loan strategies and there was a $1 billion real estate outflow, which we had mentioned on the previous quarter call, all of which contributed to the negative flow this quarter. So despite these one-time outflows in our institute outflows, I want to mention that our institutional pipeline is in fact an all-time high in terms of both AUM and revenues with AUM in the pipeline, which is one but not funded up more than 35% versus the prior quarter and up over 30% versus prior year, and that should help elevate our flows in future periods. And also like to note, that while you see on this chart, we did see very strong flows and there are great wall JV, money market product with nearly 5 billion in inflows for this quarter and that's a trend that we would expect to continue in Q4. With that, I'm going to turn it back to you Martin. Martin Flanagan : Thanks, Loren. And why don't we now turn to the transaction. As again, we're very excited about it, it's 100% consistent with our strategy and really it's going to rapidly advance the strategy that we've been talking about with all of you. But if you turn to page 11, I think importantly, you really want to know the fact is Oppenheimer Funds because it's clear, it's not understood really that robustness of Oppenheimer and how it's consistent with the strategy that we've been talking to you about. The first thing we're really excited about, obviously, it's the strength to the organization, it's incredible talents with group of people who are looking forward to working with them going forward and helping create something really quite special. The organization has $250 billion dollars in assets under management, 75% of the assets are hard to replicate differentiated active and alternative strategies. They have exceptional investment talent generating very good consistent long-term performance. 59% of assets are in four and five star rated funds and the business is financially robust. Net annual revenues of $1.4 billion, the net revenue yield is 56 basis points and operating margin of 40%, all of which is accretive to Invesco. On page 12, I want to make very, very clear, our strategy is unchanged, we continue to focus on strengthening our leadership in our core markets while executing high growth areas and we believe you must do both of these to be successful going forward. And one is not going to be satisfactory for success as you look to future. If you do both of these very well, we feel very strongly that you generate lead set of capabilities for the benefit of both clients and shareholders. What we truly believe is unique about Invesco is a combination of our leadership in core markets and our investments into these high growth areas. The combination with Oppenheimer, now, the relationship with MassMutual will meaningfully expand our leadership in the U.S. wealth management industry, while also strengthen our ability to execute in several of these high growth areas. This transaction rapidly advances our growth strategy and it's fully aligned with our clients' needs as we look to the future and that of the industry. One final point that I would like to make on page 14, is that from a context point of view of the $87 trillion in assets under management in the industry, the U.S. wealth management segment is the largest segment in the world with 23% of global assets under management is going to continue to grow. I think what's also very important, I think it's all clear to all of us that it will grow and be important but to be concentrated in fewer investment managers hands in the years ahead. The notion of having client relative to scale is an absolute necessity. So turning to the combination itself, creating a $1.2 trillion global asset manager, the vision of Oppenheimer Funds provides a number of benefits to the combined organization for our tenants, our business and shareholders represents a strong strategic and cultural fit for both of our organizations and the power really comes from a combination of four different areas, scale and client relevance, differentiated investment capabilities, compelling financial returns and the strategic relationship with MassMutual. If you take a look at client scale and relevance, as I mentioned, will be the 13th largest global investment manager in the world providing the necessary skill to compete and invest on behalf of our clients and our shareholders, but importantly the immediate impact of the combination will create a clear leader in the US retail with Invesco becoming the sixth largest U.S. investment manager with $680 billion in client assets. Another point of client relevance is looking at the relationships with the top 10 US wealth management organizations in United States. Our relationships will be meaningfully more important, as you can see with these key platforms at the close we will have five relationships with more than $30 billion in assets under management. When we turn to the investment capabilities of sales and the impact on the combined organization is incredibly compelling. Invesco's and Oppenheimer's strengths are very complimentary to one another. It broadens our comprehensive range of investment capabilities, which will not only benefit the U.S. retail market, which is what we're looking at here. But opportunities in the combined firm and the institutional market both in the United States and outside of the United States and again a number of these capabilities in the retail channels outside of the United States too. Importantly, 85% of the Oppenheimer Funds are in high demand Alpha persistent, your asset classes you can take a look at international equities, emerging markets, global equities, and also very important income-focused alternative areas, high yield muni's bank loans et cetera, so again, the combined rankings post transaction are incredibly compelling. If you take a look at the investment profiles, the investment performance profiles of the two firms, they are also highly complementary as you would imagine, from my prior comments, they are generally counter cyclical, so this is great news for our clients, it will help them through different market cycles and it is also a business benefit at the same time. So I truly believe and the organization believes this is incredibly powerful combination that will immediately benefit our clients, our shareholders and both of the organizations and we could be more excited about it. I'm going to turn it over to Loren have him go into more depth of the financial results of the combination. Loren Starr : Thanks, Marty. So, in addition to a very compelling strategic rationale for the combination that Marty just outlined. We expect the transaction to provide strong returns for our shareholders in line with our previously stated financial criteria for acquisitions. For those following along I'm now on Slide 20. Excluding the impact of incremental intangible amortization and one-time integration charges, our pro-forma EPS accretion is approximately $0.38 or 18% in the year of closing and this is to - second quarter closed it in three quarters of accretion. In 2020 with the full benefit of the cost synergies in place and a full year of financial accretion, we expect to achieve $0.80 or 27% EPS accretion. As a result of the combination and the inclusive - an inclusive of the expected run rate synergies of 475 million, we expect to add nearly a $1 billion in incremental EBITDA and by 2020 we project to have an operating margin well in excess of 45% and a combined annual EBITDA of more than $3 billion. The purchase price will be satisfied with a combination of roughly 81.9 million common shares and 4 billion in non-cumulative perpetual preferred shares that has a 21 non-co-op period and a fixed rate coupon of 5.9%. Today, stock price based on where we are today that translates into a total consideration value of approximately 5.7 billion. In addition, MassMutual will become a long-term shareholder and our largest shareholder at 15.5%, MassMutual intends to be a long-term strategic partner and a shareholder of Invesco in this regard they're entering into a two-year lock up on the common shares. In addition, MassMutual has indicated that they do not intend to sell their common shares after the lock-up period expires, the transaction is a tax free reorganization for them and it's highly tax efficient for MassMutual. So any sale of shares in the future could trigger a sizable taxable event for them, again, incentive for them to continue to hold their shares on a long-term basis. So reflecting the financial strength of the combined business, as well as the additional cash flow that will result from the combination, as Marty mentioned, we are announcing a $1.2 billion common share buyback program, which is to be completed within the next two years, importantly this will be funded through operating cash and as such we do not intend to take on any additional leverage to satisfy that. Moving to the next page, as noted, we expect to add nearly 1 billion in incremental EBITDA after synergies in terms of the modelling for your purposes we included some assumption of breakage and we acquired AUM of about 4 percentage points in 2019 and a modest level of organic growth in future years. Additionally, we've modelled modest fee reductions of approximately 45 million in future periods. We have a plan to capture by 2020 and approximately 475 million in cost synergies within the combined organization and that represents approximately 14% of our combined expense base. We have a high degree of confidence that we can achieve our synergy target and it clearly is something we demonstrate in the past through prior acquisitions. The savings will come from the scale benefits and the platform synergies and this will be focused primarily in the middle and back office areas and activities such like such as streamlining operational technology platforms, leveraging preferred vendors and rate cards across the combined organization. And the transaction which has been approved by the Board of Directors of both companies is expected to close, as I mentioned in the second quarter of 2019. And with that I'm going to turn it back to Marty. Martin Flanagan : Thanks, Loren, and I do want to come back to the history of our success in making these combinations work on page 22. A number of you have followed us for years and the track record is a proven track record and I have a high degree of confidence in the team, it's highly experienced, I believe we have the industry leading track record of success in delivering the benefits of clients and shareholders as we've discussed and laid out here. And if you just look at what's happened from PowerShares with $6 billion in assets under management originally in organic growth and to follow on acquisitions, $230 billion in assets under management today and the number two position in smart beta and four - number four position in ETFs overall really quite compelling. The Morgan Stanley, Van Kampen track record by all accounts was also an incredible success for the organization for our shareholders. So when we look at our history, we have delivered each and every time and I have tremendous confidence in our abilities to that. With this combination between the two organizations, we will create an exceptional organization. We're going to have a better client experience by the time that we're done with this. It's going to generate excellent results for our shareholders. We're going to do this on and on with our new colleagues at Oppenheimer and I couldn't be more excited. And to put this all in context, we believe this transaction is incredibly compelling bringing scale and client relevance, differentiated investment capabilities, really compelling financial returns for our shareholders and important strategic partner MassMutual. It is going to be really a special organization and we look forward to doing it with our colleagues at Oppenheimer. So with that why don't we open it up to Q&A? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Bill Katz and please state your company name. William Katz : Okay, thank you very much, from Citi Group. So thank you very much for taking the question this morning. So I'd like just to come back to the savings opportunity for a moment, I think you the highlight 475 million and Loren just gave a little bit more detail when you post your comment here. Can we break that down a little bit more a couple of different ways, how much of its coming from standalone Invesco platform? How much of its coming from the legacy Oppenheimer foot print? And then can you break it down maybe by a line item between - in between - you mentioned mid obvious, but comp versus non-comp just to get a sense of the savings because here the question is, you're running at about 45% margin round numbers, they're running at 40%, both are pretty good, I'm just surprised by the amount of redundancy that you've identified. Martin Flanagan : Thanks Bill. So, I appreciate the question, you should be surprised. So what has been presented right here something is going to conversation amongst the industry in the benefit of scale. And if you think of the Oppenheimer organization, incredible organization largely in the mutual fund industry, but their capabilities are beyond that. So that's another topic. There is the opportunity, as I said earlier for institutional channel non-US, but when really going with this is you're looking at the organization where we have a mutual fund operation too. The scale benefits from operation are astonishing, right, it's really the systems conversion that come out of it, just all the benefits you get from scale, that's really the model that we're looking at and if you compare that to different combinations that you've seen in the marketplace, it is two organizations and two different industries or two different segments or two different continents, you can't get scale benefits. This place right down in the middle of something that will be a huge benefit to the organization. So where we are right now, this we have a high degree of confidence in these numbers, it comes from all of our experience and what we know about the operating platforms, Oppenheimer was already heading down the path to make a number of changes themselves, you do have to look at it across the combined platforms. Our next step is to use our playbook and we'll team up area by area with each of our colleagues at Oppenheimer and work through the plan and execute it over the next number of months and again we just feel very confident in knowing the path forward. So the level of detail that you're asking for now, we're not in a position to share that we have to create the plans with Oppenheimer and but do know - we know how to do this. William Katz : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Glenn Schorr and please state your company name. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks. Could we first talk about distribution, I get the scale and I get all the advantages you talked about at the scale and the rankings and each of the channels and wealth management's important. But is there much unique overlap on distribution where you were strong they weren't and vice versa. [indiscernible] bring specific distribution? Martin Flanagan : Yeah, so the best way to look at the complementary nature of it is on page 17, where we list the top 10 wealth managers and you'll note where we're stronger and we've been very stronger and again it's a combination that is creating much better set of outcomes, so that's at that level. So client relevance is kind of really come through with those wealth management platforms. But I think what I really want to point you to is that if you look at the investment capabilities between these two organizations they're very complementary. And if you look at really where you're going forward the impact is in high demand asset categories right, international equities emerging markets global et cetera and you can look for yourself. And although we're presenting it from a mutual fund point of view for the two organizations, these are capabilities that are in demand and different channels beyond the U.S. retail channel and again I think it's very important understand I often do want to make a point. There is no revenue synergies contemplated at all in what you're seeing today and so it's a very focused view on the existing business. Does that recon to the point? Glenn Schorr : No it definitely does. I appreciate that. It brings up the other interesting point of - you noted 85% of assets are in those categories where passes a sub 10%, and you mentioned that international EM and global. Do you have high confidence that those aren't just next on the passive hit parade because I'm pretty sure you have passive strategies that are trying to get add at assets in those categories. So I just want to make sure that we're not buying into just the next piece of secular decline? Martin Flanagan : Yeah, so it all depends on your core belief. Our core belief is that passive in a particular factor, high-conviction active and alternative is here to stay. And if you - the notion that you're going to have a passive across the different asset categories is correct, you're going to be generating alpha from active capabilities, it's just not going to go away and that is not a common belief I would say right now, but if you look at the track records they're compelling. Glenn Schorr : One last quickie on fund mergers, on Slide 18, as much as there's not lots of overlap on the high demand strategies there seem to be within each of those categories enough overlap. Have you worked through some of those decisions and within each of those asset classes? Martin Flanagan : No. Look, we were all of two hours into the go forward and again we will work with our colleagues at Oppenheimer and over the next month, create a plan and again we'll share it with you, but we don't have that level of detail right now. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Thanks Marty. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Robert Lee and please state your company name. Robert Lee : Right, thank you. Robert Lee, KBW. Thanks guys for taking my question. Maybe we're going back to the phase of expense synergies, if I remember correctly when you did the Van Kampen deal you were able to pretty much get this - get synergies like day one after close and not that you're necessarily expecting this, but can you give us some sense of kind of how you expect that to kind of layer in. And then maybe as a follow-up with the breakage assumptions, I mean understanding mainly mutual funds or maybe little less breakage, it has institutional. But just given the importance of platforms and centralize research, can you kind of help us get to how you compliment that only $10 billion of breakage from Oppenheimer is kind of a good number or a conservative number? Loren Starr : So what we have assumed in terms of the modeling and we have a view or sense of confidence around is that most of the synergies we think would be sort of taken in the first year close, I think we have somewhere between 75% to 85% assumption in terms of what could be achieved with the rest being fully achieved in 2020. I think again it's something that we feel like we have a good play book in terms to have execute this, so once again it should not be very hard and complicated for us to go forward. I think in terms of the breakage, the numbers that we are actually quite similar to what we had thought of the percentage Van Kampen, again it's based on what we've done in terms of our studies of how things work, we do think $10 billion is a reasonably good estimate obviously there's some swing around that number, it doesn't make a huge difference. It is a few percentage points maybe accretion here and there, so but we don't think it's going to be anything much dramatically offer those numbers. Robert Lee : Great and if I can just one quick follow-up, just maybe going back you guys have obviously been talking a lot the last couple years about the investments you've making in the platform whether it's Jemstep and other things and certainly have been excited about that and thinking about 2019 as being the point in time where may we start to see some of the fruits of that start to come through. I mean are you all concerned that this - given the size of this transaction that it just becomes kind of a distraction over the next six, nine months or year as people kind of wonder about where they shake out in this and maybe that actually pushes the ability to realize some of those benefits out? Martin Flanagan : Good question, the answer is absolutely not. So again we wouldn't be doing this if we think with macro trends the business and at the same time be able to advance a number of those growth efforts that we've been on and [indiscernible] management team we've been through that have with the high degree of competence that we'll not do it. Loren Starr : Yeah I would say I mean year-to-date, we've had about $13 million of net flows into the areas that we have been focusing on growth we talk about a lot of already ETF through example from the factors based capabilities a lot of that's in the pipeline, institutional pipeline. We're actually seeing an enormous sort of buildup in our Jemstep pipeline where we've got I think really very close to production and ongoing support as part of this process, a very large client that will come through in short order and the area we're seeing more sort of in contracting we're winning probably the majority - we're actually winning share in this space. I think we have sort of generated four out of 11 kind of major banks and so we're feeling good about Jemstep into the digital advice and where that is going. So across the board, I'd say our growth engines are moving forward in a very positive way and again I mentioned China if you have another example. So obviously we didn't have a lot of time to highlight it in this call, but I think we're absolutely going to continue to provide the visibility in terms of how our areas of growth are going to continue to allow us to sort of turn that low trajectory to a positive number into 2019. Robert Lee : Great, thanks for taking my questions, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ken Worthington and please state your company name. Ken Worthington : Hi, Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. So the deal comes nine years essentially to the day after you announced Van Kampen and so I guess we're going to have to pay attention, closely to what you're doing in October 27 for the next one. So I guess congratulations. So what are your thoughts in terms of cross marketing or cross selling with MassMutual over time? Maybe is a place to start, what percentage of Oppenheimer's AUM is actually sourced from MassMutual and then what kind of incremental investment dollars might you expect from your new partner and what products investor products seem best positioned? Martin Flanagan : Yeah, so great question Ken. So we've already had half a day conversation with the respective leadership between the two organizations and there are a number of areas where we think there are opportunities by the way we're just into it right now, so let me give you - as you know they have 8,500 advisors in the United States and so that is something that's going to be an obvious focus area for us. MassMutual's also doing some very interesting things out in Asia, very complementary to what we're doing, so that's another area where we think there's some real opportunity for us, those are two to name a few. And with their knowledge and skills in insurance and risk along with what we do in investment management, I'm sure we're going to find some very interesting things. There's going to be quite a bit of focus in this area. I really can't get through to disclose the level of what they've done together historically that's just not in our permit to do right now but it is actually something that is from our perspective is going to be quite powerful as we go forward. Ken Worthington : Thanks. Maybe a little one for Loren, you guys mentioned AUM was about $250 billion. Market conditions particularly outside the US have been poor so far this quarter. Do you have a maybe more accurate AUM figure for us to kind of start out from or even as of date of the 250 billion? Loren Starr : I mean it's moved around plus or minus, I mean they've actually held pretty closely to the 250, I think it probably still rounding roughly to 250 million. So it has not been a lot of turmoil into the AUM number and flow trajectory we do have seen is been on a very positive trajectory for their franchise, so some outflow, but in on the positive trajectory over the last two months. So I think again in terms of numbers I would still be thinking 250 million is the right modeling number for you. Ken Worthington : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Fannon and please state your company name. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Dan Fannon, Jefferies. I guess just building on that last comment and talk about a little more detail about recent flow trends and we obviously saw your results this morning on a standalone basis where outflows are close to 11 billion, you just mentioned, I think with the data we can see is Oppenheimer has generally been in a little bit more outflow, it's improving but still been an outflow. So give us a little bit more around why you think flows on a 2020 basis will be positive given what we're seeing today from performance and kind of current industry trends? Loren Starr : Yeah. Back again and - again for all of us who are long-term investors that look quarter-to-quarter, which is probably not very constructive, so I'd put it in the context of - I'm very bullish on the industry, it's $87 trillion initiatives it's not going to go away. The organizations that get it right are going to be very successful we intend to be one of those organizations. So now when we bring it down here, we have seen net inflows for nine years. Some headwinds and because of where we are in this market cycle for some of our value capabilities as we told you that will change and it is changing as you know we'll again will continue to see the impact there. But what we're doing is building organization that to push through these more extreme market environments - long talk about the institutional flows Jemstep in 2019, the opportunities that we're talking about with Oppenheimer here, but stay back to even put that off to the side. What we are seeing in the factor capabilities and our solutions capabilities are multi asset capabilities where we [indiscernible] meaningful and we're expecting to be very successful as we go forward. Martin Flanagan : I think I already mentioned Dan, is there any global and international capabilities that are hard to replicate that are persistent. They've actually done very well in terms of flows and it's really some of the other areas, some of the domestic kind of equity areas that has been an industry trend when you see the biggest outflows. So we do think as we are able to leverage the capabilities on a global basis, which are in demand that we're going to be able to bring the whole franchise a positive flow and again we've talked about our own strategies around growth and how we think we can bring sort of the core Invesco capabilities also grow. So that's why we - 2019, definitely we got some outflows, nothing happened up overnight but we do think by 2020, that's the reason will remain] modest but certainly positive. Dan Fannon : Got it and then just a couple of questions on the accretion assumptions that you're making just to be clear is that on based on consensus estimates and then also is the buyback that you announce this morning included in that accretion. And then or so just kind of like what does - and it's also kind of what market assumptions are in that? Martin Flanagan : So, yeah. So effectively it versus consensus, so that is the right assumption. In terms of the buyback, the 1.2 billion there's about 400 million of incremental buyback that we have modelled in as a result of the transaction occurring but the 800 million is pretty much consistent with consensus and so we're - that's not part of the accretion numbers. So I'd say there's about 1% accretion in 2019 due to that incremental 200 buyback and another sort of 2.5 in 2020. Dan Fannon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Cyprys and please state your company name. Mike Cyprys, your line is open. Please check your mute feature. Martin Flanagan : Mike, we cannot hear you. Operator : We are getting no response. We'll move to the next question. The next question is from Brennan Hawken and please state your company name. Brennan Hawken : Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. From UBS. So just a quick one on the $45 million fee rate cut in your merger Mass, I think that gets me to about 2 or so basis points, which would suggest about a 59% I.A.C. for Oppenheimer. Can you - number one, is that generally right and number two, how much fee rate pressure has Oppenheimer experienced over the past year or two either through their own fee cuts or the headwinds that we've seen from remix in across the industry? Loren Starr : Let me hit the second part and then Martin can pick up the one. Literally their effective fee rate has gone up over the last three years by I think it's about 3 basis points, so they've been doing quite well. And again their fees are very competitive, generate very good active managers. Martin Flanagan : So again the $45 million has been estimated, really at this point we don't have a build plan in terms of how funds come together and which ones are going to sort of win in terms of fee rates but there's definitely some amount of breakage that will happen when we bring funds together. So $45 million is the number that I think it still needs to be ultimately let it out and more obviously give updates as we get closer to a real plan around how the funds come together. But we think it's really conservative number right now little bit more than we actually hope will be the case. But it does have that impact from in terms of basis points as you mentioned. There is no assumption of further because going forward per se because of their price; their products are actually reasonably priced. And again in terms of the alpha creation and the ones that are higher priced, some of the alternative capabilities are all sort of reasonable on the core products reasonably left there. There's no significant pressure on having the cut fees on the active capabilities. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks for that color. And then have you spoken with the rating agencies about the potential impact of issuing this extensive amount of preferred equity? And is there any reason why the first wouldn't be viewed as the fact that given that they're non-callable in 20 year? And then finally, if you do see a downgrade for a rating agency, what kind of impact did you expect that would have? Martin Flanagan : So, again. I think the agencies will release their reports and ultimately after they go to committee on this and we hope we will hear some of the answers today, so we're not going to sort of go ahead of them doing that. I mean I think we have our own user on the preferred and what it is. Obviously, there is a perpetual coupon 226 million that is going to be part of this deal. 5.9% coupon right now as you said might feel expensive, but we think over time it might not seem like expensive to you. You find there is no commitment for us to have to repay the 4 billion perpetual, there's a whole option and it's out 21 years really is part of requirements to have qualifying equity as part of the tax free reorg that's necessary for MassMutual. So, again, we don't, I mean, personally I don't view it as debt. It has got a lot of equity like characteristics in terms of be non-cumulative and again whatever you can sort of make your own approach and or your own assessment, surely you'll hear from all our ratings partners in terms of how they perceive this and you can assimilate that. Brennan Hawken : Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Cyprys. Please state your company name. Mike Cyprys : Great, thanks, Mike Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Just a question more broadly on M&A, so look across the industry mix results, M&A has been put it kindly. So I guess just what do you see to look across what others get wrong with M&A? What lessons do you take away with that? What do you think you have to get right to make this a highly successful transaction on the execution side for Invesco? Martin Flanagan : Yeah that's a good question. So it's just my opinion. I think trouble happens when you look at a piece of paper and it looks good on a piece of paper and you actually lose track of what really matters and these are fiduciary organizations with talented people and the value is really the understanding what the value is and how do you maintain that and how do you have that talent and how do you have that drive and so we're very focused on being very clear and jointly working through the execution with our partners as we've done historically and it might sound pretty basic, but that is in my opinion where things break down. And I - but let me come back to this. So Mike, you know that we've talked about this in the past. You know, there is this notion that there's going to be massive consolidation in the industry maybe may be not I do that the premises that there's with that thought is that there's excess number of money managers that might be doing a middling job and I think that is the case and that will get resolved one way or the other, but the notion that if you are going to see this massive consolidation with people that have not had experience and that is going to be done well, I think is a misnomer and there so I'd look at this experience here but the first experience I had was 1992 when Franklin bought Templeton when I was there and so I've been on both sides of these things and there is a way to do this and do this successfully. And I understand your sweeping comment but I point you to our track record and we know how to do this. Mike Cyprys : And somewhat related to that, you maybe you could talk a little about the risk around the large fund franchises that Oppenheimer has? How do you manage that? I guess particularly if you can talk about the incentive structures, retention structures you're putting in place to retain key investment professionals and to what extent are they going to be integrated or not? What the broader investment Invesco franchise? Martin Flanagan : Yeah, so important question, so MassMutual has put in retention program which is great but more importantly, people will stay at organizations for money, they stay at organizations because they want to be there because they thrive in a particular for investment managers, so they can actually express themselves through their craft and we actually run our investment teams in a very similar way that MassMutual does, they're separate, they're distinct, we want them dedicated to present process and philosophy, we reinforce that. We wanted to make sure that they have the tools they need to continue to generate alpha for their clients that's what Oppenheimer has done in the past, that's what still going to happen going forward, that's not going to change. And we had the opportunity to meet with some of the senior leaders of the great culture, they really love what they have and that's going to - it's going to continue that way. And I think that's really important and that's what matters and again this is where I come back to you, yeah, when does it fail? It fails when an organization combines and somebody thinks they're going to institutionalize on process and it's probably the worst thing you can do. Mike Cyprys : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Carrier and please state your company name. Michael Carrier : Mike Carrier, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Thanks guys. First one, just on the core business, Martin or Loren, I think you mentioned just the institutional pipeline is strong, maybe when we saw especially heading within August just some of the elevated outflows. Just maybe what you are seeing and what gives you mainly the confidence with that pipeline that we're not kind of seeing in the same level of redemptions or maybe any color on what drove some of those redemptions in the quarter? Martin Flanagan : Again, I think I gave some color already. Obviously, I hear sort of individual accounts that we decided and terminate I think the sovereign wealth is one that we see few times, that was the largest outflow. And so it's not a performance related topic, if not something systematic not a trend and it's really just a single coin topic more than anything else. I could - you know, and not going to happen again, but it's not something that is sweeping across our institutional business which is really localized to a particular client. I think we do feel very good about the pipeline because this broad basis across equity, the alternatives, balanced fixed income and so it is actually again I think it is a function of maybe things have shifted in terms of we're going to manage go in and we are actually heading into new found areas of demand around factor for example and some areas we're on alternatives that we haven't seen in the past. So for us revenue yield is also extremely strong and so the revenue level is also all time high. And then when we look at, we do look at the pipeline of expected losses. That is not, I mean that's funding flat quarter-over-quarter, so it is not escalating out. So I mean that's why we feel that we're just going through a rough patch here in terms of the intuitional side and it should be persistent going into 2019, certainly not anything we see with the information that we have today. Again, redemptions do happen and they can happen, we could get surprise but it just doesn't feel like a trend and it's not based on performance. Again, when we look at the products that are selling either products that are in high really performing well, we will stay in bank loans and other products that are done very well. So, then the other side of the full story I think is the one we all know which is just domestic, equity, retail US has been an outflow some of the value oriented capabilities that we talked about have been under pressure. So that is something that I think in terms of the near term for the turn around that we've seen in October and particular just given the market is sort of a proof point to our client that what we said what's going to happen is happening. Now, again, if anybody's guess as to where the market actually go, because the fact is we've said that this would happen when markets begin to sort of turn around and you begin to see momentum become less interesting that our products are going to outperform, if we do see us we're kind of moving in that direction, it should be really helpful for us, I mean some of the redemptions going forward. Michael Carrier : Okay, that's helpful and then maybe one more from Marty. I look at the history for you guys and even the industry, it seems like you've done M&A on for the gross side and then you've also done some scale transactions and in terms of a little bit of both, but when you think about Invesco going forward like in the areas that are very competitive like the US mutual fund industry, if you just create like an upscale that if you think over the next three, five years that you can combat any future exceed pressures, out flows. And then on the flip side, a lot of the [indiscernible] you guys have made over the past three years on the growth front and it seems like that you're still positioned in the higher growth in your differentiated areas. But just when you think about that combination, you think going forward Invesco, you know it is well positioned as you can get it to basically grow where you can and offset the headwinds through scale. Martin Flanagan : Yeah, absolutely, again, also the points I was trying to drive home, I mean if you look at the US retail industry, we become the sixth largest within that and we end up as one of the absolute leaders and I think that's but I also think what's important just not the number, it is the capabilities that we're bringing there and so historically if you think of the active management capabilities, the addition of Oppenheimer it's dramatically expanding that are in high demand there. You then add that with the early days of factor capabilities being picked up in net retail channel, early days of trying to get alternatives into that channel on a way that works for the channel, the solutions capabilities that are being taken up right now the models that are being built by organizations such as ourselves for that channel. We're uniquely placed there and there are not many competitors that can do that but the scale just puts us on another level there. So I think it's really important. And the other thing I do want to make really clear where you're going is, the information you're seeing today that we're putting forward the expresses the vast majority of Oppenheimer's investment capabilities happen to be an image of fund wrapper. They're capabilities that are beyond but there is greater demand beyond mutual fund capabilities of excess, so it's the institutional opportunity, the non-U.S. opportunity both institutional and retail, the opportunities are meaningful. And again you really have to put this in the context of everything that we've been talking about in executing against right it is a combination of this high condition active, passive factor in particular for us alternatives and I really feel really good about where we've gotten the organization over the last number of years, the last couple years actually in particular with this very rapid advancement of our strategy. And as I've said it in the past it's [0:08:25] combat back to the future, it is changing, it is changing rapidly. And our efforts to then get ahead of that curve in a meaningful way and we think we've done that. Michael Carrier : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Kenneth Lee and please state your company name. Kenneth Lee : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Kenneth Lee, RBC capital markets. I just want to know whether you guys have any updated thoughts on long-term organic growth targets post-acquisition you know maybe post 2019 as well, proved to do sort of like a 3% to 5% range, wondering that's changing? Thanks. Loren Starr : I think we still believe that 3% to 5% is doable for us as a fund across market cycles, this acquisition, we think is going to help significantly improve our ability to grow not just in the U.S. in a more consistent way but also as Marty mentioned taking some of the capabilities globally is going to be a big opportunity for us. So I think there's nothing that's really changed, our belief in the market itself will have something to do with ultimately where we achieved and how we're going to keep the growth. But the growth engine that we talked about are still one that we feel strongly are sort of at a very high level, higher than the industry average physically around digital advice, China those things are at double digit kind of growth opportunities and factor based, we think we can continue to really drive more growth there, so I think long answer to 3% to 5% still feels quite achievable for us. Kenneth Lee : Okay, great. And just a follow up on an earlier question about the strategic partnership with MassMutual. Just want to clarify, is there is some sort of agreement in place for Invesco to provide asset management services going forward or MassMutual insurance and retirement products? Martin Flanagan : No. No there's no agreement. I think what's really important to understand is the MassMutual has put every dollar of the proceeds back into the combine of situation. There's a high degree that they are not getting out of the asset management business, they're staying in it and they're expressing it through their equity holding and the preferred that Loren talked about. And as I said, we have had high level of conversations, I feel very strongly that the appropriate ways to work together will emerge and it will be official to both organizations, so again just very confident in the relationship. Kenneth Lee : Got you and just one last one, just in the quarter within the EU region there were some outflows there. Just wondering whether what key factors drove some of those flows banks? Loren Starr : Yes. So that was the sovereign wealth outflows that I mentioned physically it was around some of our Asian equity capabilities managed out of our [indiscernible]. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Shutler and please state your company name. Chris Shutler : Hi, guys, good morning. Chris Shutler from William Blair. Within retail, how much of Oppenheimer's AUM is in the broker dealer channel relative to the RIA channel? Martin Flanagan : What I do know is - Loren is looking for some numbers that we have it but they have an incredible distribution capability probably one of the better in the industry is very highly regarded and the results show that. They also have some very good success in the [indiscernible] segment of the market which we do not have, and again, so we look at a combinational thing. We will be better half with the Oppenheimer real talent and I think that they have done. Loren Starr : Yes, so, again, I'm not sure if it's - if I have enough transparency to really start comment in detail around the various assets and channels that it looks like RIAs, bumping around 15 billion of the total numbers, so it's marching [ph] to be mostly through the wealth management platforms, yeah. Chris Shutler : One-five, 15. Loren Starr : One-five, 15, Chris. Chris Shutler : Okay. Thanks a lot. And then correct me if I'm wrong there, it looks like I think about 85% of their Oppenheimer's AUMs in mutual fund wrapper. Can you give us some kind of breakout of what the other 15%-ish of the assets look like how much of it is institutional versus sub advisory, whatever kind of flow trends in that piece of Oppenheimer? Loren Starr : So I think they have smaller institutional capabilities. That's been in an area that we've been trying to grow, there's probably about 10 billion - 12 billion sub advisory fee around 27 billion, 25 billion. So those are the big other pieces that you might not see through the normal sort of channels that you see. They do have smaller other business which again I think it's about 6 billion, so it's mostly in the mutual fund side and ETFs, right. Martin Flanagan : Yeah, 3 billion ETFs, but - So let me come back to that. So what I do want to make very, very clear is that the bulk of the business has been a mutual funds, that is a vehicle, the capabilities with the mutual funds are really very, very strong and we look there is going to be an opportunity for a number of those capabilities to be taken to the distribution channels we have outside of the United States, retail probably, the most immediate followed by institutional both in the U.S. and non-U.S. So again, the high quality investment seems really offer us a real opportunities as we look forward. Chris Shutler : Last one, guys, real quick. How much - and you may have stated this already, so I apologise if that's the case, but the - how much of the AUM at Oppenheimer is in kind of an overlapping strategy with Invesco, where there's two strategies that look pretty close. Martin Flanagan : Yeah, very little overlap which is actually what is so attractive about the other combination. So again we look at the combination of the teams in the strategies as complementary an additive as we look forward. Chris Shutler : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Blostein. Please state your company name. Alex Blostein : Hey, good morning, thanks, Goldman Sachs. I would like to go back to the cost synergy question just one more time guys and I'm sorry if I - if I missed it, but if you think about the $475 million, it looks like it's 50% to 60% of Oppenheimer's cost base that's well above what we've seen with any other transaction and management space of the size in recent history. So what makes this one different I guess to get you guys to this level of synergies that's I guess part one. And part two when you guys talk about the 450 of integration costs that also feels pretty sizable , so maybe help us maybe break that up kind of what that comprises of and how long do you think these integration cost will be in Invesco's run rate? Martin Flanagan : Yeah, so the - I want to clarify that point, so you cannot look at it as a percentage of Oppenheimer's basis, it's not factual or correct. So what we said earlier was the opportunity becomes the dominance of their platform being in mutual funds and our mutual fund capability all being in the United States. The scale benefits that come out of systems integrations and the operations supporting the mutual fund business across both platforms is material and real. And Oppenheimer already was heading down a path of simplification in the like, so this will just speed that up, so again it is - that was very different than the other combinations that you've seen in the marketplace. Loren Starr : Yeah and then the 450, so again there is all sorts of cost associated with completing the transaction and getting process solicitation so forth and so we have some estimates in here in terms of getting to one platform plus one platform and get one platform, so there's cost around technology and integration to get there. So it's a generous number, but it's one that we think as conservative, but you know potentially going to be all used given the degree and the 475 is a big number as you mentioned. So we would expect to see that sort of in line with the timing around the synergies, so you can think of it sort of occurring roughly in step with mostly in year one and then the rest sort of getting finished up in year two being the smaller piece. Alex Blostein : Got it and the 450 is mostly cash I'm assuming, right, cash expenses? Loren Starr : Yeah, those would be cash expenses one time sort of cash expenses. Alex Blostein : Sorry, last one on the tax rate, so I'm assuming you guys will kind of proceed with the adjusted tax rate methodology in terms of how you report earnings. This probably creates a pretty sizable amortization shield. What should be sort of the adjusted tax rate we should be thinking about post the transaction and does that feed into your accretion enough? Loren Starr : Yeah, there's no benefit here from a tax perspective for us, so there's no element in the accretion related to tax benefits. The accounting around the intangible amortization is going to be small, modest, probably somewhere between $50 million $70 million a year, but there is no tax benefit associated with that, so nothing. So the step up in tax rate is going to take our current rate of roughly 20.6% and probably add another two percentage points to it for the firm as a whole just because of the degree of US earnings that we're going to be generating. Alex Blostein : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jeremy Campbell and please state your company name. Jeremy Campbell : Hey it's Jeremy Campbell from Barclays, most of them have been answered, just got one quick clean up question here on the OpEx thing. Loren, I think you obviously mentioned that 75%, 85% is going to come in '19, with a few months of planning, how do you guys in the books here? Are we really looking at something where you can come up pretty hot and heavy out of the shoe or is it going to kind of gradually build from 2Q through 4Q? Loren Starr : Yeah, I think again a little early for us to get into details. We need to work with our colleagues at Oppenheimer to really understand how to execute this. Obviously our intention is to go reasonably quickly, we don't think sort of long timeframe is helpful for anyone, but we need to be thoughtful in terms of doing this is the way we executed so. I think will be able to provide more color exactly around kind of how it gets by quarter as we get a little bit closer to close. Jeremy Campbell : Got it and just one quick follow-up on Alex's question there, just want to be sure, kind of clarification that - that's sort of like the OpEx and the very kind of small extended the buyback here there's no other kind of elements to the accretion math that we might be missing there right? Loren Starr : Nothing else no, as I mentioned the only thing of 200 million of extra buyback in two years and so as to quantify that, that is - that's about the only thing, everything else should be straight from the numbers that you are seeing. Jeremy Campbell : Great, thanks. Martin Flanagan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Bedell and please state your company name. Brian Bedell : Brian Bedell, Deutsche Bank. Thanks very much for keeping the call going here. Two mean questions one on the cost synergies side and one on the potential for revenue synergies and maybe just starting on the cost side. You naturally took a crack at trying to estimate the synergies after this is zooming in the press, 14% cost saves on the total base is pretty high and implies some product rationalization around this and so we took a crack at that and [indiscernible] with around 150 billion of AUM on the mutual fund side to both organizations that could potentially be merged and that was almost 200 billion in costs the way we came up with it. So just wanted to see if that's way off pace and then if you can just talk about the process of timing of doing this fund mergers, for example, do you have fund board approvals yet or does that come after the deal, poses and then would you look to integrate funds in fairly quickly as - so that you're not put on gate keeper watch list. Martin Flanagan : Yeah. That would all the respect that's not how we do it. Though there are no plans for fund mergers, our focus right now is to get to a combined operating platform that will be 100% focused between now and closing. And the synergies that you're seeing are coming from what I've talked about, this is the benefit of scale within an organization and again it happens because it's operational benefits that you get through emerging operational capabilities within - largely mutual fund capabilities within the United States, that's where that's coming from and there's no contemplation, no plan for fund mergers in this work and it won't be until after - yeah we'll turn ahead to sort of what - after the closing and what makes sense there. Brian Bedell : And so if you do you come up with fund managers later down the road would that be upside to the 475 then? Martin Flanagan : Yes. Brian Bedell : Okay, great. And then maybe on the distribution synergy side, so I appreciate your comment on the new products structures I mean obviously mutual funds has been a challenge product structure for a long time, but if you have the investment teams in there and Oppenheimer didn't really create a big product range in that area. How quickly do you think you can come up with institutional product structures to really crank up the net flow ability of the franchise and the 10 billion that you estimate, I assume that's a gross outflow number or is that net of potential of new products offsetting some of the mutual fund have? Martin Flanagan : Yeah, so let me hit on that. So again we're all of two hours into this, so we have some work to do and being clear. But what we do know spending time with the teams that are high quality teams, they are in high demand areas. We as an organization have a very robust instructional capability to get teams what we call client ready for the institutional channel and we are very well equipped to introduce if you want to call it retail structures outside of the United States. But it's just not the structure, it is really the go to market strategy matching up against clients demand, the sales forces, the marketing capabilities, that's what is so robust about this, so again once we spend time with one another figure out what clients are looking for we'll get after pretty quickly. Loren Starr : And the 10 is a net - it's a net outflow number, so it's not a just a redemption number it's a net flow. Brian Bedell : In a number, okay and then without the fund mergers, so you really don't anticipate being put on watch list from other DT specific [ph] distributor [indiscernible]? Martin Flanagan : No. Brian Bedell : Okay. Thank you. Martin Flanagan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Patrick Davitt and please state your company name. Patrick Davitt : Hey, good morning. It's Autonomous Research. Appreciate Slide 17, that's helpful. I imagine most of these probably want to be doing business with less managers, but is there a risk of hitting any exposure limits with big bigger with all these guys? Martin Flanagan : I wish we had that problem but no. Patrick Davitt : Okay. And then you mentioned the great wall flows, I imagine that's all money funds still if not that's great, but what kind of runway to getting more non-money fund kind of flows from that from that distribution level? Martin Flanagan : Yeah, so a couple points, so let me - we can be more excited about that actually. So if you look at our transaction partnership there it is very digitally based economy with the retail world and through we have financial. We are the first and only western joint venture partner that's in there and it starts with money funds and by the way it's 10 basis points so that's 10 basis points and tens of billions of dollars isn't so bad, but if you have a natural follow on is including further investment capabilities in that platform and we anticipate that happening in future here, I don't have the specific dates of it though, but it's a good start for us. Patrick Davitt : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Harrison, please say your company name. Chris Harrison : Good morning, Wells Fargo. Can you guys talk to us a little bit about how this transaction came about and maybe share your perspective on why MassMutual's selling? Martin Flanagan : Yeah, let's see. The transaction came about simply from conversation of where we think the world is going. We were very likeminded in where we thought it was going. All the things that we talked about today are real in the meaningful and when you have an alignment like that we turned consider your focus on what can you do together. But I do want to clarify a point, MassMutual is not selling and they're making that very, very clear and they are taking - they are holding the 81 million common equity shares and $4 billion preferred over the long term. As you know they are a mutual company, they talk about having a long-term view, it's extraordinary. And every single dollar that would be proceeds is going back into this combined intuition and I think it's really important for people to hear and understand, they're committed to combined firm and they have a high degree of confidence in what we're going to do together going forward. Chris Harrison : Okay, understood and kind of unrelated question and some of the larger Oppenheimer Funds we looked at that have had a really extraordinary performance. They do have a large overweighting in the tech sector and so I guess I'm wondering is there a way you guys can mitigate the risks or how do you mitigate the risk of acquiring that after what's been the very good run for stocks in that particular sector? Martin Flanagan : Yeah, so you're really hitting on a question that comes up a different way. No different than Invesco the investment team's managed money consistent with investment philosophy and that's one, two, three in the list that's what we want to do in the going to continue to do that and they generate as you say very good performance over market cycle and within the portfolio sort of the full discretion of the portfolio managers that like a change in our time or has never changed at Invesco. The way that it gets if you want to call it mitigated is through having complementary strategies and that's what we're trying to point out earlier. And so when you look at the lineups side-by-side - if you want to call it that's how you're mitigating the different styles, styles are in favor and out of favor as an organization. It gives clients choice but it's also good for stable - having a more stable business. Operator : And we do have time for one final question. Our last question today is from Greggory Warren and please state your company name. Greggory Warren : Good morning. This is Greg Warren from Morningstar. Just a quick question want to step back to kind of the breakage forecast you guys put out there. I understand that you're basing it on what you saw with Van Kampen, but in all honesty that was 10 years ago and that was a completely different market environment. So what gives you the belief that with the disruption like this with you guys picking up Oppenheimer Funds that you're only going to see 10 billion in outflows out of the gate, I would assume you see something slightly higher than that and I guess a follow-on to that is how much of MassMutual is actually invested in Oppenheimer Funds. How much business are you guys getting from them? Loren Starr : I think with the Van Kampen transaction we used - we estimated 10, it was nothing close to that, it was much less, so that 10 was way conservative back then and we think it's probably still conservative, but we're using it and again when we think about it it's really - because there is no real breakage, we're not foreseeing teams to sort of come together do anything different with the process, so maybe that 10 is just not going to happen, so there are just as a - point of conservatism in the modeling. I don't think there's anything explicitly that we expect from the trigger big outflows as a result of this transaction, but we really needed it when we're thinking about just uncertainty. So that's why the10's there, it's not based on fact or data or it's more kind of conservatism. I think - what was your second question, Gregg I'm sorry? Greggory Warren : Yeah surely how much - how does MassMutual actually have because usually in those situations where the life insurer or an insurer owns part of as a management firm, there's a plenty of cross business between them, so I was just wondering how much MassMutual actually have invested in Oppenheimer Funds at this point? Martin Flanagan : Yeah, no it is not a large number and again I am not trying to - I just don't feel liberty to - that I can have a conversation, so if not a large number of the intent going forward though is - one of the first parts that we collectively want to look at is making available more robustly the investment capabilities here in the United States at 85 - 8,500 advisors. Loren Starr : In terms of the General Account there is really no relationship between what Oppenheimer is doing in the management those of MassMutual has more count. Greggory Warren : Okay. And then Loren, just a quick, I don't know if I caught it or not during the course of the call, but you've got 1.2 billion share repurchase sort of authorized now. Did you give an indication of how soon you might start buying back stock or how much of may be a quarterly run rate you're looking at? Loren Starr : So we can start and we have an intention of beginning after obviously this release gets its due process in terms of two days, so you think about starting next week. And so we're going to be obviously interested given the fact that the stock we feel is credibly undervalued particularly in light of the transaction. But we're also being sensitive to the fact we haven't yet completed the deal and a lot of the buyback and the extra buyback is really on the backs of this deal ultimately bringing more cash flow. So without that said, we are so intent on sort of starting in a very serious way the 1.2 - was now laid out by quarter at this point in time, but we will be in the market almost immediately. Greggory Warren : So would it be comfortable, say you could easily finance a third of that right out of the gate? Loren Starr : No question. Greggory Warren : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Martin Flanagan : Thanks, everybody. Operator I think that's it. Operator : I would now turn it up call back to speakers for closing remarks. Martin Flanagan : Good again just want to thank everybody for changing their schedules and really appreciate engagement the questions and we're very excited about the opportunity in the future here. So thank you very much and we will continue to communicate progress on this combination, but also as Loren pointed out, many good things are going on in our core business and I will bring up to speed on those in future calls. So have a good rest of the day. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.",

Operator : Welcome to Invesco's Fourth Quarter Results Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded, if you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. Now, I would like to turn the call over to your speakers for today, Martin Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer; and Greg McGreevey, Senior Managing Director of investments. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin. Martin Flanagan : Thank you very much and thank you everybody for joining us. Again, if you're so inclined that presentation that we'll be addressing is on the website. So please feel free to follow if you'd like to. So we'll cover the business results for the fourth quarter today. Greg is going to go through the investment highlights, but also talk about the environment and also what the combined investment firm will look - the investment potential also look like. And Loren will go in greater details on our financials. And then finally, I'll give an update on where we are with the Oppenheimer combination. So turning to highlights on page five, there's no question that the fourth quarter is very challenging for the industry and for us. Eight out of ten asset classes were negative territory 2018. It's the worst on record in decades, and 74% of all listed companies were in their market territories. So again, much more difficult than I'd say that we've generally understood in the marketplace. And if you look at our fourth quarter results, we were not immune to the impact of these market dynamics. The good news was gross sales were up, that's a nice health indicator, but absolutely, we had net flows during the quarter, driven by these market dynamics and a big risk off move by many investors around the world. It was further impacted by a number of our key investment capabilities have relative under performance with those with a value bias during that period of time. We did purchased $300 million of stock during the quarter. That's from the $1.2 billion stock buyback program we announced last October. And again I mentioned, Loren will get into the financials in just a minute. As we have previous talked about, over the past few years, we've been actively repositioning the company to what we think are the opportunities in the market. There's no question that Oppenheimer is an important part of this work and will greatly accelerate our activities. And we'll talk about that more specifically in a few minutes. I do want to make the point we are on track to hit our $475 million of synergies and we're making meaningful progress towards hitting the close in the second quarter of this year with Oppenheimer. And we will revisit the financial returns with a combination, because of the fourth quarter being so difficult and you'll see they're very, very compelling still. And so with that Loren, you want to. Loren Starr : Yes. Thank you very much, Marty. So on slide six, you're going to see a summary of the results for the fourth quarter. 54% and 63% of actively managed assets were in the top half of peers over the three and five year periods, while the one year numbers dropped a bit to 41%. We did see significant performance improvement in December and into 2019. And Greg is going to talk about that a little bit later in the presentation. While gross sales are up nearly 27% versus the prior quarter, the market dynamics that Martin talked about, and some near-term performance challenges continue to set redemptions at a higher than normal level. Total long-term net outflows were $20.1 billion for the quarter, significantly contributing to this results were just a small number of larger institutional client redemptions. Adjusted net operating income was $300 million for the quarter, down from $358 million in the prior quarter. The lower revenue environment also impacted our adjusted operating margin, which decreased to 32.6% from 37% in the prior quarter. We did returned $422 million of capital to shareholders during the quarter through $122 million of dividends and $300 million of buybacks. So now let's look at the long-term flows found on page seven. For actively managed strategies outflows remained elevated in Q4. This was particularly true for our U.S. and UK retail equity products, which faced some investment performance headwinds. Active flows were also impacted by a handful of institutional outflows, for example in October we experienced a $5.5 billion low fee mandate redemption associated with a single client. Our passive flows were also somewhat mixed in the quarter, we saw good sales into our European S&P 500 bullet shares, low volatility and ultra-short duration ETFs. However this was more than offset from outflow due to $1.2 billion of naturally maturing bullet shares at year end and $1.7 billion in negative flows from our senior loan ETF. The strength of our pipeline was reflected in our institutional results as gross sales were up more than 80% versus Q3. The single account $5.5 billion low fee outflow that I mentioned previously drove us into negative net flow territory. The strength of our gross sales was well diversified and led by real estate stable value, fixed income and quantitative equity products. I'd also like to note that while you don't see it on these charts we benefited from strong flows into our great wall JV money market products, which added nearly $3 billion in inflows in the quarter. Next, turning to slide eight, our assets under management decreased by $927 billion or 9.5 percentage points, which reflects the impact of negative market returns and long-term outflows. Our net revenue yield excluding performances fees was down 0.3 basis points to 38.6 basis points. This decline was driven primarily by the negative impact of FX end market on our AUM mix, which was partially offset by an increase in the day count and higher real estate transaction fees and other revenues. Let's move to slide nine, where we provide our U.S. GAAP operating results by quarter. My comments today will focus on the variances related to our non-GAAP adjusted measures, which can be found on slide 10. But before turning to those results, one item I want to highlight on our U.S. GAAP financials for the quarter is a new expense line item named transaction integration and restructuring expenses. This line item includes transaction related costs for acquisitions, as well as integration and restructuring related costs. You might remember in fact that we use the same line annual approach when we did the Van Kampen acquisition given the size of that deal and given the size of the Oppenheimer deal. The presentation to prior period business combinations and optimization amounts has been also reclassified to be consistent with the current period presentation. And finally, I would like to note that this reclassification has absolutely no impact on total operating revenues, total operating expenses or net income on a GAAP or on a non-GAAP adjusted basis. So now let me just turn to page 10 for our non-GAAP results and you'll see that our net revenues decreased by $47.7 million or 4.9% quarter-over-quarter to $19.2 million. This decrease primarily reflects a lower average AUM for the quarter, partially offset by higher performances primarily earned from our European real estate investment teams. Our adjusted operating expenses at $619.2 million increased by $10.1 million or 1.7% relative to the third quarter. The expense increase quarter-over-quarter was driven by about $10 million of seasonally higher marketing expenses, which were focused on new fund launches in the UK, ETF offerings in Europe and our U.S. efforts including a focus on our bullet share ETF products. We also saw a $5 million of higher run rate outsource administrative costs - administration costs that's associated with our digital platforms and outsourcing of our back office services. And then finally about $6 million in non-recurring G&A expense from professional services in Q4 as well as there was a large VAT credit that we recognized in the third quarter. These expense increases were partially offset by about $15 million less in variable compensation expense. Our adjusted non-operating income decreased $32.6 million compared to the third quarter largely reflecting the negative mark to market on our seed investments during the quarter. In terms of the firm's effective tax rate increased to 25%, primarily resulting from the impact of these unrealized mark to market losses. And that brings us to our adjusted EPS of $0.44 and our adjusted net operating margin of 32.6 percentage points for the quarter. Next, just turning to slide 11. So let me say that when Oppenheimer joins Invesco in Q2 of this year, as you know we plan on reducing the total expense base of the combined firms by roughly 15%. Clearly that will represent a significant spending reduction. However, given the challenging revenue environment that we're currently experiencing, we're implementing a number of immediate cost control measures that should help to limit the negative impact to our operating results, while we continue to focus on the integration efforts. These efforts are consistent with our historical approach when we manage through extreme volatility like we've been seeing. Some of these actions include deferring new hiring, canceling open requisitions when possible, limiting discretionary non-client travel conferences, training and the slew of other professional service expenses, as well as assessing all other areas of spend for additional opportunities. So in addition to the mentioned activities, we are also working hard to accelerate many of the Oppenheimer synergies and the combined synergies of the firms that we plan on delivering upon close. This is the topic that will be covered in greater detail in a few minutes. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Greg. Greg McGreevey : Thank you very much, Loren. There's a couple of key topics that I'd like to cover today just to set the stage. First, I want to cover investment performance for Invesco as a standalone firm and provide some color on our long-term investment performance. And within that context, we'll look at some early signs of improvement. Second, I want to highlight the significant benefits that we believe we'll achieve through our combination with OppenheimerFunds. And finally, I'll highlight how the expansion of our capabilities with the addition of OppenheimerFunds will enable us to provide better outcomes to clients and that's something we're very excited about. So if you can turn to slide 13, we'll just take a quick look at performance overall. And as Loren referenced earlier in his remarks, on this slide, this chart shows our one, three and five year peer relative performance on a relative basis to peers for our assets under management for the entire firm. And as you can see, our long-term performance remained strong with 63% of our overall actively managed assets in the top half of our peer group. In total, our five year performance has remained strong despite challenging market conditions that Marty referenced, to which you're all aware of over the past 18 months. Favorably and what's not on the slide, we had 40% of our total actively managed assets in the top quartile of our peers on a five year basis, which speaks to our long-term capabilities and a reflection of our quality investment teams. So let's turn to the next slide to look at early signs of improvement in our investment performance. If you look at slide 14, the market for much of 2017 and 2018 was one fueled by growth and momentum, which should not benefit active management. Our investment team stayed the course, reflecting our strong belief that discipline is critical to producing repeatable alpha through market cycles. As you look at recent investment results, while it's still early days, we're seeing significant performance improvement in a number of areas. So let me provide a couple of touch points. On the upper left hand portion of this slide, we show our total U.S. mutual fund assets. On a one year trailing basis, performance in the top half of peer groups improved from 11% to 42%, that's the end of November of last year to the middle of January of this year. We've also seen significant improvements in the performance of our largest mutual funds in the U.S. As important, we're seeing material improvement in the one year peer relative rankings for several strategies that have experienced the greatest flow challenge, as highlighted on the right hand portion of this slide. Specifically, diversified income moving from 88 percentile to 18 percentile on a one year basis; international growth moving from 66 percentile to 46 percentile; developing markets moving from 74 percentile to 46 percentile and UK income moving from 88 percentile to 37 percentile. Again, this improvement was achieved by investment teams staying true to their philosophy and approach. Now, while six weeks is not necessarily a trend that we recognize the short-term nature of that, we're encouraged by this early improvement in our performance, a continuation of which we believe would set us up for better flow experience in the coming months. Let me now turn on the next slide to the combination with OppenheimerFunds from an investment perspective. And on slide 15, upon closing the transaction, Invesco will be better situated than it's ever been to serve clients with a more complete comprehensive array of world class investment teams and capabilities that can produce strong relative performance over a market cycle. Specifically, we believe we'll be better positioned to provide the following benefits to clients post-closing. One, have a stronger deeper investment organization; two, have complimentary investment capabilities that will drive enhanced and more stable long-term investment results; and three, have greater sources of alpha to better align with client needs across the globe and in different channels. So now I wanted to cover these points in more detail given their importance. Touching on the first of these three points on slide 16. It's very clear that will be better off together that we would as a separate organization. Oppenheimer brings world class investment teams and high demand and high alpha potential asset categories like global equity, emerging markets and international equities. As can be seen from the right hand portion of this slide. The combination significantly enhances our scale within the U.S. mutual fund market, which will afford us greater platform access and relevance to clients. And we think this is critical in the retail channel as intermediaries are looking to partner with fewer firms. This increased size and scale will also provide greater access to capital markets, which we believe is important and obtaining greater access to deal flow, research and firm exposure. So if we can now turn to slide 17. As mentioned earlier, Oppenheimer brings very strong performance track records, which improves our combined position in the marketplace. Moreover history suggests our complimentary investment styles and capabilities will produce stronger and more stable investment performance on a combined basis. And the chart on this page supports that assertion. So I wanted just to give you a little bit of backdrop on it. If you look at rolling three year performance since 2010, the batting average for having 60% or more of our U.S. retail assets under management in the top half of the peer group would have been 66% of the time for Invesco standalone, 83% of the time for Oppenheimer standalone and 89% of the time for the combined firm. And this improved performance for the combined firm over the standalone firms would have shown similar results even if the threshold were made higher. So driving home this point, Oppenheimer's performance is often Z when Invesco's performance is A and vice versa. Indicated by the fact that the performance between the two firms has been inversely correlated for the vast majority of time since 2010. And what this means from our perspective is the transaction better positions us to promote products and solutions with stronger combined performance through the full investment cycle. So let me now turn to the final slide in my section on 18. And as we discussed, the expansion of our investment capabilities will provide us with an all-weather product suite to better meet the needs of our clients across the globe. And specifically, having a more diverse set of strategies will improve our ability to meet the unique and varied needs of clients on a product-by-product basis. And in addition to that having greater sources of uncorrelated alpha will enable us to better customize outcome oriented portfolios and deepen our partnership with clients. We think this represents a massive opportunity for us to increase our relevance to clients by leveraging this enhanced product suite with our leading solutions capabilities across our global distribution network within both retail and institutional channels. So with all this, we could not be more excited about the opportunities created, because of this combination and the positive impact it will have on our clients globally. So I'm now going to turn the call back over to Marty. Martin Flanagan : Thanks, Greg. So if you turn to page 20, I'll pick up there and just spend a minute talking about an update on Oppenheimer and to level set, let me put in a context of what I talked about earlier. We have been aggressively repositioning the business over the last number of years, where we think clients are going and where the industry is going. And we've done this by focusing on strengthening our leadership positions in core markets, while at the same time investing in areas where we see rapid growth and client need, ETFs, China, digital platforms, factors, et cetera. You all know that quite well. But let's put Oppenheimer in the context of that. And it's really the combination of Oppenheimer and the relationship with MassMutual that will accelerate this work. Clearly, we get an expanded leadership position in the U.S. wealth management channel with Oppenheimer, it is actually very important, it is the largest pool of assets in the world and most competitive and being relevant to those client matters enormously. It will strengthen our ability to execute in a number of these high growth areas that we've talked about in the past. And also and I think very importantly, in particular, in light of this market where we talked about it before you can actually see the unique opportunity for us to create greater operating leverage and scale throughout combining the two organizations. We're going to do this by using the framework that we used in the past, it served very, very well I'll get in the greater detail about in a minute, but it does the obvious, it's eliminating complexity, location optimization, focusing on rationalization platforms and the like. Yes you save money, but quite frankly we generate greater resources and build a better business and that's the point that I want to drive home as we talked about this. So let me give you an update on where we are during the quarter, an awful lot got done during the quarter and I want to thank everybody in both organizations it's been quite exciting and a lot of good things have been happening. So I do want to start by making a point that confirming the synergy target that we talked about initially $475 million we feel very confident about that and we also feel very confident that we're going to be a stronger business coming out of it. Greg's comments highlight some of that in particular, there is no question we'll be a stronger more talented organization post the close, which is what we have been focused on from day one. I also want to reiterate a key element of the value of the transaction is really the highly complementary initiative investment team, which Greg artfully described in a very clear way. The Oppenheimer investment teams are really excited to be the part of the combine firm. They do have a strong retention program in place, which is important now. But the reality is it's the culture in the combine firm and feeling impart of something important and special that matters and collectively I think we are making that happen as an organization. A very important milestone happened during the quarter and that was the OppenheimerFunds Board of Trustees approved the transaction. And this is foundational and a real catalyst for us to achieve the synergy targets that we've talked about initially. The mutual fund proxies have been filed with the SEC that will be in the market soon as you know that becomes another gating factor to close. And then finally, we are actively engaged with MassMutual future partnership opportunities. So again, very good progress during the quarter. Let's turn back to the financials. We wanted to come back and sort of recap the financials in light of that very, very difficult fourth quarter. I think what you'll see is they remained stunningly compelling still, so if you - EPS accretion remains very strong if you look on a pro forma basis, it'll add $0.10 in 2019 and that's assuming the close, so for Q3 and Q4 so half of the year. When you look at 2020, we expect the accretion to be $0.52 per share and if you look at assets under management at 12/31/2018, the IRR 16% it is down three percentage points from time of announcement, but again extremely strong returns in light of the market that we've just been through. And as a result of the combination and inclusive of the expected run rate synergies of $475 million if you looked at 2020 we'll add more than $800 million EBITDA we have an operating margin in excess of 40% and the combined annual EBITDA will be $2.5 billion. So again, in light of a very, very difficult fourth quarter the financial returns are very compelling to shareholders to say nothing of a firm just being dramatically stronger than prior to the transaction. So let's spend a little more time go in a greater detail on the synergies. And on page 23 we've laid out the various categories for the opportunities that are emerging. We have robust plans in place heading towards closing and through execution many of which are in execution, consolidating key platforms, addressing overlap in areas such as distribution, consolidating the product support functions and moving to common technology and infrastructure plan. So well underway right now and these are the areas where we see the emerging synergies coming from. Some of this will be done by day one and other activities will accelerate post close due to regulatory reasons not permitting us to get start ahead of time or frankly a very important part of mitigating our client experiences. All of these activities continue to drive further decisions helping us further refine our location strategy, reduce complexity in the organization, identifying a stronger talented group of people with the organization and the reduced cost and benefits for clients and shareholders ultimately. And I do want to reiterate, we're taking advantage of this very unique opportunity to materially strengthen the combined organization, while gaining operational scale. Those opportunities don't come along very often and this is one of them and our heads are down on it. We are using a framework and approach that has serviced very well in the past and I just want to make the point again I have a high degree of confidence our ability to get the synergy target and the fact that we will be a much stronger organization post close. So let me sort of recap before up we open up to questions. As you all know, prior to 2018, we had nine straight years of positive net inflows and as we've talked about last year that that was not the case with the negative market dynamics and the various styles of our approaches. We are disappointed to be in net outflows, but it comes with the territory. Greg made the point, we have a high degree of confidence in our investment teams and the performance and yes, we'll continue to strengthen those the market continues to evolve. That said, we've made great progress in continuing to invest and repositioning our firm ahead of where we think client demand is and where the opportunities are. And I want to reiterate the combination with Oppenheimer will accelerate these efforts, driving further growth in trading scale and client relevance for us as an organization. Post close, we'll have approximately $1.1 trillion in assets under management, putting Invesco in a very strong position to serve clients grow our business and provide compelling financial returns for our shareholders. So with that, I will stop and Loren, Greg and I are happy to answer any questions anybody may have. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Mr. Worthington, your line is open. Ken Worthington : Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. First on expenses, there is clearly seasonality in 4Q for your non-comp expenses, but maybe why weren't you better able to pivot given market conditions when the market started sort of weak earlier in the quarter? And then Loren, were there any pull forwards in expenses from 1Q 2019 or 2019 in general into 4Q, such as the prepaying of marketing or other expenses? And then, I guess maybe lastly, how much cost cutting from your efficiency program was realized in 4Q both actual and the run rate of savings as we go into 1Q? Loren Starr : So Ken, let's say in terms of expenses, a lot of the expenses related to marketing were planned probably well in advance of being in the fourth quarter. So these are product launches, these are events that have been sort of scheduled and committed to. So there isn't as much sort of near-term flexibility around marketing expense management as you might think. Obviously, as we got into the more challenging parts of Q4, what we could pull back we did, but it was really not enough time to really move the dial on the market expense. But I would say that generally there's about $10 million of what I would call sort of unusually high run rate levels of marketing expense that should be taken into consideration. In terms of any pull forward, no, there was nothing pulled forward from Q1 into Q4. Again, I think the Q4 numbers as I've mentioned were punctuated by some higher expenses, particularly around G&A as well, which was about $6 million of probably one-time cost that should be considered in terms of what a true run rate would look like for us. In terms of the cost cutting, we feel like we're absolutely on track in terms of the optimization. And so in terms of achieving the total goal of run rate expense savings, I think we are at that level, maybe a little bit still going to happen in Q1. Ken Worthington : Okay, thank you. And just on the balance sheet post Oppenheimer, it seems like some of the feedback that you're getting suggests that investors characterize the preferred as dead and thus see Invesco as a highly levered asset manager. With this in mind, are your thoughts - what are your thoughts about the priorities for cash post Oppenheimer? And does deleveraging take priority over buybacks once the $1.2 billion commitment is complete? Loren Starr : Great question. So I do believe we're sensitive to the leverage clearly, but we do feel that the $1.2 billion is something that we need to do as part of this transaction, as part of I think the economics. And clearly we may delay some of it a little bit further into 2020 as opposed to accelerating more in the upfront part of it, but we are still intending to complete the $1.2 billion within the two year timeframe that we originally discussed. We are going to be - clearly looking at the leverage ratio, I don't want to say we're blind to it. Markets will have some impact, it's still I don't want to say it's sort of immutable true that we're going to deliver $1.2 billion. If markets really took another downturn, we might think about it again. But right now where we are, we feel very comfortable completing the $1.2 billion per schedule. Ken Worthington : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Worthington for your question. Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Sir, your line is open. Craig Siegenthaler : Good morning, Marty. Loren. I just wanted to come back to slide 16, can you provide us an update on the potential to merge the Invesco and OppenheimerFunds that are in the same categories? And I know you didn't include this in the $475 million of expense redundancies, which is mostly focused on back office. But there is a lot of product overlap between the two businesses. So just wanted an update here. Martin Flanagan : Yes. So that is one of areas that we will not turn our attention to until after close for various regulatory reasons. There's probably going to be less overlap than you imagine in that. But I will say there is opportunity, I'm sure there's opportunity for rationalization. And again, after close, we will come back to you and give you some insights. And again, I wouldn't look at it as just unique to the Oppenheimer transaction. Again, it's a normal practice that we just look at our product shelf and make those decisions. So, I wish I could give you a more clear update, but we're just not in a position where we can do that. Craig Siegenthaler : And then my follow up is on the ETF business. You build a large ETF business both organically and through M&A. But the business really didn't participate in the migration to ETFs last year or in the fourth quarter. And I know some of that was the bank loan ETF, but can you give us your view on sort of what happened in 2018 in terms of share loss? And also, how you're positioned for growth in the future? Martin Flanagan : Yes, look we think this has been a very important undertaking for us. And I think if you just look at where we started and where we are, we think we're very well placed. We do make some important points of - if you look at where the dollars were moving us last year where our lineup was. And as what we said, on the back of Guggenheim we had a lot to build from utilizing the self-indexing unit and some of the things like bullet shares. The final launches where we think we will be done will be by the end of Q1 of this year. And we feel that we'll be in a very good position to continue to grow. And again I think you're right. So, [indiscernible] other bank loans in life, those are - that's part of what comes with that market. Craig Siegenthaler : Thank you, Marty. Operator : Thank you for your question Mr. Siegenthaler. Our next question is from Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is open. Michael Carrier : Thanks, guys. Loren, maybe first one for you. Just given your commentary around expenses and more environmental separating it from say the Oppenheimer like synergies throughout the year. Just wanted to get maybe a little bit more granularity on how you're thinking about maybe Invesco like the core expense base going forward relative to say like the fourth quarter run rate? Loren Starr : Yes, absolutely, Mike. So, I think, I was giving you some points around sort of run rate versus one-time. So let's say there's in my mind, sort of roughly $16 million of expense in Q4 that, I'd say were elevated and more onetime in nature related to specific events that won't recur on a regular basis. So if you were to take that out of the Q4 numbers, I would say our go forward into Q1 will be certainly down, flat to down to that number. So we feel very confident that that number into Q1 is going to be at a lower level run rate wise versus where we are in Q4 ex-those one-time things. Michael Carrier : Okay, thanks. And maybe one\u2026 Loren Starr : Wait, Michael, I think, Marty just want to add\u2026 Martin Flanagan : Yes, I understand, and again, we're being very responsible going through Q1. But I do want to - the organization is going full forced to get this combination done. And I think turning your attention to that is really what matters. There are very, very few opportunities where you can literally create a stronger organization and take out 15% of the operating costs around the world. One in fact this is largely is coming from the U.S. And if you put that side by side, very, very few organizations able to pivot like this in an environment. So again, it's really the capabilities that attracted us Oppenheimer. But when you look at the scale benefits they are material and real. And I think as we said Q4 really sort of highlight that for everybody is beyond the conversation it's actual fact. Michael Carrier : Okay, that's helpful. And then, Marty, just on the organic growth or the flow outlook. So clearly fourth quarter was tough for everyone. I think in the third quarter you guys had some elevated outflows. Just want to kind of get your maybe perspective on what were some of the more unusual things or things that were more surprising versus when you're looking at 2019 with markets stabilizing you guys pointed to some of the investment performance rebound. Where you're seeing some of the sales traction where you're maybe most hopeful that redemptions could slow to start to turn the trajectory around. Martin Flanagan : Yes. So let me put in context, and again, we feel that we've built a very diversified business by asset class and by geography. But if you look at last year and if you line up the organization you almost couldn't make it up thing didn't serve us well because of the value capabilities we had. You saw that quite clearly what happened that largely impacted the U.S. mutual fund business. Brexit is a real topic for us and you just saw sterling dropped from I think a peak a 1.44 to 1.24. But if you literally look at EMEA and use mutual funds flows as a proxy in the year they dropped by 87% there. So, I mean - and then you look at the trade wars and people will point so well there's nothing really happened in there. I can tell you our clients went risk off. We had some very good capabilities Asian equity capabilities that got terminated during that. So the notion that you could have trade for as Brexit. And saying disproportionately impacting an organization like Invesco. I would not have thought that's possible. It's not an excuse, it's just a reality. And again, I think, importantly, Greg, was talking about the depth and breadth of the investment capabilities, the performances these markets are actually good for active management and we're seeing that. I don't know if Greg, if you'd add to that. Greg McGreevey : The only thing I'd add to, when you kind of look at our pipeline overall I think there's maybe a couple of areas where that pipeline is starting to see a pretty significant increase in fixed income as kind of one factor we kind of talked about that before is too. And then pockets of the alternative business overall where clients out there need income when they need returns. So specifically within real estate and we're starting to see after a very troubled kind of fourth quarter within bank loans overall we're starting to see an increase in the interest within kind of bank loans. So in our solutions businesses really being ramped up given the investment that we've made there. And so we're starting to see a number of things come out of that engagement that we're having with clients. So those would be I think if you just look at our pipeline the kind of areas we've seen an increase. Michael Carrier : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you for your question Mr. Carrier. Our next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open, sir. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. I guess, Marty, just kind of building upon your comments about the last quarter and kind of the integration of - and how excited you are about the deal. Can you talk about I guess what you're hearing from intermediaries, consultants, your clients about the transaction? And I know you guys have an outflow assumption based on what you gave us last quarter based on the transaction, maybe update us on if there's any changes to that or how you think that may or may not be conservative? Martin Flanagan : Yes, look I can speak to my very specific conversation if not every single one of them was incredibly positive. So if you just start with the fundamental strength of where Oppenheimer is in the U.S. wealth management platform the notion of those two firms together that we've had nothing, but very, very strong positive feedback for all the reasons that Greg talked about, right. It's depth of capability, type of capabilities it's beyond investment capabilities what can you serve the clients beyond the investment capabilities. So very, very positive. There is also institutional clients in different parts of the world that are actually very attracted already to a number of the Oppenheimer capabilities emerging markets, global equities to name two of them. So again, we're just getting very good client feedback of Oppenheimer joining us, but also what we can do together. So again from our perspective the next few months can go fast if we want to get those closed. Dan Fannon : The redemption assumption on the - because of the deal. Loren Starr : So I think nothing changed in terms of those assumptions, we're still looking at sort of a $10 billion assumption outflow in 2019 after the deal is completed again that's a degree of conservatism. I think in some ways I mean you're seeing a little bit of the overhang on Oppenheimer flows right now as people are waiting for the deal to close. And so - but again the good news is it seems to be manageable number, it's nothing that is sort of excessive. We are feeling very confident that once we bring the firms together that we're going to be able to improve the redemption experience for both firms quite honesty. Dan Fannon : Okay. So just to clarify a couple of things on your change in accretion, can you just give us the specific factor of the change, I think the timing closed and I think obviously markets. But also, could you just update us since the announcement what Oppenheimer's outflows have been? Loren Starr : So again, I think in terms of the biggest change will be the timing so we only have two quarters of accretion versus sort of roughly the three quarters that we had in the prior assumption. Obviously, we're starting at a lower AUM base for the business, which also has impact on both the first year and the second year accretion numbers. Beyond that all the other assumptions are essentially the same in terms of market and so forth. The outflow for Oppenheimer, I think is roughly a 4% decay annualized. So again, it picked up a little bit as we've entered the fourth quarter and not to be surprised about that one just generally because of the market environment. So we continue to watch it, but as I said there's nothing extreme or alarming at all in terms of the flow pattern that we're seeing so far. Dan Fannon : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question Mr. Fannon. Our next question comes from Bill Katz with Citigroup. Your line is open sir. William Katz : Okay, thank you very much. I think in your press release you had mentioned and a little bit in your prepared remarks that you're still pursuing some cost containment work as well. I was wondering, if you could maybe potentially quantify that? And then, how sticky is that, in other words if the revenue backdrop were to improve would you relax some of that with maybe some delayed spending on the other side of that? Loren Starr : So, I mean, in terms of stopping hiring and freezing it that makes a lot of sense for us in the context of a large transaction that is going occur in the second quarter. We are obviously bringing on a fair number of folks to the combined company. But I would say that, we are really asking people between now and the time of the close to curtail any hires that they otherwise might want to bring in if they are able to without affecting clients or investment performance really the discretionary elements of what we do. And then, sort of services around training, development, really sort of internal thing that can be delayed. So some of it is just the time based, can we sort of reduce our spend until we get to the point where the biggest event will be sort of reducing 15% of the combined cost of the firms coming together that is by far in a way the bigger impact. We are looking at - I mean, with that said are there sort of longer term opportunities to reduce cost on a permanent basis as opposed to some of the things that we just talked about. So that is still happening, but those things take longer and again it is going to be impacted by bringing the two firms together, we see a lot of opportunity to do that. William Katz : Okay. Just as a follow up two part question, so thanks for taking both of them. In your guidance you also mentioned the pro forma EBITDA being $2.5 billion versus previously $3 billion. So I was wondering, if you could unpack that and I guess you gave some of that around the Oppenheimer assumptions. But how much of that comes from sort of the legacy footprint if you will? And then, as we look into the new part of the year any qualitative or quantitative update on how the flows are both at Invesco standalone as well as Oppenheimer? Loren Starr : So the reduction in EBITDA is really a function of lower AUM for both firms that is just quantitatively what is driving our EBITDA numbers down. Nothing more in terms of sort of unpacking, it's really just lower earnings. I think in terms of sort of the preview into the quarter I think we feel that there's a lot of variability right now. And so, we're sort of hesitant to sort of provide glimpses into the quarter. We think it will be a better result if we can sort of talk about that when we see all three months' completed as we - and you will see the monthly releases as they come through. William Katz : Okay, thank you very much. Martin Flanagan : Yes, thanks, Will. Operator : Thank you for your question, Mr. Katz. Your next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Alex Blostein : Hey, good morning, guys. So maybe just a couple of specific questions, I know we're kind of go through some of these numbers already. But could you guys give us just the Oppenheimer ending AUM revenue run rate and expense run rate where things done today? Loren Starr : I don't have that detail for you, Alex. Obviously, we have the AUM of 213 to 214, I think is the number that we provided. So, again, I think it will scale down, revenue will scale down, you should expect kind of literally with the AUM. Alex Blostein : Got you. And in terms of the purchase price. So, understand, obviously, the market conditions got a lot worse. But, the $0.52 accretion in 2020 or 30% below the $0.80 that you provided in the last call. Can you talk a little bit about it, there's any room to negotiate the purchase price I think there was something there as it relates to flows, but was wondered if you could flash that out a little bit. Loren Starr : Yes, I mean in terms of the flow, there are some contractual sort of adjustments related to outflows between now the close - or the type of close if we aren't successful bringing over client assets as well there's an adjustment there. So it's a pretty significant hurdle for that to kick in. I think it has to be at least 7.5 percentage points and it's done on a revenue run rate. So - and at that point and below is when the adjustment happens. So anything between 0 to 7.5 there would be no adjustment made on the purchase price. And Marty, I don't know if you want to talk about sort of concept of renegotiating that's not even a thought. I think we're contractually bound and happy to continue. Martin Flanagan : Look, I turn your attention to the financial returns that you just put in front of you after a very, very difficult market are quite compelling. And again, we're going to be dramatically stronger firm coming out of it. So\u2026 Loren Starr : I would say, I mean, obviously markets have improved off that point. I think, sort of 3.5 and above percentage points rose where we are. So all those numbers are going to look better in light of just a few weeks of January coming through. Alex Blostein : Okay, fair enough. Thanks. Operator : Thank you for your question, Mr. Blostein. Our next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open, sir. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So just to clarify on the triggers that Alex just asked about. I think you said 7.5% decay rate, is that annualized in the period from announcement to close? And while I appreciate that is at a 4% decay rate, a lot of that seem to come in the fourth quarter post the announcement. It's hard to unpack exactly how - what attributed to that decline, the announcement of the deal versus a very difficult market period. But when you update us on the $10 billion number or did not update the $10 billion number, that's post to close. So it would anticipate potentially some of those outflows happening ahead of close. Can you just sort of flush that out a little bit for us, please? Thanks. Loren Starr : So, I mean, what we're doing this is taking the 214 assuming flat markets through the close and then $10 billion out, right. So it's not a not a refined sort of when it happens. But if it happens before 214 sort of becomes 200 before the close, it's essentially getting the same place, right. So it's not a - that we assumed that outflow was almost immediate when it kind of happened - when the deal happen. So I don't think it would affect the deal economics in terms of when the flow happens it's really just the fact that is $10 billion less off of the 214 numbers, right? So that's the assumption that you should be looking at for those deal economics that still work. Brennan Hawken : Okay. And then the 7.5% decay that you required is that annualized? Loren Starr : So there is two things, so one there's so that you can look at the filed documents in terms of the contract just all the details there and it's probably a little more complicated I'm making. But that's our run rate, that's a 7.5% revenue run rate decline off of what was originally put in place due - purely due to clients not coming over through the deal. So, I think it's just important to note that, again, there's details around that, I don't know if it makes\u2026 Martin Flanagan : It's a common practice, we have these transactions. Brennan Hawken : Okay. And then, when you guys had announced it initially, you had indicated that you had a repurchase that you're going to be executing in between announcement and close. Can you give us an update on your expectations for those repurchases and the timing, et cetera around those? Loren Starr : So I think we had said originally $400 million to $600 million prior to the close, obviously we've done $300 million of that already and then the rest being done after that. We're still looking at the market; we're looking at what happens to stock price. So, I mean there's all sorts of elements are coming to our repurchase decisions. We're sort of exiting the blackout period, so we're going to be able to begin to transact again in our stock. And again, also just mindful of the leverage ratios and so forth. So we're going to be sort of reasonably conservative around the pace of buyback prior to the close as you would expect. Brennan Hawken : Thanks for taking my questions. Martin Flanagan : Yes, thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question, Mr. Hawken. Our next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, sir. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks very much. Maybe just coming back to the one more in the cost saves of the $475 million. Just to get it clarified, I think I may have missed this, I think you think the deal is now closing closer to the later part of the second quarter. And then, on the expense synergy on that timing through 2020, can you just give us - just reaffirm sort of that trajectory? And then whether you can - whether you think you can actually accelerate those back office saves given the environment? And then, the walk down of the margin from over 45% to 40% post synergy is that all due to the lower AUM and market conditions? Loren Starr : Yes. So, Marty you can jump in if you want. Martin Flanagan : Why don't you start, I'll hop on. Loren Starr : Okay. So, I mean on - so in terms of the $475 million, you should expect that because the close has been delayed effectively a quarter that our timing around capturing synergies is going to be more pushed into the first quarter of 2020, getting that sort of numbers that we were talking about, 75%, 80% of synergies just because of share timing. So that's kind of one point. I think in terms of the margin, being 40 - around 40, greater than 40, that's all just due to AUM levels. And so the associated impact. Again, that would be better today just because of the lift that we've seen in the markets with respect to both firms. So again, we'll obviously continue to look at those deal economics very sensitive to where markets are, but again hopefully we've sort of hit a bottom and we'll see more upside in these deal economic numbers. Martin Flanagan : Yes. And I would just add, the platforms and the like. Look, these are big undertakings. Now we do know how to do it, we have a history of doing them well, we'll do them as quickly as possible. But also very importantly, we got to meet - you got to serve your clients, you need to do a good job. So again, I would come back to the big picture. We will hit $475 million, we will hit the margin target as we talked about markets and it's a very unique opportunity for us to frankly build some very important scale into the organization, which we will do. Brian Bedell : Great. Okay. And then, as you think about the growth - the revenue synergy and growth opportunity, this is going back to your comments about being able to launch new product structures using Oppenheimer investment management talent on those products and also expanding them geographically into Europe where they don't have a big presence. Is - I guess the spending around those growth initiatives - how do you think about that like the timing of that? Is that something that you would prefer to get a handle first on whether you're going to combine any investment teams and then go about that process or would you rather try to get that product into these new structures and geographies sooner rather than later and maybe sacrifice some of - have some additional expense against that? Martin Flanagan : Yes, I think the beauty of the combination is the incremental spend is not very much. The quality of the investment teams are there. We have an institutional distributional capability. There is demand for it. So pace will be determined by the clients and their appetite. And as you know institutionally it takes time to go through those processes. Oppenheimer already has a non-U.S. range, a SECOP [ph] range that frankly it's getting it into our distribution capability. So again, those are things that will come pretty rapidly. I do want to come back to there is no revenue synergies in these numbers from going to the institutional business or the non-U.S. business or anything between MassMutual and ourselves. And that's just fine, but there's none of that in that as we move forward. Brian Bedell : And just the timing on that, on the expectation of doing those. Is it synergizing that Oppenheimer product? Would you wait for product teams to be combined first or would you kind of just go right out those synergies? Martin Flanagan : Look, there are already conversations with what the teams and what the opportunities are. And also we're in deep conversation with MassMutual about what we can do. But again, I don't want to set an expectation other than we will execute and what's in front of us. But the combined firm together and a relationship with MassMutual is going to be an important one. Brian Bedell : Okay, great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you for your question Mr. Bedell. Our next question is from Kenneth Lee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open, sir. Kenneth Lee : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. In terms of the - just a question on the OppenheimerFunds. I think on the last call you mentioned that fee rates have been trending upwards over the last few years. Just wondering what's the expectation over the near-term? What factors or mix shift could push that fee rate either up or down? Wonder if you could just give us a little bit more color there. Thanks. Martin Flanagan : Yes. I'll maybe start and Loren can add. Look it's no different than us. Our effective fee rate what you see trending down it's really - it is a mix shift topic for us. And you would imagine in risk off environments, people putting money and money funds, et cetera that you see that happen. Oppenheimer during the period had the exact opposite. There was an aggressive or I shouldn't say aggressive quite successful in emerging markets and international equities and those are higher fee capabilities. And again that is sort of the natural flow of things within an organization. So client demand will drive those mix shifts. There's very little we can do about it. Loren Starr : Yes, and I'd say, I mean from what we can see, their fee rate is very stable. So nothing is really - even though the market has been sort of negative, I think they've continued to offset that through growth in the alternative platform. And so, overall I'd say it's pretty stable. Kenneth Lee : Got you. And just one a bit of a housekeeping. Some details behind that $5.5 billion LOP mandate redemption you mentioned, which asset categories were those located? Thanks. Loren Starr : So that was mostly fixed income. There was a little bit of equity component all single-digit basis points. Kenneth Lee : Got you. Very helpful, thanks. Operator : Thank you for your question. Mr. Lee. Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Your line is open, sir. Patrick Davitt : Good morning, guys. Thank you. Earlier last year before you announce the Oppenheimer deal, there was a lot of focus and chatter from you guys around 2019 optimism on flows from newer initiatives, in particular, Gem Step [ph] getting ramped up with some new distribution pipes. Could you walk through your expectations on that now? Has the ability for that to generate a little bit more incremental flow changed, or has been pushed out or pulled forward? Now you're really focused on Oppenheimer, but it'd be helpful to get an update on some of that stuff as well. Loren Starr : Yes. So we're still on track second quarter of 2019 is when are the largest client that we've sort of one business from is going to start using and putting into production the Gem Step capability along with our models. So we will begin to see flows in revenues coming from that immediately into the second quarter. Again, I think it is one of these things that we said is going to build, it's not going to be sort of a flood of revenues and AUM immediately. But given the size of this client and the breadth and scope of the advisors they're using and how the model they are going to play out, I think it will built into a material number as we get into end of 2019 and into 2020. The pipeline for Gem Step is still very strong, continues to win business. And so that is, again progressing, but it is as we said slower than anybody would have possibly had originally imagined in terms of the actual going from the design, to production, to execution just takes time. I'd say the other thing just in terms of the thing that we are excited about around ETFs and institutional business, China factor-based investing, I mean all of these capabilities is growth engines that we so called characterized have just been growing as a percentage of our overall sales every quarter. So we do see that as being an increasingly important factor in terms of our success. And so the investments that we've made, which we've talked about I believe are paying off for us and will even more so into 2019. Patrick Davitt : I've got a quick follow up. You mentioned Brexit earlier and I think everybody has kind of decided to trying to handicap what happens there, will be vital at this point. But as that plays out through March and April, have you done any work to kind of gauge how much worse the outflows in the UK business could be if it goes bad? And conversely how much better they could be if it goes good? Martin Flanagan : Yes. So it's a good question. Everybody is doing those types of calculations, but what I would say and I mentioned this earlier, Brexit for our business really didn't become real until this past year in the second half of the year. And as I've - it's just not the UK it's on the continent too. And I mentioned if you look at flows across, it's literally down 87% year-over-year that - it has been risk off environment like you really can't imagine. So I don't know what's going to happen with Brexit, there are a lot smarter people than me on it. We spend a lot of time on it, it's important to us. But Loren was talking about this quarter if my perspective and the organization's perspective, if you take a no deal Brexit off the table and it looks like there will be some different outcome, I think that would be very positive for investor sentiment, client sentiment and I would imagine we would be in a better position when you look at clients getting back to making investment decisions. That's how we're looking at it. The other one that is a headwind that we'll see what happens is the trade negotiations between U.S. and China that is a headwind for us. So anything that moves into positive manner is again I think about positive development for us. Loren Starr : Yes. And maybe just a bit of information. So one, in the quarter, Q4, the UK equity outflow was under $1 billion. Still a big number, but again in terms of overall size of AUM, it's sort of manageable number. And the other point is, we did just because of the uncertainty around the Brexit outcome, we did hedge through the full 2019 using similar strategy that we've used in the past around hedging the operating income for struck at 1.25 as sort of insurance policy. So if the pound were to drop below 1.25, I would say this insurance policy would protect us on the down side at worst case scenario. So anyway just so people know, we have it through 2019. Operator : Thank you for your question Mr. Davitt. Our question comes from Robert Lee with KBW. Sir, your line is open. Robert Lee : Great, thank you. And guys thanks for your patience in taking all the questions this morning. Martin Flanagan : Yes. Robert Lee : And again sorry to maybe go back to the expense saves, but I just want to make sure I understand everything correctly. So, I guess, what I'm trying to square is - I mean still the expectation of ultimately an 800-ish EBITDA contribution if I have that number correctly with the lower kind of accretion. So should I was simply be thinking that how you're going to still targeting that, but really maybe some of that benefit because of the later close and timing kind of leads it into 2021, so that's why 2020 is kind of coming down. Am I thinking of that correctly? Martin Flanagan : No. So I just want to be really clear on this. So the accretion numbers that - for 2019 and 2020 that we laid out, it is based on I mean our expectation of getting to close having the two quarters this year full next year. Then the run rate impact of a $475 million through the programs that we outlined that are in place right now. We know how to do this, we've done it in the past. And the only change that drove the EBITDA from $3 billion to $2.5 billion was the market. And so, there is - we don't expect or believe the reason why the quarter went back was you really have to get - getting through mutual fund approval is just critical. And that happened at the end of the year into January and other than that we're on track. So again, we have a high degree of confidence that we'll get this done. Robert Lee : Great. And maybe just to confirm the guidance from a share count perspective, basically where you finished post the share repurchase you've done already plus what you're going to issue and that fit kind of no incremental that filling in the rest of the $900 million every purchase between now through call 2020? Loren Starr : Yes, so I mean again I think let me just specifically your question is, timing of the 1.2 or\u2026 Robert Lee : Well, no more like if I think of 50-ish cents accretion in 2020 you're not - is there additional share repurchase kind of baked into that from this point forward or you just kind of pro forma we are today plus what you're going to issue? Loren Starr : Yes it's - I mean it's the exact same pro forma where we are today, what we're going to issue and then buyback as just previously described. The 400 to 600 prior to the close and the rest on was in the year after the close. Robert Lee : Okay, great. That was it, guys. Thank you. Martin Flanagan : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you for your question Mr. Lee. Our next question is from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Chris Harris : Thank you. Hey, guys. So on the improved investment performance you're highlighting here, I wonder if you can talk about that a little bit more. Is that mainly attributable to the value style investing coming back or is there something else going on? And if it is kind of an improvement in value should we be assuming that potentially about saying then for the Oppenheimer business? Martin Flanagan : Yes, so Chris thanks a lot for the question. I think there's a couple of things that are going on I think one of which I mentioned in my comments when we're kind of going through the prepared remarks, a lot of it is just the change in momentum driven stocks that were really a big driver of the market. That really changed or started to change when we moved into December and kind of into January. And so it's become over that time period and hopefully that will continue much more conducive environment for active management. So it's just the stock selection was really the big driver there. And specifically momentum it was driving a lot of stock performance kind of changed if you will there was a component of that that could be a little bit of kind of value in growth, but that really wasn't the biggest component if you will that would contribute to that performance if you will. In terms of the second part of your question I mean, I think as we kind of highlighted that we're going to zig and they're going to zag, which we think is a really good thing when you look at stock selection and uncorrelated sources about if you will. So some of their strategies in the very short run they have fallen off a little bit not necessarily specifically related to the fact that value has come more back into it, I think the headline for what we're really trying to point out is when you look historically at our performance and their performance it's very uncorrelated sources of alpha we think that's very important for our clients kind of over the long on. Chris Harris : Got it, thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question Mr. Harris. Our next question is from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is open. Michael Cyprys : Hey, good morning. Thanks for your patience and taking the question. I just wanted to circle back to the strategic partnership that you have with MassMutual. Can you just talk about what that will entail, how formalized it is and how does Invesco - how do you ensure you get what you need from it in say three or five years' time? Just in terms of the level of commitment and alignment. Thank you. Martin Flanagan : Yes, Michael, this is Marty. So look, we've a very good relationship with them. They have a material interest Invesco and the alignment of interest starts right there and that's not going to move. Roger is very clear about the long-term nature of wanting to be in the asset management business and that's how they view this transaction it was just broadening their exposure to the sector. And what we are right now assuming a big broad range of conversations of what are the things that we could do together that it could make a difference in the marketplace. And again, I'd rather come back with facts then to get ahead of it and right now we are assuming zero revenue synergies from anything other than the core Oppenheimer business. Michael Cyprys : Got it. Okay. And then, just if I could ask a follow up just quickly here, on liquidity in the market and the credit cycle just be curious to hear your perspectives on any sort of implication of a turn in the credit cycle just given the buildup in leverage by corporate to cycle with a larger portion going into daily liquidity funds such as high yield bond funds and loan funds many of which you guys manage? So I guess what sort of risk does that present to the industry? And what's being done to mitigate such risk and how do you see this playing out? Martin Flanagan : So we're looking pretty closely and I think it's probably a very long winded answer to probably address the heart of your question. So we are - we certainly are seeing those things that you kind of referenced play out if you will. I think the main part that we're dealing with is really looking at from a client fiduciary standpoint, the liquidity within our funds, the ability to be able to respond to that liquidity if you will. I think the size and scale and a comment that I kind of referenced from a capital markets perspective I think is kind of helpful in our ability to get access to the capital markets and be able to hopefully get improved liquidity in areas like that. So, the implications I think are multifaceted, when you kind of talk about the industry. So maybe in the second time I'll kind of - just kind of stop there in raising your question. Loren Starr : I would say though in terms of like our bank loan product we saw absolutely no issues in terms of managing through volatile markets and sort of addressing the redemptions. So it was all done really with no issues. Given the way that we manage that product. So again one data point, but probably one that's relevant certainly for Invesco. Michael Cyprys : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question, Mr. Cyprys. Our last question is a follow up from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, sir. Ryan Bailey : Good morning. This is actually Ryan Bailey on behalf of Alex. I guess a question for Loren on the standalone Invesco expense base for 2019. So if we look at expenses for 2018 ex distribution looks like it's about $2.4 billion. Can you help us think about where we should be resetting for standalone Invesco given current AUM levels? And then some of the cost initiatives that you outlined excluding what was happening with the deal synergies. Loren Starr : Yes. So I think I touched on it a little bit when we're sort of looking into the first quarter versus where we are fourth quarter we are - if you look at the $619 million, which was quarterly expenses in Q4 you subtract out the $9 million kind of one-time expenses that I was talking about I mean you're sort of in a $603 million kind of run rate. And we said we're going to be down from that number. So again - and that first quarter also includes payroll taxes and so forth, which tend to go away. So again it is a little hard to sort of talk about the full year because we're obviously doing this large transaction and that's the plan. And so, we're planning on taking out 15% of the combined business and post close there is no standalone Invesco anymore. So it's really the combined company. But I would say in terms of thinking about us the run rate guidance that I just provided should give you the right standalone view if you want to just extrapolate that assuming flat markets across the year. Ryan Bailey : Got it. And maybe just if I can sneak one more in. What's the minimum amount of cash we should be thinking about that you'd need on the balance sheet just given the seasonal expenses you just mentioned for kind of the first half and then any integration costs? Loren Starr : So again we - again our capital policy has not changed. We are targeting and continue to target $1 billion of cash in excess of what is required from a regulatory capital perspective largely driven by the rules in Europe that requirement in Europe is somewhere between $600 million and $700 million of capital that needs to sort of stay on the balance sheet. And so we'd have roughly $1.7 billion would be kind of the target on a go forward basis. Ryan Bailey : Got it, thank you very much. Loren Starr : No problem. Operator : That does conclude our Q&A session of today's call, I'll not turn our conference back over to Martin Flanagan. Martin Flanagan : Again I just want to thank everybody for participation in the questions and look forward to speak with everybody soon. Have a good rest of the day. Operator : That does conclude today's conference call. We thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. And have a great rest of your day.",

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded, if you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. Now, I would like to turn the call over to your speakers for today, Marty Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer; and Greg McGreevey, Senior Managing Director of Investments. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin. Martin Flanagan : Thank you very much and thank you everybody for joining us. And today we will cover the first quarter results as we typically do. We will spend some time on investment results during the quarter, and an update on OppenheimerFunds combination, and then we will open up to questions. The presentation is available on the website, if you're so inclined to follow and I'm going to start Page 5 and just make a couple of comments before turn it over to Loren. So assets under management rose more than $66 billion from the fourth quarter, ending the quarter at $955 billion. We saw net flows increased nearly $22 billion from the fourth quarter resulting in long-term total net inflows of $3.5 billion. And we saw investment performance rebounded very strongly from the fourth quarter, and this is something we would expect in the type of market we've seen post 2018. There is really a combination of these factors resulted in adjusted earnings per share increasing 27%. So in summary, the quarter is a marked improvement as compared to the fourth quarter of last year quarter. Also during the quarter, we made significant progress on the integration at the OppenheimerFunds. We anticipate closing now at May 24th. And we expect to recognize 85% of the $475 million synergy target by 1,231 of this year, resulting in $0.24 of accretion in 2019. But most importantly, this combination will be extremely beneficial for our clients and our shareholders. So with that is highlight, I am going to turn over to Loren to go in the financials. Loren Starr : Thanks very much Marty. So on Slide 6, you'll see a summary of the results for the first quarter, 51% and 57% of actively managed assets. We're in the top half of peers over the three and five years, and one year numbers improved by nine percentage points versus the prior quarter to 50%. Greg is going to go into greater detail on the performance later in the presentation. Out total long-term net outflows were $5.4 billion in Q1. That's an improvement of nearly $15 million when compared to the prior quarter. This improvement was largely driven by stronger ETF flows globally, and a significantly improved redemption picture across both the retail and institutional channels. Our adjusted net operating income was $284 million for the quarter, down from $300 million in the prior quarter. This decline in turn drove our adjusted operating margin down 0.6 points to 0.32% in Q1. We've returned $170 million capital to shareholders during the quarter through $120 million of dividends and $50 million of share buybacks. And additionally, we announced a 3.3% increase in our dividend this quarter to $0.31 per share. An overview of our long-term flows can be found on Slide 7 with additional detail on the flow highlights from the quarter on Slide 8. The net flow picture improved in the first quarter across both active and passive capabilities and across all channels. The redemption rates normalized while sales levels remained generally strong for the firm as a whole. Our institutional pipeline grew about 6% quarter-over-quarter with new one, but not funded claim mandates and real estate, stable values, fixed income and quantitative equity products. In the Americas, we saw institutional net flows improvement as we gathered more than $2 billion in Direct Real Estate. While outflows continued in our U.S. retail equity products, we did see marked improvement in redemption rates resulting from stronger investment performance as well as more stable markets. Global ETFs displayed renewed business momentum in the quarter with more than $4.2 billion in net flows and market share gains in multiple regions. In the U.S., we saw more than $2 billion in ETF flows for the quarter followed by the S&P low volatility suites and the bullish share ETFs. In Europe, our ETFs also experienced improved net flows across both equity and fixed income products, resulting in net inflows of more than $2 billion. In Asia Pacific, we saw strength in sales across several fixed income capabilities, however, the net flow results in the quarter was impacted by single client redemption of the bank loan mandate. I\u2019d also note that we benefited from continued flows into our Great Wall JV money market products with more than $3 billion in inflows for the quarter. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 9 next, and you\u2019ll see our assets under management, which increased by $6.6 billion or 7.5%. And that primarily reflects the impact of positive market returns offset by long term outflows. Our net revenue yield, excluding performance fees, dropped 1.5 basis points to 37.1 basis points. The dip in the fee rate was primarily due to two fewer days in the quarter with remainder of the decline driven by a change in AUM mix. Slide 10 provides the U.S. GAAP operating results for the quarter. My comments today, as historically we\u2019ve done, will focus on the variances related to non-GAAP adjusted measures, which we found on Slide 11. For the non-GAAP results, you'll see that net revenues decreased by $32.1 million or 3.5% quarter-over-quarter to $887.1 million. This decrease primarily reflects the reduced day count and the lower average long term AUM for the quarter. Our adjusted operating expenses were $602.8 million, decreased by $16.4 million or 2.6% relative to the fourth quarter, and we're largely in line with the guidance that I provided last quarter. Despite the positive snap back in the market in Q1, we maintained the expense discipline outline last quarter and we will continue to focus on expense management in the occurring operating environment. The expense decrease quarter-over-quarter was driven by lower marketing and G&A expenses both of which were particularly at high levels in the fourth quarter. That was offset by the seasonality of taxes and benefits that increased compensation expense in Q1. Our adjusted non-operating income increased by $73 million versus Q4, largely reflecting the positive mark-to-market on our seed investments during the quarter compared to negative market movements in the fourth quarter. Firm's effective tax rate at 23.8% was elevated by approximately 3.5 percentage points refract the impact to the annual share awards vesting in the first quarter. We\u2019d expect our tax rate to decline to between 22% to 23% after the Oppenheimer close. This brings us for adjusted EPS of $0.56 and our adjusted net operating margin of 32% for the quarter. And with that, I'm going to turn it now over to Greg, who will talk about investment performance. Greg McGreevey : Loren, thanks very much. There were three things I wanted to cover on my top level review of investment performance in the next four slides. So first I\u2019ll provide an update regarding Invesco\u2019s performance improvement that builds on our expression from last quarter\u2019s earnings call. Second, I wanted to highlight performance improvement at OppenheimerFunds. And third, I\u2019ll review performance on several key investment strategies for both Invesco and Oppenheimer. If you turn to Slide 13, you\u2019ll see both Invesco and OppenheimerFunds, one, three and five year performance on the pure relative basis based on total assets under management for each firm. As you can see from the top of the chart, Invesco's long-term performance remained strong with 57% of our actively managed assets in the top half of their respective peer groups on a five year basis, 38% of which is in the top quartile. At the bottom of this chart, 60% of OppenheimerFunds total assets were in the top half of peer groups on a five year basis, about a quarter of which was in the top quartile. These result on both an individual and combined basis, highlight our long-term focus and the high-quality nature of our investment teams. Now let's look at performance improvement for both firms on a quarter-over-quarter basis. As we're become evident on Slide 14, both firms reported significant quarter-over-quarter improvements in performance in total U.S. mutual fund assets. These chart show three month performance on a peer relative basis at the end of the first quarter of this year compared to three month performance at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018. 76% of Invesco's mutual fund assets were in the top half of peers at the end of the first quarter compared to 40% of the end of the year, an increase of 36 percentage points. In a similar vein, 72% of OppenheimerFunds mutual fund assets were in the top half of peers at the end of first quarter compared to 8% at the end of 2018, an increase of 64 percentage points over this period. Off note, Invesco maintained a solid proportion of its funds in the top quartile, while Oppenheimer improved its assets in the top curtail from 5% to 35% between these two time periods. While this performance is short-term in nature, the chart shows the significant improvement on a peer relative basis over this period for both firms, and is indicative of an ongoing trend of improvement performance as well as the strong desire of both firms to drive the strong investment results. These teams are focused and not distracted in any way. Now let's examine performance over a longer period as well as performance improvement from notable funds for both firms. If you could please turn to Slide 15, I wanted to provide a couple of touch points that highlight performance improvement from November 2018 to the end of March 2019 for Invesco. The upper left hand portion of this slide shows Invesco's performance improvement in the top half of peer groups increased from 11% to 44% on a one year rolling basis. We used November as a time period for consistency. So that was used in last quarter's earnings call and we thought that would be helpful for ease of comparison. We have also seen significant improvement in the performance of several of our largest mutual funds. Over this time period, we've improved the number of our 16 largest funds in the top half of peers from one at the end of November to seven at the end of March 2019, as shown at the bottom left hand portion of the slide. To fuller illustrate at this point, we've shown material improvements in the one year peer relative rankings for several notable strategies as highlighted on the right hand portion of this slide. Many of these strategies experienced significant flow challenges in the past year. And let me highlight a couple of these improvements. Diversified dividend moved from 84th percentile to 43rd percentile, high-yield units from 64th to 33rd, international growth from 66th to 32nd percentile, and balanced-risk allocation from 70th to 45th percentile. We continue to size the mutual fund assets in each strategy on the right hand side, which combined, represent 26% of Invesco's total U.S. mutual fund asset base. I\u2019d now like to share the results for OppenheimerFunds, mutual fund assets using the same methodology and time period as we move to Slide 16. The peer relative performance for Oppenheimer\u2019s mutual fund assets remained strong and stable in total as well as for several of their key strategies on a one-year rolling basis. The upper left hand portion of this slide shows performance in the top half of peer groups on one year trailing basis remain solid at 53% at the end of March 2019, up slightly from 51% at the end of November of last year. As expected from these numbers, the total number of their 16th largest mutual funds in the top half of peer groups remained about the same over this period. The following observation can be made when drilling into some of OppenheimerFunds notable strategies on the right hand portion of Slide 16. On a one year rolling basis at the end of November 2018 and March 2019, developing markets continued to deliver superior results for clients by maintaining performance at the 13th percentile for each time period. Main Street large cap core improved from 79th percentile to 32nd percentile, International small and mid cap maintained outstanding performance at the 4th percentile for each time period, and Rochester High Yield Muni also maintained outstanding results for clients by delivering 2nd percentile performance for each period as well. You can also see the size of mutual fund assets here for each strategy, which combined represent more than a third of Oppenheimer\u2019s U.S. mutual fund asset base. Let me wrap up this section with a couple of high level summary points. So performance in aggregate is strong and improving at both firms. Performance in the largest mutual funds is improving and or remaining solid at both organizations. We\u2019re extremely exciting about this performance improvement and working hard to ensure this performance will continue. Leading more excited in our believes that the combination of investment capabilities of OppenheimerFunds with Invesco will create a truly unique all weather portfolio across passive, active and alternative capabilities to better serve the various needs of our clients. These firms will have this broad set of complimentary capabilities in the industry, which we believe will drive stable long-term investment results as well as provide greater sources of outflows to better align with clients across the globe and in different channels. This is exciting for us and for our clients where we continue to focus on delivering strong performance that will help them meet their long-term investment objectives. I\u2019d now like to turn it over to Loren, who will walk through the financial returns and post combination revenues, expenses and details on synergies. Loren Starr : Thanks very much Greg. As Marty mentioned, during the quarter, we made significant progress towards the integration of the OppenheimerFunds. We've highlighted a few of the key activities completed to date on Slide 18. I'm not going to spend too time here, but I just wanted to say that we\u2019ve completed a process of defining the leadership teams and the organization for the go-forward business, and we\u2019re making significant progress obtaining fund shareholder approval for each of the funds that we\u2019re bringing over. Finally, I should mention that a key area of focus between now and May 24th is to ensure that the combined sales teams are ready at close to execute a single transition and provide enhanced experience for clients on both sides. Next, let me provide a quick update on our deal economics based on the information effective by the end of March, which now reflects a May 24th close date, full clarity on the timing of synergies and current levels of AUM. And for those of you who are following along, I'm now on Slide 19. So we now expect to recognize, as Marty mentioned, up to 85% of the cost synergies by the end of 2019, and that is earlier than originally anticipated. The ETFs accretion numbers for both 2019 and 2020. And now estimated to be $0.24 in 2019 and $0.58 in 2020, similar to the way we showed this in Q4. These accretion numbers are calculated looking at the combined firms relative to Invesco on a standalone basis, assuming no Oppenheimer combination were to take place. The updated IRR for the deal is now expected to be 17%. And finally, by the end of 2020, when we realize the full impact of the $475 million of synergies, Oppenheimer will add more than $900 million in EBITDA. The combined firm will have an operating margin in excess of 41% and the annual EBITDA of the combined firm will be more than $2.6 billion. Other than the update to reflect current AUM, the May 24th closing date and the timing of synergies, our expectations have not changed around the total amounts of the synergies, the integration costs or slower revenue assumptions for the Oppenheimer post close. So let me next turn to review what the financials of the combined firm will look like. So on Slide 20 through 22, we provide a pro forma look at the financial position of the combined organization. On Slide 20, we show the combined organizations run rate, net revenues and net revenue yield after the combination. Again, this is based on March 31st information. The combined firm will have a net revenue yield, excluding performance fees of 41.5 basis points after the close, and estimated annual adjusted run rate net revenues of nearly $4.9 billion, on a pro forma basis. This assumes assets are flat to the end of March levels. Next turning to Slide 21, you'll see the pro forma view of the combined expense base before and after the full cost synergies are captured. After the impacts of the full $475 million in cost synergies, the combined organization would have approximately $2.9 billion in annual adjusted run rate operating expenses. Once again, I'd like to point out that this run rate assumes that AUM is flat to 3-31-19 levels. The $475 million in cost synergies represents approximately 14% of the expense base of the combined firm. As we discussed last quarter, this expense reduction is directly related to the inherent benefits of scale of this deal as we will leverage a single operating platform for the combined businesses, manifested in the areas of the middle and back office, enterprise support, technology and distribution, in particular. Slide 22 provides further detail on the synergies, including a breakdown by line item and quarter of realization into the run rate. As you will note from the chart, we expect to recognize roughly 50% to 55% of the cost synergies by the end of the third quarter. Additionally, by the end of 2019, we will anticipate capturing approximately 85% of the synergies or more than $400 million in the run rate savings. You will remember that we had previously guided to capturing approximately 75% to 85% of the synergies by the end of the first quarter of 2020. The progress we've made to get the go forward team in place and the integration work that we have completed to date has positioned us to deliver on the higher end of our original target range in one quarter earlier. Remaining synergy capture, which largely represents property and office-related costs, and the remaining compensation synergies, will come in over the following year so that our 100% of the synergies should be captured by the first quarter of 2020. In subsequent quarters, we will continue to provide you with updates on our progress against these targets. And now with that, I will turn it back to Marty. Martin Flanagan : Thank you, Loren. Are as we've discussed on previous calls, what truly makes Invesco unique is the combination of the leadership we have in core markets and our ability to continuing invest in high growth areas. Our strategy remains unchanged. The combination with Oppenheimer meaningfully accelerates our strategy expanding leadership in core markets in U.S. wealth management, in particular, while strengthening our ability to execute in high growth areas, we focused on in the past, including China, ETFs, multi-sector solutions. This approach is helping us deliver on lean set up of capabilities, which will help drive sustainable and broad base growth aligned with where our clients were the industry is heading, while further benefiting shareholders. The addition of OppenheimerFunds will create a $1.2 trillion global investment manager that provides significant benefits to both clients and shareholders. The combined firm will be the 13th largest globally and the 6th largest investment manager in the U.S. wealth management channel, and importantly providing greater scale and client relevance. To further expand our comprehensive range of capabilities in a number of highly differentiated investment capabilities. And we\u2019ll provide compelling financial returns to shareholders, as Loren pointed out, in opportunities for growth from day one post closing. We\u2019re very confident on our plans to bring the two organizations together. We could be more excited about the tremendous potential of the two firms and for the benefit of both clients and shareholders. And with that, let us stop and open it for questions. A - Loren Starr : Operator, will you open up the line for questions? Operator : Our first question comes from Dan Fannon with the company Jeffries. Your line is open. Dan Fannon : I guess, I think you guys have gotten some comments about this as we have around just kind of the leverage post the transaction. And so wanted to talk about how you\u2019re thinking about capital post close? How we should think about maybe net debt considering, obviously, the long-term bonds you could pay, but they aren\u2019t necessarily as really callable or as financially attracted to do that. So just wanted to think about how you\u2019re -- get some comments on how you\u2019re thinking about kind of leverage and excess liquidity over the next kind of 12 to 24 months? Loren Starr : I\u2019ll pick that one up. So, good question. So given the continued improvements in markets and our AUM levels, so we actually feel comfortable maintaining our plan right now, our current capital plan, which as you know, sort of suggest that we\u2019re going to buyback $1.2 billion of our stock by the end of Q1 2021. However, I will say, Dan, we will continue to evaluate both the timing and the pace of the buyback in light of, obviously, any subsequent market actions as well as any significant shareholder inputs. Again, we feel that the firm is continued to strengthen -- both firms are continuing to strengthen in this current market. And firmly the combined firms are going to be stronger and more effective together than we are currently right now. Dan Fannon : Got it. And then just in terms of kind of the flow picture, I recognize some of the performance improvements you guys are talking about. But, obviously, flows for first quarter is typically better for the industry, and we saw that improvement with you guys. But if we think about kind of the combined benefit and the distribution efforts, how quickly do you think you\u2019re able to start to manifest an improvement and actually the net organic growth rate as you kind of go through this integration? Martin Flanagan : Yes, Dan, this is Martin. So let me start with, and Loren has mentioned this. So what now is in place on the distribution side is all the leadership is in place and everybody in the go forward organization is in placed and notified and already been trained, and very focused on the day after close really making an impact in the field with clients. We've done this in the past, I think, it will be better than we have done historically, and the talent is representative of -- the best talent from both of the firms. But we will literally have better talents and more resources against the distribution than we ever had before. So that's where I would start. I think, you are right, historically. The first quarter is one of the strongest flow quarters. And we saw some quite a bit of change ourselves. But let's remember, coming out of 2018, in the fourth quarter, in particular, people were not very confident about where the markets are going. And so was really slow in a relative sense to the uptake. So we're continuing to see increased demand, frankly globally. And Loren pointed out, in particular, we're seeing that's the improved set of flows from our ETF business, and we would anticipate that. Again, I think, Greg also pointed out we're seeing a marked improvement in our equity investment performance, which we would anticipate because we intended to have a value bias, and that really hurt us last year. But again, we're seeing some really strong performance. So, all the leading indicators would suggest that we're heading in a very good direction and quickly. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ken Worthington : I just got to know, MassMutual better. How are the conversations going in terms of cross-marketing? So it seems like you're going to be hitting the ground running in terms of the cost synergies from the deal. I was wondering to what extent this team can be set in terms of revenue synergies and cross marketing? Martin Flanagan : Ken, great question. So, we were very specific to focus on what are the financial outcomes that we're delivering right now. The vast majority of people following the company, that's really all that wanted to hear, and it was show with what's happening. Now the reality is great conversation with MassMutual. We are making very good progress. We will update people at the next call on sort of the go forward revenue opportunities across the organization, just not limited to MassMutual. And again, so that our definite scale benefits here have to retaliate from our perspective is, we\u2019re very stronger firm with greater capabilities and greater upside in revenue opportunities and meeting client demand. So we're not ignoring it, we're just responding to what has been the very specific focus of you and other analysts following the company right now. Ken Worthington : And then can you talk about the sales environment in the UK? So given Brexit has been push back, but it's still an issue and given current performance, may be what is your outlook for the rest of the year or the go forward here in the UK? And I think you guys called out the big GTR redemption in the quarter given the performance track record there, may be more specifically, what is the outlook for this strategy and the assets? Thanks. Martin Flanagan : Yes. So, Ken, very good point. And what we look at the fundamentals strength of the organization is the UK and EMEA, in particular, frankly last year turned to a headwind as Brexit became very, very real. And if you just look at -- if you want to look at retail flows across the continent and the UK, the industry level after they just dropped like a rock. And those people went absolutely risk off, and that hurt us quite a bit. It continues to be a risk off-environment. Brexit is actually a headwind. And I'm sure everybody in the EU that would like to get some clarity here, I think, as soon as there\u2019s clarity, you\u2019re going to see quite a bit of change. I don\u2019t think anybody else will answer the question when that\u2019s going to happen. So don\u2019t have a specific timeframe, obviously, but we will anticipate marked improvement inflows post any decision, quite frankly. And with regard to GTR, the performance has been improving, which is a very good thing. As you know, it\u2019s been a very successful capability for us. But as the relative performance veined last year, it absolutely did slowdown. So again, we would look forward to really improved performance, I think, is really going to be the key for us as we go forward there. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Patrick Davitt : Just a quick follow up to Dan\u2019s first question. All of that commentary, would you say that suggest an increased willingness to delever post deals kind of the same willingness or lower willingness to delever versus repurchase? Loren Starr : I mean, I think, we\u2019re open to it. We actually feel very comfortable with the financial leverage that is effectively part of the preferred in light of the strong operating EBITDA that we\u2019re going to be generating through the synergies and with the combined business, with close to a $1 billion of EBITDA coming on board post synergies relative to the coupon. It does not really presents in our mind a significant financial risk, but it is one that we continue to listen to shareholders. And we certainly believe there is a little bit of work to be done just. So we make it clear kind of our perspective on the financial risk associated with the preferred -- actual preferred, which is again non-cumulative. It doesn\u2019t have a call until the 21 years. There\u2019s no it\u2019s just professional so there\u2019s no principal repayment. And so there are aspects to this preferred that is a little bit unique and different than I\u2019d say more traditional preferred. Patrick Davitt : And then on the flow picture, what about the GTR redemption mix you feel like it\u2019s one-time? And then on the Japan side, how much more exposure do you have to bank loan clients in Japan? And then maybe more broadly, could you speak to more detail how the April flow picture is tracking? Loren Starr : In terms of GTR, we\u2019re getting wins on GTR. There are a couple of potential ad risk accounts as well. So in terms of size there isn't seen to be anything quite of same magnitude that we saw in the first quarter, but ultimately it\u2019s a big pool of assets and there could be further determination. But we\u2019re defending it well given what Martin mentioned in terms of the performance having improved. So again, it\u2019s -- we\u2019re going to continue to watch that closely, but nothing that we know about that is depending. In terms of Japan and bank loans, I mean there\u2019s still probably some potential bank loan outflow that we see nothing significance. I mean it could be an aggregate, maybe I don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s - about a $0.5 billion issue in that time -- in that amount. But ultimately, we\u2019re continuing to do solid client engagement with those clients. And ultimately, I think, we\u2019re seeing a strong sales pipeline that could offset some of the outflow associated with that particular category. And again, the bank loan category just in general has been an outflow. So it is nothing unique to our capability. It's really just been sort of the lack of interest in that. Martin Flanagan : Yes. I think it\u2019s interesting enough in Japan outside of one client. There's been some increased demand. And we're seeing out some quite strong interest in the pipeline even in Japan for bank loan. If you know the performance of that strategy, is incredibly strong. And so there is most of that stuff is separately managed accounts, but there's also big buyers of what we do on the CLO front that also coincide the interest in bank loans overall. So we'll have to see. We kind of think the worst on the bank loan side from a flow standpoint is probably behind this. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with the Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Michael Carrier : Thanks. Good morning. Just on the net flows, you saw the improvement in the quarter, some seasonality in environment, but even if you look over the past, three or four quarters, it's a good kind of level of improvement. It still seems like the redemption levels are a bit elevated, close to breakeven. So when you look at what's driving that whether it's on the RECO side or the institutional, you called out the GTR and then the bank loan, but is there anything else that's kind of weighing on the redemption that you think can start to improve as we get later into 2019? Martin Flanagan : Let me just make a comment for some perspective from our point of view and then Loren can get specific. So you can earlier -- we were making a point. So last year, if you looked at fundamental strengths of the organization, we would say it's the UK, it's the continent, it's Asia-Pacific, and quite frankly a number of the capabilities that Greg highlighted here in the U.S. All of that led to the nine years of net flow before last year. Brexit became a tremendous headwind for us as an organization last year. At the same time, the trade war actually became quite a headwind for us also in our Asia-Pac business in this risk-off environment. And then finally, we are just sort of value bias here in some of our equity capabilities in the space where the bank concentration really hurt us. So all three of those lining up at one time was something that we wouldn't ever have imagined that could have happened. What we're seeing coming out of it is really the improved performance because of the market. The pipeline continues to grow. But there is an absolute focus on the redemption side for us as people are assessing where they are and their sort of risk-off or into the market. But everything that we're seeing and the interactions are as strong as they've been over a year. So we're very happy to leave 2018 behind, and it looks like heading in the right way. Loren? Loren Starr : Yes. I mean, I wouldn't add much more to that. I think in the institutional side, obviously, there have been one-off redemptions. There have been very large. Certainly, we saw that in the fourth quarter. The idea that we're going to be avoiding any large one-offs in future is probably unrealistic. But we do see the pipeline strengthening significantly as I mentioned. They were up, I think, about 6% quarter-over-quarter with probably about 15% year-over-year improvement on AUM as well. Again, revenue mix in terms of what is coming in relative to what's going out is superior, so all those dynamics are very positive from a flow perspective. You can certainly get sort of fixated on the absolute numbers of the flow amounts. But when you actually look at the revenues, that is what I am most focused on, and I actually really think that we're seeing continued interest in products that we really have great capabilities in that are higher fee. And certainly with Oppenheimer coming on board that is another feature. And I would mention that there\u2019s always been a continued thought about the fee rate on Oppenheimer is going to be at risk. And when you look at Oppenheimer\u2019s fee rate, all the way back to 2011, I mean, it\u2019s only increased, and it\u2019s been absolutely steady for the last six years. And it really is not been a topic of the fee rates been challenged. So I do think our opportunity to slow at a reasonable rate with good economics is something that we\u2019re very focused on post-transaction. Martin Flanagan : One thing I\u2019d add maybe just -- fully because outflow for a second. This is a real positive story. I think is our gross flow picture is remaining very, very strong. So especially strong, and I think an increase in a couple of key markets. But the redemption picture to the question is really kind of spot on. We\u2019re also seeing how that redemption began to decline. So if we can focus what Marty mentioned is really impart, and we're kind of all over the ability to get the focus that we need, especially in post the combination of firms in the U.S. wealth management business. We can do that and continue to drive an investment performance. We don\u2019t have some of these one-off events. That\u2019s kind of a flow trajectory, but I think we could see from a net basis going forward. Michael Carrier : All that color is helpful. And then just a quick one, just on the Great Wall JV, given the strength that you\u2019re seeing in the money market, just update is there on like you came you broaden that relationship? Or what would get more of the long term product flows in over time? Martin Flanagan : Look we are incredibly uniquely placed in China. And as you know, we were the only foreign manager that is kind of the financial network and it is broadening into other capabilities. And it\u2019s started with -- they had a very specific need around money front. Quite frankly, that is going to slow down here for a quarter or two as we\u2019re going to be introducing another -- money funded to that and the broadening of channel. And again, we\u2019ll get into further detail in the quarters ahead. But the ray has just came out in China. And we are right the number two well successful firm in China as of foreign money managers. So we are incredibly well placed, and that platform is just one of many. And we\u2019re seeing almost half of our flows -- retail flows through the joint venture coming through where they refer to e-commerce channel. So that is the future for us there. Again we continue to be very well placed. And this is going to continue to give us proportionate area for us an organization. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brian Bedell : Maybe just to start off with the cost save side of things, thanks for all the granular detail, but as I asked this before a couple of quarters ago, just wanted to sort of get refreshed view. But Marty and or Loren, obviously, this all of the cost saves here are back office in nature. So what are your thoughts about potential product rationalization where I think last time you said as you get into the deal, you may revisit that, maybe some updated thoughts there? And then what portion of the combined sales force was cut? Martin Flanagan : Yes. Let\u2019s see with regard to products rationalization, that's something we do on an ongoing basis. And we have to be very clear. We have not been able to focus on a lot of client rationalization while the proxies on the market. So we have no insight to pass on to you. What I will say back to the comments we made from the beginning, vast majority of the capabilities are supplementary. We don't see an awful lot of rationalization there. And where it will be -- it will be on the margins. So we'll not be disruptive to clients, which is really very important. We wouldn't have done the transaction if you thought it was. But again, that will turn our attention to that after closing. And needless to say, we will grow as rapidly as we can with that. Loren Starr : We provided, obviously, what percentage of the synergies is coming from sales and distribution in the last call. That level of detail in terms of kind of what we're doing is really the most we want to provide at this point, Brian. So hopefully you can pick that on. But we feel that a combined sales organization is going to be stronger, clearly than what each of us individually had. And we are going to be able to invest in areas that each of us individually have not been fully able to invest in with, I think, great results, brand innovation, thought leadership, practices around education, the client engagement that are going to be superior to one of our individual capabilities. Brian Bedell : Okay. Okay. And that's a good take to the revenue synergy side. So I don't know if this has asked before. May be just more specifics on the plan for branding, are you getting with the Oppenheimer name or you keeping it for a while? And then on product creation given that there is opportunity, if you create new products for existing mutual funds on the Oppenheimer side, especially, what are your initial thoughts there? And also whether you would license the upper city in active ETF may be just your thoughts on the approval of that active nontransparent ETF? Martin Flanagan : Yes, lot of [indiscernible] Brian. So let me -- with regard to product capabilities, if we're just focused on Oppenheimer, again, what we said very complementary the vast majority of capabilities are in the U.S. wealth management channel. There are opportunities institutionally for number of the capabilities. There is opportunity for retail outside of the United States for number of the capabilities. There will be likely product extensions into Asia, really off the Emerging Markets team like this, as Greg pointed out the performance. It's really quite spectacular. Global equity is something is very interesting institutional clients outside the United States. So again, it's -- we're on that same path that we talked about in October. We just have a greater degree of confidence in that. With regard to the proceeding in ETFs, I think that the SEC approval that I think that's a very good development. I think the other reality is -- there is going to be, I think, a long tail before that becomes successful in the marketplace. And when you look at the totality of the ecosystem, and I think the firms that are most likely well placed and the firms like us that have a strong active capability along with the ETF franchise because it\u2019s that performing other need is really -- it's a true skill set that needs to be within the organization. So again, I think, that's good news. I don't you're going to see a rapid change though in that area from that perspective. Brian Bedell : Okay. And then just on branding? Martin Flanagan : Yes. So at close, the combined firm is Invesco. The funds will -- the OppenheimerFunds will the Invesco Oppenheimer something for a period of time. And the clients will tell us what they want that ultimately to be, but that would be some time in the future. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Campbell with Barclays. Your line is open. Jeremy Campbell : And thanks for the helpful realization timeline you guys put out on Slide 22. Just a point of clarification on that one, are these -- the synergies you\u2019re expecting to be embedded in the quarter or the exit run rate? So I mean like 3Q, are you doing costs between now and like July 1, still 3Q will reflect like 250 of annualized synergies, so basically $50 million in the quarter itself or exiting 930 at that run rate? Loren Starr : Yes. It would be the exit run rate that\u2019s the way to think about that. Jeremy Campbell : And Loren, maybe I misunderstood you, but I think when you\u2019re talking about the synergy timeline earlier here you kind of noted that it assumed AUM as flat to 3.31. If AUMs move kind of up or down from here, should we expect the cost saves changed at all or are you just referring to the accretion math overall and the impact on the top line? Loren Starr : It\u2019s really related to the accretion amounts and the top line. I mean, we\u2019ve been consistent with the 4.75 through kind of different AUM levels as well. So we\u2019re not going to change the 4.75 markets go down or go up. It\u2019s really the number that we\u2019re going to be focusing continue to report on. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open. Glenn Schorr : Quickly on the net revenue yield and passive sale like 7% year-on-year and more than that quarter-on-quarter. Is most of that just mix in end markets? Were there any material price changes in the quarter? Martin Flanagan : So it\u2019s going to be mix. There\u2019s substantial amount of non-fee earning AUM in the passive category like the leverage associated with our mortgage REITs when we do an equity offering that shows up. So that will definitely push those fee rates down relative to what you might see on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Glenn Schorr : And then one other one on, there\u2019s a lot of changes on those, obviously, on the retail distribution side and just in terms of how they\u2019re approaching their business and move towards more portfolio construction. But I think that has a long tail. So the question I have for you is what are you doing to capitalize and change with them meaning to your answer to last question? You\u2019ve a lot of the tools between your ETF franchise and your broad diverse product set. But they\u2019re changing portfolio construction. And they have different means. So I'm just curious if you\u2019re seeing big changes and are you changing in a big way on how do you approach that channel? Martin Flanagan : Yes. So I'm going to make a couple of comments and let Greg. And so, absolutely, we've not been clear. So under the banner of solutions that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing. It is really creating models for platforms with platforms, working with just want to say wealth management platform where your question was. Also with the big teams, working directly with the big teams, helping with analytics, helping with them within the various systems, within their approved list and what they\u2019re trying to accomplish has been a massive undertaken for us. And that is the way the future. I think, if you don\u2019t have the resources to compete there, I think you\u2019re superiorly disadvantaged. And we have a very talented team. And maybe Greg, you want to talk about. Greg McGreevey : Yes. I don\u2019t think we need to add a ton to that. I mean effective solutions team. We've really put a significant investment in over the last four years. We've got a couple of components to it. The client engagement piece really to go out and do a superior job of kind of understanding the need that both platforms as well as prevent to the institutional side of what their needs might be. And then we have an analytical team to really come back and try to create outcomes for them whether that would be in the case of retail where we have model portfolios and other things that we can create. And we're doing that -- we've done that pretty extensively even over the course of the last couple of years where we partnered with a number of platforms that we think could be helpful whether they're using or directly our model portfolios are in some cases are going to use that to modify what they're doing. But I think, the question is spot on and what we think the retail market ultimately is going to go. And we think with the solutions capability and what we are doing from an engagement standpoint, we are going to be extremely well positioned there. Glenn Schorr : Just kind of a follow up. Is that Invesco branded or do you private label that within just when you deliver that model and then eventually deliver the solution to the end client? Martin Flanagan : Yes. It's all different, right? I mean, it really depends on what client -- so it's a full spectrum which is just fine for us. Let's say on that for a second. So I -- this is one element that we've been talking about, so where the industry is going? That's where scale and relevance really matters. I mean to have the wherewithal and the financial resources and develop those capabilities, it's real and it's meaningful. And by the way, we don't have them right now. It's too late, right? I mean it's going to be very hard because there are -- small number of firms that already have those capabilities, and there with these platforms as you would know. The other feedback they will get from big platforms is, if you don't have data analytics capabilities with regard to -- on the distribution site, you are going to be severely disadvantaged. And again, that's money and that's resources and that's where firms like ourselves are going to be a material advantage to those firms with less resources going forward. So I think we are on a very important topic. And we feel very well placed against where that setting. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Katz with Citigroup. Your line is open. Bill Katz : Okay. Thank you very much for taking the question and also appreciate the very specific line on details. It's especially helpful. Loren, may be a question for you just on the -- I think, I understand the dynamics driving the higher year one accretion for 2019. What I am trying to understand where the excess success or so is coming in the second year, just given some of the statements around some of your underlying assumptions? Loren Starr : Yes. So when we disclosed in end of Q4 results, we had, I think, it was $0.53, I don't know exactly. But that was based on Oppenheimer assets at $214 billion. So Oppenheimer assets at $230 billion at the end of March is what provides that operating leverage and earnings opportunity for us across both years. Bill Katz : And then I don't know for yourself or Greg, or Marty. Just going back to the gross sales dynamic a little bit, it sort of sound like there are some ins and outs as you think about geography, by asset class, by distribution channel some bigs and small. How should we think about -- what's the characteristic of the gross sales moving up from here? Is it sort of pro forma or the full of impact of Oppenheimer and so leveraging that to the U.S. retail distribution channel? Or is it something else that you can do beyond that just like the legacy book of business to get the instant franchise accelerating? Martin Flanagan : Yes. A couple of comments. First come back to -- for the industry and probably investor again that the environment that we came out of 2018. It was really creating this very form, call it unique set of ins and outs with all the sentiment so that the various reasons I talked about in the different parts of the world. Going forward, I mean, it\u2019s really no different for us. It\u2019s within the institutional business, but we\u2019re seeing not much different than what you\u2019re seeing in wealth management platform's clients are working fewer organizations. And what we\u2019re seeing is a dynamic of more mandates for institution than we had in the past. That\u2019s going to be one of the elements that are driving up to growth flows. China is another area that we\u2019re looking. You can see it. So it\u2019s really just more blocking and tapping as we\u2019d expect for us, but Greg really pointed out if you look over the number of years. Our gross flows continue to increase at a pretty strong rate. And I think -- that\u2019s a very important part of health as an organization by far. We have turned our attention to very much on how do you -- how can we minimize the redemptions. And as we said in the past, that\u2019s one area for all the work that we try to do to understand it. We\u2019re not great at understanding one institution hopefully make some of those decisions, some are clear, some just literally happen overnight. But \u2026 Loren Starr : The only thing I\u2019d add to that is I think some of the blocking attack when it is marrying demand with capabilities and having a clear go-to market strategy. I'd like to focus that we have the stronger teams that we\u2019ve got in from a distribution standpoint in most markets is going to be quite helpful to that. I think when Oppenheimer comes onboard, we\u2019ve done a lot of work to kind of look at the capabilities that they have into existing markets that they compete, and also where can we take those capabilities into new markets. And we think that\u2019s going to be quite additive. And when we talked about solutions a minute ago, there\u2019s a lot of parts of the industry that are going to outcomes away from products. So we\u2019ll probably hit the product side and the ways that we just kind of talked about. But we\u2019re ramping up dramatically what we\u2019re doing on the retail and on institutional side of having outcome-oriented conversations with clients using our solutions capability and partnership with distribution to really have different conversations. So we think that\u2019s going to take some time to generate flows. But clearly that is the direction of travel. And I think, as we talked about before, we really well positioned, I think in that space. So the combination of those, it\u2019s kind of building a mosaic, a combination of those things is really what\u2019s going to continue to drive our gross flow picture. Greg McGreevey : And I'm just hoping like we mentioned most of the other things that are what we call our growth engines, but obviously the digital distribution opportunity is one that we\u2019ve talked about for a while. And it\u2019s not one that\u2019s going to sort of go from zero to 100 overnight. But it is one where it is something where we\u2019re seeing demand for these types of capabilities. And it is one where I think it does uniquely position us within opportunities for us to grow sales in a way that we go into new channels that we're currently not in. Bill Katz : Okay. Just at this point of clarification, I think one of the questions was about April flows, and I apologize if you shared that number. But if you can just repeat what that was or? Loren Starr : We didn\u2019t actually share the numbers. So I think we've said that going forward. We\u2019re really not going to be sort of ramping discussions about flows into the next quarter or so. We\u2019re going to keep our commentary to March ending quarter. And so my role would be having our April AUM released. And we\u2019ll see those numbers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open. Brennan Hawken : A lot of mine have been actually answered, but just one on your -- on Slide 20. You guys laid out the Oppenheimer state with an update, which is great. But I looked at it and compared to the original numbers that you gave when you announced the deal. And then you had flagged a gross management fee of 61 bips. And now we've got -- it looks like you've got labeled as a neck of 61 basis points. I know Loren has spoke to the stability in Oppenheimer's fee rate for the past five or so years. But did Oppenheimer actually see their fee rates increased from 930 to 331 or is that just a definitional adjustment. Could you may be clarify that? Loren Starr : It is more of just an accounting kind of impact. So what we originally disclosed was net revenue yield, which was 56 basis points after breakage for Oppenheimer. That was on the October call. And right now, we're showing kind of 58.5 or 59, just looking at that number. And the difference between those two numbers have to do with the fact that Oppenheimer netted certain expenses against their revenues based on the way they accounted for their P&L. And so, we took their numbers and we've reposition them where we have actually gross up our revenues and those expenses I would otherwise been noted or shown as gross expense for us. So that's the difference kind of a technical aspect. But, what happen, it has not impact on the bottom line, operating income what so ever. Brennan Hawken : Got it. So Slide 20 of your current deck is apples-to-apples with the way Invesco report. Loren Starr : That is correct. Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kenneth Lee with RBC Capital. Your line is open. Kenneth Lee : Just one on the model fund flows post-close for the OppenheimerFunds. Any update on the previously assumed 1% to 2% organic growth target longer-term? And when you look across the combined complex between both companies, what would be the key drivers for the longer-term organic growth target? Thanks. Loren Starr : So in terms of the assumptions, no, we did not change any of the flow assumptions. We still have the same that we historically have discussed, which again suggests $10 billion outflow is going to take place. And I think that's still a very conservative number, but it is in the model. In terms of the Oppenheimer sort of disruption in terms of the client flow outlook and that would happen at close or really last half of the year close. And then for 2020, we said, sort of they would go to 1% to 2% organic growth rate. Again, our view is that once we are able to bring them in combined the two firms together, and with performance sort of moving into a more stabilized position that we're going to be able to grow both of our businesses more effectively. And then we were individually to do so. So that is our current thought. There is no reason for us to think otherwise at this point. We are obviously something -- is a key -- key aspect of the still but we are very focused on, as I mentioned, sort of at close really gearing up our sales force and having much more successful outcome. Kenneth Lee : Got you. Thanks. And one -- just one follow-up, and this is potentially a follow-up to some earlier questions regarding solutions business, granted a lot of the focus on the expense management side of things as well as the integration in the cost reduction efforts. But when you look at the need to reinvest in the business, and once again this is, I think similar to previously, not separate, to build up the institutional side of business with solutions business, what the potential impact to the needed expenses to reinvest on that side? Thanks. Martin Flanagan : That\u2019s a good question, I want to clarify that. The $475 million that we\u2019re talking about where there is going to be deliver period. But what -- the real point is it's not a cost saving story. It\u2019s a story of being able to more competitive for our clients, doing a great job for our clients. So when we talk about the U.S. wealth management business and commentary. We had earlier it is repositioning of distribution capabilities, its more challenged, greater resources than either of the firms have before. Against it\u2019s a literally -- this net number is after we\u2019re making investments that we need to continue to accelerate our growth whether it\u2019d be true needs for the investment teams, whether it would be digital analytics, whether it be for product developments, building up the institutional business. So that $475 million is going to be delivered. And all at the same time, we are a stronger organization. We\u2019ve made the investments that we need to make going forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Lee with IBW. Your line is open. Robert Lee : I guess a couple of questions. Marty, you've point out one of the drivers behind the transaction as to be more relevant for many of your distributors. And that\u2019s -- can you measure not just by the kind of the size of the AUM base and breadth of -- under-strategies, but a lot of firms also focused on, say different product structures and obviously of the ETFs you have the funds. But one of the things that maybe I think I would find helpful is you think you have a full product array in the sense of the SME business or CIT? Just trying to get a sense if there\u2019s other area that you would see a need for investment or maybe or not aware of fully appreciating possible momentum you may have to other product structures? Martin Flanagan : Yes. Look there\u2019s -- reality the variation, especially post closure, very few product capabilities that we don't have, right? And so that\u2019s one place to start. By the way, there\u2019s a very few vehicle structures that we don\u2019t have. An opportunity for growth for us going forward in the U.S. wealth management channel will be SMAs. That is something that has been an area of focus for the wealth management platforms. We would look to that as upside project. I think Greg and Loren have talked about it earlier. It\u2019s really the solutions capability as the other area that it\u2019s going to be meaningful and real as we go forward. But what I will say and you\u2019re hitting on it and it came off some of the other questions to some degree, just having capabilities is not enough to be successful with these firms anymore. I mean, it really is a level of resources whether it would be through thought leadership for building models or education or we\u2019re currently developing products. It is broad and it is deep. And that\u2019s what\u2019s demanded. It\u2019s the largest segment of assets under management globally, but it\u2019s also the most competitive. And you really need to be resourced holistically across that and we think we are. Robert Lee : And may be the follow-up. And Loren you've touched on this a little bit earlier. I'm focused on revenue versus flows. So with that in mind, if we are to think of kind of may be the pipeline you have, if we're think of kind of the revenue or maybe, in the perfect world, the EBITDA contribution of flows. I mean, how -- from where you could today, I mean how was the leasing quarter compared to kind of the net flow picture? How are you anticipating that playing out over the coming quarters? And may be as part of that, any thoughts that that would be a metric that you would consider sharing the future. Loren Starr : It's a great question. We do look at that. I mean it's very important to us to understand the revenues coming in versus potential revenue coming out, as I mentioned. So our fee rate for the institutional pipeline is some 20 basis points in excess of the firm's overall fee rate. So that is a very, very positive kind of contributor of EBITDA, and certainly the fee rate of what's going out is a much lower rate to the overall firm's fee rate. So we haven't quantify that. It is an interesting question. It gets into how much discloses too much. We've debated this internally quite a bit, and probably will continue. But it is something that I do feel is a very legitimate question because people get very focused on just the absolute value of assets won or loss. And that's really kind of missing the big picture in some cases where you really understand what is it contributing to the bottom line. And I think our story is not well understood and is a good one. Robert Lee : Great. And if I have time for one more quick one, Jemstep. Loren Starr : Yes. Robert Lee : I mean just kind of curious. I mean this was, I think, suppose to be a year where you start to see kind of all the investments start to pay off as the year progresses, may be an update on that. And I know there were some big clients that were potentially are expected to come onboard just kind of where that stands? Loren Starr : Yes. So we are still anticipating both Jemstep and Intelliflo starting to kick in more materially this year. We will anticipate after the second quarter to be able to give you more robust insights into that with Jemstep, specifically and in Intelliflo. In Intelliflo continued to grow both the combination, but the next step of Invesco being a part of the product offering that will be the second half of the year. Martin Flanagan : Just to be clear. So for Intelliflo, which again most people may or may not know, but they have -- they're talking about $440 billion of client assets. We are implementing this model of portfolio system that will allow them to offer models to their clients and similar to Jemstep. It has the opportunity for Invesco products to be featured in those models. That's a very significant opportunity for us. That, as Marty mentioned, is coming on line in the second quarter. Similarly with Jemstep, we have been working through a very significant commercial bank, it's a global bank in terms of penetration. And so that is something that we will be able, hopefully, to provide more detail at the second quarter call in terms of where that sits. But it is all very positive trends for us. And there are very substantial clients that are also in the pipeline. Well, again, with our focus being mostly on commercial banking relatives to may be some of the other competitors who are focused warehouses or other venues. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Alex Blostein : A question for you guys on Oppenheimer. What were their flows in the first quarter this year and Q4 of last year from kind of the fund data it looks like generally flows got to worse a little like kind of six month, but wondering what the whole franchise looks like? And I guess, more importantly, do you think these outflows were largely a function of the deal? So kind of slower sales kind of the difficult stuff that happens or relative performance issues that they seen a little course of the last kind of six months. And the deal related to dynamic is still kind of on the come? Loren Starr : Yes, so, good question. In the quarter they were outflow on long term about $3.3 billion. And so that was certainly worse results relative to their prior year-to-date of about $0.6 billion. So if you look at what that is, again, obviously, is included really rough fourth quarter like everyone had. Oh, sorry, it will coming off of the rough first quarter. But it is something where we\u2019re seeing sales have declined a little bit. So here our quarter-over-quarter sales declined about 20%. I think that is a little bit of function that was going on with the transaction. It\u2019s hard to actually say that that is the case. But I think we saw with the Van Kampen deal similarly when funds are going to be transferred over people. They probably don't sell them quite much. So we\u2019re hoping that that\u2019s a temporary situation and when that will get fixed as in the close happens. Alex Blostein : Great that\u2019s helpful detail. And then the second question just quickly up. And again, thanks for the expense guidance and kind of the outlook you guys provided on the slides. So I heard you loud and clear on the $475 million, and then that\u2019s going to be delivered. But curious to think about the investment spend from there as you look the organization as a whole. Where do you guys think is sort of the reasonable growth in the expense base from there right as you kind of go back to normal? Loren Starr : I mean, Alex, with -- I don\u2019t think it will be much different in a way you\u2019ve seen us operate in the past. I mean we\u2019ve made significant investments in areas around institutional, ETFs, solutions. That\u2019s all happens, obviously, excluding the Oppenheimer deal. As it all been a very fundamental part of what we\u2019ve done, and then something where we made a lot of investments already and they are sort of in the run rate at this point. In terms of kind of expected future big lifts on investments, I think it\u2019s going to be more incremental building on top of that current base. So I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see big step-ups in a way that we probably saw through 2018, which was where you probably saw the greatest need for investments on the short term basis. Definitely, we\u2019ll be able to give more color around guidance as we put them together. But one of the great things about this transaction, as Marty said, is that we are actually able to invest significantly behind our business through this transaction because we\u2019re ultimately creating stronger capabilities of talent, that is unparallel level for us, and technology and systems that is taking the best of both of their worlds and our worlds and bringing them together. So it is like an upgrade that is happening already through this transaction, and should substantially into at least a few years we would expect that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Chris Harris : Guys, just one question on the Oppenheimer EPS accretion. After the market rally in the first quarter, it looks like Oppenheimer AUM is only down now about 8% since the deal announcement, but 2020 EPS accretion number at $0.58, up nicely from December, but still down about 28%, since the time of the deal announcement. So can you guys walk us through that the disparity between those two numbers? Loren Starr : So I mean, there is a significant amount of operating leverage that is inherent in the Oppenheimer deal. And so there is no question if we got to the level that we disclosed previously at the 250. That number would be back up at $0.80. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your line is open. Chris Shutler : I need your thoughts around rationalizing the company's combined product portfolio post close. And I guess on a similar point, you give the AUM-weighted investment performance on Page 13 of the slide deck. But I'm guessing the numbers look less favorable on an equal-weighted basis. So is that fair and how does that play into your thoughts on our rationalization? Thanks. Greg McGreevey : I'm going to be a little repetitive from before. Post close, will turn our attention to product rationalization. We're not allowed to spend time on that when proxies are out in the marketplace, we, as always, we were always looking at product rationalization. We'll do that here. Our view is it will be on the margin, the vast majority of capabilities coming over our complementary. And so you will see a very little client instruction from our perspective. Loren Starr : I think, on the -- where you're seeing about the first base, I don't think our performance is dramatically different versus the asset-weighted basis. So there aren't a lot of underperforming small funds or things that need to get. But from those do happen every year. We do go through product rationalization efforts and trim. And so there's never one where we kind of let the attic too full. So again, really subsequent to the close we can address that question in a more detailed way. Chris Shutler : Okay. And just to be clear, rationalization is not in the EPS accretion. Loren Starr : That is correct. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Michael Cyprys : Most of my questions have been answered. Just may be curious if you can talk a little bit about the integration of the technology and systems perspective. And how many systems are you guys operating today? How many systems you are going to operate post integration? And what's the opportunity to rationalize all of the technology systems to do something entirely new greenfield and may be even leapfrog ahead in terms of technology? Martin Flanagan : So, it's two phase, as you would imagine we looked at something else getting to date one. So at close, we will be on a single transfer agency. That's always very critical because that's the client facing element, so that a principal factor in choosing the closing date. 90 days after that the operating platforms will be all rationalized. We are then looking over the next two years to do exactly what you're talking about. We have a unique opportunity to totally leapfrog and number of the operating platform capabilities that we have. We are well into those conversations. And I think that's going to be real opportunity for us in complementary to a lot of additional things that we talked about earlier. So we're very excited about it. Michael Cyprys : And when you mentioned that the next two years, that's something that you're to be looking into? Any additional color you could provide in terms of goalposts, objectives there and how you\u2019re thinking about that sort of saving into the expense growth in that post to your backdrop? Martin Flanagan : Yes. As we\u2019ve already said in the past, things become material and interesting. We\u2019ll definitely share them. Loren Starr : Yes. I would say that that none of that should have any impact on the $475 million that ultimately we\u2019re going to deliver that. And so if there\u2019s opportunity to invest further, it will be completely offset by extra saving. Martin Flanagan : Okay. Thank you everybody for your time and questions. Appreciate it. And we will talk to you shortly. Operator : Thank you all for joining. That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

Operator : Welcome to Invesco's Second Quarter Results Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I would like to turn the call over to your speakers for today, Martin Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer; and Greg McGreevey, Senior Managing Director of investments. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin. Martin Flanagan : Thank you very much and thank you everybody for joining us. And if you're so inclined, you can follow along the presentation that's on the website. I'll cover the business results today and talk a little bit about the combination. Loren will get into greater detail of the results and impact of the combination and as practice; we'll open-up to Q&A. So, let me get started. I'm on Page 6, if you happen to be following the presentation. And as you saw, we successfully closed the OppenheimerFunds transaction at the end of May with $1.2 trillion in assets under management. We're now the sixth largest retail manager in the United States, 13th largest manager in the world, which puts us in a much [indiscernible] position to meet client needs. We're now just two months past close and we are more confident ever in our ability to achieve the deal economics and the tremendous potential of the combination. I also want to point out; we're incredibly pleased that the combination has created a much stronger organization with very talented people. Our conversations with clients reaffirm our view that the expanded set of capabilities we now offer combined with best-in-class distribution format, meaning we strengthened our relevance in the market and of late increase organic growth. I also want to point out there are very clear benefits to shareholders from the transaction. I want confirm once again we will get the $475 million in net synergies, 85% of that will be accomplished by the end of this year. The additional scale, resiliency and stability resulting from the combination will help us achieve a greater than 41% run-rate operating margin. And finally, pro forma year-end EBITDA on 2020 is expected to be exceeding $2.6 billion. Turning to the highlights; investment performance remained strong during the quarter. 58% of actively managed assets were in the top half of peers over both the three and five year period are getting greater detail in just a minute. Long-term net outflows totaled $3.9 billion, building on the improved trend over the prior quarter, reflecting stronger flows from our ETF and institutional businesses. During the quarter we began to see the power of the combination of recognizing the deals only close for one month. There is a 16% increase in net revenue quarter-over-quarter. The operating margin expanded 300 basis points to 35% or 27% increase in operating income quarter-over-quarter to $363 million. We're now operating from a position of strength, which has enabled us to invest in the growth of our business while also returning $389 million to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends during the quarter. All of this means we're better positioned to deliver relevant outcomes for our clients invest in future growth of the organization and provide solid returns for shareholders. Turning to investment performance on Slide 8; as I mentioned, performance remained strong, 58% of our actively managed assets were at 58% of five-year period, 33% of that was top quartile performance. The combination has enhanced the depth and breadth of our investment expertise across the business while further expanding the scale of our investment capabilities. Invesco now ranks Top 10 in assets under management, 10 of the 15 largest asset categories in US retail channel, which is the largest market in the world. Best examples are a second-ranked in bank loans, HY Munis, third rank in emerging markets, fourth rank in global equities. We see three areas where there's an alignment from market demand is strong, long-term track records of our capabilities that being global, international, emerging markets equity, fixed income and alternatives. All three of these asset classes have significant percentage of our assets in the top quartile for all time periods. So, in short, we're very well positioned in the market and the capabilities we are seeing strong demand, which will drive organic growth. I'll now pass over to Loren to go through the results. Loren Starr : Thanks very much, Marty. On Slide 9, you'll find an overview of our long-term flows. In aggregate, we experienced net outflows of $3.9 billion in Q2, which is an improvement of $1.5 billion compared to the prior quarter and $4.1 billion compared to prior year. As you can see on the slide, the area is driving this positive change, we're in passive Asia-Pacific, EMEA, ex-UK and institutional. ETF capabilities globally contributed more than $4.5 billion in net flows for the quarter. ETF flows in the Americas were diversified across our smart beta offerings, led by our S&P low volatility suite and bullet shares ETFs. In EMEA ex-UK, we saw a positive ETF flows across a number of our equity and fixed income ETF capabilities. Notably, our ETF flow growth has propelled us to number two in terms of net new ETF assets in this region year-to-date. In Asia-Pacific, we generated $3 billion of net inflows. We saw a growth in sales surge across many of our fixed income and balanced capabilities with particularly robust growth provided by our China, Invesco Great Wall business. In China alone, we added nearly $2 billion of net flows into several of our active balanced and equity capabilities, reflecting the excellent investment performance and market positioning we have in this region. Our institutional business continued to show signs of strength, delivering $2.1 billion in positive flows in Q2. Of note, the last time we posted positive net flows in our institutional business was in the first quarter of 2018. Much of this change is due to the improvement we're seeing in redemptions. On the same slide, you can see the areas driving outflows in the quarter, which included active, the Americas, UK and retail. The majority of active outflows were in the asset class of equities, although these were offset to some extent by fixed income net inflows. In the Americas, outflows in our US retail equity products were elevated against the prior quarter due to the partial period inclusion of the legacy Oppenheimer products, which experienced approximately $2.5 billion in post close outflows during the quarter. The Americas were also negatively impacted by outflows across our bank loan capabilities with about $1.2 billion out, as investors redeemed from this asset class on an industry-wide basis. Industry dynamics also continue to challenge our retail flows in the UK as risk assets remained broadly out of favor with investors in these markets, fueled by the uncertainty from Brexit. Looking forward to the last half of 2019 for Invesco, we expect the factors that are currently impacting our flows both positively and negatively to largely persist. With that said, while we certainly are seeing an elevated level of outflows in the legacy Oppenheimer fund products in the short-term. We believe that we'll be able to improve our level of sales growth in the Americas, given the world-class distribution team and platform that we've created through this combination. It's still early days and the opportunity to drive flows through improved sales and marketing efforts have not yet been realized. So, before I leave this slide, I wanted to quickly provide an update on our expectations around AUM breakage as it is related to the combination. Our original deal expectations included an estimate as you'll remember of $10 billion in outflows in the first year after the close. As we look to client breakage, the only item that we've specifically identified at this point related to the announced transaction is the transition of the state of New Mexico 529 plan. This transition will result in a $2 billion outflow in the fourth quarter. So, with this known outflow and considering expectations around potential impacts from the announced investment team changes, we believe that our AUM breakage from the transaction will in fact meaningfully less than the original estimate of $10 billion. Next let's turn to Slide 10 which outlines our AUM. Our assets under management increased by $243 billion or 25.5%, which primarily reflects the impact of the OFI combination and positive market returns, partially offset by total net outflows. As a reminder, the RFI combination added $224 billion to our AUM in May. We saw a quarter-over-quarter growth in AUM across both active and passive and across all channels and client domiciles other than for the UK. The Oppenheimer AUM increased the percentage of the firm's AUM and that is active retail in Americas based while our institutional and passive AUM grew due to long-term net inflows and market appreciation during the quarter. As Marty mentioned, our general net revenue yield excluding performance fees increased 1.4 basis points to 38.5 basis points versus 37.1 basis points in the prior quarter. In addition of OFI AUM for slightly more than one month added approximately 1.3 basis points to our net revenue yield and we also saw one additional day in the quarter which added 0.3 basis points. These factors were modestly offset by change in AUM mix. Slide 11 provides US GAAP operating results for the quarter. My comments today are going to focused on the variances related to our non-GAAP adjusted measures which will be found on Slide 12. Moving to this slide, you'll see that net revenues increased by $145 million or they were 16% up quarter-over-quarter to $1.03 billion. This increase reflects primarily the impact of the Oppenheimer combination and the increased day count in the quarter. Adjusted operating expenses at $668 million increased by $65 million or 11% relative to the first quarter; this increase largely reflects once again the impact of the Oppenheimer combination on expenses for the period. Next, moving to Slide 13, I'd like to comment on the progress that we've made on the integration and synergy capture recorded to-date. As noted in the first quarter, we spent a significant amount of time between the announcement date and closing date defining the leadership and the organizational structure for the combined team. This has allowed us to quickly execute on a number of very important post-close activities required to increase our sales growth for the combined business. These activities include moving to a single brand, strengthening our newly combined sales organization through training and definition of go-forward client coverage and creating a client demand framework and go-to-market strategy for the combined firm. As I mentioned earlier when I was discussing the Q2 flows, we have not yet to fully realize the benefit of this work and the impact on our sales in the US retail business. In addition to activating the newly integrated US retail sales platform, the pre-close integration work has also enabled us to make meaningful progress on cost synergy recognition. We remain on-track to capture $475 million of net synergies through the first quarter of 2021. As a reminder, this $475 million amount of bottom line cost savings is net of investments we are making, which will allow us to drive future growth and avoid future costs. This combination is allowing us to accelerate investments in areas that strengthen our distribution investment capabilities and processes as well as allowing us to deploy new technologies and automation to significantly increase our operational efficiency while still delivering the $475 million in savings. In terms of timing, to achieve the net synergies, we originally expected to have 52% of total expense synergies captured at the end of the third quarter of this year. Given the significant amount of progress we've made prior to the deal close to establish, communicate and execute on our end-state organization systems and work placement by location, we were able to achieve this level of synergy captured by the end of the second quarter. With the quicker synergy capture, we remain well on-track to recognize 85% of synergies by the end of 2019. Next, let's move to Slide 14 which looks at our adjusted operating and net income. Operating income increased $79 million to $363 million, largely reflecting the increased operating earnings from the Oppenheimer transaction. Our operating margin improved to 35.2% versus 32% in the prior quarter, reflecting the positive margin benefits from the combination as well as the quicker synergy capture, I discussed on the previous slide. Firm's effective tax rate came in at 21.8%, which was consistent with our prior guidance. We continue to expect our tax rate to come in somewhere between 22% and 23% starting in the third quarter. Lastly, our net income improved by nearly 25% to $280 million, reflecting continued strong non-operating gains from our investments and adjusted EPS improved to $0.65 versus $0.56 in the first quarter. Next, move to Slide 15. This presents a snapshot of Invesco's balance sheet and capital management. So, as I had mentioned, we continue to execute in a very disciplined way to achieve the target level of deal synergies and the improved financial position that the deal provides. In doing so, we expect to continue to return significant levels of capital to our shareholders. You saw this in the current quarter when we returned nearly $390 million to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. This represented a PAT of about 107% of our operating income for the period. You'll recall that we announced a $1.2 billion share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2018 and we successfully executed $600 million against that plan through the end of the quarter as we see a significant opportunity to repurchase our shares given Invesco's stocks depressed valuation and trading discount to peers and given our confidence and the strength of the combined organization. In addition, we executed a further $200 million forward repurchase agreement in July. That will bring us to $800 million stock buybacks. Once this is completed, we expect to have repurchased some 39 million shares since the fourth quarter, which represents more than 8% of our share count outstanding as of the transaction close. Although there was no preferred payment in the second quarter due to the timing of dividend declaration, we will pay the preferred dividend starting in the third quarter. Note that the third quarter payment will be elevated at $64.4 million as they will reflect the additional 80-day post close period from May. Starting in the fourth quarter, the amount will level out as $59 million per quarter. Turning to the balance sheet; so, you will see that we have a $7 billion increase in assets during the quarter, largely reflecting the indefinite lived intangible and goodwill assets recognized as part of this transaction. Our equity balance increased by $4 billion, reflecting the preferred issuance to MassMutual close and our cash and cash equivalents balance increased by nearly $200 million. With the increased earning power and cash flow of the combined firm, we expect to reach our targeted $1 billion of cash, in excess of regulatory capital requirements by the second half of 2020. We repaid approximately $400 million of debt in the quarter, largely paying down our credit facility and leaving a near zero balance, which obviously has a positive impact on our leverage ratios. We expect to be able to maintain our current level of debt going forward. As Marty noted earlier, we anticipate that the combined organization will have a pro-forma annual EBITDA post synergies of more than $2.6 billion by the end of 2020, which represents a significant increase when compared to the pre-combination at Invesco. With this increased level of EBITDA, our leverage ratio would be approximately 0.8 times gross debt to EBITDA based on the US GAAP classification of the newly issued $4 billion of non-cumulative perpetual preferred as equity. Conversely, if the preferred were instead treated as a 100% debt, the leverage ratio would be at a 2.3 times gross debt to EBITDA. This is a level that we certainly view as manageable and one that will certainly come down over-time as our earnings grow. So I'll conclude by saying that we're very confident in our ability to capture the $475 million in net cost synergies and deliver the deal economics and other benefits we outlined, which include not only the targeted $1.2 billion in stock buybacks, but also a strong balance sheet with little or no added debt and some $1 billion of excess cash, as we get to the second half of 2020. And with that, I'll turn it back to Marty to wrap-up. Martin Flanagan : Thank you, Loren. Let me make a couple of comments before we get to Q&A. And as we've discussed on previous calls, we continue to be very focused on improving our leadership position in core markets, which of course this combination has while at the same time investing in those parts of the business where we see rapid growth. This approach has helped us to deliver best-in-class set of capabilities, which will drive sustainable broad-based growth as we look to the future. The combination with OppenheimerFunds has meaning if we accelerated the strategy. Obviously, expanding our leadership position in United States while also strengthen our business in areas where we're growing quite rapidly as Loren mentioned, China ETFs, digital platform solutions to name a few. So again, we're just too much paths closed and we have all the confidence that the combination is meeting and exceeding our expectations. And with that, let me open-up to questions please. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. You may go ahead. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning and thank you for taking my questions. I think first prior to the deal; I believe Oppenheimer was sort of running neutral to positive net sales. Since the deal was announced, Oppenheimer has seen a pickup in the outflows. I think you said it was $2 billion or maybe $2.5 billion since the deal was closed. I think originally you were modeling 1% to 2% organic growth for Oppenheimer. What are your sort of thinking now for the go-forward there? And then how quickly do you think you get the benefits from a sales perspective? I think you've suggested that the integration of the Oppenheimer and Invesco sales forces was particularly disruptive. We've got three months of Oppenheimer in 3Q rather than 1Q. So how quickly and maybe what is the cadence look like for an improvement in sales as the sales force is now integrated and hopefully more stable to offset some of these dis-synergies? Martin Flanagan : Yes. Let me hit some of the high points and I'll let Loren later. So, this is the most talented sales force I have ever seen. And it is literally made-up of half Invesco, half Oppenheimer. That was just the outcome of the exercise that the leadership went through. It is in place; it was in place and closed all of that work was done before. That said, it's a new range of capabilities in the focus area. So, I would quite say, through the end of the year until things settle down is when I think everybody have their sea legs. But that said, each and every day is a better day and had reached degree of confidence there. The other thing that we've talked about is just not the US wealth management platform, but Oppenheimer is a number of capabilities that will be well received in the institutional market and also in the retail market outside the United States. So literally, some of the retail capabilities will be available on October and we're already working on get it to market with a number of the institutional teams around the world. So again, the big difference is we're up and running and executing where most transactions I have seen this thing starts to happen after close. And from every transaction there I've been involved I can say this is the best that we've ever done. So, I think we're in a very good spot. Loren? Loren Starr : And Ken, we had an estimate of 1% to 2% organic growth scheduled to begin in 2020. So, at this point, we're still hopeful that we can achieve those types of levels of growth. Again, there is an opportunity to take these capabilities into our institutional channel into our offshore business. There is a lot of activity going on as we speak to actually make that happen a lot of interest in those channels for these products. We have some headwinds on certain key products in the Oppenheimer sort of capabilities, but there are other really high performing capabilities as well that we think we're going to be able to leverage itself. So, I'd say in terms of our distribution efforts that is really being spring-loaded in terms of being able to execute really in a position as we get to the second half of this year. I mean, again, there is probably some headwinds in the near-term, still that we're going to see, as I mentioned, we don't think anything can change, but ultimately, we're going to start seeing the benefit of this really world-class organization coming together and being able to execute. Ken Worthington : Thank you. And then on the institutional side of the business, you highlighted a move to inflows. But you also highlighted that the drive to net sales was driven by redemptions slowing. It does look like gross sales have slowed too. You've talked about in the past that the institutional pipeline was sort of hitting record levels. Should we see gross sales improve from here. If so, what asset classes and geographies? In terms of the decline in gross redemptions, is that sustainable or might that have just been a one-off this quarter? Loren Starr : Great question. So, I think the reduction in sales was really just the market environment that we've been in, things slowed down in terms of funding. So, there is some pause that happens. So, the one but not funded pipeline is still as large as it's been in fact it is up 10% versus prior quarter is up 31% versus prior year. So, the pipeline of one not funded is robust, very strong growing. So, we feel confident those assets are going to come through. It's really just a matter of timing on the solar redemption side. Again, it's hard to say what is permanent and what is not. In terms of what we know, in terms of expected outflows, nothing has increased relative to prior levels. So, we think that looks reasonably stable. But there is always going to be potential for idiosyncratic outflows that come from certain key clients. So again, what we can manage at the sales probably more than the redemption side and we are feeling very positive about that outlook into the next couple of quarters. Martin Flanagan : And let me add. Because you raised a very good point. I have absolute confidence that the operating results are going to be as you would predict, as we've talked about through '19 through '20. That said, two fundamental strength of our organization are seeing headwinds. Brexit is a headwind and for us it is incredibly risk-off in UK in particular. And the trade wars actually do impact our position in Asia-Pac. That said, we're still going to get the results that we're talking about. So, if you see any benefit in that, we would expect real strong increase in inflows. Loren Starr : And I didn't answer your last question sorry Ken. So, it's about more than 60% of the pipeline is in alternatives, about 23% is in equities and some 10% in fixed income; just to give you a sense of where it is coming from. Ken Worthington : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. You may go ahead. Dan Fannon : Thanks, good morning. I guess my first question is on just the synergies, the $475 million. Obviously, you've expressed a lot of confidence and have some good kind of runway to start here. So, Loren you mentioned also just kind of reinvestment back into the business. And so just curious, as we think a bit out if there is upside to the $475 million or if you're going to continue to kind of reinvest in growth in other areas as you achieve these synergies if there is additional things that are found? Loren Starr : So, Dan, we certainly have seen this transaction is an opportunity to upgrade significantly as we've talked about putting the firm together, becoming stronger firm has been part of the objective. This is not just been about cost saves. It's actually about creating a stronger organization. And so, we actually view this as a fundamental part of the transaction, the $475 million should be viewed as a net number, net of investments in terms of what we're going to deliver. We're absolutely confident we're going be able to deliver that. I think the good news is that we've been able and we expect to be able to continue to invest alongside delivering the savings into critical areas that will strengthen our distribution, our investment capabilities and invest in new technologies automation to augment our operational efficiency, really bringing our firm to sort of the state of the art and basically avoiding sort of the need to invest in the future, so really allowing us to accelerate all this activity right now. Today, we've been able to invest, small amount. So, let's say roughly $30 million. There is an opportunity I think to be able to invest more as we go through, but in terms of kind of the modeling and your thinking I would bank on the net $475 million is what to expect. Dan Fannon : And then just a follow-up; Marty on your comment about Brexit. Obviously, that's you said risk-off, but also performance in that area has not been good for you guys and some of the your -- I guess your former employee is going through some hard times over there. And then I just want to talk just generally about the franchise you see there, the strategies you have in place, how performance is kind of having through this type of environment and are there anything you guys are looking to do to proactively get in front or institute change or just kind of waiting for the macro to shift? Martin Flanagan : Yes, it's a good point Dan. I would say it's more broad. I mean, as you know, what has been a fundamental strength of the organization where we had nine years of net inflow up until throughout '17. Much of that was on the back of value biased equity capabilities and we're in an extreme period where it's out of favor almost, the most extreme period that we've seen, that's a record. That said the investors are still very, very talented, have great faith in them and they are going to do quite fine. So, the business issue that you're talking about is the flows and as I keep pointing out, we're posting these results with these extreme headwinds. But now we're not just waiting for things to change. I would pay attention to the Intelliflo announcement came out in June and it is a digital platform that start with our model portfolio, starting in the fourth quarter of this year, it uses a broad array of our capabilities, both active and passive and we looked at it as a game changer in the UK. Loren Starr : I'd also point out because it's moved quickly, there's lot of currency going on here as well, but pre-Brexit our UK as a percentage of AUM was about 12% of total. And as we show it is about 6%. So again, in terms of kind of the total exposure to Invesco just by the nature of the currency and some of the market and flow dynamics, it is not as large an exposure to the firm as you might have otherwise seen just a short period of ago. Dan Fannon : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Craig [ph] with Credit Suisse. You may go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. Good morning Marty and Loren. I just wanted to start with the $10 billion of merger dis-synergies, redemption notices have actually been trending better than you initially guided to. First-off, when do you expect institutions to notify you in terms of pre or post-closing and are you really kind of passed that point, so that's a good sign? But then also Oppenheimer has seen very large outflow since you announced the deal. So, I'm just wondering do you not include retail or intermediary redemptions in your dis-synergy number? Loren Starr : So, in terms of institutional notification, that's not really a factor because I think we really had very limited institutional relationships of any size at Oppenheimer's 529 was the largest for sure. So that's done. We have not seen any sort of notifications large scale institutional or retail-wise that indicate we should expect outflows due to breakage due to this transaction. There are as we mentioned some performance headwind, which we don't think fairly should be attributed to the deal. It's more just kind of the nature of the asset class or the performance in combination. A good example would be around kind of the international growth capability, which I think industry-wide was in significant outflow and so we certainly saw some of that hit our capability as well. So basically I would say in terms of the transaction and the impact -- that's not as we said, it's going to be materially less in terms of the current headwinds around outflows, again some of that may persist into Q3 and Q4, we are hoping to offset some of that through improved sales efforts across not only protecting that current estimates, but also promoting some of the other very strong investment capabilities through channels that had not previously been able to access those products where they weren't on the platform. So hopefully that's helpful in terms of sizing it. I wouldn't say the market has been helpful too. So, offsetting some of the outflow markets have offset that. So, in terms of the overall AUM levels related to Oppenheimer, we're still exactly where we were kind of in Q1. Unidentified Analyst : Loren, do you have the Oppenheimer total flow number for 2Q '19 not just post-closing, but for the full quarter? Loren Starr : I don't have that number handy. I'm sorry, Craig. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. You may go ahead. Glenn Schorr : You guys touched on it on your comments on the UK business. But maybe I could ask overall with now becoming number six I think you said and obviously done the deal to be more important in the retail channel, the retail channel distribution efforts are changing to the more portfolio construction approach. Could you talk about what you have functional now and also how much of the market shifted there. In other words, I get that the future is it now or is it impacting flows now. So, your positioning and then a statement on the overall retail channel. Martin Flanagan : Yes, it's a good question. So, we fully agree with the notion that clients really around the world are looking much more sort of outcomes, which basically means that we are creating solutions, portfolios of different sizes and make-ups. We are seeing that in the US retail channel too. I would not say it's -- I'd say that is where it's heading, it tends to be right now the largest teams are very focused on it. And as we've talked over the years, where that [indiscernible] through our solutions capability, which is very strong, very talented, it's been marketed, it's been in market for a couple of years and they do anything from building unique portfolios for organizations to analytics for various teams to help them determine how they might shift their mix. So, we do think that's the future. There's no question about it. The other area where we have made a great investment is in all of our analytics around distribution and again it only got stronger with the combination with Oppenheimer. They had some very talented people there also. And again, we think we're clearly one of the top players with those capabilities. I think what it also highlights to just this kind of conversation. You have to have size of scale to compete and the notion that you don't have the depth and breadth of capabilities, we are active as of only for solutions and to have digital support and capabilities. I just think it's going to be very, very difficult for others to compete. Glenn Schorr : That leads into maybe a quick question on the passive side. Obviously, you've had good inflows there. Could you broaden out a little bit of what's working best in passive land and maybe even touch on arbitrary associated? Martin Flanagan : Yes. So, what you are saying, the ETF business in Europe is now kicking-off in a very strong way. We had currently 20% organic growth in the quarter. It's the second largest flow in the marketplace. So, sources absolutely integrated product line is the way it's supposed to be. We're executing on all cylinders and back to the United States. Again, we're also starting to see our ETF flows picked up, again very important element of that is the bullet shares. We're not done with that. The build-out of the BulletShares capabilities yet, but the ones that we have put in place are very strong and again play to just a question you were asking about earlier a huge opportunity in the marketplace for financial advisors in particular with the BulletShares capabilities. Loren Starr : Glenn just in terms of specifics, I mean some of the largest flows we're seeing in terms of the S&P 500 low volatility ETF, we also saw a significant inflows into a newly launched fund in Europe, which is our MSCI, Saudi Arabia, ETF. Physical gold is another one where we saw interest. BulletShares in the US has been and continues to be a very, very fast growing capability, short duration ETFs as well seem to have picked up a lot of share. So a combination of fixed income commodities and mobile. Glenn Schorr : Great, thanks. Thanks for all that. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may go ahead. Michael Carrier : Good morning, thanks for taking the questions. The first one, just given the flow mix in terms of more passive and then institutional versus active in retail and the impact of that can have on the fee rate outlook versus what happened this quarter with the deal. So how do you think about the incremental margin for the business. If you see the flow trends continue like in that direction versus say over the next one to two years retail are active start to shift back? Martin Flanagan : Let me make a comment before Loren does. And I think you're hitting on something that is largely misunderstood. So when you look at our business, I can speak to others. The growth in our ETF business is a positive one, a very positive one. The profitability, the profit margins are in excess of our stated profit margins. So it's actually accretive to the business. And so the overall effect of fee rate if it drifts down, it has nothing to do with fee pressure. It has all to do with the mix in shift, which quite frankly is an area where we have greater profitability. Loren Starr : And in terms of the way we are thinking about it, the incremental margin that we're seeing as we grow, is in that 50% to 60% range, one that we've historically talked about. So nothing has shifted really in terms of our ability to see margins grows as we grow, certainly delivering that the net incremental number well above the firm's overall margin. As we talked about even though passive continues to be a very fast growing part of our business. The incremental margin on that business is actually extremely attractive and also well in excess of the firm's overall margin. So again, we want to differentiate. In fact that we've been focused mostly on the sort of smart beta factor based ETFs, which have generally higher prices than we've seen on the commoditized market cap weighted ETFs. And again that gives those products really strong margin incremental margin characteristics. Michael Carrier : Okay, thanks for that. And maybe just a quick follow-up for Loren. Just in terms of Oppenheimer, does that have any impact on the other revenue in the performance fee line, when we think going forward. Loren Starr : No, it really would not. There are very few places where Oppenheimer is subject to performance fees. I would say that the only caveat is to the extent that we use those capabilities institutionally in places in the US or outside the US. You could see some of those products potentially having some performance fees linked to them, but currently on their current asset base, no and other revenues as well. No. Michael Carrier : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Bill Katz with Citi. You may go ahead. Bill Katz : Thank you very much for taking the questions this morning. Just seeing one of the slides that you're -- so the EPS accretion is static from the last update, but the market has moved the fair amount. How do you think about market impact to that assumption? I'm just trying to understand sort of sensitivity to the macro. Loren Starr : So Bill, as I kind of hinted at one of the other questions, we obviously lost some assets through outflow, but we actually gained those that assets back through market. So in terms of general accretion, we're kind of exactly where we were before just happened to be where we are right at that that same level of AUM. Bill Katz : Busy morning, I apologize if I missed that. And then when you look out into 2021 when you are on the other side of sort of the normalized savings. Does your incremental margin change or maybe another way to ask the question is, what kind of growth rate would you anticipate on expenses assuming a relatively benign market backdrop? Loren Starr : Yes, good question. So again I think we would expect to see some 3% inflation on expenses generally as you get out into those outer years. I think again, one of the good news elements of that we are accelerating the fair amount of investment through this transaction. So our need to sort of substantially sort of redo technology and other things that other firms might have to deal with it through the course of the next several years. We're kind of getting a lot of that done through this transaction. Bill Katz : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. You may go ahead. Patrick Davitt : Good morning. Thank you. My first one is on the, I guess the expected uptick and fee rates from Oppenheimer. I know it's tough to do exactly, but my rough math suggests the full quarter uptick was something in the range of 3 basis points. And I think you guided to 4.5. Am in the right ballpark there and is there a reason to change the expectation for that 4.5 basis point uptick on a full run rate basis? Loren Starr : We still have in the model an assumption of roughly 2 basis points being lost due to sea breakages, you remember Patrick. And so we still don't know if that's going to be fully the case. But at this point, not able to say that it's not the case. And so I would still assume that there is, that $45 million kind of loss going to happen at some point, particularly as we at some point potentially rationalize products and so forth. So the way that I'd be thinking about it we were 39.1 in Q2. We'd expect to see our basis points climb roughly 2 basis points into Q3, maybe a little bit sort of higher into Q4. So that would be our thinking sort of 40, 41.2 to 45 in that range for the last half of this year. Patrick Davitt : Okay, thank you. And then on China, obviously good to see the traction there and obviously in some higher fee products. Could you walk through in more detail a little bit what's driving that uptick in inflows? And if you see that run rate accelerating at a similar rate going forward? And then finally any nuances to the sharing of those economics given how they are distributed? Martin Flanagan : Yes. China is a fundamental strength of ours. It has been for a long time. But what you are seeing now is the growth is just incredible and it was always an opportunity, but now it's literally happening, it's happening at both levels. The institutional level there we're managing money for the sovereign wealth funds etc. But the joint venture is amazing situation right now, Invesco Great Wall. The flows continue to grow and we expect that to continue. And then probably the thing by most unique is we're the only foreign money -- managing money for and financial that money fund and what's happened post that is then adding on traditional long only equity fixed income capabilities. So what they call the e-commerce platforms are very strong and for us is from nothing to a number two distributor in China right now. So we see nothing but ongoing success in China. Loren Starr : Yes. I'd say, I mean, about half of our flows are coming from those digital distribution channels. The economics on those channels are somewhat similar to what they are for the banking channel. So there is no sort of free gift here, but ultimately, we're very well positioned to continue to drive those types of products through and the overall fee rate in China in particular as well in excess of the firm's overall fee rate. So that dynamic in terms of our ability to distribute our active products into China is one that will have a positive impact, not only on margin and you can see what the margin is on our China Great Wall business, because we provide great detail in our queue and I mean it's in excess of 50%. So you can see that it's going to have a positive incremental margin impact as we grow if we're successful and we expect to be grown in China and our China business. Patrick Davitt : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Kenneth Lee with RBC Capital Markets. You may go ahead. Kenneth Lee : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just a follow-up on the AUM breakage. Wondering what key factors drove the updated thoughts for being meaningful less the $10 billion? Was it just the transition of the state of New Mexico or was there anything else? Loren Starr : So I think we announced some changes around our portfolio teams with respect to Oppenheimer and Invesco as we brought the two firms together. And again, it was relatively minor in terms of kind of the overlap as we had hinted. But now that we've sort of fully got our arms around that, the impacted assets are really not large and so when we think about fee breakage due to those changes, the $10 billion is well in excess of what is reasonable to think about. So it's really just understanding what ultimately, we're able to do around those investment teams and ultimately there'll be a follow-up impact on some products in terms of mergers of products and product rationalization. But the overall impact of AUM is not large. Kenneth Lee : Okay, great. And then just one follow-up; in terms of the alternatives AUM, wondering what key factors drove the outflows there. I think you mentioned in the past there were some elevated outflows in the GTR product. Just wondering whether you still saw that in this quarter? And if so, could you give us a sense of what fund flows were in alternatives, excluding the GTR? Thanks. Loren Starr : So it actually wasn't GTR, it was mostly the senior bank loan. So that was a massive outflow industry-wide where obviously large. It was about $2.3 billion of outflow for our senior loan business across the ETFs and the actively traded accounts. GTR was $1.3 billion out. So there was something there, but it was not the biggest piece and ultimately, I think GTR flow picture is not one that we are hugely concerned about. There has been some strong improvement year-to-date on the performance, I mean even though it's underperforming on a three-year basis. It actually performed extremely well in some of the most volatile months, doing exactly what it was supposed to do in terms of protecting downside. So we feel reasonably good about protecting the GTR franchise and not seen it so to continue to be a source of significant outflow. Kenneth Lee : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. You may go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Good morning guys, thanks for taking the question. Loren, I think you had said that 41.2 to 41.5 basis points is the updated expectation for the revenue yield. Does that replace the previous 41.5 and it's just like you guys have a little more granular detail on it now? And so that's why there is an update and why would that rate move up from 3Q, just overall that's a little confusing to me? Loren Starr : So I think what I was looking at was net revenue yield. So excluding performance fees, it's probably more flat when you think about where the timing is. So you can think about somewhere between sort of 41, as I mentioned 41.2, 41.5 just kind of the 41.5 pickup is just the performance fee impact, which is again are normally sort of weird and lame approach to and forecasted performance fees, which is not very accurate. Brennan Hawken : Okay. So the 41.2 to 41.5 is not fee revenue ex-performance fees, but it's all in fee revenue? Loren Starr : The all-in fee revenue, yes. Brennan Hawken : Okay, got it. So when we look at it like-for-like versus the previous because I think the 41.5 that you guys gave last time was for run rate fee revenue ex-performance fees. So is -- Loren Starr : Right. So again, we've had some outflow. We've said we've had some mixed dynamics that worked against us. So this is kind of where we're landing right now based on today. Brennan Hawken : Okay, I got it. That's helpful. And then just definitionally understanding some of the deal related breakage in the $10 billion that you guys updated. Is this just when a client indicates that the reason, they are redeeming is due to the deal and therefore it's sort of a high bar to clear in order to get that notification because it certainly seems like from the outside. And if you guys if I'm misunderstanding this, I'd love to hear clarification, but it definitely feels like flows have deteriorated since the deal got announced, it feels like that I recognize 4Q was really tough and volatile and it's been a tough time, but it also feels like especially versus where the run rate was previously on an asset-flow basis it's deteriorated and so isn't some of that probably deal related and the clients just aren't telling you? Maybe you could help me understand that a bit. Loren Starr : I mean this is impossible to really know. But we look at our outflows relative to the industry outflows and we try to explain how much of the outflow is due to the industry. We also obviously look at our performance and we can explain some of the outflow due to performance. We can explain 80% to 90% of the outflows we're seeing in the Oppenheimer deal due to industry flows and due to performance. So we're not having to attribute nor is it fair to attribute it to the deal. Again, if anyone tells us it's still related, we'll put it into that $10 billion. But we do think that mostly what is happening is due to industry kind of outflows and the performance on certain key large products. Brennan Hawken : Okay, thanks for that. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. This is actually Brian [ph] filling in for Alex. Marty. I wanted to come back to your comments around the divergence between margins and fee rates and how flows into ETFs are actually supportive of the incremental margin. Can you give us sort of similar color around the margin impact for back to the equity book and the active alternative book because I think what we're trying to do from our seats is marry the idea that if you have outflows from what we would, what we see as higher fee buckets. What impact that would have on the margin. Loren Starr : Yes, I can answer that Brian. It is actually very similar. I think there is always been this perception that lower fee rate products must mean lower margin, I mean that's been sort of the knee jerk on most people when they were bemoaning the dropping fee rate. But the reality is the incremental margin if you are able to grow off an existing portfolio team, I mean, you're not having to add a lot of resources to be able to do that. So the economics are similarly excellence and higher than the firms overall average. So as long as we can sort of grow assets both in active and passive, we're going to see the fee rate and the incremental margins in that 50% to 65% range. I mean again it varies a little bit tend to team region to region, but overall, it's fair to say that it's very similar. Unidentified Analyst : Got it, okay. And then maybe just one more. We've talked a fair amount about the UK business but if you could come back to that for a second there feels like now all of a sudden there is potential for increased regulatory pressure there potentially around some of maybe the way funds are structured, can you give us a little bit of color on what's been the potential impact on your fund flows for the quarter, particularly in UK. And then if any of that was related to some of the issues that were also associated with funds. Martin Flanagan : No. Look I, we don't see that sort of conversation about the regulatory where it might end up is impacting our flows. I mean it was really has been as we spoke previously its risk-off environment and people in particular hate UK equities just with Brexit overhang and again what we see is the real opportunity for us in the UK. It's a very important market for us. We will continue to be. There have been obviously important headwinds because of Brexit and as we've said we really saw come to light just really last year. It's real in the marketplace and that's where the reactions are, but again I think what we've done, our competitive position with Intelliflo and the impact on flows now it's going to probably kick-in much more Q1 next year, but we'll start to see probably in Q4 beginning of inflows through various models on [indiscernible]. Again, it just puts us in a very different place competitively than the other organizations we compete with there. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead. Brian Bedell : Great, thanks very much for taking my question. Maybe, if I could just go back to the Oppenheimer flow situation really from the sales side in terms of just the trajectory of what you're doing there and if whether we can see that potentially reversing the outflows. And if you can talk a little bit about the distribution, actually the sales force; just the size of that sales force now versus before the deal. How much that's expanded and whether there's been any change in composition either across geography footprint or greater strength in any particular distribution channel and then the status of the work on launching the Oppenheimer products institutionally as well as listing in Europe? Martin Flanagan : Let me start. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we anticipate the retail products be available outside the United States in October. Institutionally, we're just going through, we call market readiness right now with a number of the Oppenheimer teams. So we'll be in market very shortly. Here already there's been some meetings out in Asia with the teams. So that's all underway. I'll make a comment and Loren speak more specifically of the size. But the US retail distribution force as I said, it's the most talented group of individuals that I've ever been associated with. They're very focused at in-market and focusing on different channels and what we had in the past. Within it, high net worth being one of the areas and again, we just think we're positioned very strongly in that market. Loren Starr : Yes. I mean I'd say, I mean, it's been a huge effort, obviously the amount of training that had to happen, it has been significant. I mean there have been tens of thousands of hours of busy person and sort of training to get everyone up to speed on the products and the regions and kind of how things work in the combined organization. There has been significant work on the brand and sort of positioning and the digital campaigns with respect to our products and having people understand the combined organization versus the two what it was previously as two separate ones and we are beginning to really get real connection with placements and investment wins, particularly where consultants historically had missed the opportunities of previous firms because of the gaps we had in product capability, combined we have now sort of the full set of capabilities. So again, I think it's still as we said early days and so we really think we're going to see the ability to grow our sales number off of maybe what you see as a second quarter level. Just how successful we're going to be is, we'll see it when we see it. But we do think it's material and we do think that there is far more upside off of the levels that we're currently seeing. In terms of the other part that we're very excited about is the European opportunity, those products. I think we're ready to go at the end of September, sometime in September. So that's something that you will actually begin to see some activity in flows coming off of those products, hopefully this year. Brian Bedell : And how big is the sales force increase and the wholesale in fact? Loren Starr : Just, I mean it was a modest increase. I think there was some change in composition with more use of hybrid sort of crossing between regional and I'm sorry, internal and external or where the hybrids are coming in, but I mean there wasn't a dramatic increase in the net side, it was really just the talent and the skill-set of the people that we retained. Brian Bedell : Okay. And then maybe just lastly Marty on, just your view on the [indiscernible] active non-transparent ETF. Maybe first of all, just holistically what you think of the ability for that product? Do you significantly help active flows for the industry and then you're in position at Invesco, whether you're ready to launch those products as early as by year-end or early next year? Martin Flanagan : Yes. Look, I think the excitement around it is ahead of the reality of the impact and I think you're starting to pick that up. I think it's a very interesting vehicle and again we will be willing to participate in our own way in that. But we don't anticipate it being frankly a big change in the industry anytime soon. Brian Bedell : Okay, fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead. Michael Cyprys : Good morning, thanks for squeezing me again. Just wanted to circle back on some of your commentary around retail solutions. I guess maybe more broadly as you think about retail solutions, model portfolios, Jemstep, Intelliflo, if you could just update us today on how meaningful those are in terms of AUM flows and revenue at Invesco? What the pipeline looks like and can you talk about some of the actions that you're taking over the next six to 12 months for those initiatives to accelerate? Martin Flanagan : Yes. So let me start with Jemstep. So still main channel focused, we're now -- as I've said in the past it's literally an application, but you install it literally is integrated into the client's infrastructure, so it does take longer to do that. So that's starting to happen right now. We're anticipating probably into next year when we'll start to see something more material there. Intelliflo is further ahead, 35% market share in the United Kingdom between and telephone Jemstep. There are opportunities outside of the United States and the UK that we're looking at right now. So again, I would say 2020 you're going to start to see flow impact from the combination of those two. Loren Starr : I mean, so most of the revenues are coming from Intelliflo. It's showing up in our service and distribution fee revenue line. I mean, so those numbers are becoming larger as the business is growing $10 million plus kind of levels. It is one that we have not really used this NPS capability out where you could actually see Invesco products find their way in these model portfolios. The total AUM for Intelliflo is about $450 billion in assets right now and it continues to grow just in the UK. So obviously the impact for us being successful with that activity would be material in terms of assets under management and revenues. So there is a reason to be excited about how this is going to go up. Michael Cyprys : Okay, great. And just as a quick follow-up on the MassMutual relationship bump. What sort of conversation and dialog are you having with MassMutual regarding the cross marketing and synergies from that relationship? And in your view what would successful look like say three years from now with respect to that relationship in the revenue synergies, how meaningful? Martin Flanagan : Yes, very strong relationships and the teams are -- both teams are working very diligently and probably half a dozen different initiatives right now. They range from the obvious with their sales force of 8,500 here in the United States and opportunities they are co-product development things in the general account we're having a conversation with and also looking at there is some related things we can do with their insurance capabilities and our money management capabilities. So we're well into it and how big could it be, we'll just have to see, but they're a great partner and they are actually dedicated to success of between the two organizations and frankly very excited about it. You'll hear more specifics in a not too distant future. Michael Cyprys : Great, thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Robert Lee with KBW. You may go ahead. Robert Lee : I just want to talk a little bit about the leveraging of Oppenheimer. I know historically mutual fund track records management haven't really translated into the institutional business or the SMA business. So I mean how do you feel about the extend you're trying to leverage that platform through other channels. I mean is it really trends that transferable to other strategies and other markets or where do you think the do you thinking that the real leverage is a kind of retail outside the US? Martin Flanagan : No, not just retail. I think what has our experience been and things that will transfer be successful. It really depends on the long-term track records, but really not just that, but the asset class itself. And as I was saying that from the beginning of this, if you look at the capabilities that came over, they are in-demand capabilities. So they have a got a great global equity capability. Global equity is not that attractive here in the United States. Outside of the United States, it's very attractive at the institutional level. And that is one of the areas we're having conversations. There is emerging markets equity, emerging markets debts to other areas where there's institutional demand. And frankly, there's not enough high quality managers in those areas. And so if you look at the combined firm right now, we're very, very strong in emerging market equity. Obviously, we're one of the most important franchises in the industry there. You look at things if you want to get sort of basically have the bank loan capabilities with ours. It is arguably the top in the industry and those are things that are not just in the United States, but outside of the United States, too. So you really have to look at, we keep talking about the makeup of the asset classes that came over. There are really important asset classes that many institutions are interested in them also and not just the retail channel outside of the States. So again for us if it's going to happen it's just when is it going to happen and just from my past experience, we're further ahead than we've ever been in the combination. And at this time, we're literally in market trying to make things happen where more often than not, you don't start something like that till six months after closing a combination of size. So I can't tell you what quarter we're going to start to see the flows, but we've done everything possible to be in market making impact right now. Robert Lee : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. You may go ahead. Chris Harris : Thanks guys. If we look at retail investor behavior here in the US, as you know the stock market has gone up a lot, but equity flows in the industry are pretty weak, as you know, a lot of flows going into bonds. And your judgment why our investors behaving this way and really more importantly is your commentary about US sales picking up predicated on investors increasing their risk appetite from here? Martin Flanagan : Let me hit the last. So, no, it's not predicated on investors changing their appetite. I didn't say that simply because of the depth and breadth of our capabilities. There are very few asset classes that we don't have strong capabilities and so regardless of market, yes that's a topic. You're asking the very important question of what's happening, why our investors stayed away from US equities probably in particular. Look, it's 10 years after the market bottom, I still think investors have been -- retail investors in particular focused on cap weighted indexes. Quite frankly, I think they have too much exposure to it and retail investors that is and you saw what happened in Q4 last year and I think you just again have to look at the narrowness of the equity market and the difference in the value growth trade and that's really where the money is going right now and that is we've said and I'm sure you have too. We hope retail investors understand what they own. It will change and but when will it change, probably after correction in my investment. Operator : And that was the last question. Martin Flanagan : Okay, thank you everybody for the questions and I look forward talking to you next quarter. Have a good rest of the day. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. All participants may disconnect. Thank you for your participation.",

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures may be found at the end of our earnings presentation. Operator : Welcome to Invesco's Third Quarter Results Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]  Now I would like to turn the call over to your speakers for today, Marty Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer; and Greg McGreevey, Senior Managing Director, Investments. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin. Marty Flanagan : Thank you very much, and thank you, everybody, for joining us. The Q3 presentation is available on the website for your reference. But to allow more time for Q&A, we're going to shorten our prepared remarks and really get the questions quite quickly. So I'll just give a brief overview of the results and Loren make a couple of comments, and again, we'll get the questions, so we\u2019ll have more time to have a discussion. So now only four months post the close of the acquisition of Oppenheimer made tremendous progress, bringing the two organizations together, and you can see by this quarter it's generating meaningful results already. As we've discussed on previous calls, we do look at this as a multiyear growth story that people's relationships in the U.S. provides this capabilities to take around the world, while also creative skills for organization. That said, the first full quarter of the combined organization has delivered powerful results.  If you look at very strong earnings quarter-over-quarter generating $502 million operating income at 38% improvements as compared to last quarter. Operating margin expansion exceeding 500 basis points, taking our margin up to 40.9%. The combined firm added $200 million net revenues during the quarter, while adding only less than $60 million in expenses. And we're particularly pleased to announce that we're bringing on our expense synergies well ahead of schedule and exceeding our initial target of $475 million. We are now estimating savings of $501 million.  Importantly, we achieved these results and what was a very challenging macroenvironmental flows and also been the early days this combination between our two organizations. During the quarter, clients reacted to the market news by keep risking, which resulted in outflows in our Americas and UK retail businesses. Flows in our legacy or byproducts low during the quarter, which we had expected, but they are stabilizing. We will speak about that in a couple of minutes.  These outflows were offset by positive flows in China, EMEA, ex-U.K. business and ETFs. So the positive flows during the quarter really demonstrate the tremendous strength and potential to combination. Furthermore, the operating and financial strength of the combined firm enable us to return $440 million to common shareholders during the quarter through dividends and stock buybacks. So finally, it is still very early days, but from our perspective, the initial results are very strong. Loren? Loren Starr : Great. Thanks, Marty. So before we get to Q&A, I wanted to spend a few moments highlighting some key items for you on the topics of flows and expense synergies, resulting from the Oppenheimer transaction.  So if you look to Page 5 or Slide 5, we had $10.5 billion of net outflows in the Americas, majority of this is attributable to the retail business. On the next page, we drilled down on this a little more.  So on Slide 6, we show that 2019 history of monthly gross sales and net flows for the Invesco and Oppenheimer U.S. active, retail products combined, which includes periods of both pre and post-close. It has had another way, this illustrates the trend for the two firms together over the entire period, including the pre-acquisition period. I think there are few important takeaways from this chart. First, gross sales post-close are increasing, we see a positive trend line. However, while gross sales are improving, they\u2019re not yet to the pre-deal level. So there is obviously more room for improvement. Second, the chart clearly highlights that the deal has had an impact on our gross sales levels. Integration of two sales team are well underway, and in fact, going quite well, but they\u2019re not yet complete. And as the integration is completed, we would expect the gross sales levels to come back to at least the pre-acquisition levels. And, third point, net outflows have been more elevated post-close. But this is largely a function of the abnormally low gross sales level I just mentioned. And we\u2019d expect net flows to improve as we complete all phases of the sales integration work through this year and into 2020. While staying on the topic of flows but moving away from U.S. retail, I\u2019d like to point out that we continue to see a strong institutional pipeline. The institutional won but not funded AUM continues to build quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. And in particular notes, we were notified this quarter of $10 billion mandate, won by our solutions team, which is expected to fund in the first half of 2020. Also, we received notification of a recent $100 million when into the newly launched OFI emerging markets local debt fund on our cross-border fund range in EMEA. It\u2019s still very early days, but we\u2019re beginning to see revenue synergies from the deal. There is strong retail and institutional interest in the OFI products and the pipeline is warming. The next \u2013 let me move to the topic of expense synergies. If you\u2019ll recall, we have been projecting to achieve run rate net expense synergies of $475 million by the end of the first quarter of 2021. At the end of the third quarter, we achieved 105% of our synergy target or $501 million of run rate expense reductions for the combined organizations. This represents an elimination of 15% to the expense base of the pre-combined organizations. We already saw that the opportunity to stay more than $475 million by the time of the transaction closing, we only had a clear line of sight, regarding the $475 million in savings. After we closed the deal, we were able to look deeper into the business and we started making significant progress on the integration. And we now see that we can run the business with this slower expense base. There is still further integration work to be completed, but we\u2019re confident that we can deliver the higher level of expense synergy that we\u2019re presenting to you today. And as a reminder, the synergy level is net of investments made in areas that further strengthen our distribution and investment capabilities and processes and which allow us to drive future growth and avoid future cost. We presented on Slide 9 of our deck summarizing these expense synergies, this illustrates the combined firms\u2019 representative run rate, annual operating expense base. But please do keep in mind that this assumes FX and market conditions are in line roughly with the end of Q3 levels. So in summary, before we go to Q&A, let met just say that we see the potential for the long-term net flows to trend in the right direction, although that clearly not where we want them to be right now. One of the key areas of outflows we\u2019re experiencing is centered in U.S. retail space and that is largely due to the shortfall and gross sales that we expect will ultimately be corrected. And as the U.S. retail sales teams complete their integration. We continue to work hard managing the things within our control, improving gross sales, funding greater expense savings and adding to our deal-related expense and revenue synergies, and continuing to invest in areas that we believe will allow us to grow more quickly in the future. And with that, operator, I\u2019d ask you to please open up the call for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We do have our first question from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning. Marty Flanagan : Good morning. Ken Worthington : Can you first talk about the journey back to positive long-term net sales? So a positive net long-term sales, something you foresee for Invesco in 2020? And if not, 2020, when? And then, can you maybe describe the path to positive sales, which new or existing products or asset classes do you see driving the incrementally better sales or incrementally lower outflows that we\u2019re seeing today, the more specifically, you could be the better? And then why? Marty Flanagan : Good question, Ken. Let me hit a couple of those and I\u2019ll ask Loren and Greg to pitch in, too. So let's say on the what Loren was pointed out about the deal because I think it's actually quite critical. The \u2013 to put sales force point in clarity as we've said in the past, literally the sales force now represents half of old Invesco, old OFI. They're literally going through training right now.  We actually as you always do have disruption when you do transfer agency conversions in the like, they'll probably be up and running, I'd say fully into December, so I think early next year. And the quality of the team is the best we've ever had. So we've viewed that the historical gross sales. We will exceed those that will be, so when does that happen into next year, that will surely happen, ideally on the first half of next year from our perspective. Again, I'd put it in the context of Loren date of the \u2013 it all depends on the market, but with this market continues, that's what we foresee. Loren Starr : Yes. I think in terms of the path to positive, so we're clearly saying we're going to become look like that's where really we're saying because of the sales improving. I think the path to positive is going to be a function of some other things that are \u2013 some within our control and some without of our control. So one thing that is still very much weighing on our flow picture for the firm globally is sort of just the macro environment and some of the political uncertainty that exists, where we see risk off, it's affecting everybody.  And so in Europe for example, that risk off behaviors drove driven flows into cash and in a way from active products. And that's something that we can control, but we're definitely looking to see hopefully some of these events becoming more clear, Brexit being the most obvious one. The other element that I think is moving in a positive direction and is an important precursor to flows is performance.  And we've had some headwinds around performance that we're beginning to see sort of a turnaround and particularly in sort of recent months where you can see just how strong the comeback or the pullback in performances when we see some release on some of these macro topics for example, what we're seeing in terms of what's going on in Europe and the UK has a big impact on our UK business. I think Greg, I mean, you can speak to that a little bit if you want. Greg McGreevey : Yes. Maybe can just to get a little granular to the essence of your question. So it's that intersection between demand and performance. Maybe point to kind of four or five areas to get to the specific question that you asked on. One would be fixed income, where as you know, we have very strong performance. We're seeing quite strong demand in almost all markets. Part of the transaction that we talked about before with Oppenheimer was to really leverage their global equity capability, which is incredibly strong. There's quite strong demand for global equities and its various flavors in a lot of markets outside of the U.S. And so we're seeing that, I think ETFs and the traction that Loren kind of mentioned with this when we're going to hopefully see in the first quarter and when it farms in solutions. We're seeing that traction really take shape in almost kind of all markets, if you will. And then global liquidity, that was kind of mentioned as one of those areas, not only in China that we talked about on prior calls, but we're just kind of seeing that in other markets.  So that's really for I think the gross sales side and where that demand and performance, where we have that strong performance kind of intersects. Clearly, we're seeing some \u2013 on the redemption side, some important performance improvements in a number of those funds that have had the most significant amount of outflows. I'm happy to drill into those numbers, but I think on a year-to-date basis, which is still short-term for most of our funds, both here with the legacy Oppenheimer, we're seeing some notable improvement that has to continue. But if we see that in concert with those things that I talked about, that's really how I think we get to the positive flow picture. Ken Worthington : Okay, thank you. And then on the synergies, can you talk about the outlook from here both synergies and dis-synergies? So maybe starting with dis-synergies, I believe there's still a 529 plan outflow. I think that's a fourth quarter event. Correct me if I'm wrong. Any other deal related dis-synergies that we should expect in the near-term.  And then on the cost side, you took out $501 million. Is that the end number we should expect? In other words, if you get more, do you are reinvested? Are you going to reinvest some of the $501 million? And if not, any idea on how much more we'll be able \u2013 shareholders will be able to keep that wouldn't be reinvested. Loren Starr : So Ken, on the first point that the synergies, you're correct, there's the $2 billion New Mexico outflow that is to be expected in the fourth quarter. That has been dis-synergy. The only other dis-synergies are the ones we just talked about in terms of the gross sales being abnormally low, some of the kind of a general disruption related to GA conversions. I mean those have been dis-synergies to the flow picture that should end. We're seeing begin to improve overtime, but there isn't anything else that we know of in terms of dis-synergy, and if anything, again, we're seeing more positive revenue synergies that take on potential for the products in the C Caps in Europe for example is a good real live flow coming in. In terms of the $501 million, that number is net of investments. So that is the number that we are saying you're going to get. There is no intention for us to invest through that number. So that's the bottom line. There are more opportunities for us to sort of generate more synergies. We believe some of that may get invested, some may drop to the bottom line. We're at this point comfortable with the $501 million. And we will continue to keep you updated in terms of the potential upside on that number. Ken Worthington : Thank you very much. Marty Flanagan : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is open. Mike Carrier : Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. First one just on the sales and the flows, I think Marty, you mentioned over the past, probably one to two years, there's been some negative impacts the business, whether it was Brexit and some of the European headwinds and then on the value side versus growth, that being the headwind. It seems like some of those things are at least starting to potentially like shift gear. But just wondering if you're seeing any early signs some like improvement on that front. Marty Flanagan : Yes. So look what we think are fundamental strengths of our organization. So I think EMEA, I think Asia-Pac, Brexit and trade wars, they have just tremendous headwinds for us and against, so posting results in light of that, it's not an excuse, it's just a reality. We are sensing with Brexit in particular, certainly end game coming here \u2013 like to starting to see just recently the performance is starting to pick up very strongly, which is a very good sign.  And so again they say hope is not a strategy, but you definitely are sensing some relief here. And look, we have Sterling being at, what is it 120, 129 is a whole lot different than 119. So again some of these \u2013 be able to continue to manage through it, but any relief is just really powerful. They get on a few anything in the performance. Greg McGreevey : Yes. My quick, I think the rotation is starting to happen from a growth to value. The market's starting to recognize, but not all companies are the same. Some make better capital allocation and are able to produce different returns on investment. So we're starting to see probably the most impactful thing is a lower correlation of stocks to the index. And that really gives our active managers, the ability to use their strong stock picking skills. And so I think that's part of the reason when we kind of look at our year-to-date performance improvement, it's really the result of some of those factors that has kind of allowed our performance to improve the $64,000 question is always, is that going to continue?  The one thing we know is, it's not going to continue forever in terms of what we've seen over the course of the last 10 years. So it gives us some comfort that when this does change, given the strong teams that we have, we'll be able to generate the performance that you've come to expect. Mike Carrier : Okay, thanks. And then Loren, maybe just on the fee rate, so you got to bump this quarter with Oppenheimer, the trend over the past couple of years has been a little bit more on the negative side. You've just given the expansion on the ETF front and then the industry is seeing some pricing pressures. There's some news on FMAs that that's coming under pressure as well on some platforms. But just when you look at some of the investments that you guys are making and now with Oppenheimer, on the platform, I know it's tough to predict, but do you see some areas that yes, like higher fee, like momentum or trends versus some of the areas that are going to pressure that fee rate overtime. Is any update on how you're thinking about that and then managing expenses with that mind? Loren Starr : So it's a very dynamic, there are a lot of puts and takes in the fee rate. There are some definitely some positive things in our fee rate. In terms of we've talked about in the past with our institutional pipeline, where the assets that are funding are in a higher fee rates in the assets declining. We continue to build out I think a strong set of capabilities around alternatives, which tend to have a higher fee rates and aren't going to be sort of pressured by indexing.  We are also very supportive and like our ETF business and we want to continue to grow it. And so those are coming in at lower fee rates and that is a good thing for us. They are great margin products as long as you can grow them quickly and sort of great scale and those products, we embrace that phenomenon and want to grow that part of the book. I think it is very hard to provide guidance on this measure just in general. And really there's just so much that's outside of our control in terms of the mix of products not to mention currency in markets. So we're probably not in a great position or we're probably more likely to refrain on providing guidance on fee rate going forward just because it is so dynamic. But I would say it's a real even fight in terms of the things that are sort of helping us on the fee rate on the positive side versus things that may be putting it to the flip side. Mike Carrier : Okay. Thanks a lot. Loren Starr : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brian Bedell : Great, thanks. Good morning, folks. Maybe if I'm wondering if you could just go into just the integration process and you realize obviously you've hit the $500 million of cost, but like you said there's definitely so more work to do. It's still pretty early. Maybe just can you outline what types of things are being done over the next couple quarters? For example, the any kind of back office arrangement on custody fund accounting in mid-office if that's in process for the combined organization, in any thoughts on how much product rationalization has contributed to the $500 million and in any future rationalization that might be planned from that? Marty Flanagan : Let me hit a couple of things and then Loren and Greg can pitch in. So yes, so all the systems have converted over to our systems from Oppenheimer. So that's a good development. We still have with the transfer agency, one more software upgrade that will happen at the end of November, all the middle and back office will end up converting through next year again. So still I think first quarter 2021, as we said. So that's in progress too. And those are the areas where we'll know more when we get in \u2013 further into it, but that's all underway right now. Loren Starr : Yes. I think listen, it's the fund mergers and those types of product rationalizations have not happened yet. So that's not part of inherently the $501 million. There may be some sort of incremental savings associated that there's probably some incremental investments as well, that we're hoping to do. So I'd say really it is \u2013 the $501 million is a number that we feel extremely confident that we'll be able to deliver through a variety, they are right now. We are going to continue to look at some of the other integration opportunities really around tech, run operations as well. Some \u2013 there's all sorts of efficiencies that we can still continue to create in our sales efforts, as well as our investment efforts. So I can't get too specific at this point, but ultimately, we're still looking at the wide range of opportunities around this integration as we get closer to the business. Marty Flanagan : I do want to come back to the product rationalization, think of, it's a small thing, not a big thing. And I think I've spent some overreaction to it in the past. So it's a small thing, not a big thing, just remember that. Greg McGreevey : Yes. Maybe just to put a finer point on that, Marty, I mean, I think when you look at the impacted assets, we think it's around 2% of our total assets, roughly 14 legacy, Invesco maybe 15 OppenheimerFunds. So we're not in the grand scheme of our whole product mix. It's really a both small percentage of funds, and if even smaller percentage of assets. Brian Bedell : That color is really helpful. Is it clear to think that operating margin obviously is going up from the 40% that we're already seeing, because there's sounds like there'll be incremental savings of course, revenue dependent. But maybe just also talk about the growth sale initiatives and the potential to improve that from even levels before the deal, to what extent can you do that through the institutional offering of the Oppenheimer products in the potential sale of Oppenheimer retail in Europe. And I guess any color for $10 billion mandate on the solutions team in terms of what disciplines that's coming in? Marty Flanagan : Yes, so look, I could be repeating myself, but there's nothing we are full steam ahead on driving gross sales right now. And I said previously, if you look at the most acute area where there was disruption, it was a U.S. wealth management platform. We think January 1st, we'll be on our front feet and full steam ahead and we anticipate seeing higher gross sales on the back of that. Greg mentioned, we do now have alarming here. We do now have six OppenheimerFunds on the C Cap range to set road shows in Europe for two weeks ago, so early days. But as Loren said, I think we saw already $100 million, it's not going to change our world, but that's very, very fast and it's going to continue. So what we're seeing institutionally is, I talked about lot going on a fixed income, lot going on a real estate. So that really the also part of the business continues to be in high demand institutionally and to looking for some opportunities in the retail channel. So we're very excited about what's in front of us. Loren Starr : Yes. And I think we also haven't yet fully sort of explored the full opportunity with MassMutual and there the revenue synergies working with their advisors. Again as we've talked in the past they have 8,500 advisors. They're the seventh largest distribution for us in wealth management space. And so we are now actively working with MassMutual with our products and our solutions that we trying to understand what is a good fit within their network. That has yet to sort of get plugged in. So that we'll provide some further lift that was not there pre-deal for any of the combined firms just as an example. Marty Flanagan : And again, we've not talked about as we really like our position in China and we just see that rapidly growing in the quarters and years ahead. Greg McGreevey : Yes. And I think this relates to Oppenheimer, maybe you can just put a finer point on, one of the biggest opportunities we see is to promote the legacy OppenheimerFunds into both retail and institutional channels. We've been spending a lot of time post the merger between investments marketing and distribution. Those would be things like our global equity suite, things on the global fixed income side, muni bonds to mention kind of three very specific areas. And so we're optimistic, it's still kind of early days, but we really come together across those three areas to see again and that intersection between demand and where we have investment capabilities, so where we're going to be able to get out to prospects and clients. Loren Starr : And Brian just on the color on the $10 billion solutions when it's not a appropriate for us to talk about, it\u2019s just the client has not sort of released their own notification of that. So when it comes public, we'll be able to talk a little bit more about that deal. Brian Bedell : Okay, fair enough. Thanks for all the details. That\u2019s very helpful. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Ryan Bailey : Good morning. This is actually Ryan Bailey on behalf of Alex. I was wondering going back to Slide 9, if we're looking at that $2.9 billion number. Is that the right run rate, I guess as we should be thinking about the expense base entering 2020? And then are there any puts and takes in that number? And then maybe coming back to the $501 million, that's a net synergy number. Can you give us a little bit of color around like maybe how much investments would be included in the gross number, and then where those investments are going? Greg McGreevey : Yes. So on the $2.905 billion that is the right run rate for you to be assuming going into through 2020. We feel confident, again, assuming kind of markets flat to September and effects that that number is definitely achievable, if not \u2013 if one that we can do better on. In terms of their $501 million that is a net number, there is about $30 million of investment that is already been done relative to the Oppenheimer transaction.  So you can think about our gross number being closer to $531 million. And so the $501 million, and those have been areas that where we invested around technology, sort of their sales team effectiveness, really again trying to create a better platform for WMI business to be successful. We do think there's opportunity for us to invest more and we do plan to invest more to continue to grow and make our team more effective. That will be some \u2013 will be entirely funded by further sort of integration or savings. But with that said, there is opportunity for us to deliver more net synergies to the bottom line beyond the $501 million. We believe, but we're not at the point where we're able to commit to that. Ryan Bailey : Got it, okay. And then maybe if we turn to capital for a second, so you've done two forwards over the last two quarters. It's about $500 million, it sounds like you're \u2013 you have to pay out between sort of 1Q and 2Q 2021. Do you expect to do any more of these over the next call or year or so? And then is there any shift in capital priorities overall? Greg McGreevey : Good question. The answer is no. We don't intend to do any more forwards at this stage. We think that we will still be doing buybacks, but there's only $260 million left on the remainders stub of what our commitment is. And that's one that a commitment that we think we can complete over through open market purchases easily and effectively without using foreign purchases. So that is going to be done, probably through the course of 2020. The \u2013 in terms of changes to capital priority, there are no changes to the capitol priority. We continue to focus on first returning capital to organic needs, through seed is not seeing significant needs around seed above and beyond expectations. So we think that is largely sort of status quo. We want to continue to be able to grow our dividends every year under our markets. And so that's still part of our priority. And then the remainder of capital will be returned to shareholders through buybacks. So that priority is still exists. I will say that we still is very important to us to maintain our investment credit rating and we also want to continue to build cash. So we have $1 billion of cash in excess of what is required from a regulatory perspective. All that is consistent with our past priorities and all are still intact in terms of our thinking. Ryan Bailey : Got it. Thank you very much. Greg McGreevey : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow-up on that last one on the expense comment on the $2.905 billion. Loren, I just wanted to kind of clarify, because previously you guys had walked through the synergy, the expense synergy quarter by quarter, and you've upsized the ultimate target. So $475 million goes to $501 million that's really clear. It clear that your end run rate for expenses would be the $2.905 billion. But I thought in your response to the prior question, you said that that the $2.905 billion would be the run rate entering in 2020, but I'd thought previously you had said the expense synergies you get there by the time you exit 1Q 2021. Is that \u2013 is the previous timeline still intact or you accelerating the timeline too? Marty Flanagan : We are accelerating the timeline. So we're delivering the full synergies, 105% of the synergies effective this quarter, so pretty much all that kind of wait for it to come has gone. We can declare victory effectively in terms of bringing you that run rate effective this quarter. I think the point that we're trying to make, or I've been making that there's still integration work happening in the background, but we are getting the synergies and those savings effective this quarter into Q4 into \u2013 first quarter 2020 so far. So that that is hopefully it helps answer your question. Brennan Hawken : It does. It's very clear. Thank you. Sorry if that's a \u2013 if it was redundant and previously indicated, I just wanted to clarify. Marty Flanagan : No need to worry. Brennan Hawken : Yes, agreed. Good and helpful. So there was previously referenced the announcement we got recently from Wirehouse expected to launch a program optional for participating asset managers on SMA products. Is this a sort of product that you think would be compelling? I know that a lot of times on the shelf having a \u2013 you got to have a good product, it's got to be the performance has to be strong, the value add has to be clear, but it also has to be at a compelling value, a compelling fee rate, especially versus the peers. So is this the sort of program while not \u2013 maybe not commenting specific to any program, because I know you wouldn't want to do that until then front run. But is this a sort of program that you think would be compelling? Is this a sort of program that you think you would participate in? And do you think it would help accelerate your sales in that important broker sold channel for you? Thanks. Loren Starr : Yes. So Brennan I think just to put some context in terms of the SMA business generally, we're currently ranked 36 in the industry. So it's not a big part of our business. We have sort of under $10 billion in overall SMA business. I think related to that particular platform that you're talking about our exposures probably less than $0.5 billion. So it\u2019s not a big deal for us, just in general. We did see it. It is little too early for us to say just how interesting and attractive, it might be for us. There is definitely some potential upside but also some things that we have to get an understanding before we said it would be interesting for us to participate. And\u2026 Marty Flanagan : Yes. And I just add, just listening to our conversation today, we just have so many opportunities in different channels to work in, within the United States retail institutional globally and our focus continues to be there. And that\u2019s where we see the excitement and really what\u2019s going to be the force behind, you can see the growth of the organization. So, again, we have plenty to work with what\u2019s on our plate right now. Brennan Hawken : All right, fair enough. Thanks for taking my questions. Marty Flanagan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Patrick Davitt : Hey, good morning guys. Thank you. Another one on the $2.9 billion run rate, understanding that\u2019s kind of a baseline for 2020. Should we\u2019d still assume \u2013 to the extent, we assume asset inflation in our models, some upside to that with kind of normal increase in expenses related to asset build. Or is that really kind of what you think it will be and can go lower from there? Loren Starr : Yes. So I think we made a caveat, which is that\u2019s based on sort of assets based on September AUM, as we saw a huge market up tick, there\u2019s definitely some amount of variability in our incentive plans that would scale up, which is what we \u2013 you\u2019d expect. Similarly, as we saw a down market, we would also sort of see that flex down. So there\u2019s normal kind of variability that would happen around incentive plans. But, ultimately, there is no \u2013 you should not expect to any sort of hidden inflation numbers into 2020 on this number at all. This number, we\u2019re feeling is comfortable based on the current AUM levels. Patrick Davitt : Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful, thanks. And then when you announced the deal, you kind of announced an expectation of, I think 2 basis points of revenue yield deterioration from breakage. Is that related to the rationalization process? So we should still expect that when you do rationalize or is that something separate? Loren Starr : That is something that would include the potential for breakage with those rationalizations. And again, that was $45 million. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be anywhere near that amount, as I think it was already discussed. It\u2019s a small number of amounts of products or assets in general. So I think as I\u2019 mentioned in the past, that $45 million could be an upside to the overall modeling and the fee rate deterioration that we\u2019ve provided in terms of deal economics. Operator : Does that conclude your question, Patrick? Patrick Davitt : Yes, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Katz with Citi. Your line is open. Bill Katz : Okay. Thank you very much for taking the questions. Fortunate, I do want to spend on more time on this $2.9 billion, because I\u2019m still actually a little confused by it, so I apologize, but my denseness. So is there enough synergies go forward from here that could offset the inflation to the extent that flows worth to build against the path that you think that could play through. And just assuming a \u201cnormalized\u201d market with so called $0.07 for equities? I\u2019m just trying to sort of see, how that $2.9 my trend as the business gets a little bit better. Loren Starr : We haven\u2019t done the sensitivity. I mean, I think if you look at how the firm has \u2013 it\u2019s a bonus pools, it\u2019s really the largest component of it. And it\u2019s a percentage of PCBOI. It\u2019s in the proxy. It\u2019s kind of, that\u2019s how we operate. It\u2019s the same concept that\u2019s going to come into a sec going forward. So if we see flows really driving, higher levels of AUM, which we\u2019d love to see or if the market improves from here, you\u2019re going to see sort of just a normal type of flex around those types of bonus pools. So again, I would point you to kind of our past experience, the same kind of set of ratios that you\u2019ve seen in the past in terms of how complexes with revenues and assets. Marty Flanagan : Bill, I think the point out, profitability will improve if that\u2019s really the underlying question and you would get a margin expansion in that scenario that you\u2019re talking about it. That\u2019s the fundamental question. Loren Starr : Yes. The incremental margin is still at the high level of 50% to 65%, as assets and revenues grow. Bill Katz : Okay, that is very helpful. Just two more questions and just [indiscernible] On the institutional channel, I certainly appreciate the notion that your pipeline is getting better and the fee rate underneath that is better than what\u2019s going out the door. But when I look at just over the slide that continues to sort of point to flattish flow Page 5 \u2013 flattish flows overall. At what point does some of that very strong pipeline feed into maybe a more positive growth? Or maybe another way to think about is where you losing traction, where you\u2019re gaining traction? Loren Starr : I think, in terms of pipeline as we send, we\u2019re gaining traction in some of the places that were quite successful in China, Greater China. So geographically that\u2019s been really a strong area for growth across all sorts of asset classes in Chinese equities fixed income. I think it has a lot of upside for us as we continue to see success and further penetration in that market. We do think that Europe is got a lot of opportunity, particularly as we build out the solutions capabilities and we are meeting the needs around fixed income and general use of factors and other capabilities that have been part of our growth engine story for some time. So those are upsides. Real estate continues to be a major driver of opportunity for the firm overall. I think in terms downside, there isn\u2019t a ton of downsides. We don\u2019t see sort of big likely to terminates or sort of big ugly story on the downside for institutional. The reason that as it kind of turned negative here, it\u2019s been largely because of the volatile market that we\u2019ve been in and some of the fundings have slowed just because of the uncertainty, work that we\u2019re doing in Europe and UK have definitely slowed to some extent just because of the \u2013 sort of the risk off a behavior that we\u2019re seeing is people want to understand what direction \u2013 things are going in. And so we do believe that, I mean, those numbers are going to fund. It\u2019s just a matter of timing. Bill Katz : Thank you. Just one last clarification I probably did, I think you covered before on that $10 billion mandate that you expect to find in the first half of the year. Is there a way to think about the fee rate associated with that? I apologize, if you already covered that. Loren Starr : Yes. Again, just because it hasn\u2019t been disclosed publicly, we\u2019re not going to talk about it, because it really will be transparent to the client and if and when they disclose it. So we just think it\u2019s appropriate for us to be talking about fee rates for clients. Bill Katz : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open. Dan Fannon : Thanks. My question is around the UK, obviously, Brexit has been an overhang, but also there\u2019s been the scrutiny of Woodford and the asset management industry as a whole. Could you talk about, kind of perpetual, because they\u2019re being brought into same in the same discussions around the platforms and how these funds are being sold and you obviously your performance there has been hit? And so I guess just in general, can you talk about the outlook for perpetual, what any ramifications you may or may not expect from some of the platforms and how funds were sold and how your business practice might differ from the way it\u2019s been written about in the price for other funds? Marty Flanagan : Look, it\u2019s a good question. And you obviously it\u2019s very topical in the UK, yes, I can\u2019t speak for win, but what I will say, one of the most fundamental things that we did, strategically was purchasing Intelliflo. And that\u2019s early days, but that is really a very powerful platform that we think is going to make quite a difference for us in that marketplace. And you should realize, if 35% market share, we\u2019ve just please the model portfolios, it\u2019s early. Clients are starting to go on the platform. It\u2019s going to start picking up next year. And I think that was a very important strategic decision that we made. And with regard to investment performance, again, these markets more recently have been very, very positive for us and in those teams. And the combination thereof I think puts us in a good place. And this is how, speaking at a retail level, I think as what you\u2019re addressing. Institutionally, we continue to be very, very strong in the market and growing. Greg, I don\u2019t know, if you want add anything. Greg McGreevey : Look, I think just highlight the year-to-date improvement that we\u2019ve seen in our Henley business overall, especially on the equity side with a number of our assets, especially those that have had the most significant size in the top half of peers improving pretty dramatically from 2018 and 2017. So don\u2019t want to get too far ahead of the fact that it\u2019s relatively short term performance. But September was an especially strong month for performance within the Henley equity side and so we're travelling definitely in the right direction if you will. And we've seen significant improvement also within the Henley fixed income side. So the one thing I think on that business because is kind of gets to outflows and what we may see there, I think that group historically, like a lot of our other equity teams has an incredibly strong culture, skill and capabilities. And I think that team historically has produced incredibly strong performance. It's really been the recent market environment in the short run has kind of impacted our performance notwithstanding with the positive things that have happened on year-to-date basis. So, I'm highly confident that we'll be able to given those skills to return back to what we would expect that group and what they historically have produced in terms of performance. And Marty? Marty Flanagan : Yes. The Brexit coming into the market environment has been a tremendous headwind for us, but that's a high degree of confidence in our investment teams. And at some point it will not be a risk off world and we anticipate, we are participating very strongly in it. Dan Fannon : I guess to clarify on the performance, I'm looking at Slide 14 and I look at the UK on the one, three and five year numbers. And so what improvement are you citing I guess or is it somewhere else that I could see that? Loren Starr : Yes, so this is at the end of \u2013 so this is \u2013 looking at it on a one year basis, I was giving you a year-to-date numbers. So the four quarter of last year as I think you know is an especially troubling year for kind of all equity performance. And so that really impacted when you looked at the one year performance at the end of September of 2019 those numbers, if you look at it on a year-to-date basis you would definitely see improvement. And then I was referencing specifically the September number where we had roughly about 90% of all of our assets within the Henley group in the top half of our peer groups. So again, it's relatively short-term, but we're starting to see that trend in the right direction for the same reasons that we talked about earlier. Well, hopefully did that clarify? Dan Fannon : Yes, yes it does. And then just a follow-up on Asia, outside of money markets, I guess what products are selling in that region? And I just kind of what \u2013 I guess or what are you or where you see potential other kind of avenues of growth in that region? Marty Flanagan : Yes. So through Invesco Great Wall its very broad, equity products are very, very strong, highly performing they are recognized as one of the top tier local money managers there. Institutionally, in China it's very broad, heavy real estate fixed income [indiscernible] market to add, so very broad and very deep in that area. Dan Fannon : Okay. Thank you. Marty Flanagan : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Michael Cyprys : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just hoping to dig in a little bit more on the institutional channel, it's good to hear that the pipeline is up and improving here. Just hoping you could talk a little bit about some of the investments that you've been making in the institutional business, particularly around data, technology and also the ability to customize. And I guess the question is how is your approach different today versus say two years ago and what might be most different as you look out over the next two to three years? Marty Flanagan : Yes. Look it's a great question and let me hit on a couple of points and I'll have Greg pitch into. I think we and all our competitors would tell you it's a great opportunity. The other reality is the demands on clients have never been \u2013 from clients has never been stronger. And so this depth and breadth of investment capabilities has mattered, but right behind it exactly what you're talking about investments in technology around analytics, insights, has been very material. And if we look at this beyond its a necessity as you're going to compete and win with institutions, thought leadership is an another area that becomes very, very important in these conversations because what we're seeing with appliances, they're wanting to work with us very deeply and very broadly and so its effectively opening up the organization to whatever set of capabilities that we have and so it's been material and it's been real. Greg, what would you think? Greg McGreevey : Yes I think, the big three areas that we've invested in are capabilities on the solutions front, the client experience, which would be both technology and systems as well as thought leadership where we've added with very strong content from our investment teams, the ability both in marketing and within that group to be able to provide that content into the marketplace. On the solutions front, it's been one of the largest investments I think we've made as an organization. And the ability to partner with clients to help them create outcomes that they really desire is where the market is moving to. And it gives us, I think, an ability because of the individual resources and expertise that we've added to really have the conversations that we need to, and provide those outcomes that I think are so \u2013 the clients are looking for. Part of the reason that we were able to talk about that client on the institutional side and a lot of the other pipeline is really the result of that investment that we made a number of years ago in solutions. We wouldn't have been able to obtain that client, when we talked about that was $10 billion without the investment that we made. And we're seeing a lot of momentum with other clients as a result of those three areas that I kind of talked about and Marty talked about within the institutional side. And we think that's only going to be a trend that will continue. So we're excited about that. Michael Cyprys : Great. And just a quick follow-up, is there any way to sort of quantify, I guess, how much investment spend is currently in the expense run rate and how we should think about that, if anything kind of peeling back over the next couple of years or if that get recycled into other investments? How should we be thinking about it? Marty Flanagan : So, we have an enormous amount of investments in our run rate. I think we've \u2013 it\u2019s well in excess of sort of $100 million of investments just generally around the firm across a variety of growth engine areas that we've talked about in the past around China, around solutions, around factor-based investing. So that is \u2013 in our run rate, we expect to continue to build that number over time, but offset that with further savings as we talked about through synergies and just general, sort of prudent expense management and discipline. Loren Starr : And I think the key thing for where we're at within solutions, which is kind of a broad area, we feel quite confident that the majority of the investments that we've made within solutions has already been made. Although the other things that we might need to do on the distribution side and in another areas to kind of support that, but, we really feel like we've made the significant amount of headway into the individuals that we've need to hire there. Greg McGreevey : And really \u2013 again, just to put some, how do we see it and what have we done? Our solutions team uses our capabilities, right? I think that's quite different than what a number of our competitors do. So literally, sort of sits on top of \u2013 looking through all the investment capabilities that we have and it's really hand in hand with the clients. And what we're seeing clients do where if you go back two and three and four years, it was more of what product does a client want and what do we have doesn't match off much more. It's becoming a much more holistic engagement with our clients. Now it might be a capability or second capability, but it's really that insights and analytics that is really just changing the dynamic with the client for any institutional money manager to be successful in our view. Michael Cyprys : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open. Glenn Schorr : Thank you. I want to drill down a little bit more on the MassMutual potential. You mentioned the 8,500 advisors, you also in the past talked about the general account. The advisors are not the same type of businesses as the retail broker dealers, the wire houses. So can you talk about what you expect to be selling into that channel? What do they typically consume and how quickly that can be? And then anything you could add on the general account, that'd be great? Greg McGreevey : So look with MassMutual, again, I'd say early days, it's a very strong robust relationship and we're working through those multiple areas that we've talked about. What we'll do better on is telling you once we've accomplished something as opposed to what's coming that's not been received. So what not these calls, that said with the 8,500, we\u2019re looking at building models for that sales force. And you can think of traditional investment capabilities that would be available, some of the other wire houses. So it's not as different as \u2013 it is different. But again, the commonality is there that, [indiscernible] frankly, we are in multiple conversations around the general accounts, right now with MassMutual. And again, once we accomplish something, we'll let you know. Glenn Schorr : And the models are that a product of Jemstep being\u2026 Greg McGreevey : It's really the solutions team that's doing them sort of building a combination of our active and factor capabilities and in consultation with the CIO and what they are looking for their client base. Glenn Schorr : Cool. And then maybe just you could just update us on GTR. I wish that on the past and choppy markets like we saw this quarter, that was decent backdrop for GTR, just \u2013 if you could just talk about what you're seeing on the ground in terms of potential demand? Loren Starr : I mean, I think what we've seen is, there's been a fair amount of outflow in the retail side, particularly in EMEA as that product has underperformed some loss. And I think there's sort of generally been, again, as I mentioned, sort of risk loss and people have sort of moved into cash. It still actually appeals to a lot of people in principle in terms of what it's trying to achieve as an outcome in a lower risk than the equity markets with good return over cash. It's currently, I think, it\u2019s somewhat underperforming that level maybe by 200, 300 basis points. It's been improving in the current market. And so the performance has instead of come \u2013 is moving in the right direction. So again, we're hopeful that we can see that product at least stabilize at a minimum as opposed to sort of currently where it's in that flow. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Thanks, Loren. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Kenneth Lee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Kenneth Lee : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just to follow-up on the UK flows, I'm looking at it from a broader perspective. Just wanted to get some of your thoughts, whether any of the recent regulatory activity or Brexit have been changing client preferences over the past year? And maybe just how would you characterize the sentiment of clients within the UK? Marty Flanagan : Yes. Look, it is a \u2013 yes, it's really wearing on clients, right. It's been about Brexit transition has been a long and difficult, but from our perspective, where it's really come to light where you can feel it. It's really 2018 into this year. I mean, you can see it in our business, you can see it in the actions of clients and what they're doing. So it's more of a movement to risk off cash type things. So we're seeing less of a movement towards passive as you see here in the United States. So again, it has been a headwind. Again, so what have we done about it? We take it\u2019s been very important to change our ways to support our clients and Intelliflo was an important part of that. And again, it was [indiscernible] Greg talked about the active performance was picking up what we are, as you see now and our portfolios are \u2013 we are bringing factors and passive into the market. And that is also something that we'll need to be on the Intelliflo from also that trend will pick up there in our mind. And again, I think you can see it just more broadly from our ETF flows throughout EMEA that is incredible strong. And right now, we're the number two flowing ETF provider in that part of the world. So again, source transaction was very important for us and we see that pace just picking up as we look to the future. And if you remember when you go back when we announced it, you can look at the ETF business in EMEA literally looks like its 10 years behind where the United States was. And that was a couple of years ago. And you are absolutely seen that demand pickup as we anticipated, and we are a beneficiary of that. And we looked at that as another area of very important growth for us. Kenneth Lee : Great. That's helpful. And just one more looking further out when you take into account, potential synergies with MassMutual fully integrated sales force being able to leverage a broader product set. Any updated thoughts on what could be like a long term potential organic growth expectations for the combined Invesco and OppenheimerFunds complex? Marty Flanagan : Yes. I wish I had that crystal ball, but what I will tell you is, our organic growth rate will exceed that of our competition. And we've strongly believe with what we're building and what we have built, puts us in a very strong position for where the industry is going and how we're position against it. And so we are starting to see that in very \u2013 the areas that we've talked about on this call. Are they all at full potential? Absolutely not. But they are absolutely contributing, right now we're seeing it and you're seeing it and we're very excited about it. Kenneth Lee : Great. Thanks. Marty Flanagan : Yes. Operator : At this time, we have no further question. Marty Flanagan : Great. Again, on behalf of Loren, Greg and myself, thank you for your time and appreciate the questions and the dialogues. And have a great day. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now, I would like to turn the call over to your speakers for today, Marty Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer; and Greg McGreevey, Senior Managing Director, Investments. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin. Marty Flanagan : Thank you very much, and thanks everybody for joining. This is Marty Flanagan, along with Loren Starr, our CFO, and Andrew Schlossberg, Head of the Americas. And if you're so inclined, the presentation is on the website if you want to follow along. That said, we're going to follow the format that we did last quarter where much shorter prepared remarks so we can get to Q&A. Loren will get a brief overview of the business results before we get into the questions though. And as we've discussed on previous calls, we view this combination with Oppenheimer's multi growth - multi-year growth story that deepened our relationship with Invesco clients, expanded the capabilities offered globally, scaled the business for both the benefit of our clients and shareholders, and we're already seeing that. This expansion meaningfully enhances our ability to grow our business, achieve very strong operating results, and compete in the ever increasing dynamic market environments. Importantly, this is a long-term growth story. That said, we are seeing real and meaningful signs of the power of the combined firm. We ended the year with just over $1.2 trillion in assets under management. That's a 38% increase year-over-year. That's a record high for the firm. We also have higher assets under management across all channels and all regions as we ended the year. Long-term outflows for the year were $34 billion. That's a 11% improvement from the prior year. We hit record levels of revenue and record levels of operating profits for the year ended 2019. We also achieved significant expense savings delivering ahead of schedule and at $551 million is more than $25 million ahead of the synergy target that we talked about at the time of the combination. And we'll continue to look for additional synergies in 2020. Lastly, and importantly, we did return $1.2 billion to shareholders in 2019. And looking ahead, we believe we are well on the path to continue to make progress to move into positive flows in 2020. The key factors that we've looked at are improving equity performance and several capabilities where they're in high demand, continued very strong fixed income performance, meaningful progress on the integration of our U.S. sales team, strong momentum in our growing China and ETF business, a very strong institutional pipeline, including large ones and solutions. And finally, the clarity on Brexit will help the investors who backs away risk on mindset and we are beginning to see that. So, I'm going to turn it over to Loren to give our results. Loren Starr : Thank you, Marty. So, I'd like to spend the next few minutes highlighting some of the key items for you on the topic of flows, expenses and capital management. So, starting on flows, as you can see on Slide 7, we're seeing year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter long-term net inflow improvements in the regions of EMEA ex-UK and our Asia-Pac area. The Q4 net flow growth in EMEA ex-UK was driven largely by our ETF business as well as our direct real estate business. So we saw, for example, $0.9 billion in the S&P 500 UCITS ETF and $0.7 billion in real estate. The Q4 growth in Asia-Pacific is largely centered in Greater China and is driven by strong flows into our joint venture. The JV flows were $2.6 billion across many asset classes with fixed income contributing $1.7 billion followed by balanced $0.8 billion. We are also seeing quarter-over-quarter improvement in our UK business. We had positive net flows in our institutional business, and that was driven by direct real estate primarily but also fixed income where we had $1.3 billion in real estate and $1.1 billion in fixed income. Our retail flows do remain somewhat challenged. You'll see the majority of the $16 billion in net outflows in Americas was attributable to the retail business, and that was driven by a $9.4 billion in outflows from some of the legacy OFI funds, some of the largest outflows included. OFI global equities, there was $3.9 billion there and the OFI senior loans $2.2 billion. We didn't see a natural redemption out of maturity of our BulletShares. There was $1.7 billion out of that activity. $0.8 billion came from Invesco International Growth, $0.7 billion from stable value, and $0.6 billion from global asset allocation. I'd like to note though that about $2 billion of these outflows is due to the previously disclosed New Mexico 529 plan. It was a deal related redemption that we discussed earlier. So, on the next page, let's drill down a little bit on net inflows in the Americas. So you'll see on Slide 8 we show the 2019 history of AUM monthly gross sales and net flows for the Invesco and the OFI U.S. active retail products combined, which includes periods both pre and post close. So, another way, this reflects the two firms together over the entire period, including the pre-acquisition period. So these tables highlight a few points. So first, both the legacy Invesco and OppenheimerFunds have maintained AUM levels aided by the market. Net revenue yields are stable across the timeframe. Second, you'll see our gross sales post close are still well below the pre-close levels, and they did dip in Q4 although we did see a stronger December. We've made progress with the integration of the two sale teams and we worked to provide the teams with the tools that they need to hit the ground running in 2020, but we are not fully operational yet. We do have Andrew Schlossberg, as Marty mentioned, the Head of our Americas business here with us on the call today and he'll be able to elaborate on this during the Q&A session. Third point I'd like to make is, net outflows have been elevated post close. And this is largely a function of the abnormally low gross sales levels in conjunction with performance challenges we have in some of our active equity portfolios. As you can see on the chart in Q4, outflows were impacted due to the previously announced $2 billion deal-related redemption of the New Mexico 529 plan. As we get to the second half of 2020, we expect the U.S. retail net flows to be on an upward trend, and this should be driven by improved gross sales levels and moderating redemption rates on many of our portfolios that have recently seen a significant step up in investment performance. So next, let's get to expense management and the P&L. So, on Slide 9, we set out our revenues and expenses. You'll see revenues included $52.2 million in performance fees in the period compared to $18.7 million in Q3, and that was largely from our real estate business. Of particular note, expenses are up $36 million a quarter that was driven by several factors, among which the most significant was the movement in foreign exchange rates and global markets in the quarter. Despite these factors, we maintain our focus on expense management and achieving our expense synergy targets discussed last quarter. So, on Slide 10, we provide additional information about our expenses to highlight the foreign exchange and market impacts and the other factors that drove Q4 expenses above Q3 levels. I'd like to walk you through briefly these variances that are shown in each of the columns on Slide 10 before turning to the impact of these items on our 2020 expense run rate. So, first, foreign exchange and market. The FX and market both increased expenses in the quarter by $21 million. We saw a strengthening of the pound and the euro against the U.S. dollar during the quarter. Pound was up 7%, euro is up 3%, we also saw other currencies like the renminbi up 3% in the quarter. Additionally, markets increased significantly where we had the S&P 500 up 8.5%, MSCI Emerging Markets Index up 11.4%, Russell 2000 up 9.5%, MSCI All Country Index up 8.5%, all that impacted our variable expenses. The next column is our integration impacts and you'll see that we realized $3 million in integration savings in the quarter. And there were $9 million more in savings related to compensation that was largely the result of the decline in our bonus pool related to the transaction and integration departures in connection with the confirmed exits of employees in Q4. These savings, however, were offset somewhat in the period by about $6 million in property, office and technology costs. That's related to the step-up in outsource admin costs, some of which will go away when we get to a single operating platform by the end of 2020. The third column to talk about is seasonal expenses. We had about $9 million of our operating expenses in Q4 were due to elevated seasonal expenses primarily related to marketing spend. And then, the fourth item is non-recurring items. So, we saw about $9 million in expenses following that quarter or occurred in the quarter that were non-recurring, and that's largely in the G&A area with the small amounts in property, office and technology. These expenses included regulatory, legal settlement, security-related expenses as well as product launch costs. So, let me next move to the 2020 expense run rate. So, if you'll recall, we indicated in the Q3 - in the third quarter that our operating expense levels of $726 million would be a good expense run rate for 2020, but that was assuming FX and market levels consistent with those at the end of the third quarter. So, if FX and market levels remain consistent with the 12/31/19 levels or end-of-year levels of the revised 2020 quarterly expense run rate will be $755 million per quarter. And that's comprised of starting with the baseline of $726 million as discussed from the third quarter, adding in the fourth quarter FX and market impacts of $21 million or add in an incremental full quarter run rate expense impact of $9 million resulting from the FX and market levels at the end of year-end 2019. Then you add in the savings related to integration of $3 million, and then one quarter of the impact of the seasonally high expenses that occurred in Q4 since that will probably happen again since our seasonal. So, the resulting $755 million represents an average quarterly run rate for the operating expenses for 2020, and realistically, I mean, there will be some quarterly variation around this average. A good example of the quarterly variation is the Q1 increase that we often see, or we always see, in compensation expense to the seasonal payroll taxes, which we'd expect to be about $15 million to $20 million for the combined organization in Q1 of this year. So, the full year 2020 guidance for operating expenses based on year-end 2019 market and FX levels is $3.02 billion. And we're confident with our ability - confident in our ability to maintain this level of expense based on year-end 2019 market and FX levels, which means that we're achieving our targeted cost synergies of more than $500 million. And we will continue to update you with respect to our ability to generate more and greater cost savings as we move through 2020. So next, let me move to Slide 11 and talk about the increase in operating income quarter-over-quarter that was offset by some large movements below the line. In fact, non-operating net expenses impacted our EPS for about $0.07 quarter-over-quarter driven in large part by two big non-cash items. So, the first was - that we recognized $15 million in negative valuation adjustments on our co-investments related to our CLO holdings. These marks are booked on a one-month lag. And so, the pickup that we actually saw on the bank loan market in the month of December was not reflected in these results. But importantly, this is a non-cash item. This is really just mark-to-market activity. And then additionally, we saw positive market gains on our seed portfolio as you might expect with the strength of the markets in the quarter. But that was offset in other gains and losses by the FX impact of the settlement of an economically hedged cash transaction we had in place related to our intercompany dividend. Basically this item is really just the FX impact on an intercompany loan. This represents about a $27-million swing quarter-over-quarter. And then once again, this is a non-cash item. So, let me move to capital management, and you'll see on that slide, Slide 12, I think, that we did have - did not have a significant buyback activity in the quarter. I'd also like to note that we paid down our credit facility balance to zero. And then, after completing about $975 million in stock buyback since the announcement of the Oppenheimer deal in October 2018, you'll see that we've transitioned to a more balanced approach towards capital management with a greater focus on our strengthening our balance sheet. So let me just in summary say we remain diligent in our approach to expense and capital management. We continue to pursue greater cost synergies related to the Oppenheimer transaction. We are focused very much so on increasing U.S. sales in the U.S., and we believe that our sales teams are now positioned for 2020 with the tools that they need to succeed. And with that, operator, I think I'll now ask you to open up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robert Lee with KBW. You may ask your question. Your line is open. Robert Lee : Maybe despite the start out with the - in talking about the trajectory of new sales in the U.S. I mean, obviously you've talked about the integration of the sales force and product performance. But maybe - I'm just kind of curious how long do you think the lag is between - you've had the combine forces now for, I guess, going on about six months and what's kind of the lag between when you get it together and you get out in the field and they start talking to advisors that you think you can really start to see get back to where you - the combined firms you are pre-deal. And then maybe you also have a little more granularity if there's in the U.S. kind of the handful of products that you think could really kind of drive that demand, where you think you could really kind of leverage sales? Marty Flanagan : All right. Andrew? Andrew Schlossberg : Maybe it's rather important to kind of take a step back for a minute. While we did put the two companies together six months ago, it was one of the largest asset management transactions in history, as you know. And we started putting the teams together then, and we're just kind of getting them on the field now. One of the really important strategic decisions that we took when we integrated the companies was to rapidly change the distribution force to meet where a client needs are moving to. So we took a very holistic look at all of our resources and took a real sense of urgency to try to make change and to fully integrate them systems and people. So that was something we wanted to do swiftly and right at close. So, the last six months, we've made a lot of - we've had a lot of progress since then, and we positioned ourselves to start to hit the ground running here in 2020, start to see the progress throughout the year. And as Loren said, I think get into the back half of 2020 in a real way. Maybe to get a little more specific about your question though, I think there's three key reasons why we're confident in the progress we've made. I think, firstly, we've established what we believe is the leading distribution force in the U.S. wealth management intermediary industry. As I said, the second reason is that we've built out a single fully integrated team and product line by end of 2019, and that's pretty important that we were able to do that. And then, lastly, I think we created a truly relevant platform for top U.S. wealth managers that we serve. And as you know, they're consolidating those relationships pretty rapidly at the asset management level. Let me just put a little color around each of those, and then I'll pause and get to your second question. In terms of establishing a leading distribution force, at close, we selected the team and we were about 50/50 from Oppenheimer and from Invesco. So, we've got the top talent. We also achieved the synergy targets that you're familiar with, but we also repositioned the firm toward growth trend. So, we positioned towards high net worth or IVs well centers, digital data, things like that, while focusing on core key clients and segments like regional broker dealers, home office platforms. So, we think we've got that leading team in place now, resources repositioned towards the things I mentioned. I think we feel like we've built out an integrated team and product line by 2019. We announced the mergers of our products, ETFs and mutual funds in December. That was a big milestone. I gave clarity to analysts that cover our products on where we're going, and I think that was important thing to do. We've also got territories and training in place. We did a lot of that during the back half of last year to get running for 2020. And then, lastly, in terms of having a relevant set at the top of U.S. wealth managers, we have a significant seat at the table. I mean, now we have over $600 billion with client AUM. With U.S. wealth managers, we have client AUM, with U.S. wealth managers, we have half dozen clients greater than $25 billion in AUM and a top 10 position and the largest active fund categories and the largest sort of alternative beta ETF player out there. So, we've got everything served up we think for success into 2020. Robert Lee : Maybe just a quick but I mean maybe this is a little old fashioned way to look at it. But I guess I've always historically thought that any distribution forces, I know, some number half dozen, 10 strategies products that you kind of focus on and really drive. So, just kind of trying to get a sense of what you think those are this coming year? Marty Flanagan : Yes. No. Thanks. Probably three things I'd mentioned, I think the first and biggest driver of our net flows success in the U.S. is going to be in the fixed income space and that's both active and passive. So, as Marty mentioned and you can see in the deck, our fixed income performance is quite strong across the board. Those products are capable and ready and in particular in the muni space, core plus multi-sector again across active and ETFs, that's a big area of focus for us and where we think we'll see success. I'd say, the second is ETFs in general and factors. We had strong momentum in 2019 and we did around $16 billion positive net flows globally in ETFs. In both income and volatility mitigation strategies, that we believe is going to continue to be important to us by the second area. And then, lastly, I'd say on the redemption side just slowing the redemptions on the active equity strategies, improving performance is common international equity, certain U.S. equity strategies and we think coupled with that product integration clarity that I mentioned, and the sales team focus on those redemptions that should be a point of improvement in 2020. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. You may ask your question. Your line is open. Patrick Davitt : I think there's been a little confusion on the comment you made in December on inflows and kind of what you said today. So, is the view that you could be in inflow by the end of 2020 or the full year could actually be an inflow year? And more specifically, I think you mentioned earlier a strong pipeline and solutions wins. Could you maybe help frame that a little bit more specifically? And within that, how should we think about the $11 billion solutions when coming through over the next few months? Marty Flanagan : Great question. So, we're not talking about the end of the year. We look at it as 2020. We see the line of sight for inflows for the year with everything that we've just been talking about today. So it's not - you'll start to see it pretty quickly here. Loren Starr : Yes. And I think, in terms of the institutional pipeline, we've seen continued growth in the pipeline. Quarter-over-quarter, it grew about 4% to 5% both in AUM and revenue basis. A lot of that is being driven by real estate and other traditional areas, but we're now competing in RFP businesses or opportunities around solutions that we haven't in the past. And so, as a result, we're actually seeing larger scale win opportunities than we've ever - never - haven't seen those in the past. The one that you referenced, the $11 billion, is going to happen probably in the second quarter of this year. I think it was just as we said in the first half, it's probably more likely to happen in the second quarter. We're seeing similar opportunities like this of similar magnitude, plus or minus, that we expect to also be generated as an inflow in this year. So, more to come on the solutions, but we really, I think, are seeing significant success now bringing our solutions capability to clients in a way that we hadn't in the past. Operator : Our next question comes from Kenneth Lee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Kenneth Lee : Just a follow-up on - wondering whether you have any update thoughts on potential incremental expense synergies? Just want to gauge any relative confidence you have potentially on achieving incremental synergies. And also as well, when you originally broke out the categories for the synergies, there are some longer tailed categories such as property and office as well as G&A. Just wondering whether those are the particular areas where you could see some potential incremental synergies? Thanks. Marty Flanagan : Yes. So, Ken, thanks very much for asking. Yes, absolutely, because when we first talked about this transaction, as you remember, we said that there was a long tail to the integration that would take us through the full year 2020. And they were related largely to some of these technology and back-office elements. And I even referenced, obviously, there was $6 million that stepped up in this quarter really to outsource admin cost, and some of that will go away as we get through the end of this year - full expectation. So, order of magnitude is - there's something there. Probably if you look at the numbers, it was in the order of magnitude of, sort of, $10 million to $14 million that could be possibly generated. We still feel very confident that those numbers will get delivered. I think, as we said in the past, we still are evaluating how much of that might drop to the bottom line, guess - versus getting reinvested in some of the high growth areas that we've talked about like China or digital. But we are absolutely, through the course of 2020, going to give you full line of sight as to what we think can drop versus what we feel we absolutely need to use for reinvestment. Kenneth Lee : And just one follow-up question, if I may. Just on that slide showing the U.S. retail active net revenue yield ex-performance fees, it looks as it's been pretty stable recently. Wondering if you could just give us some color on any relative impacts from either mix shift or changes to gross fee rates? Thanks. Loren Starr : Yes. Again, so the one thing I would say that obviously this is just ex-ETFs. This is really just the core mutual fund products, additional products. There isn't a huge amount of shift that happens between the mutual funds. The biggest shifting that we've seen really has been the mix between mutual funds versus ETFs. This we don't think is going to change, I mean, even with the sale of more fixed income. I don't think it's going to have a massive or sort of material impact on these types of fee rates. But probably, as we do sell and continue to look at ETFs, that will have a bigger impact overall. And so, I do think there's still some amount of expected fee decline for the firm as a whole as we continue to sell ETFs at a higher rate. Marty Flanagan : Yes. But I think an important point that often gets lost is, don't correlate levels of fee rates to profitability. The ETF business is very, very profitable for us. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. You may ask your question. Your line is open. Ken Worthington : Can you talk a little bit about the balance sheet? Loren, I think you mentioned the pay down of the credit facility and you talked about reprioritizing the balance sheet with regard to capital management. What does that mean? How aggressive do you want to be here on the balance sheet? Are there any targets or goals that you can share with us in terms of deleveraging or debt pay down or a couple of ratios, that would be great? Loren Starr : Yes. So, I think you should expect us to live up to our commitment of the buybacks, which we've talked about, $1.2 billion. We've got about $950 million completed through when we first announced. So there's some $200 million left that we're looking to complete in this year 2020. Again, we can do more or less depending on how markets react. But in terms of kind of what you should expect from us, it's probably a much more sort of steady normalized buyback pattern along the lines I'm just mentioning versus the very accelerated front-end loaded buyback that we were doing when the deal was announced. What we want to do is be able to build up some cash. As we've said, we want $1 billion in excess of regulatory capital levels. Generally we're not quite there yet. So there's still opportunity for us to build some more cash. And we do want to have some flexibility. Come 2022 when some debt is coming due, there's $600 million to potentially allow that to be paid down or we might roll it. But having that financial flexibility by continuing to build little cash is we think prudent. Ken Worthington : And then, just following up on some earlier questions on the Oppenheimer deal. I think the original target was organic growth of, say, 1% to 2% for Oppenheimer for 2020. Is that still a realistic target? And if it is, can you kind of walk us through either by distribution channel or maybe a couple of the big products like, how do you get from sort of the bigger outflows that we've seen more recently to that flip to 1% to 2% organic growth? Marty Flanagan : Yes. Let me make a couple of comments and then maybe Andrew can pitch in. So, it's really - we still think it's - that is very typical issue will be timing, right? So, what you can't foresee when you begin these things are relative performance. Loren hit on two important areas, the headwinds around bank loans that came over and one of the international funds. The performance in international is improving. I think it was - Andrew was talking about when you first to look for slower redemptions. But when you look through the totality of what's on that platform, we feel very confident about the opportunities. And we're also seeing opportunities outside of the United States already institutionally and also retail in EMEA. So, again, what we saw at the beginning is something that we still feel very confident, and it's going to be an issue of timing. Andrew Schlossberg : I mean, maybe the only two things I'd add is, we saw - I think through some of the disruption that we mentioned earlier and combining the distribution forces, you can look back at Page 8, we're still operating pretty well below our gross sales that we had as two individual companies. And just getting back to that level, which we think will happen sooner than later, then lets us sort of go into that acceleration mode. I think you'll see it - we're going to see it on the gross sale side I think to make that pickup happen. The other thing I would mention is, we've been focused a lot on the active U.S. retail position on page 8, but the ETFs are going to be a really important accelerator. And with this stronger distribution force together, we have a lot more energy and resource against growing that business rapidly as well. Loren Starr : And obviously some of this has to do with the performance of the products. And we've seen some improvement. Obviously we continue to see an improving trend on some of the core products like international growth as a good example. That's going to really help us achieve those levels. But probably realistically within 2020 getting to 1% or 2% is probably not realistic at this point, and I think we have a path to it. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Shaun Calnan : This is actually Shaun Calnan on for Mike. Just going back to the product offerings, in 2019, we saw significant pickup in industry ESG flows and it looks like more of a - there's going to be more focus on this from competitors and investors. So I'm just wondering what your current offering is there and what your plans are going forward? Thanks. Andrew Schlossberg : Yes. Hey. It's Andrew Schlossberg. I'll jump in the first instance. We've been, like many others in the asset management space, investing in the ESG space for some time. So, our first focus really is making sure that sustainability and other ESG factors are incorporated into our active strategies as a factor that they look at. Most of the demand we see from clients, including in places like Europe, is for inclusion portfolios not exclusion. So, our first protocol is to make sure that we're contemplating that. Where we anticipate seeing some increased demand though is in ESG portfolios and things that - that's the core focus of it. We've incubated and put strategies in place across our entire platform. One area of note, and then maybe Marty can pick up more fully, but in the ETF space in the U.S., we've been sort of running sustainability focused ETF since 2005. And they are in place. We have, I think, six or seven of them, and we're starting to see more demand. We expect to see more demand into next year. And likewise in Europe, we listed a set of strategies last year to address the same set of challenges and opportunities. Marty Flanagan : If you look at where the impact is, where it's been real, it has been on the continent. If you're not absolutely engaged and focused on ESG inclusion, you have a real business problem regardless of what you think about it. And you can tell in the United States where from my perspective has been more of a conversation - pick up. So, it is definitely a real opportunity and really frankly something that is going to be actually pervasive, I'd say, throughout the whole industry globally, which is a good thing. Loren Starr : Yes. I would just say, I mean, in Europe in particular, I mean, we just launched some new ETFs that were ESG focused in Q4. I know we have a bank loan capability that's all ESG focused that is also being told and doing well. And the big solution when we had in the U.S. that we've talked about was actually focused around ESG offering. So, we have the capabilities to deliver on ESG and we're actively pursuing those. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question. Your line is open. Brian Bedell : Can we just go back to the organic growth trajectory and let's put the positive in sort of the timing of that. So, you mentioned, Marty, the institutional pipeline, what's strengthening. Of course, we've got the - I think it's announced as $11 billion mandate that's funding in the second quarter, if you could just sort of go into the different components of that. Obviously, you mentioned Brexit is a little bit more - the situation there is a little bit more favorable. And if you combine the nuance - maybe you can talk about actually the new products that you plan to launch on the Oppenheimer strategies during the year in terms of the institutional products and then the launching of maybe euro down the sales front. How that plays into that trajectory of positive organic growth. It certainly looks like the second quarter, you can achieve that with the funding of the mandate. Do you think you can possibly achieve that in the first quarter given the trends you're seeing so far? Marty Flanagan : The answer is yes. So let me try to hit the highlights. So, you're seeing continued rapid growth in China, we expect that to continue. The ETF business, what Andrew talked about, globally we continue to see that positive flows and increasing. There's more to do in Brexit, but round one has actually been very important. You can already start to see more positive activity on the continent. You did see some improvement in our UK business just in the fourth quarter. So, those are two areas where they were very strong contributors to our business a couple of years ago, but as Brexit became very real, I mean, we just saw an incredible drop off in any real activity as people went to the sidelines. So, those are all very positive, along with the institutional business that you talked about. So, again, this is - you're going to start to see, very quickly here, all these things starting to show up in the numbers. And it's quite broad, it's not one area. Loren Starr : And I mean, what we're just seeing is - I mean, solutions is, by far, in a way, the fastest growing part of our institutional pipeline. The other parts continue to grow, direct real estate and bank loans are - they are fixed income as well would be the areas that we see growth and interest. Marty Flanagan : And you talked about the Oppenheimer. So, right now, I think it was Q4 introduced four different Oppenheimer capabilities into the use of products on the continent and they were often roadshows in Q4. So, again, that's the beginning of that and also where we've seen interest is, in the global equities, emerging markets equities, emerging markets debt, all outside of the United States institutionally. So, again, they're longer tailed engagements institutionally but they're well known, well recognized and there is real demand for the asset classes. Brian Bedell : And then maybe just to put two expenses real quick. I missed the comment about the incremental cost sales in 2020 on that $3.02 billion. Maybe if you can just re-highlight the principle, the $3.02 billion, does that include additional market returns in 2020? And then, I know you're still wrestling with when you get cost, incremental cost from the deal you may reinvest them. So and maybe just a little bit more color on, if that 3.02 billion could be improved by additional cost saves from Oppenheimer. Loren Starr : Yes so, on the first question you had. It does not include any incremental market returns that have already happened in 2020. So there may be some lift depending on where, what and how the quarter comes through. It's really based on year-end levels December 31 levels. In terms of incremental cost saves again, there is probably 10 to 14 that we easily see in terms of opportunity to deliver more synergies. And so that is something that we will as I mentioned sort of, be able to talk through as we get through 2020 as to how much of that could drop in the bottom line versus not. But the 3020 does not include any incremental saves at this point, it is really consistent with the 501 that we originally talk about. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question. Your line is open. Chris Harris : Just to follow-up on the 2020 expense guide how would equity markets up say 8% or so effect affect the outlook? Loren Starr : So again, I mean - you can kind of look at what happened in this current quarter to get a gauge where we did have equity markets sort of similar levels. So again - there maybe some parallel there now about the market and FX, about half of that was market and half was FX. So of the 21 that we are showing so you can get a sense as sort of roughly $10 million that could be due to an 8% lift. Chris Harris : And then just wanted to talk to you guys a little bit about Brexit so on the one hand actually signing a deal would remove a layer of uncertainty, but I guess there is additional uncertainties regarding how the new Brexit situation might affect the local economy. So, like what are you guys seeing and hearing from your investors I mean are you actually seeing and focusing, hey look once this deal is inks that might remove so much uncertainty that we can get involved in equities again or I guess I was kind of hoping to get some thoughts about what's driving the confidence there? Marty Flanagan : Yes it's a very good question. And people are quick to point out there is the second part of Brexit is a trade deal - and how that's all going to turn out. You could absolutely sense incredible sigh of relief on the continent and in the U.K. with but just round one of Brexit being agreed. You can start to see that in the activity on the continent, in particular in fund flows it's trailing in the U.K., but again it's just total sense of relief that there is a pathway forward. Yes how high would that enthusiasm be is unclear but everybody that you talk about, talk to, there are record levels of cash on the sidelines in the U.K. and on the continent. And you're not making very much money at all needless to say with the rate environment and negative rates in particular. So that's why you're starting to see some sort of activity emerge. Yes, I can't predict how disruptive this next round of trade talks will be, but everything that we're seeing is round one is actually a very, very important positive step. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. You may ask your question. Your line is open. Dan Fannon : So a follow-up on expenses. And I understand you're talking about synergies and incremental savings. But if I were just to look at core Invesco and we are sitting here today, after the kind of the results and the flows you're seeing. I think we would be talking about cost cutting, or other ways to curtail investments. So could you talk about, obviously do you have the integration and what you've outlined and you've achieved that but at the end of the day the business are doing worse than you expected. So what are you doing I guess when we think about incrementally to adjust for an environment that we are now. And I think you've talked about any additional savings or expenses being have to being reinvested in the business. So can you help us think about the market backdrop, maybe that's not as favorable what you can do or other things beyond just the integration that are keeping expenses under control? Loren Starr : Yes, great question, Dan. So I mean we have been very focused on this deal and the synergies coming out of steel but I want to say it\u2019s not where our focus stops. So there is a greater larger focus about what happens sort of day two kind of ideas around how can we make the entire firm more effective, more efficient and there is work being done completely separate from the Oppenheimer transaction about looking at. How can we simplify some of our technology and systems, particularly sort of some of the systems that may not be directly back office or middle office, but others that sort of get more into investment support and other things that could simplify the way we manage our various capabilities. And that's just as an example of something that is interesting to us, because obviously, we do have a fair amount of technical debt associated with supporting multiple teams. There may be opportunities for us to sort of streamline some of that infrastructure. So that's a good example of an area that could be quite large. Other things that have been clearly talked about beyond Invesco, but we are actively pursuing is how can we move more to the cloud. Having things that are on-premise is very expenses due to a lot of maintenance and support required for that kind of physical maintenance. And so if we can move more to the cloud, there really is a significant opportunity to sort of eliminate a lot of cost data centers and other things that are just not necessary anymore. So, those are things that we're working on through 2020. Probably as we get through its more of a 2021 opportunity for us, but we absolutely will want to talk further through 2020 about some of these ideas as well, not just the Oppenheimer ones. Dan Fannon : And then can you expand upon the MassMutual relationship and what has happened or what you are planning in terms of 2020 from a contribution through that channel of those advisors and what kind of the potential could be there? Marty Flanagan : Yes, I'll make a couple comments and Andrew can chime in. So obviously in the first quarter call is the 8,500 advisors and literally it\u2019s onboard and capabilities that couldn't make available historically looking at areas of alternatives that could be made available to that sales force. Also and some conversations going on looking at their general account around the portfolio\u2019s capabilities that we have that they will take on as mandate. So again it's a very strong relationship, and we're expecting it to be beyond the important shareholding that we have, but also doing business together. Andrew Schlossberg : Yes, the only thing I'd add is on the Advised insurance side, one of the bigger opportunities we mutually see is with model portfolios and solutions into that channel. Open architecture but also highly inclusive of our active and passive strategies. And so that's - what we see, it's a maybe one of the larger opportunities in the advice channel. Dan Fannon : And is that in 2020 or is that beyond? Andrew Schlossberg : Through 2020 and beyond yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. You may ask your question. Your line is open. Adam Beatty : This is Adam Beatty in for Brennan, just wanted to focus in on China a little bit more on your business there it sounds like things are going well. I appreciate the breakdown on the flows just wanted to get a sense in terms of the financial contribution the magnitude and timing that you might be expecting. Also any regulatory updates and when you might increase the stake in the JV and finally, any thoughts on the competitive environment there? Thank you. Loren Starr : Yes, so in terms of the financial again I'd point you to our press release, we do provide detail in the footnotes that allow you full transparency in terms of the revenues and the expenses in our joint venture. What you've seen is that the margin sort of range somewhere between 40% to 55% I mean if it was down a little bit quarter-to-quarter I think, it dipped down a little bit this quarter. But generally they are well in excess of the firm's margins and it is a business that has the same kind of very positive incremental margins. You would expect for something that has generally higher fees and there is a lot of infrastructure necessarily required to support the growth. So financial I think it is a one that is going to help accrete our margin as we continue to see that business grow. I forgot the other part of your question. Marty Flanagan : Yes I will pick up, so the shareholding. So we continue to be - there is - meeting of the minds that will increase the shareholding - we\u2019ve not come to final terms. But I think a very important point is it's less relevant for us than others because the point is we have management control and we have had management control of the joint venture. And so, we operate in China, as really a combined firm because of that and that's what's unique about it. If you look at the competitive nature of it, there is estimates that half the flows in the industry over the next 10 years can come from China. We been managing to Chinese securities since 1992, in the joint venture was 2004, very strong expertise management of clients in China $50 billion of Chinese whether it be large institutions or the retail business and we continue to see growth. So it is people look at as an opportunity, the fundamental fact very competitive, and to me my sense is that the start-up time to become successful is quite long tailed. So having the depth of capabilities and tenure and experiences. What we look at is a very important competitive advantage for us. Loren Starr : Yes, I think I'd also say just the investment performance of the products that they're managing is spectacularly strong, and so they really do have wonderful position in the market right now, and which has allowed them to be able to launch products, probably more rapidly than others, just because of there has seen as being experts in this area when regulators are looking at kind of who is equipped to do these product launches. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, you may ask your question. Alex Blostein : Wanted to pivot the discussion on organic growth from AUM to fees for a second, I guess, first maybe you could talk a little bit about the fee rates on the $11 billion. When do you expect to fund in the second quarter and then Marty just given your comments around line of sight on positive flows for the year, what are the fee rates you guys expect to get on that pipeline and I guess just taking a step back, if you could talk about organic fee growth for 2020 is both organic AUM growth that would be helpful. Loren Starr : Yes. So I think we're said it for solutions - at the solutions kind of typical fees I think single digits. So it is not higher fee, it tends to be at a lower fee, which is generally what we've seen. I mean a lot of the capabilities are going to be in the ETF space as well. So we're going to sit somewhat consistent with the overall FX strategy. So in terms of overall feed progression. I think we said we're not into forecasting kind of fee rates just because it is so hard with mix and hard to figure out different things around foreign exchange market that he was at around, but clearly with ETF growth you'll continue to see some focus on fee rates coming down as ETFs become a more prominent part of our overall mix, but as Marty mentioned is not margin sort of dilutive. This is very high incremental margins for that growth. So we absolutely have no issue with sort of our fees coming down due to ETFs growing the bigger topic has been outflows in the higher feed product and so that's the wildcard in terms of predicting this and we've talked a little bit about how quickly can we, so the stem, what we've seen around some of those higher fee redemptions were hopeful that we can get there through some of the things we've talked about,  but that's the bigger part to forecast and is the hardest wanted to say how quickly that's going to happen. Alex Blostein : And then the second question I had for you guys was just around the non-US growth dynamic particularly U.K. and Europe. So clearly, lots of money on the sidelines. You mentioned that, and we have as you see some of that as well. As you think about prospect of some of that money coming back into the investment products. Can you share some of the perspective of whether or not you think it's going to be more of a money flowing back into the active products or the passive products. So just some flavor what you actually hearing from the distribution channels in the UK and on the content that would be helpful. Marty Flanagan : Yes, I'll make your comment Loren can pick up. So what you saw last year. You know our ETF flows were sort of record flows right. So the second largest inflows in Europe into our ETFs that's going to continue. Look it's early days post the Brexit, but the focus on active is actually picking up and we're seeing that early trend. And again, I mean, we're not even - we're almost done with January. So I don't want to extrapolate too much, but there has been a change already. Loren Starr : Yes, I mean, I would just say I think probably it's going to be a mix, but probably there is going to be a heavy component of ETFs flowing into Europe. Really, we've seen that and we don't expect that to change what we do think is probably helpful that some of the active is going to start coming back. We have some great products that are performing really well. European balance high income European corporate bonds are examples of the products that are doing really well from a performance perspective. So our European lineup on active is actually pretty strong. And so any sort of improvement on the risk off we're getting more risk on is going to be helpful for some of those cross border flows coming back to us. Marty Flanagan : I think I might just add two quick things, one is that initially cash balances being high the equity demand has been so depressed the last few years that just a pickup back into equity strategies off a low base is both active and passive we expect. And then the other thing I'd mentioned, which is relevant in EMEA, but also globally that we didn't talk about was we're seeing more demand come into alternative strategies throughout the world. Institutionally, I mean emerging retail. So I probably look for flows to return there as well as people come off the sidelines. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question and please standby. Your line is open. Craig Siegenthaler : First, I just wanted to come back to be positive net flow commentary earlier in Q&A, were you specifically called out the Oppenheimer international fund, just given the trailing performance that fund. I wanted to hear why you thought flows would be improving over the next several quarters. Loren Starr : Yes. So the one-year performance has significantly improved on that particular product. And  screaming a little bit to see if I can find it right now, so I can actually tell you, but I think we've seen a real pick-up in is it\u2026 Marty Flanagan : It is 32nd Loren Starr : 32nd percentile on a one-year. Marty Flanagan : One year. Loren Starr : So it's definitely improved from where it was. So it's not so much that it's going to turn it around dramatically, but it will allow us to protect it and sort of maybe stem redemptions little. So that's going to be a big help to the flow story overall. A \u2013 Marty Flanagan : It's a well-established team with high conviction and again money comes back also into the international equity space with some of the headwinds changing are continues to come in with the performance improvement we feel better about the redemption rate. Loren Starr : Yes, I mean just anecdotally, I know it's a short period, but I think on a three-month basis it's it percentile. So it's really come up well and so near term it's definitely performing well. Craig Siegenthaler : And then just my follow up on Jemstep. Can you provide us an update on this business and also do you know what the current AUM contribution is from Jemstep, which I assume would mostly be inside of PowerShares. A \u2013 Marty Flanagan : Yes, so the total digital platform right now, there is $900 billion in assets under administration. So it is due to certain to come online. Pretty quickly you will see some advancements of clients into Jemstep here and then next little while the business on the continent continues to be very, very strong. This fourth quarter, we talked about the model portfolio launch, clients are starting to come online in that we suspect up probably mid-year before you start to see meaningful flows into that, but again we feel really good about the strategy and you'll start to see some good things happening here, but we'll talk holistically about. Loren Starr : Yes, I think, I don't have much more to add other than. Yes. So it's a huge opportunity, I think is less than 2% of Invesco AUM and the share of you just mentioned. So it's not material at this point, but the opportunity that is before us in terms of being able to actually penetrate the AUAs is very real one. So I think it's a story for 2020 that we hope we're going to be able to tell more fully A \u2013 Marty Flanagan : And to put in a context. So with the active model portfolios that were introduced in the U.K. about 18% to 20% of that content is Invesco products and so you put in the context of open architecture and the other distribution platform if you at 18% to 20% of the mark share that would be is basically 4 to 5 times higher than having a successful position and a traditional platform. Operator : Our final question comes from Robert Lee with KBW. You may ask your question Robert Lee : Actually my follow-ups were asked and answered. Thank you. Marty Flanagan : Great good. Well, thank you everybody and have a good rest of the day and will be shared with you soon. Loren Starr : Thanks everybody. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation. At this time, you may disconnect your lines.",

At that time, to ask a question, press star, one. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I\u2019d like to turn over to the call to your speakers for today : Marty Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer; Colin Meadows, Senior Managing Director and Head of Global, Institutional and Private Markets; Andrew Schlossberg, Senior Managing Director and Head of Americas; and Greg McGreevey, Senior Managing Director, Investments.  Mr. Flanagan, you may begin. Marty Flanagan : Thanks very much, and thanks everybody for joining. I\u2019ll spend a few minutes just talking about the environment in the quarter. Loren will spend the bulk of the time talking about the results. Colin has joined and he\u2019s going to talk about the institutional business, Andrew will talk about the Americas, Greg will also join us for questions, and I\u2019m also especially pleased to introduce Allison Dukes, who joined Invesco as Deputy CFO and will be taking over as Senior Managing Director and CFO on August 1, when Loren Starr takes on the new role of Vice Chairman. I will note that we\u2019re not in the same room and taking the call from different locations, as you can imagine in this environment, and you\u2019re also welcome to follow along using the presentation that\u2019s available on the website. First, I hope you, your families and colleagues remain safe and healthy during these unprecedented, challenging times. I\u2019ll tell you we\u2019ve been intensely focused on protecting our employees and their families while continuing to robustly engage with our clients and serving them in any way possible and just operating a disciplined business in this highly turbulent environment. We\u2019ve been dealing with the effect of COVID from the time it first affected our business in China in February. Several weeks ago, we reached the point where literally 99% of our workforce was working from home. The operating outcomes have been outstanding, which is a testament to my colleagues and the strength of our global operating platform.  Despite working in this remote environment, we\u2019ve been highly engaged with our clients around the world, as I said, supporting them in any way necessary during this period. We\u2019ve had thousands of digital and virtual interactions with our clients since the start of the crisis which have been incredibly effective, and this experience will no doubt change permanently how we operate and interact with clients going forward. Financial pressures and the client demand presented by the coronavirus will only [indiscernible] with global trends where global multi-channel, multi-capability firms with operating scale will grow in the years ahead. For the past decade, we\u2019ve had the discipline to act on our high conviction industry views [indiscernible] ahead of key macro trends that have positioned us well and helped us achieve record operating results in 2019. Today, we now have a diversified platform with approximately 90% of our business in key growth areas when you look to the future, including our leading presence in China, our leading global ETF [indiscernible] franchise, a broad range of global equity, international and emerging markets equity, alternative capabilities, strong fixed income [indiscernible] capabilities, and our leading digital wealth platform. Our efforts over the past years have placed us in a very strong position to manage through the current crisis while continuing to meet our clients\u2019 needs. The resilience of our employees, the strength of our client relationships, and the breadth of our capabilities were reflected in our consolidated operating results and stable total flows during the quarter, with new outflows of only $2 billion. Despite the extreme market volatility, long-term [indiscernible] increased nearly 40% to a record $87.4 billion, resulting in net inflows in a number of diverse areas for the quarter, including institutional, China JV, money funds, [indiscernible] ETFs and global fixed income in particular. Long-term investment performance during the quarter remained strong in capabilities with high demand, which would include international equities, emerging markets, and a number of fixed income capabilities.  In light of the current operating environment, a key priority of ours is supporting our long-term financial strength and flexibility to ensure we continue to operating from a position of strength for the benefit of our clients and shareholders. Last year, we captured $500 million in efficiencies post the Oppenheimer transaction, creating operating scale as we entered 2020. This was a significant achievement [indiscernible] target ahead of schedule. Since the start of the COVID-19 crisis, we\u2019ve been executing [indiscernible] across our expense base while working in an uncertain environment to create further operating flexibility to strength our liquidity position. We see these actions as creating roughly $80 million in average quarterly expense savings relative to the guidance we\u2019d previously provided for 2020, and this includes variable compensation in a number of discretionary expense areas. Loren will provide more detail later on in the call. Importantly, beyond these short term tactical responses, we\u2019re building on the program we started with the integration of Oppenheimer to leverage our experience to drive further efficiencies and scale into our operating platform, and I\u2019m confident that the experience of the team and the track record [indiscernible].  In addition to these expense measures, we\u2019ve believe it\u2019s imperative to maintain financial flexibility during this uncertain market period, and let me highlight a few of those. First, our partnership with MassMutual continues to yield positive results, including the recent approval of $425 million in capital for real estate strategies and ongoing discussions about [indiscernible] across our alternative platform. These investments and others that may follow speak to the strength of our growing partnership [indiscernible] capabilities. We also plan to redeem approximately $200 million of seed capital from certain of our investment products [indiscernible] year over year.  Finally, we\u2019ve reduced our quarterly common dividend from $0.31 per share to $0.155 per C-share, which we\u2019ll establish as a sustainable dividend going forward and provide almost $300 million in cash annually. Loren will touch more on our decision to reduce the common dividend, but I want to say upfront, this is a proactive decision we\u2019re making. Our liquidity is good and it puts us in a position of [indiscernible] and protection should the market deteriorate from here.  It is clear that 2020 is turning out to be a much more challenging year than any one of us ever would have anticipated. These combined actions will helps us maintain financial flexibility, build ample liquidity to further strengthen our balance sheet [indiscernible] the present uncertain environment, which will allow us to continue to operate from a position of strength. With that, let me turn it over to Loren, who will run through some of the details of the results for the quarter. Loren Starr : Thanks Marty. Before I cover the topic of flows, expenses and capital management, I want to pause on the investment performance slide, which is Slide 5 of the deck that we have posted on our website. You\u2019ll see our long-term investment performance does remain strong at the end of March. We reported 60% and 69% of our capabilities in the top half of peers for the five-year and 10-year time periods, and that\u2019s up slightly from the end of 2019. Marty talked about our diversified global platform with exposure to the industry\u2019s key growth areas. Our platform is aligned with these growth trends. It\u2019s in these areas that we\u2019re delivering strong investment performance, particularly in global, emerging markets and international equities, global fixed income, liquidity, and alternatives. Next, let\u2019s move onto flows. As you can see on Slide 7, we had net inflows in our institutional channel and we continue to see positive net long-term flows in Asia Pacific. Positive net flows of $11.2 billion in our institutional business were driven by the partial funding of the previously disclosed Amalgamated Solutions win, and we also saw inflows into our stable value products as well as other active fixed income mandates. Additionally, we had just under a billion dollars in net long-term inflows into our China joint venture, driven by our balanced fund but also across equities and fixed income products. Colin is going to talk a little bit more about the institutional business a bit later. Our retail flows do remain challenged in the quarter. You\u2019ll see $30.3 billion in net retail outflows driven by ETF net outflows of $6 billion, which did include $1 billion from previously disclosed ETF closures. We also saw outflows in OFI global equity funds, senior loan funds, U.K. equities, and high yield muni funds. Our ETF product range in the U.S. is weighted to domestic U.S. equity, and that was impacted by the flight to liquidity in the period. Offsetting this was $2 billion in net inflows in our European commodities ETFs, particularly in our physical gold ETF. In fact, we were number two in terms of net new assets or new flows in ETFs in EMEA markets. You\u2019ll hear Andrew Schlossberg talk a little bit more about the wealth management and the Americas business a little bit later in the presentation. Next, let\u2019s move to revenues and expenses, turning to Slide 8. You\u2019ll observe that our results were impacted by the reduced market value of our AUM. The decline in revenues in the quarter was driven by lower average AUM, one less day in the quarter than in 4Q2019, and lower performance fees relative to the prior quarter. It\u2019s important to note that the impact of the March market declines and the flight to liquidity were actually quite impactful to our mix and the level of AUM as we entered the second quarter. In fact, the pro forma net revenue yield reduction due to market and mix in the month of March alone was approximately two basis points of net revenue yield, and you\u2019d see that on a go-forward basis. In addition to the impact of the market declines in the period, the weakening of the pound and the euro against the U.S. dollar in Q1 impacted operating expenses. We saw operating expenses flex down in the period by a net $29 million, and that was comprised of a $40 million combined market and FX impact which was offset by a net $11 million increase in other expenses, largely in compensation. As you know, compensation expense is typically higher in the first quarter due to the seasonality of payroll taxes. In light of the uncertainty in the markets and the economic environment, we have undertaken a thoughtful review of our operating expense base with a focus on what we can do in the near term to minimize costs. We\u2019ve determined that we will freeze hiring for the time being. Additionally, we are aggressively managing discretionary expenses and reviewing other aspects of the firm\u2019s expense base. You\u2019ll remember last quarter, we offered quarterly run rate operating expense guidance of $755 million a quarter. We now expect our quarterly operating expenses to be approximately $80 million per quarter lower on average for the remaining quarters of 2020, largely due to the lower compensation as well as the reduced G&A and marketing line items. These expense numbers were based on market and FX levels as of March 31, and they will of course fluctuate up and down based on seasonality and the nature of certain areas of spend. A portion of the reduced expense base is tied to the temporary suspension of travel, events, consulting and other spending affected by this unusual environment. We remain highly focused on identifying additional discretionary and structural levers that we can pull, such that we deliver most effectively and efficiently for our clients within the present environment and longer term. Let me move on to Slide 9 and just briefly point out that non-operating factors impacted our EPS by about $0.14. That was driven by non-cash mark-to-market losses on our seed portfolio as well as an elevated tax rate this quarter. The 27.9% in Q1 tax rate, that was elevated for two primary reasons : our lower share price resulted in less of a deduction on the vesting of shares, and the fact that our seed capital is domiciled in Bermuda where there is no tax deduction for the seed mark-to-market losses. We would expect the tax rate to return to the 23% level going forward. Moving onto Slide 10, looking at the capital management, you will see that we have a credit facility balance of approximately $500 million at the end of the quarter, reflecting the typical Q1 draw down on our facility to fund annual bonus payments, as well as we also had a $190 million prepayment of a portion of our forward contract liability with respect to the share repurchases we made last year. As Marty mentioned, we determined to reduce our common dividend to allow us financial flexibility and to strengthen our balance sheet. This was a very thoughtful decision and one that we believe is both proactive and prudent in the present environment. I want to spend just a few minutes walking through some of the considerations that led to this decision.  First, in light of the present uncertain market environment, a reduction in dividend allows us to preserve liquidity and enhance financial flexibility. It also reflects a more balanced payout ratio given lower expected earnings as a result of the March ending AUM levels. This action around our dividend also allows us to target the common dividend payout ratio at about 40% to 60%. Over time and as market conditions firm, the enhanced liquidity will give us flexibility for the strength in our balance sheet and with an eye towards improving our leverage profile and continuing to invest in the business for growth. We\u2019re committed to a sustainable dividend and the return of capital to our shareholders. We do not anticipate additional share buybacks in 2020. Reducing our common dividend leaves us with ample capacity to buy back stock in the future, however. In the combination of the dividend reduction, continued focus on expense management, and our operating cash flow generation creates ample cushion for liquidity and provides us with financial flexibility. We generate significant cash flow each quarter, and I want to just take a moment to walk you through a few key elements on our cash flow. As a reminder, our net income includes some fairly significant non-cash elements, particularly this quarter with $74 million in non-cash [indiscernible] money market declines. In addition, net income includes deductions of $48 million for non-cash depreciation and amortization, and $47 million for non-cash share-based compensation expense. Also, as part of our efforts to improve our financial strength, we\u2019re looking to redeem about $200 million of seed money investments, all done without impacting our clients, so that will be done in 2020. It\u2019s also important to keep in mind, as I mentioned a moment ago, that in the first quarter we prepaid $190 million of the forward share repurchase liability in connection with posting additional collateral. We have a remaining $220 million obligation which is net of $90 million of collateral that we posted, which will be fully settled by April of 2021. Then finally and perhaps most importantly, we have no debt maturities until Q4 of 2022. The combination of our actions this quarter puts us in a position to be thoughtful about managing our capital structure, improving our leverage profile, and also including the ability to reduce our revolver borrowings to zero and to pay off our 2020 maturity. We\u2019re not committing to any specific actions right now in our capital structure - it would be premature, but our objective is to maintain flexibility through a volatile environment. Nevertheless, we feel good about the optionality that we will have to strengthen our balance sheet while further improving liquidity. In summary, we remain prudent and diligent in our approach to expense and capital management. The steps that we\u2019re taking will further strengthen our balance sheet and provide us with enhanced liquidity to manage through the market volatility and uncertainty while allowing us to create flexibility for investment and growth in the future for our business. Let me now turn it over to Colin, who will have a discussion about our institutional business. Colin? Colin Meadows : Thank you Loren. I would like to echo my colleague\u2019s hopes that all of you are staying healthy and safe in this challenging time. Our institutional business had a strong quarter as our clients by and large are taking a measured long term view in line with their investment objectives. We realized gross flows of $26.9 billion in the quarter with mandates funding in a variety of strategies, including custom solutions, stable value, investment-grade credit, and real estate. Redemptions stayed largely in line with prior quarters at $15.7 billion, largely as a result of rebalancing decisions. These results allowed us to realize long term net flows of $11.2 billion in the first quarter.  We also saw significant net flows of $26.3 billion into liquidity products as clients look to ensure financial flexibility through the crisis. A growing share of these flows resulted from direct liquidity mandates, which will provide us with the opportunity to help our clients meet their diverse investment objectives as they eventually transition these assets into other strategies. Our won not funded pipeline remains very robust at $31.9 billion. Our focus on becoming trusted partners to our institutional clients has resulted in wins across a variety of strategies, including factors, solutions, alternatives, and fixed income. This result compares favorably to prior periods as it\u2019s twice our won not funded pipeline on a year ago this quarter and is a 20% increase over our pipeline in the fourth quarter. We are especially encouraged that institutional clients have remained engaged through the crisis as $14 billion of that total are mandates that were won in the first quarter. As a result of the COVID-19 crisis and social distancing measures across the globe, we\u2019ve transitioned to a completely digital engagement model, and institutional clients have responded. We\u2019ve hosted 20 webinars and webcasts that have attracted over 2,000 clients globally. Our week Market Pulse webinars have been particularly impactful as we responded to client areas of interest, including investment implications of COVID-19, updates on global financial markets, government and regulatory interventions, and implications for key investment strategies and products. Institutional clients are increasingly looking beyond the crisis to understand what\u2019s next for their portfolios and member plans. Clients have expressed interest in a diversity of strategies, including multi-asset, stressed credit, real assets, EM equity and liquidity. We\u2019re also working closely with our Invesco solutions team to engage clients on changes to their investment priorities and portfolios and are introducing Invesco Vision, our portfolio analytics tool to these conversations to provide real time modeling of various scenarios. We believe that supporting our clients as partners through all environments will allow us to deepen these important relationships and ensure client success. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Andrew Schlossberg to discuss our Americas wealth management and global ETFs business. Over to you, Andrew. Andrew Schlossberg : Great, thank you Colin. I\u2019ll refer to Page 12 for some of my comments; however, before discussing the flow results, I\u2019d like to take a moment to describe how our Americas wealth management intermediary team is matching off with the marketplace. The strength of our newly formed distribution group, our consolidated and diverse product lines, and our total client experience strategy that were all put in place late last year, went full force in the first quarter and delivered with much success against multiple market environments of the past few months. Through the combination last year of Invesco and Oppenheimer, we\u2019ve built a distribution engine that is pointed to the future. It\u2019s comprised of top talent in the industry. We\u2019re re-apportioned resources to key channels and clients, and we\u2019re deploying both traditional and more digitally inclined coverage models and tools to the marketplace.  Our go-to-market strategy in the North American wealth management platform and advisor market is anchored on a differentiated three-part client experience model which includes investment insights and thought leadership, portfolio risk and positioning through asset allocation and investment analytics capabilities, and business consulting for advisors to help them grow and manage their practice. While our distribution model was not designed to be 100% virtual in its client engagement, we\u2019ve been operating in this format since early March and we\u2019re deploying this distribution strategy now digitally, with really strong success.  Feedback over the past six months has been positive. It confirms to us that the winners in this space will need to have scale going forward to maintain strong relationships, will need to have advanced technology for both client service and interaction, and a holistic client experience like the one I described.  Just a few stats to give you a sense of the relevance we\u2019ve had with clients the past six weeks. We\u2019ve done over 100,000 virtual and digital engagements with wealth management platforms and advisors. We\u2019ve had over 200 proactive media placements of Invesco thought leaders, and we\u2019ve seen a 50% increase in our web and social media traffic while print fulfillment has declined by virtually the same rate. The team looks forward to being able to combine this virtual engagement with the in-person engagement soon, but we\u2019re confident the past six weeks have validated our strategies, those capabilities, and our ability to accelerate next-generation distribution.  Now I\u2019ll just touch a little bit on the Q1 results in our active U.S. retail business. First, we saw a very strong pick-up in gross sales in Q1 following the integration of our distribution teams in 2019, so $20.3 billion of Q1 gross sales were recorded. That\u2019s our best quarter since combining as one organization, and it\u2019s 50% greater than our Q4 results. We saw record growth in gross sales across all asset classes, in particular global and emerging, equities, and taxable and tax-free fixed income. As you can see on the chart, the March acceleration was really marked by unprecedented amounts of money in motion and a retreat to cash and conservative strategies, and maybe an early stage equity and risk asset reallocation, which I\u2019ll touch on. All propelled the gross sales forward in March. The net flows in Q1 were really a tale of two markets. In January and February, we showed really strong progress with net flows increasing nearly 30% over the Q4 monthly averages, and improvements were recorded across all major asset classes. In particular fixed income moved into positive net flows during that period; however, March changed the picture, as everyone knows. The industry net flows declined in the active mutual fund space by over $300 billion, which represented a 2.7% monthly decline from February\u2019s ending AUM. Our March results in net flows were slightly better than those industry averages at negative 2.5% as investor redemptions spiked and clients raised cash and de-risked.  Our hardest hit in March were some of the asset classes where we are market leaders and we have high AUM exposure, like municipals, international equity, and bank loans, which together were responsible for nearly half of those outflows in the month of March. But we believe these market-leading strategies are some of the same that are positioned to benefit from heavy reallocations and consolidations of client portfolios in the weeks and months ahead. Just a little color since the last week of March, we\u2019re seeing flows moderate quite a bit. The benefit of first stage government interventions, market stabilizing, and early stage reallocations have benefited our gross sales, while not at the same levels as the large March spike. They remain 10% stronger than pre-crisis, January and February levels, and 55% higher than Q4. On the redemption side, it\u2019s stabilizing as well. Net flows are about 60% better than the month of March, but still remain below January and February levels by around 20%, primarily due to risk assets like high yield and emerging, that continued to have a higher than normalized redemption levels in the meantime.  Perhaps just a moment or two on ETF flows before I turn it back to you, Marty. While the ETF flows are not detailed on the page, I did want to give you a sense of the global franchise in our results. Industry-wide, the ETF structures held out very well, pretty well in the market volatility and liquidity squeeze of the past six weeks. We believe the structural advantages of the ETF, notably its liquidity and the tax management benefits in the United States, should encourage high demand as investors cautiously reallocate, wade back into market, and at Invesco we\u2019re ready for the potential acceleration in those flows. Our business has $250 billion of ETF AUM, which gives us top status in smart beta ETFs and provides us with breadth, scale, liquidity, and most importantly long term track records for managing through volatility, diversifying income, and targeting growth. The distribution profile we have, both with existing large ETF users in the U.S. wealth advice channels, one of the fastest growing usage platforms in EMEA, and strong exposure to emerging channels in digital wealth model portfolios and asset allocation puts us in a really strong position. With this backdrop, just a little more detail on what Loren mentioned on the global ETF franchise. We had a very strong start to the year in January with net inflows of around $2.5 billion, which was a great continuation from the $16 billion positive net flows we recorded in 2019, but like our active funds, the second half of the quarter saw major declines at the industry ETF levels, and it impacted our business as well. It resulted in negative $6 billion of net ETF outflows globally, but that\u2019s inclusive of the $1 billion that Loren mentioned from the pre-announced closures.  We were negatively impacted by smart beta funds in key sectors of equity and fixed income which were impacted as investors looked to de-risk, but it was particularly focused on a few funds in U.S. large cap equities, bank loans, and emerging market fixed income. But we had several bright spots with [indiscernible] growing by $6 billion in the quarter and alternatives up a billion, led by our commodity and currency strategies. All of that said, net flows have improved significantly since the heightened market volatility at the back end of the quarter, and we\u2019re seeing our U.S. range improve by around 75% on a net flow basis and we\u2019ve turned positive in a few important categories in taxable and alternative suites, and earning signs of people returning to smart beta strategies. EMEA has remained strong, and we have continued in positive flow territory post the first quarter. With that, Marty, I\u2019ll turn it back to you. Marty Flanagan : Thanks Andrew, and before we get to Q&A, let me just close out this section by saying we had a good quarter in what was an incredibly challenging macro environment. The key points to take away from the conversation we just had, investment performance in key areas continues to be aligned against where marked demand is and a strong investment performance [indiscernible] as we look forward. Total outflows of negative $ billion, an extremely challenging quarter really reflects [indiscernible] diverse platform, including long term flow scenarios we consider strategic. Average assets under management remained flat to Q4, and since that time has gone up since March. Margins are 4% higher than the same period a year ago, reinforcing the power of the combination with Oppenheimer and the benefits of scale. Finally, we\u2019re making prudent decisions around expenses and capital and liquidity, allowing us to build ample liquidity and financial flexibility to support our long term growth. With that, why don\u2019t we open up to Q&A. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open. Dan Fannon : Thanks, good morning. I guess my first question is on the balance sheet, and the dividend also. Thinking about the actions today and understanding that you\u2019re solidifying that for going forward, but wondering how this impacts the institutional business. Clients looking at your financial stability of the parent and thinking about large mandates, particularly in areas such as fixed income, as we remember from the financial crisis for others in the industry, this was an issue in terms of winning business or retaining it. Can you talk about how clients are engaging with you and asking--you know, bringing up parent liquidity and/or the balance sheet strength, and how that may or may not impact the business trends going forward? Marty Flanagan : Yes Dan, let me make a couple comments and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Colin in particular. Look, the whole point is the balance sheet is strong. We\u2019re taking proactive measures around the dividend in particular and then all the other actions that we talked about today as we focus on expenses in this uncertain environment, and freeing up capital from the seed capital. Again, our institutional business has never been stronger and it just continues to grow, so again these actions today, they\u2019re just proactive. It\u2019s just not been a topic for us at all, and what we do today will probably only strengthen that. Colin, anything you\u2019d add to that? Colin Meadows : No, I think you nailed it, Marty. Obviously institutional clients do care very much about the financial stability of the parent. It has not been a topic on clients\u2019 minds up to now. I think they feel that Invesco is a very strong company and, to Marty\u2019s point, I think we think that the actions that we\u2019ve taken to date honestly reinforce that and would expect that our institutional clients would view it the same way. Marty Flanagan : I think the other thing, which is a really important point we\u2019re trying to make, we\u2019ve built scale in this organization. We came into 2020 with some of the highest EBITDA margins in the industry, so that puts you in a very different cash flow position than a number of your competitors. Again, that will all the other actions we\u2019re taking, the company is very strong and, again, we\u2019re just trying to be very prudent at this moment. Dan Fannon : Understood. I guess as a follow-up, the $80 million a quarter in additional savings, it seems like some of that is kind of run rate with some of the business practices in place around no travel and other things, and also market related with AUM. If you could maybe talk about specific removal, permanent removal of cost versus temporary, and how--if this is headcount, if there are certain areas outside of just people staying home and markets being lower. Marty Flanagan : Yes, so let me start on that and then I\u2019m going to turn it to Loren. [Indiscernible] we talked about really in the last quarter post-Oppenheimer, we already had turned our eyes to driving additional operating efficiency into the platform, and it is platform-type undertakings, so it is--that\u2019s where we get the additional scale. That slowed down, quite frankly, in this first quarter as we turned our attention to making sure that all our employees are safe, that they were able to work from home, that we could interface with our clients and serve our clients, so the immediate actions to do just what you\u2019re talking about. The things that you should do in a crisis is hit the brakes, stop [indiscernible], and where you can stop spending, stop spending, always with an eye to making sure that you\u2019re serving your clients, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. We\u2019re now at a place where we\u2019re back to looking at going forward and building this program that we started, and that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to take the longer, more permanent types of expenses [indiscernible] as an organization.  So back to the point - we know how to do it, we\u2019re not just talking about it. We\u2019ve proven it time and time again, and last year with the Oppenheimer combination [indiscernible] it\u2019s just not an idea. We know how to do it and we have a proven track record of doing it. Loren, anything to add? Loren Starr : The only thing I would add is--I mean, one of the things that no one\u2019s presuming is that post this COVID situation, that everything is going to be back to normal, right, so I think we are learning things, as everyone is, around how we can operate perhaps differently, and that reflects a whole slew of some of the costs that are business as usual costs around travel. Honestly, we\u2019ve gotten very good at using digital method for interacting with clients and how we use space and other things, so I do think there is a variety of things that are being looked at and that we will continue to explore with respect to what should the operating model look like going forward.  Beyond that, I think right now we\u2019ve definitely hit the brakes. We\u2019ve done this before. This feels very much like the way we managed through the financial crisis, and you can look back to how that worked through. But we\u2019ve been very diligent and good about stopping spend around areas that I think we can keep a handle on for some period. The bigger opportunity is, as Marty already alluded to, is around some of the structural opportunities around technology, operating platform, which we are well down the path of looking at. Marty Flanagan : Yes, and I do want to reiterate Loren\u2019s comment, and I tried to highlight that. The way that we\u2019re operating, and I\u2019m sure many organizations, it is absolutely going to change how we operate going forward, just how we operate the business. But really, the client interactions, they have never been more robust, more frequent, more meaningful than this period that we\u2019re in, and it\u2019s good for our clients, it\u2019s good for the organization, and it will just create a very different dynamic. The operating model and costs associated with it will definitely change going forward. Do we know what [indiscernible] right now? No, we don\u2019t, because frankly our heads have been down taking care of our clients and taking care of the business, but it is going to be a changed world, and I\u2019d say for the better, frankly. Dan Fannon : Got it, thank you. Marty Flanagan : Thanks Dan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning. You cut the dividend by half, but it still seems like you\u2019re taking a defensive position here given market conditions and outflows. You talk about the preservation of capital in the press release, you talked about not buying back stock this year. That sort of seems like the cut may have been a half measure. [Indiscernible] cut the dividend further or outright eliminate it altogether, maybe why not consider dropping the preferred dividend for a number of quarters in order to strengthen the balance sheet, allow yourself to buy back stock, and really take advantage of the downturn in the market that we see? Loren Starr : Yes Ken, good question. Our decision to reduce our common dividend by 50% was done certainly with an understanding that the environment could weaken from here. It wasn\u2019t necessarily our working assumption, but certainly we\u2019re not thinking that we\u2019re seeing a snap back going forward. But we don\u2019t intend, and we certainly don\u2019t intend to make another difficult decision like this again, and we do feel confident that this was the right action at the sufficient level to give us the flexibility that we desire to manage the balance sheet, even if the environment were to deteriorate from here, and we\u2019ve stress tested this all which ways. I do think it\u2019s important to note that while 2020 is emerging to be more challenging than we anticipated, we are still operating, as Marty mentioned, from a position of strength. This isn\u2019t a reactive move driven by liquidity concerns at all. Instead, we are proactively addressing the opportunity that we have to improve our leverage profile and to maintain financial flexibility, which is going to be required to invest in client enhancing and growth capabilities going forward.  We feel comfortable that this was absolutely enough, that what you were suggesting is not needed, and of course we looked at everything when we were setting this. It was not a decision taken casually, and there was a lot of stress testing involved. Ken Worthington : Then I think you guys regularly disclose quarter to date net flows on these earnings conference calls. How do things look so far in 2Q for long term net sales? Loren Starr : Yes, I don\u2019t think we typically have done that. We sort of stopped that practice a while back, Ken, so I think we\u2019re going to continue to not do that, just because it\u2019s still too short a time frame to really judge what is going on. I think obviously March was a horrible month. Things are better, clearly, in the way the market is evolving, but beyond that I don\u2019t want to get into actual numbers. Ken Worthington : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brian Bedell : Great, thanks. Good morning folks. Just a clarification, Loren, on a couple of the guidance points you made, just the absolute level of the fee ratio in 2Q, the down two basis points. Is that implying a little under 37 basis points - do I have that right, or is that a different number? And then the cost run rate, I think you said, if I\u2019m not mistaken, 80, lower than the 755, so the second quarter quarterly adjusted expense run rate should be about 675. Do I have those correct? Loren Starr : Yes, so on the latter one, yes, 675 is what we\u2019re suggesting as the average run rate for the remainder of \u201920, and so yes, we\u2019re saying that in terms of the net revenue yield less performance fees, that we\u2019d be suggesting two basis points off of where we ended in Q4. That is the guidance that we\u2019re providing. Brian Bedell : I\u2019m sorry, so where you ended in Q4? Can you-- Loren Starr : I\u2019m sorry, for Q4, not where we ended. For the Q4 net revenue yield. Brian Bedell : I\u2019m just trying to get the actual level of the revenue yield that you\u2019re talking about for 2Q on an ex-performance fee basis. Loren Starr : All right, so the actual quarter was 38.7 for the quarter, so we\u2019re talking about two basis points less, so 36.7. Brian Bedell : Okay, so it is 36.7 - okay. Just wanted to make sure I had that. Then just on the--you know, it sounds like obviously the sales momentum is a good story here, both on the institutional and retail sides. Can you talk about which areas institutionally that you\u2019re seeing that sales momentum and the timing of that $31 billion, $32 billion won but not funded pipeline in terms of actually getting funded? It sounds like the solutions mandates, I think there\u2019s only a few billion left that\u2019s included in that $31 billion pipeline, so maybe if you can just talk to the sales momentum on the institutional side in particular. Marty Flanagan : Colin, will you pick that up? Colin Meadows : Sure, happy to. Momentum has been strong. As I mentioned before, the pipeline is--won not funded pipeline is growing. In fact, it\u2019s actually grown each of the last five quarters consecutively, and so we feel that we\u2019re being quite responsive to institutional client needs and that\u2019s reflected in wins.  In terms of when it will fund, what typically happens is that pipeline will largely be funded through the end of the year. It usually takes about two to three quarters for the pipeline at any given time to be funded. There\u2019s obviously some things that will tail off beyond that, but that\u2019s a good expectation. In terms of product, it really is going to be client dependent and depending on needs. We are seeing strong momentum, continuing momentum into our solutions and factors capabilities, continuing momentum into alternatives [indiscernible] real estate and real assets, continued momentum into various fixed income categories. In many ways, it reflects the portfolio dynamics of institutional clients globally. Brian Bedell : Have you been able to create institutional products for the Oppenheimer funds yet or is that still a work in process, and what would be the timing of availability for those separate accounts? Colin Meadows : It\u2019s still a work in progress, but we are getting increased inquiry, particularly in the current environment. It\u2019s not reflected enormously in the pipeline as we see it, but in the longer term pipeline that we have that\u2019s beyond won not funded, so these would be things that were more on the qualified side, we\u2019re starting to see early interest. Marty Flanagan : In particular, where we\u2019ve seen it so far is on the retail side of the platform. It\u2019s global equity, emerging markets equity, and institutionally that is exactly what\u2019s happening now, so those are the conversations that there\u2019s a lot of interest. Loren Starr : I think particularly in Europe and Asia. Brian Bedell : I was going to say, yes, on the CCABs and Luxembourg sales product, are you getting traction there on the Oppenheimer side in terms of demand? Loren Starr : There\u2019s still strong interest. It hasn\u2019t grown dramatically. We are still talking about a couple of hundred million in terms of AUM, but the interest is still there. The product is still considered very attractive. Obviously in the current environment, things slowed down, and that number is with all the market impacts. Brian Bedell : Great, thank you. Marty Flanagan : Greg--I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything, Greg? Greg McGreevey : No, I think you captured it. I think the interest is in the areas that you mentioned, and we\u2019re seeing that interest continue to pick up, so I think we\u2019re pretty excited about the longer term opportunity or the intermediate term opportunity for a lot of the products, that demand is strong and our performance in those products is incredibly strong. Brian Bedell : Great, thank you. Loren Starr : Thanks Brian. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Katz with Citigroup. Your line is open. Bill Katz : Okay, thank you very much for taking the questions. Appreciate some of the new disclosure in your supplement as well.  First question, you had mentioned the targeted payout ratio of 40% to 60% for the dividend. Is that GAAP payout ratio or an adjusted payout ratio? Loren Starr : That\u2019s based on adjusted, Bill. Bill Katz : Okay. Is that a forward 12-month type of dynamic? Loren Starr : That\u2019s a forward 12-month type of dynamic - yes, absolutely. Bill Katz : Okay, then just turning to the fee rate for a moment, I appreciate some of the color from the conversation as well. Could you break down the net impact of volumes coming versus going out in both retail and fixed income, you know, setting market dynamics to the side because there seems to be a lot of different moving parts? Just trying to get a sense of how to think about the fee rate, other than your outside market moves. Loren Starr : There\u2019s a lot of ins and outs. We had some dynamics where you had--you know, money market was a huge flowing in, that\u2019s at a lower fee rate, typically 10-plus basis points but lower fee rate. You had the funding of a significant solutions win, which was also single digit fee rate. You had Qs coming in, which are sort of non-fee driving. It\u2019s hard to parse all that through. That\u2019s why I provided the guidance, just because it was really hard, I think for anybody to really understand the full impact, plus you obviously had the market which was obviously compressing some of the higher fee equity components within our mix. So again, it\u2019s a complicated fee rate thing, and even hard for me to forecast which is why I typically don\u2019t do it, but we wanted to give you that two basis points, which we think sort of puts you at least statically where you should be, based on March. Bill Katz : Okay. Just one final one - thanks for taking all three of them this morning. In terms of looking at your balance sheet, debt went up, cash went down. How do we think about a targeted leverage ratio, whether it be a function of market cap or enterprise value, or maybe more focused in terms of debt to EBITDA? What\u2019s a reasonable target and when do you think you can get there? Loren Starr : It\u2019s a good question. As I mentioned, we\u2019re not committing at this point in terms of de-levering. We are very confident, though, that we have the ability to have the financial flexibility to do so. In terms of what that could mean, obviously taking our credit facility down from 508 to zero, eliminating the obligation that\u2019s remaining on the forward purchase of $220 million by April, and then finally we have the $600 million that\u2019s coming due in November of 2022. Under a very dire scenario going forward, we could cover those requirements handily through the existing liquidity without further borrowing. Our focus would be on having the flexibility to de-lever as we come up to those events, or maybe even sooner if we decide that\u2019s the right thing to do. I think if you were to look at our debt to EBITDA ratio, we\u2019re higher than we are comfortably wanting to be right now. I think we would rather see--if I\u2019m just looking at debt to EBITDA, where debt is our long term debt, let\u2019s not provide anything around the preferred at this point, sort of getting closer to 1.25 times to 1 time has been the long term target that we\u2019ve had in the past, and we\u2019re not that far away from that number, but there is opportunity for us to bring that down further going forward. Marty Flanagan : I think the main point that we\u2019re trying to make today is just literally to create optionality, right, and it\u2019s such an uncertain market and I don\u2019t think any one of us has the answers as to what things will look like, but these steps again are very proactive. It just puts us in a much stronger position to [indiscernible] if markets start to recover, and that gives us the different options. That\u2019s the main point. Bill Katz : Okay, thank you very much for taking all the questions this morning. Thank you. Marty Flanagan : Thanks Bill. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is open. Shaun Kelley : Hi guys, this is actually Shaun Kelley [ph] on for Mike. With the pullback in the seed capital, can you give us an update on the outlook for launching new strategies and products? Loren Starr : Yes, maybe I\u2019ll just touch on it, and then Marty or Greg or others can--. I mean, I think we have been very focused on launching products to the benefit of our clients around--particularly in the area of ETFs. We\u2019ve been very fortunate to have the seed provided by our clients effectively, so we have not had to put seed in to launch those products. That is our preferred method of launching products generally. Now, we can\u2019t do that with all products, some alternative products and others do require so co-investment. I think as Marty mentioned, we\u2019ve actually seen partnership with MassMutual really opening up some doors, where they themselves have stepped in, in certain cases to provide seed and co-investment to some of these product launches, which has been really helpful because it offsets our need to use our own balance sheet.  I don\u2019t know, Marty, if there\u2019s anything you\u2019d like to add to that? Marty Flanagan : Why don\u2019t I ask both Andrew and Colin to make a comment or two? Andrew, you want to start? Andrew Schlossberg : Yes, from a seeding perspective, the only thing I\u2019d mention is the product line that we have across the ETF complex and the mutual fund complex, given all the work that we did over the course of the last year or two in consolidating acquisitions and right-sizing our product line, our seed capital needs in those areas are fairly limited at this point and, as Loren said, much of it coming from clients, where we do have launches on the drawing board for the ETF side. Marty Flanagan : Maybe Colin, you can [indiscernible]. Colin Meadows : Sure. From an institutional standpoint, I think we feel quite comfortable with the support that we\u2019ve received over the years from a seed capital standpoint, so I can\u2019t think of anything that\u2019s been slowed down, nor would I anticipate anything going forward.  I might reinforce Marty\u2019s point and Loren\u2019s point, MassMutual has been a fantastic partner to us in the support that they\u2019ve shown for a number of our strategies, particularly in alternatives. They\u2019ve been just tremendous, and we would expect that relationship to continue to blossom going forward. Shaun Kelley : Okay, thanks. Then just going back to flows, are you starting to see any improvement in Asia, since they\u2019re a little bit further along with dealing with the pandemic? Marty Flanagan : Yes. There was [indiscernible] in the quarter, and it just continues to accelerate at a retail level. The institutional engagements with the important clients out of there also continues to be quite strong. Again, that\u2019s continuing as we move into this quarter. Maybe Greg, do you want to add anything from your perspective, because there\u2019s a lot of demand from the fixed income group too over there. Greg McGreevey : No, I think you\u2019ve got it covered, Marty. Marty Flanagan : So did I get your question? Loren Starr : Yes, I think I\u2019ll just mention, I think Asia continues to be a positive contributor to flows. They\u2019ve continued to, even in the height of this, produced positive long term flows. There is nothing indicating that that\u2019s slowing down. We\u2019re still launching product, people still are interested in the products that are being launched, and it is broader than just China. I think Japan as well is beginning to show up as a potential contributor with opportunities around fixed income in particular.  Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kenneth Lee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Kenneth Lee : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just in terms of the--I had a question, you mentioned there\u2019s a lot of non-cash items within your net income. What\u2019s your best view of ongoing free cash flow generation for the company, and how could this potentially evolve in the near term? Thanks. Loren Starr : Cash flow from operations is strong. We see somewhere between, and this is based on current March end levels, so again somewhere between--you know, in excess of $950 million to a billion of cash flow from operations going forward. Even in the stress scenario, that number holds in reasonably well, so that\u2019s a huge contributor. Again, the non-cash elements, when you add those back to earnings, you get to those types of numbers. Hopefully that gives you a sense of how much cash generation we are providing just from the business. Kenneth Lee : Great, and just one follow-up, if I may, just in terms of the MassMutual. Wonder if you could provide a little more detail in terms of that approval of capital for, I think you mentioned it was real estate or alternative strategies. What are the potential time frames that we could see some initial products, and perhaps you could better frame the opportunity you\u2019re expecting there. Thanks. Marty Flanagan : Colin, could you take that, please? Colin Meadows : Sure, happy to. I think as we mentioned earlier, MassMutual has contributed $425 million to two of our real estate strategies. The first is a non-traded REIT strategy, really targeted at the retail market. We\u2019ll figure out the timing of when we would launch that strategy as the markets start to settle down in real estate, so you can get some sense of value and valuation. That was a key capital investment, and then they\u2019ve also contributed an anchor LP position in one of our Asia real estate funds as well. Kenneth Lee : Great, thank you very much. Marty Flanagan : Thank you. Loren Starr : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Lee with KBW. Your line is open. Robert Lee : Great, thank you. Thanks for taking all the questions. Sorry to go back to the balance sheet questions, but just to clarify, Loren, should we be thinking in terms of use of cash over this year, obviously some liquidity, but that\u2019s to kind of chip away at the revolver over the course of the year and then it kind of reloads first quarter of next year? Is that the right way to think about it? Loren Starr : In general, yes. I mean, this is obviously extraordinary times, and I think you\u2019ve certainly seen other companies draw fully on their credit facilities just to get cash. That\u2019s not what we\u2019ve done, but I\u2019d say the normal sequence would be, yes, there\u2019s a normal draw that happens on the credit facility in the first quarter, and then we generally pay that down. I\u2019d say that would be the right way to think about it, and the cash flow that we generate would allow us to do that, for sure, would allow us to pay down the credit facility, would allow us to, as I mentioned, fully pay back the forward commitments and still generate excess cash. Robert Lee : Okay, great. Then maybe as a follow-up, and I appreciate the disclosure on the pipeline and quantifying it, but give us a sense of if we look at that mix, I know there\u2019s a lot of factor-based strategies there, how would the fee mix compare to the overall? Your overall fee rate, is it in line, a little lower? How should we be thinking of that, with that in the mix? Marty Flanagan : Yes, let me make a comment. I don\u2019t know if we have that information, but as you know also, Rob, I wouldn\u2019t confuse fee rate levels with fee rate profitability. The factor business [indiscernible] has very high margins, even [indiscernible] quite frankly same thing with the [indiscernible] business.  But Loren, do you have a sense of--? Loren Starr : Yes, I think the pipeline has a fee rate, because of the growth in solutions, that\u2019s just a handful of basis points below the firm\u2019s aggregate fee rate, so it has come down a little bit, but it is still roughly in line with the firm\u2019s overall [indiscernible]. Robert Lee : Okay, great. That was all I had, and everyone stay safe and healthy. Thank you. Loren Starr : Thank you Rob, appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Ryan Bailey : Good morning, this Ryan Bailey on behalf of Alex. I actually had a question about the OFI MLP dynamic that was going on. I was wondering if of the $400 million accrual that you guys have taken, about how much of that you expect to recover, and then if you have any color on timing and whether the $400 million is the maximum we should be thinking about underwriting as an expense. Loren Starr : Yes, I think you saw in the quarter, we basically moved--I mean, we reflected the full--it was about 380--I think a little more than $380 million that was reflected through a purchase price adjustment. Marginally there was a small component that went through transaction integration. That\u2019s been reflected. In terms of the expectation for recovery, I guess one, it\u2019s going to take a while in terms of ultimately figuring out what the final number is, but we do believe that the number that we provided and we took through our balance sheet is the right number, obviously, but it is an estimate. Ultimately it needs to get confirmed as we go through the full detail of those client by client impacts, and that\u2019s not going to get known for probably many quarters, so you\u2019re probably talking more about a 2021 understanding of where that shows up. In terms of recovery, we have expectation that we\u2019ll going to recover the substantial component or a majority of that number, if not all. It is still something where we have to work through insurance, the claims that we\u2019re putting through as well as ultimately the normal indemnification that came as part of the transaction when we took the business over. So right now, at least in our thinking, there is nothing substantial or material that you need to think about in terms of net cash out as a result of this. Ryan Bailey : Got it, okay. Thank you. Then maybe just one more. Can you give us a reminder on any impact of fee waivers on the money market business as we roll through maybe another couple of months at lower yields on those products? Loren Starr : Yes, it\u2019s an interesting dynamic. I\u2019d say we\u2019re fortunate in that the majority of our business is institutional money market business, which tends to be lower fee, so the topic of waiving is not nearly as relevant or impactful as it is if you had a large retail component. That said, I think as we move into 2020, there probably could be some amount of fee waiving that we\u2019ll need to do in order to maintain a certain limited amount of yield on these products. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a material amount of money. It\u2019s probably order of magnitude, and again these are sort of swags a little bit, so it could be a little more than $10 million on an annualized basis. But we are still looking at those numbers right now, but as I said, it\u2019s not that material for us given our mix of business. Ryan Bailey : Got it, thank you very much. Loren Starr : You got it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Most of them have been answered. I guess number one, could you remind us of or maybe update us about any regulatory or other calls on cash and liquidity at this point? Loren Starr : I\u2019m not sure if--the only thing that we all know is the amount of cash that we have within our European subgroup, that\u2019s nothing different than it\u2019s been in the past. It\u2019s sort of in the range of $700 million--not a range, that\u2019s the number, but let\u2019s call it $700 million, so that has not changed. That\u2019s still roughly the number. Beyond that, there is nothing I\u2019m aware of where we have any need from a regulatory perspective to provide cash or capital.  If there\u2019s something specific, Brennan, you\u2019re getting at, please ask. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m answering your question. Brennan Hawken : No, you did. I just was curious whether or not that number had changed or whether or not there was anything that we didn\u2019t know about. If you don\u2019t know about it, then-- Loren Starr : No, there is nothing else. It\u2019s the same old thing. Brennan Hawken : Good enough, cool. Then thinking about the pay down plans, I appreciate the comments on how you guys view long term debt to EBITDA and that ratio. The increase or the draw down of the half billion for the revolver to fund the obligation that you guys have coming up, is the idea there that that\u2019s going to be a priority, to pay that down first, or does the plan around the revolver fold into the overall plans around long term debt, or is that though of separately? Loren Starr : Well, we absolutely have the capacity to pay it down, so I think it\u2019s a flexibility topic, as to would we rather pay down the revolver, would we rather keep cash? I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re at this point ready to commit to the timing of the pay down or when we would pay that down, but I would say that we are going to--in terms of a net debt perspective, it\u2019s effectively paid down as we get into the end of 2020. You should think of it that way. How we actually manifest it, I think we\u2019re still looking at. Marty Flanagan : Again to reiterate the point, we\u2019re just creating flexibility right now. We think that is absolutely the most important thing to do until there\u2019s greater clarity in this environment. The message to take away is we have the capacity to pull any one of those levers, and when we get greater clarity, we\u2019re going to pull the lever that we think is most impactful to the organization. Brennan Hawken : That is clear and very sensible. Thank you. I was just hoping to squeeze in a follow-up here. The $80 million, I think it was Dan who asked about that initially. A lot of that seems to be based on--and I understand we\u2019re not really on terra firma given everything that\u2019s going on with COVID, on a few different levels. Are you guys going to update us as you continue to work through, thinking about how much of that would go from natural current environment changes to more structural expense declines, or should we--is there a certain portion of that that we can start to think about as a more structural decline in the expense base? Marty Flanagan : Yes, as Loren said, our action is very similar to what we did during the financial crisis. The first thing you do is you protect the organization and the employees, so you protect [indiscernible] as you protect shareholders. That\u2019s exactly what we did, and [indiscernible] effectively stop spending, [indiscernible] stop spending and it creates really some security and some flexibility. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing right now [indiscernible] which you\u2019re going to hear from all of our peers, I expect. We happen to be in another position where coming out of Oppenheimer, we said we\u2019re moving to what we call Day 2, to look at greater, more permanent operational opportunities to create ongoing efficiencies in the organization. We were heading down the path, we had to hit the brakes to take care--to get on top of this, the COVID challenge. We\u2019re now turning our heads back to that, and as we get greater clarity and confidence of when we come out of that, we will absolutely share with everybody.  But again, I just want to come back to we know how to do it, we have a track record of doing it, and we had already started down that path, and we\u2019ll just pick it up as things start to settle. Loren Starr : Yes, but we\u2019ll definitely give you clarity as we get through this, no question, Brennan. Brennan Hawken : Yes, okay. Thanks for taking all the questions, really appreciate it. Marty Flanagan : Absolutely. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Stephanie Liu : Hi, this is actually Stephanie filling in for Mike. I wanted to get your updated views on ESG, maybe. Do you think the environment today lends itself to increased demand for industry products further in the industry broadly speaking, and then maybe within Invesco, do you see an uptick in demand, and any sort of opportunities you see from here on the ESG front? Thank you. Marty Flanagan : Yes, why don\u2019t I make a comment first and then Andrew can speak to it, and Colin and Greg are in the middle of it, [indiscernible] happen. I think there\u2019s no question, and again I think it depends on what--where you sit. ESG is just an absolute necessity for any investment organization to be deeply engaged in. Beyond what your opinion, it\u2019s absolutely a business necessity in Europe. If you are not very strong, you are incredibly disadvantaged. It is gaining legs here in the United States and also Asia. But what I will you as an organization, we are deeply engaged in ensuring we have ESG capabilities embedded in our investment capabilities and various offerings.  Andrew, do you want to start with some of the--maybe talk about the [indiscernible]. Andrew Schlossberg : Sure, I\u2019ll make a couple comments, and others may want to as well. I think the environment, and we\u2019re positioned for it, is probably going to create more demand around ESG and just more momentum. I\u2019d go beyond product - I know your question focused a bit on that. We certainly think there will be ESG-focused product and we\u2019ve been building that, or have built that and will continue to look at it.  I think the bigger area that we\u2019re focused on, and Greg might want to comment on it, is how we\u2019re embedding ESG into fundamental strategies as a factor of the way that they\u2019re looking--that we\u2019re looking at active investments. I think that\u2019s a growing expectation of all of our investors--I\u2019m sorry, our clients around the world. I think that\u2019s an area of focus for us too. Then lastly, I think more and more, as people are putting together asset allocations in portfolios, at the retail level it\u2019s going to continue to be a factor that drives those aspects too. I think we\u2019re seeing it on all fronts. Maybe while people are triaging in various environments right now, you may see a short slowdown, but in the medium or long run, I don\u2019t see any of that abating. Greg McGreevey : The only thing I\u2019d add to that is I think that the focus--that we\u2019re seeing this from a lot of different participants overall, and there\u2019s just a tremendous focus that emanated in Europe, so I think we\u2019re seeing that in a lot of discussions that we\u2019re having with clients in Asia and clients in North America overall, so that\u2019s coming in the form of demand and we\u2019ve got a number of products that have kind of hit that demand, that stem from things that were doing in our alternative business to things that we\u2019re doing in fixed income and other areas. We have a wonderfully strong capability, we think, in ESG, and so we\u2019re trying to match up that capability to the point that Andrew made, in embedding those into our investment teams and making sure that we\u2019re kind of proactively, really not just touching the surface on ESG but really embedding that in the things that we can do from an investment standpoint to make decisions that are going to support ESG mandates overall. We\u2019ve got a strong capability, we\u2019ve got increased demand, we\u2019ve got a lot of products that we\u2019ve already put into the marketplace, and we think that while it may be stalled for a couple of weeks in light of what\u2019s gone on in the environment, once we get through this, which we will, that demand, we think will come back online and we\u2019re well prepared to be able to handle that, we think. Marty Flanagan : Colin, anything you want to add on that? Colin Meadows : No, I\u2019d just reinforce the points that were made. It\u2019s a core skill, and I think as Andrew mentioned, the ESG book is a product but, equally important and maybe more importantly as a factor that can be applied across portfolios, is of critical importance. In fact, our ESG capabilities have been core to a number of our wins, particularly in the solutions space where that ability was critical from a client standpoint. We feel quite good about our capabilities. Marty Flanagan : So that was the last question, and again I appreciate everybody just spending time with us and engaging, and we\u2019ll be chatting soon. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s conference. Please disconnect at this time.",

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I would like to turn the call over to your speakers for today, Marty Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; Loren Starr, Chief Financial Officer; Allison Dukes, Deputy Chief Financial Officer; Greg McGreevey, Senior Managing Director, Investments. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin. Martin Flanagan : Thank you very much, and this is Marty Flanagan. Thanks for joining. Much appreciate it. What we'll do today is I'll make a few introductory comments and Allison and Loren will go through the financial results, and then we'll all be available for Q&A. And if your [indiscernible] presentation on the website. Before we begin, I would like to recognize that after 15 years, this is Loren's final earnings call. He's been an incredible partner and CFO for all those years, and incredibly well-regarded, internally helped us through all of our growth and some challenging times during various crisis, including this one. But I will say, value to his trusted counsel on a good basis, we'll get to benefit from that as he becomes a Vice Chairman until March of next year. And at that announcement, we did announce that Allison will become the CFO on August 1. Allison has been with us through -- since mid-March and has served as Deputy CFO, working with Loren and his team, and I will say the transition is going to [indiscernible]. Allison's prior experience as the CEO                . Well, let's get started, and I'm on Slide 3 if you are following along. So prior to the onset of pandemic, we were on the path to execute our long-term strategy, which was in                 our ability to meet client needs, while returning Invesco to organic growth. And over the past decade, we've had the disciplined act on our highly efficient industry views ahead of key macro trends, and we think that's positioned us very well. With the onset of pandemic, we reacted dramatically, as many firms did, focusing                 and focused on ensuring the financial strength of the firm. During the quarter, we remain committed to helping the way these clients and communities navigate the challenges that presented themselves as the virus spread. In fact, we've transformed how our employees work with one another, how we interact each and every day. The vast majority of our employees continue to work from home, and we fully embedded                 which is helping all of us to work more effective and efficiently together through technology-enhanced outreach and constant communication we've made supporting our teams, while they                 promote to be a top priority. We have also reshaped our client delivery model to a fully digital engagement platform, which allows us to meet our clients' multiple technology platforms wherever they are in the world. We're able to work effectively and safely while serving our clients at the highest levels. These efforts combined with a strong investment performance and high demand capabilities led to improved low fundamentals during the quarter. Long-term flows in EMEA turned positive in the quarter and we continue to see net inflows in Asia Pacific. Our institutional pipeline is at a record level. Our Solutions capability enabled over 50% of the pipeline, created wins in customized mandates during the quarter, and we continue to get very strong impact from our clients. Retail flows improved during the quarter but were net outflows. Long-term flows into fixed income capabilities were strong by channel and                 Loren will give color and insight to flows in just a minute. During this uncertain environment, we are continuing to reallocate resources to further grow while turning our focus of building operating scale in the organization. Our total operating expenses were in line with guidance that we provided last quarter, despite the market rebound demonstrating                . In addition, we strengthened our balance sheet in order, paying down revolver, improving our leverage profile and increasing our liquidity. Allison will cover details of our expenses and capital management in a moment.  Invesco has built a global, diversified business with depth, breadth and resiliency to delivery positive outcomes to clients through various market cycles. We have the foresight and discipline to invest in several macro trends that are shaping the future of our industry. As a result, we are now well positioned in areas of high demand with the majority of our investment capabilities aligned with key future growth areas, a significant and growing Solutions effort and leadership positions in alternatives, ETFs, fixed income factors, emerging market capability as well as fast-growing China market.  Our efforts place us in a very strong position to manage through crisis while continuing to be               ]. The resilience of our employees, the strength of our client relationships and the breadth of our capabilities continue to achieve more solid operating results. We remain focused on helping our clients navigate with a challenging market environment by running a disciplined business and working towards a return to organic growth. Let me close my introductory comments by noting that Invesco is committed to addressing the long-standing racial inequalities that became the focus protests worldwide during the quarter. In support of Black Lives movement, we further strengthened our commitment to addressing social injustice by deepening our understanding on this topic, driving progress in our communities, and further expanding our diversity and inclusion efforts across the globe. As an example, we support the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce efforts to pass the hate crime legislation in Atlanta -- in Georgia, excuse me, which was recently signed by the governor, and took other steps to address systematic racism in our communities.  With that, I'll turn it over to Loren and Allison to go through results and then we'll get into Q&A. Loren Starr : Yes. Great. Thank you very much, Marty. Slide 5 summarizes our investment performance. We had 57% and 69% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers on a 5-year and a 10-year basis, reflecting strength in fixed income and global, emerging markets, and Asian equities. These are all areas where we expect to see strong demand from clients globally. Moving to Slide 6. We ended the quarter with $1.145 trillion AUM. AUM increased to $118 billion in the quarter from increased market values. Turning to Slide 7. Long-term net outflows in the second quarter were $14.2 billion, that was largely reflecting the market dynamics in U.S. retail. Flows in this market improved from levels experienced in Q1. Net long-term outflows and active AUM were $13.4 billion, and net long-term outflows in passive AUM were $0.8 billion. Our ETFs experienced net outflows of $0.4 billion, that was largely driven by net outflows in the S&P 500 low volatility ETF, the Invesco FTSE RAFI US 1000 ETF, which was offset by net inflows in our EMEA physical gold exchange-traded fund and the Invesco National AMT-Free Muni Bond ETF. These ETF flows are against an industry backdrop of very narrow flows, about 90% or $119 billion of total ETF flows of $131 billion went into fixed income and alternative/commodity strategies. In fact, the top 10 funds in the industry drove more than half of the industry flows. Our QQQ fund, in fact, was among the top 10, it saw net inflows of $6.1 billion in Q2. But I'll note that we do not include our QQQ net inflows in our net long-term flows, but as nonmanagement fee-earning flows. We saw improvement in our retail net outflows with $14.6 billion in outflow, down from $30.3 billion in Q1. On the institutional side, our net flows were slightly positive at a net $0.4 billion in the quarter, but that was down from net inflows of $11.2 billion in Q1, and I'll provide a little more color on these flows in the next few slides. Looking at flows by geography, you'll see that sales outside the Americas and EMEA and Asia were positive. EMEA ex-U.K. returned to positive flows in the quarter of $1.8 billion from net outflows of $1.2 billion in Q1 and that was driven by strong flows into our gold exchange-traded fund. We also had net inflows in Asia Pacific of positive $2 billion, and that's up from $0.2 billion in Q1, driven by institutional investment-grade fixed income mandates in Japan and net inflows into our balanced funds in our China joint venture. We don't have net flows by asset class on this slide; however, I want to point out that we saw strength in the fixed income across all channels and markets in the second quarter with net long-term inflows of $6 billion. So now let's move to Slide 8. The timing of institutional funds can be lumpy, and we did see some slowdown as it was in the quarter. But as you can see, our institutional pipeline remains full. In fact, grew to a record level during the second quarter to $33.4 billion from $31.9 billion. Our pipeline is robust across both asset classes and geographies. And significantly, our solutions effort enabled more than half of the pipeline underscoring the success of the consultative approach to the sales process that we're using. Moving to Slide 9. Let me add a few comments about our active U.S. retail. Long-term flows for the industry were slightly negative, negative $2 billion, but they were highly bifurcated between fixed income, which was positive $145 billion, and equity, which was $115 billion. Industry inflows into fixed income were led by taxable funds, which is about 90% of the total inflow for the industry. You can see on the active U.S. retail slide, that our ending June AUM grew 11% from the end of March. And importantly, our fee rates were strong and remain consistent period to period. Our average monthly gross sales remained at a healthy pace for Q2, similar to the growth trajectory of the pre-COVID December, January and February levels, and that's also up 7% from the effectively combined firms Oppenheimer Invesco results in Q2 2019. Net flows improved 30% in Q2 versus Q1 across all asset classes, but they were challenged by our large exposure to equity funds. Equity funds for Invesco represent about 65% of our active U.S. retail AUM, and we also had limited exposure to taxable fixed income, that's only about 8% of our active U.S. retail AUM. And so again, given what happened in the industry, you can sort of see the context of what happened to our flows. Fixed income in the Americas, however, along with the industry, shifted back into positive net long-term inflows for the quarter, and that was led by our muni products suite. Our heavy AUM exposure in the 5 largest industry outflowing sectors in Q2, which were U.S. large-cap value, U.S. large-cap core, bank loans, international equity and global allocation that accounted for 70% of our active U.S. retail net long-term outflows. So now that we're done with flows, let me turn it over to Allison, who will comment on revenues, expense management efforts in the period as well as our capital management activities. Allison? Allison Dukes : Thank you, Loren, and good morning. Turning to Slide 10. You'll note that our revenues decreased $112 million from Q1, driven by lower average AUM in Q2. Average AUM in Q2 was $1.12 trillion, 5% lower than $1.18 trillion in Q1. Net revenue yield ex-performance fees was 36.8 basis points, down 1.9 basis points from Q1 and largely in line with guidance we provided for the quarter. Net revenue yield was impacted by the change in mix of our AUM, following the flight-to-liquidity experienced in March, going slightly by the increase in markets in the period. Given the mix shift we're seeing in our AUM, including the impact of larger, lower fee institutional mandates, we expect a continued modest decline in our net revenue yield ex-performance fees in Q3. Our total adjusted operating expenses were $675 million in Q2. We guided in April that we expected operating expenses to be around $675 million based on market and FX levels as of March 31. Through prudent expense management, we were able to maintain the total operating expense level despite the market's rebound. Like many firms, we're taking a hard look at our expense base in light of the ongoing global pandemic and its impact on both markets and clients. Much of our operating expense improvement has been realized through pandemic-related restrictions on travel and other business operations. Additionally, we're being thoughtful about hiring and have tightened discretionary spending. While these measures have and will continue to benefit our operating expense base, they are temporary improvements and we would expect those expense categories to return to a more normalized level when travel and in-person engagements resume. Marketing expense was unusually low this quarter, and we would expect that to modestly increase in 3Q. Beyond these temporary reductions, we believe we have an opportunity to create more permanent improvements in our expense base aligned with our strategic plan. We have the benefit of scale with nearly $1.2 trillion in assets under management, which allows us to allocate resources and simplify our operating complexity through coordinated execution across our global firm, all tied to our long-term client-centric strategy. As Marty noted, we've managed through the process of rotating to work-from-home status for nearly all of our employees, and we've ramped up our ability to virtually engage with our clients. We're now focused on strategically positioning the firm to deliver positive outcomes for clients and compete effectively in an industry that is being reshaped, like so many others, to a post pandemic new reality. Our strategic evaluation has several components, including enhancing client outcomes, improving organic growth, reducing complexity of cross-functional activities and streamlining our operating environment. We'll provide more detail around expected improvement to our expense base in the coming quarters as we complete the strategic evaluation. Moving to Slide 11. You'll see that nonoperating expenses negatively impacted earnings for the quarter. Adjusted EPS was $0.35 compared to $0.34 in Q1 with adjusted nonoperating expenses, reducing EPS by $0.07. This included $53.2 million of net losses in equity and earnings, driven by noncash market valuation adjustments, primarily in our CLO holdings, which are reflected in our results on a 1-month lag. The unrealized CLO losses do not provide tax benefits due to the jurisdiction of our holdings, contributing to an elevated tax rate for the quarter of 24.4%. For the remaining quarters of 2020, we estimate our tax rate to be between 24% and 25%, while the actual effective tax rate may differ due to nonrecurring or discrete items. Turning to Slide 12. We reduced our revolver balance by $182 million in the quarter, consistent with our commitment to improve our leverage profile. In addition to using excess cash to reduce leverage, we seek to improve liquidity and financial flexibility. To that end, our balance sheet cash position improved to $987 million in Q2 from $941 million at the end of Q1. Our goal remains to build cash to $1 billion in excess of our regulatory capital requirements. And at June 30, we were holding approximately $280 million in excess of regulatory requirements. As we've indicated, we're building financial flexibility in these uncertain times, and we believe we're making solid progress in our efforts. We're committed to a sustainable dividend and to returning capital to our shareholders. In summary, we remain prudent and cautious in our approach to expense and capital management while reallocating our resources to position us for growth. Our focus on driving greater efficiency and effectiveness into our platform, combined with the work we have done over the past 15 years to build a global business with a comprehensive range of capabilities, puts Invesco in a very strong position to meet client needs, run a disciplined business and grow our franchise over the long term. With that, I'll turn it back to Marty for some closing remarks. Martin Flanagan : Thank you, operator, very much -- excuse me, Allison and Loren. Can we turn to questions, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Glenn Schorr, Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Wanted to ask a follow-up on your comments on the retail industry and that part of the business. You obviously mentioned the positive flows for the industry in fixed income, negative in equity. And that's been going on despite pretty good equity markets overall. Obviously, this year came too with some ups and downs. So you have really strong gross sales, but redemptions are also high. So can we talk about what's within your control? How are you adapting maybe your retail servicing and platform portfolio construction? You put that all in a package of what we can do because the reason I ask, obviously, is retail and equity outflows is offsetting altogether good stuff that's going on at Invesco. Martin Flanagan : Yes, Glenn, great comments. You're right. I will say the flows this last quarter were quite huge. And there was fund stocking we're looking to when you have huge exposure to categories that are not                 so way to do product. We continue to build the capabilities that are going to see persistent growth over time. But I think your answer is something very different. Engagement model with wealth management platform just continues to evolve dramatically. And it's been very, very important for institutes to develop sort of much Solutions capability. So don't think of it just as institutional. Think of it as engagement with important FAs that exist within platforms. And that is, frankly, the first place we started. So that is an area that's -- that gains -- really starting to make difference, as I was talking about a few minutes ago. I think the other thing that has been a very important thing evolving is building models for the platforms and having the ability to Solutions in our self-indexing capability to build models for the platforms, and that is also something that's very, very different. And we had visited a very important model in one of the important platforms. But to build the models, you literally have to have the component parts, right? So you literally need all major asset classes that you would imagine to be available within them all. And what we see happening in the future, more and more it's going to be Solutions engagement, building models, whether it be either through buys and not necessarily a discrete model profile. So those are capabilities that                 successful because they're really the most competitive and the largest asset pool in the world. And I think also, the other element is more and more the wealth management channels are looking to firms such themselves to help them be successful with the client base. And that has really done a very good job through Invesco consulting. So any one of those -- any combination of those is really going to be the difference maker. And again, I think, it's also important, not just active, but having capacity capabilities and factors and alternatives to give some totality of the offering. So hopefully, that's helpful in the engagement point that you're raising. Glenn Schorr : Absolutely. Allison, if I could just ask one quick -- but if you're doing one, I'll move on to the back. It's cool. Allison Dukes : No, please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Just a quick follow-up then, sorry. You mentioned the CLO mark. Could you give us a little more detail in terms of the composition and the size of CLO holdings and where you fit in that stack? Allison Dukes : Sure. So I think probably most important to recognize about the CLO mark this quarter is that we noted it's on a 1-month lag. So that mark-to-market, it reflects the valuation at the end of May, would obviously decline substantially from where the valuation would have been at the end of February and what was reflected in our first quarter results. I think over the course of that time frame, the valuations fell probably 51% thereabout. And we would expect our third quarter mark would be reflected as of August 31. We know through June, CLO valuations have continued to improve. So I would expect some modest improvement from there, hard to predict, and we wouldn't want to predict, but we do think we took the majority of that pain and our losses there. In terms of our equity and earnings and what comprises that, it's obviously our co-investments in CLOs, but also in private market funds, and it's about 75% of that mark came from CLOs and about 25% came from our private equity funds. Loren Starr : And Glenn, I would just say, our co-investments, it's all equity. So we have the lowest level in the stack. So it does move around quite a bit based on these kind of valuation mark-to-markets. But again, it's all unrealized, noncash flow. And I think we have roughly, in terms of aggregate numbers, about $60 million of investment in the CLO equity as of end of May. Operator : And our next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Allison, maybe if I could just go on to the expenses, the $675 million, obviously good given the market had rebounded quite a bit since the earnings call. I just want to check if that's -- if -- even with this rebound, that seems to be sustaining more into 3Q, is that still if you're viewing as a good comp rate in -- on a quarterly basis in the back half? And then just you mentioned about the expense strategic revaluation. Just -- obviously, there's much more to come on that, but could that include both on product rationalization and other areas to try to improve the organic growth by eliminating products that aren't growing? Allison Dukes : So let me start -- thank you, let me start with third quarter expense guidance. I would say, again, some of what we've -- as I noted, some of what we've enjoyed thus far would be considered temporary in nature. I don't expect anything changes there in the third quarter as it relates to travel or in-person engagements. We are operating in a very consistent environment in the third quarter and like all of us don't really know when that ends. We would expect marketing expense, the advertising component of that might pick up modestly in third quarter. Those expenses can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. We're certainly not going dark. We're actively out there in the market with our clients virtually. And so I would expect that might be a little bit higher than what we saw this particular quarter. But net-net, our expenses will probably be somewhat in line quarter to quarter. And as we think about broader expense reviews, not at this point, what I feel like we're in a position to make any decisions around any sort of strategic decisions that would impact revenue. But rather, what we would be thinking about is looking at what I would consider all the typical areas you would expect us to review. And that would include organizational efficiency and effectiveness, real estate optimization, tech and office efficiency and third-party spends. So we'll be thinking about all those different expense categories and making sure that we're creating a really disciplined expense state to weather any revenue environment as we continue to progress. Brian Bedell : Okay. Great. And then maybe just the trajectory of flows moving into July in terms of I guess, how is the sales -- the combined salesforce doing? Is there more traction? Obviously, it is still a tough environment. And then on that institutional pipeline, that continues to be strong, maybe if there's any commentary on timing of when you think some of that will fund? Just to get a sense of the trajectory of overall flows moving into 3Q? Loren Starr : So Brian, yes, I'd say we are gaining more traction on the U.S. retail side. So it's definitely sort of an improving but still challenged environment. I think you have access, so you can see the flows on the ETFs that has definitely improved. I mean, it was steadily improving every single month within Q2 and through sort of mid- to late July, we've got $2.3 billion of positive long-term ETF flows. So we're seeing definitely some more traction. I think Allison kind of mentioned that. We think the overall flow picture is going to be improved generally relative to where we are in the first half, which is not saying much because of tough first half, but sort of signs of green shoots coming through. And certainly, as I mentioned, both EMEA and Asia Pac, everything outside the U.S. is definitely nicely positive at this point and continues to look to be so. Brian Bedell : And the timing on the institutional side with the Solutions? Loren Starr : Pipeline -- pardon -- and so on the pipeline, we feel pretty good about the timing of the pipeline sort of funding generally within the next 2 or 3 quarters, I mean, that's generally what's happened. I mean there has been some slowdown in some of the, for example, more traditional real estate funding as that market is sort of -- obviously had to sort of readjust and we value on certain properties. But some of the other pipeline elements, which is sort of broad-based across the different capabilities, fixed income IQS and so forth, those are -- look like they're going to be funding within this year, for sure. Operator : And our next question is from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous. M. Davitt: One more quick follow-up on the expense guide. As we think about heading into the 3Q against the market improvement, why would we not see more pressure on the compensation side given the market recovery? And to what extent there is some variable compensation tied to that? Or is there not really any of that relationship anymore? Allison Dukes : No. I think important to note in our expense guidance, both as it related to the guidance for second quarter and going forward, that was assuming market and FX levels at quarter end. So certainly, if there -- that could fluctuate, and there would be variability in several expense line items, compensation being the biggest driver should we have some sort of market improvement. So we would expect those to work in tandem. But absent any change, all things being equal, that's really what our expense guidance is based on. M. Davitt: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then more broadly, I guess there was some chatter over the last month or so about a new QQQ tracker in a more traditional ETF wrapper that you could actually make money on. So could you speak to how you plan to market that alongside the existing QQQ Trust to talk about the opportunity there. If I imagine, the current QQQ users care more about its liquidity, and it would be tough to get them to move to something else. Loren Starr : If I can or do you want to go? Martin Flanagan : Go ahead, Loren. Loren Starr : Yes. So again, just in terms of the QQQ announcement, I mean, I guess, to step back and we -- Invesco has already had a very long-term relationship with the NASDAQ by AUM. NASDAQ is the largest index partnership for Invesco's ETF business. In the U.S., we have 24 ETFs managed against NASDAQ indices, accounting for over $120 billion in aggregate assets. In fact, NASDAQ also plays a critical role as a calculation agent for our BulletShares index. But we're -- in terms of this particular announcement, we are not actually at liberty to discuss new offerings, specifically because we're in this quiet period. But what I would say is that this announcement and the addition of new funds to the \"Invesco QQQ suite\" really does show how we're strengthening our relationship between both Invesco and NASDAQ. So more to come on that one, Patrick. It's very exciting. But we can't really get into much detail because of just the timing of the registration. Operator : Our next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Martin Flanagan : Dan, you may be on mute. Daniel Fannon : Can you hear me now? Martin Flanagan : Yes, we can hear you, Dan. Daniel Fannon : The question is on expenses in the U&D margin in the second quarter. What drove the outsized decrease in the expense side of that relationship versus revenues? Allison Dukes : So what drove the improvement in second quarter versus first quarter relative to revenues? I mean, largely compensation expense concurrent with market as the average flows were a little bit better, but still relatively low, certainly relative to what we expected. And then a large part of that expense improvement was -- did come from G&A. And the suspension of travel and in-person engagement that is a significant driver of the expense reduction. And again, would be considered somewhat temporary in nature, although we're certainly not in a position to forecast what normal looks like anymore. Loren Starr : And again, you'd mentioned marketing. So marketing was down significantly from $35 million in Q1 to $16.6 million in Q2, and so that was a big driver. Allison Dukes : Yes. And that would be both advertising expenses and some of the travel-related marketing expense. And some of that advertising, we would expect to be modestly higher going forward. Daniel Fannon : Okay. I apologize. My question was on the distribution expense. The relationship between the revenues and the expense. Did net distribution margin improve quarter-over-quarter? Allison Dukes : Sorry, we didn't hear distribution at all. Distribution fees were abnormally low in the quarter given really the TA waivers, low activity, lower marketing support, which would just be related to a lot of the lower COVID-related activity, too. And we would expect some of those activity and fees to be a little bit higher in the third quarter, but it was unusually low in the third quarter. Loren Starr : In the second quarter. Allison Dukes : I'm sorry, in the second quarter. Loren Starr : As Allison mentioned, I mean, the pipeline is going to record to levels, but it is largely sort of being enabled by kind of Solutions efforts as well as some index kind of capabilities, IQS. And those tend to be at a fairly low rate. So what we're seeing probably both on the institutional side as well as the retail side in terms of interest around lower fee products, ETFs is that -- I mean, this is a continuing trend that we've seen for years now. And so there isn't any sort of \"stabilization.\" And what we did show, obviously, on one of the slides was, I mean, the actual fee rates on the products themselves are pretty stable. But just in terms of where the client demand is coming, it's largely around sort of these lower fee things. Now the margin on these capabilities are still very good. They're larger. They're bigger wins. And so you do have very fine margin dynamics, but it will sort of drive the free rate as sort of modestly lower sort of quarter-to-quarter, and it's hard for us to forecast. And we don't provide real guidance because it is really just a matter of time how these mandates fund and where the client demand comes from. I mean, if we were to see, for example, international emerging market capability coming back with strength, that would obviously have a very positive impact on fee rate right now that -- as we talked about, that's been sort of an outflow for the industry and we see that as well, and that tend to be a higher fee part of the mix. Martin Flanagan : Yes. So I think -- just to reiterate Loren's point. It is also consistent with where the demand is, right? So you just saw outsized demand in fixed income. And again, lower fee dynamic than some of the international resets. It will be reflective of a fine demand in                . Operator : Our next question is from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Kenneth Worthington : Maybe first, Invesco is a big manager of direct real estate and REITs. Maybe first, remind us how big your real estate investment business is? What kind of exposure you have to retail, hospitality and other COVID-exposed investments? And in your slides, you had 24% of your won but not funded mandates were in alternatives, how much of these are focused on real estate? Loren Starr : So let's see. In terms of real estate, total AUM is about -- $80 billion of AUM is in real estate. I think about 2/3 of that is going to be direct real estate and the rest is securities. In terms of the pipeline, it is a good component of it, but it's not the majority. It is still a sort of multibillion element within that $34 billion. But what we're seeing in terms of the pipeline, it's being dominated more by the Solutions, which is really not necessarily real estate IQS type related mandate. So there's still a strong interest, but it's not one that is driving our pipeline. It is part of the growth, but it's not the majority of that growth. The business as a whole is doing very well. There's been a lot of client outreach and sort of working through this new environment. There isn't an overexposure to sort of those hospitality elements per se. And globally, there are a couple of funds and a couple of sort of mandates that probably do have some degree of more exposure than others. But we are not sort of positioned on the outside of sort of our exposure to those types of mandates, which is a good thing. And so it has not had major impacts on our business at all. I would say the bigger topic is really just working through the tenants and the others, the clients to make sure that we continue to see income streams coming off of those properties, which we are -- we're still seeing strong income generation on those properties. So, so far, so good. We feel pretty comfortable that the business is continuing to grow. And as I mentioned, it is a component of our pipeline, but not the dominant one. Kenneth Worthington : Okay. Great. And then other revenue is down. I think you guys called out lower front-end fees. What is that? Is there any offset in distribution? Or is it 100% margin? And what is the outlook going forward for that fee component? Loren Starr : Yes. So the lower front-end fees, it's a small bit. I mean, it's been like $4 million difference quarter-to-quarter. So it's not a large amount. Those are elements that still get paid and are offset, though, on the other -- on the distribution pass-through. So it's not a major sort of margin topic. The transaction commissions and transaction -- real estate transaction fees were a component of the other revenue as well. As I talked about, things kind of slowed down, sort of the market was taken a pause in understanding valuations. So we did see sort of a bit of a dip in Q2 in other revenue. We would hope to see that line item begin to sort of at least stay at this level if not improved somewhat modestly into the next quarter. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Michael Carrier : Just on capital and cash flow. I think you mentioned where your cash level was, and I think you wanted to get that above like $1 billion or so. If you can just kind of run through how you think about like quarterly cash flow? What's kind of tied up or taken? And then just priorities for that cash flow? You mentioned paying down the revolver, but also kind of expanding that cash level. So just trying to get a sense over the next few years where those priorities are just given what's free each quarter that comes out? Allison Dukes : Sure. So yes, as noted, this quarter, we are at about $280 million in excess of our regulatory and liquidity requirements. We do have a target of trying to get to about $1 billion of cash in excess of those requirements, and we did make good progress this quarter as we continue to pay down the revolver and build those cash. As we think about inside the quarter, any particular cash or capital requirements. Nothing that wouldn't be, I would say, quite obvious in terms of both our common and our preferred dividends. But otherwise, inside of the quarter, it's fairly straightforward from here. And our priorities are to continue to support our future growth, to strengthen our balance sheet and also to return excess cash to shareholders. And so as we think about that, we do seek to : one, continue to make progress towards this $1 billion excess cash target; two, continue to reinvest in the business in the form of seed capital; and three, remain committed to a sustainable dividend, returning capital to our shareholders. And then right now, as we've noted before, share repurchases aren't a priority at this moment as we continue to focus on delevering and improving our balance sheet. But they certainly are an option and one that we will keep front and center over time. Our revolver balance is down to about $336 million. We did make about $180 million of progress there. We do seek to continue to manage that down over time. We don't have any other debt requirements coming up until our '22. So we've got some time before our next maturity. And we will be looking to just modestly improve our leverage over time and seek to keep ourselves within the targets that we set ourselves along with the rating agencies and financial flexibility we're trying to create for the uncertainty of the environment we're in. It's a balance. I would say, it's taken in totality. We're trying to balance all these objectives. Operator : Our next question is from Bill Katz with Citigroup. William Katz : Okay. Loren, best of luck. Quick question on Direct Index. Can you talk a little bit about how you sort of see the pros and cons of the business through the prism of your existing passive business? And any opportunity or threat to the active business to the extent that, that takes off? Martin Flanagan : Yes, I'll make a couple of comments, and Greg can chime in too. What we've said for a good number of years, the reality is clients are using a combination of passive factor                 build portfolios. And so we have those capabilities. We're growing in all of those areas. And if you look over the years, they've grown quite dramatically. You need to align that also with what our clients are doing and what our platform is doing. They're using fewer and fewer money managers. And if you cannot offer the totality of the asset classes that they want, you're really going to be disadvantaged. And I'd say that becomes more relevant during this pandemic period where there is no question in my mind, clients are turning to their existing relationships and looking to do more with them. So I think this environment has accelerated that. And again, we can do more for clients, be more relevant for clients and we just -- it's been a very important part of our strategy, and I think it's been the right one. Gregory McGreevey : The only thing I'd add to that, Bill, is, I think, Marty is spot on if this allows us to come in as clients have really changed their risk budget. They're using a lot of indexing and then other things that they're trying to get their returns, but we can come in and have that conversation about indexing with them. And it requires us to holistically understand their portfolio, so we can come in and be more relevant by providing an index solution. So I don't think, in the premise of your question, that this is anything but complimentary to both the client relevance. And then ultimately, we think we can do, given our broad capabilities, other things that we might be able to add on to the client to have a more holistic relationship. And that's starting to actually bear fruit in some of the relationships that we've got some index wins already. It just changes the conversation on a go-forward basis. William Katz : Okay. And just a follow-up, it's a little tactical in nature, so I apologize for that. But just on the institutional money market business, I appreciate it's probably a low fee start point. Is there any incremental pressure on the underlying fee waiver? Or if there is a fee waiver, could you maybe quantify what that pressure might be as we look into the third quarter? Loren Starr : Yes, Bill. I think right now, actually, very little is being waived. So we have, as you know, sort of traditionally all been really focused on the institutional money market business. And so we do have a very small retail component. And so to us, the idea of sort of fee waivers probably could be, worst-case, sort of $10 million to $20 million. We've not seen any of that sort of come through. So we continue to watch that space. But that would be kind of the math kind of pain that we would see. I don't think there's anything imminent in Q3 that we're sort of need to sort of put you on alert on, but it is sort of if you sort of stress test this even further, that's kind of the pain that we would suggest you... Gregory McGreevey : Yes. Maybe just to put a little finer point on that, Bill. At the end of the second quarter, we're waiving advisory fees on only 2 of our institutional funds. It's really a de minimis amount. And we've also waived additional fees to support certain fund share classes. So any fee waivers have really been more on the retail side. And I think Loren gave you kind of the aggregate numbers, which, as we sit today at the end of the second quarter, it's a fraction or roughly half of the number that he mentioned on a go-forward basis. William Katz : Can I squeeze just one quick question on that. I'm just sort of curious, as rates are tumbling globally and more money is moving into fixed income, is there pressure on just sort of active fixed income fee rates for either Invesco or the industry at large, just given what's happening with sort of the net yield component? Loren Starr : Yes. So I mean, on an institutional basis, always, I think it's all competitively bid, and so there's always a threshold where it doesn't make sense. And so we generally walk away from things that don't make sense. What we are seeing though is more interest in using index products and sort of the -- which is, again, just a theme that we continue to see, which tends to be lower fee. And maybe not as much around active. So we are in a good position to be able to talk to clients about both and be able to serve them in a way that, again, could create a solution that might actually make the best of both for that client. So I'd say that does continue to sort of be part of the fabric of our discussions with clients, just generally fees, whether it's fixed income, equities, alternatives, it's all there. Operator : Our next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Just wanted to try to see if it was possible. I know that it's really, really hard to predict this stuff. But I believe, Allison, you had said that you expect some continued fee rate pressure. You called it modest. So how should we contextualize modest? Does that mean that it might not be as significant as it was in the second quarter, but we should look to the general trend in recent years? Is there a good way to think about quantifying that? Allison Dukes : Yes. Thanks, Brennan. I would say it's your first guess, which is it should not be as significant as it was in the second quarter. And it is, as we talked about before, given mix shift, given client demand and where that client demand goes, it's very hard to predict, and we wouldn't want to fall in the trap of trying to over predict that. But we would not expect it to decline at the magnitude it did in second quarter, and we would expect it to be somewhat modestly lower. Loren Starr : Yes. We were talking in terms of basis points, not whole basis point. So definitely modest. Brennan Hawken : Got it. Okay. Then sort of a small item, but just saw in the headline and it was -- struck me as a little odd. I saw a headline just the other day that you guys turned over the PM that had messed up the rebalancing in the product, the equal weighted product this quarter. At first, sort of not surprised to see the headline and then I sat and thought, well, why does such a product need a PM? Actually, after all, isn't it just like a program that automatically goes through and reallocates on an automated basis. So again, sorry, if this is a little bit of a simplistic or stupid question, but how does the management of those products work? Loren Starr : Do you want me to -- okay. So I think just in terms of the title portfolio manager, I do think it's one that may mean different things in different contexts. So they are the named portfolio manager for these products, and every product needs to have a named portfolio manager. But in terms of sort of active bets and other things, it is more operational than it is sort of active selection. So I wouldn't get wrapped up in the terminology of PM. I do think in terms of what particularly happened there, again, we -- number one, take care of our clients. That's our first job always. And -- so that is what we did in terms of sort of correcting the impact on the fund and then ultimately, correcting the source of the error in terms of what happened, where we've moved operations to our existing center of excellence around that type of index rebalancing and other activity, which is done for the ETFs generally and they've had no issues whatsoever. And so all that has been moved over to that center. So in terms of kind of what we've been telling our clients and then trying to make sure that people understand is that, that particular has been addressed, and we feel good that we've taken care of clients overall. So again, we're not happy that it happened, but we do feel that it has been addressed. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Christopher Harris : So positive flows in the institutional channel. But I think redemptions are probably a bit higher than you guys would like to see. Can you talk a bit about what's driving the redemptions in that channel? And how should we be thinking about the prospects for redemptions versus what is a record backlog for sales? Loren Starr : Yes. Good question. I mean when we look at sort of likely to terminate that, that number is sort of lower than we've seen in a long time, too. So we are not seeing sort of a spike up in sort of redemptions line. It sort of offsets this growing pipeline that we've seen. So there's always -- it's hard to predict. And we've said, please don't take guidance or ask for guidance on redemptions because clients will just tell us and they are very much aware of their own circumstances, whether it's a middle -- say, it's a Middle East client who needs money for -- because oil prices or whatever it might be. I mean those types of things happen, and they're completely outside of our control. It's generally not a performance topic. It's often a client topic that drives that. And -- but you're right. I mean, we have seen some rebalancing and movement in the portfolios, as I imagine, given the change in environment was radically different post this COVID situation where some people are sort of taking sort of wait-and-see mode and maybe willing to put things into more liquid type of assets. Flip side too, in some cases, the most liquid assets are the ones that have been eliminated because they wanted to get it out. And so where they could take assets, they did. And in many cases, we had liquid alternative products that were sold. So there's a whole set of stories probably around each client redemption. So it's hard to sort of characterize them. It's not going to be easy. Operator : Our next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein : Just a quick follow-up on the capital management. I was curious if you could talk to sort of any additional free cash flow needs, sort of post dividends over the next 12 months, including the forward purchase liabilities, which I think it was around $300 million as of last quarter, but a quick reminder, that would be helpful. And I guess just any unresolved issues related to the MLP calculation or anything like that. So really just trying to get a sense for any sort of abnormal demands on cash flows as we think about you guys working back towards rebuilding the cash position. Allison Dukes : So yes, the remaining obligation on the forward is about $242 million. It does fluctuate quarter-to-quarter just based on stock price and that would be fully settled in April of next year. So we still got some time on that. As it relates to any other cash flow, on the MLP matter, that is a complicated matter, and it is one that involves layers of accounting over the years, and it's going to take some time to work through. We don't expect there to be any cash obligation on that until late in '21 at this stage. Operator : There's no further questions at this time. Martin Flanagan : Okay. Again, thank you, everybody, for joining us. Thanks for questions and the dialogue, and we'll talk with you soon. Have a good rest of the day. Operator : And thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines, and thank you for your participation.",

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you any objections you may disconnect at this time. Now I would like to turn the call over to your speakers for today, Marty Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; Allison Dukes, Chief Financial Officer; and Greg McGreevey, Senior Managing Director of Investments. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin. Marty Flanagan : Thank you and thank you, everybody for joining us this morning. So over the past decade, we've undertaken several strategic initiatives and made meaningful investments and key capabilities that have position us well to deliver for our clients in competing what is now a highly dynamic and competitive industry. Looking forward, we continue to be very focused on executing our long-term strategy, which is intended to further strengthen our ability to meet client needs while returning the firm to sustainable organic growth. With the continued uncertainty in the economic environment we saw during this third quarter, driven by the global pandemic again, we remain very focused on our clients and ensuring that we're meeting their investment objectives, while also been really focused on running a very disciplined business in this uncertain time. These efforts combined with strong investment performance and high demand capabilities lead to long-term net inflows of $7.8 billion during the quarter across a broad variety of channels, geographies and asset classes. Retails outflows significantly improved during the quarter and our Solutions-enabled institutional pipeline remains robust, long-term flows into fixed income capabilities continued to be strong, and we saw net inflows in Asia Pacific and EMEA regions during the quarter, and net outflows in the Americas improved significantly. Net inflows in Asia Pacific during the quarter were $8 billion up significantly from the $2 billion we saw in the prior quarter. As we noted during the second quarter call, we've undertaken a strategic evaluation of our business, and this evaluation has several objectives, including enhancing client outcomes and improving organic growth, reducing complexity and streamlining our operating environment. We see opportunities to invest in areas of growth aligned with our strategic plan and supported by data and analytics and these include areas such as ETFs, China, Solutions, Alternatives and Global Equities, as we also look to optimized primarily in areas of the business that do not directly touch clients. We expect this optimization will reduce our normalized annual operating expenses by a net $200 million by the end of 2022, and Allison will speak more to this in just a moment. In addition during the quarter, we continued to manage our balance sheet by reducing the outstanding borrowings under the revolver, while improving cash balances. Invesco has built a global, diversified business with depth and breadth and resiliency to deliver positive outcomes for our clients through various market cycles. We have invested ahead of several macro trends that are shaping the future of our industry. As a result, we are now highly competitive in areas with strong demand with the majority of our investment capabilities aligned with key future growth areas. These include a significant and growing Solutions effort and leadership positions in fixed income, ETFs, factors, global equities, which would include emerging markets, alternatives and the fastest growing China market. And again, we remain very focused on meeting the needs of our clients in this very volatile environment, while running a disciplined business and working towards sustainable organic growth. Before I turn the call over to Allison, let me comment on the 13D that was filed by Trian on October 2nd. The valued shareholder that we're looking for and we're regularly engaged with our major shareholders in a constructive dialogue aimed at further strengthening on our business and driving sustainable growth. We welcome Trian as a shareholder and are in active and constructive conversations with them. And as you appreciate, given we're still in the process of engagement, we are not in a position to comment further on this topic during the call today. With that, let me turn it over to Allison. Allison Dukes : Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everyone. Slide 5 summarizes our investment performance. We had 63% and 68% of actively managed funds in the top half appears on a 5-year on a 10-year basis, reflecting strength in fixed income, global equities, including emerging markets and Asian equities, all areas where we continue to see strong demand from clients globally. Moving to Slide 6, we ended the quarter with $1.218 in AUM. Of the $73 billion in AUM growth, approximately $53 billion as a function of increased market values over the quarter. Turning to Slide 7, our broad-based platform generated long-term net inflows in the third quarter of $7.8 billion, representing 3.3% in annualized organic growth. Notably, we generated positive net inflows and activate AUM of $1.8 billion and passive AUM of $6 billion. Our ETFs experienced net inflows of $12.4 billion, including $6.8 billion and long-term ETFs in $5.6 billion in QQQs representing the second largest net flows in the industry for Q3. The QQQ ETF delivers significant marketing benefits that drive brand awareness, and it increases Invesco's footprint, leadership and relevance in the ETF market. Including the success of the QQQs, our US listed ETFs have their best quarter in their 15-year history with those flows representing 10% of the overall industry flows in the quarter, which is 2 times our industry ETF market share. Long-term ETF flows in the US and EMEA were diverse across asset classes in the third quarter, including broad equity and commodities, fixed income, ESG oriented equity and sector equity. Positive ETF flows for contributors to the meaningful improvements in our retail net outflows, which narrowed to $300 million in the third quarter. On the institutional side, we had net inflows of $8.1 billion and I'll provide a little more color on those flows on the next few slides. Looking at flows by geography, you'll note net outflows of $4.4 billion in the Americas, an improvement of $10.5 billion in the quarter. This improvement was driven by net inflows into ETF, various fixed income strategies, our stable value capability, our balanced risk capability and improvement in redemption rates particularly in our international growth and value fund. Flows turns positive in the UK, generating $1.4 billion for the quarter, which was driven primarily by flows into our institutional quantitative equity capability. EMEA net inflows were $2.8 billion driven by the strong close and to our gold, S&P 500 and EQQQ exchange traded funds. And finally, Asia Pacific delivered one of its strongest quarters ever, with net inflows of $8 billion driven by institutional fixed income mandates in Japan and significant net inflows and the balanced fixed income and equity funds and our China JV. Our JV has been in operation since 2003 and our reinvestment in China has positioned us uniquely to take advantage of this long-term macro growth opportunity. It's worth noting that we continue to see strength in fixed income across all channels and markets on the third quarter with net long-term inflows of $8.8 billion, that's following net long-term inflows of $6 billion in fixed income in the second quarter. Now moving to Slide 8, our institutional pipeline remained strong at $31.9 billion on the heels of a strong pull through in the institutional pipeline during the third quarter. This pipeline remains robust across asset classes and geographies, and our Solutions capability has contributed to meaningful growth across our institutional network. Our investments thus far into our Solutions team have been impactful to the dialogue we are having with institutional clients as evidenced by the pipeline. Turning to Slide 9, as Marty mentioned in his opening remarks, we are well positioned with investment capabilities aligned to key future growth areas. These include the growing Solutions effort, capabilities in fixed income, ETF, factors, global equities, including emerging markets, alternatives and the fast-growing China market. These are high-performing capabilities and are illustrative of the breadth and diversification of our product offering. In addition, these are capabilities that present tremendous opportunity in large and growing parts of the market. On the left side of this slide, we highlight certain capabilities in China, where we have seen strong demand and good performance, as well as our deep and varied fixed income offerings. Through the Oppenheimer transaction, we broadened our platform with sizable global equity offerings, including Developing Markets and the OFI International Growth capability. We have good performance in these areas, and we're well positioned for client demand to return. Additionally, we offer a range of real estate investment strategies across risk spectrums and geographies. On the right side of the slide, we illustrate ETF capabilities upon which we will look to expand. The QQQ ETF is one such example. As announced earlier this month, we've expanded the QQQ product suite which will allow us to market the capability to new and different investors. In addition, we're seeing client demand for ESG capabilities. Year-to-date, industry ESG ETFs have gathered over $20 billion in net flows. We manage over $5 billion in ESG ETF. The investors sold our ETF as our top selling ESG ETF with net inflows of $400 million in the third quarter. We will continue to invest in these areas and we believe there's opportunity to take market share and that these capabilities will be important contributors to our organic growth. Turning to Slide 10, you'll note that our revenues increased $59 million or 5.6% from the second quarter, driven by higher average AUM in Q3. Net revenue yield, excluding performance fees were 36 basis points, down eight-tenth of a basis point from the second quarter. 75% of the decline in the yield was largely driven by the growth in our non-fee QQQs. Outside of this, the fee rate declined modestly due to other mix shift we experienced across the products in the quarter. Total adjusted operating expenses increased 1.7% in Q3 against the 5.6% increase in revenue, creating positive operating leverage. The $11 million increase in operating expenses is driven by higher compensation as a result of strong market growth in the quarter. Operating expenses continue to be lower than historic activity levels due to pandemic driven impact to discretionary spending, travel and other business operations. Now turning to Slide 11, for a little more color on our expenses overall. Having successfully completed the integration of OppenheimerFunds and delivering savings of $501 million against the combined organizations' expense base, we see additional opportunity to optimize our model. As I noted in our earnings call on July 28th, we conducted a strategic evaluation across four key areas of our expense base; our organizational model, our real estate footprint, management of third party spends and technology and operations efficiency. Through this evaluation, we see an opportunity to invest in key areas of growth, aligned with our strategic plan and supported by data and analytics, including ETF, China, Solutions, Alternatives and Global Equities, while creating permanent net improvements of $200 million in our normalized operating expense base. A significant element of the savings will be generated from realigning primarily our non-client-facing workforce to support key areas of growth and repositioning to lower cost locations. On January 29th, we guided to a 2020 operating expense run rate of $3.02 billion, which included the full realization of the Oppenheimer synergies. Our annualized operating expense run rate as of the third quarter is at $2.74 billion, which reflects COVID-induced business impacts and market-driven expense reductions from the guide we provided the beginning of this year. Our normalized operating expense base assumed to return eventually to normal business conditions once the pandemic subsides globally. This normalization of largely marketing expense, G&A and the seasonality of our payroll taxes within compensation expense would add an additional roughly $134 million to our third quarter annualized operating expense base. And that would bring our normalized operating expense run rate to $2.88 billion. We'd see an opportunity to reduce this run rate further by $200 million net of reinvestments. We expect $150 million or about 75% of the run rate saving to be achieved by the end of 2021, with the remainder recognized in 2022. The savings represent low double-digit accretion to ETFs in each of the next two years. We expect total, one-time transaction costs for the realization of this program to be in the range of $250 million to $275 million over the next two years, with roughly 40% of those charges occurring in the fourth quarter, 40% in 2021 and the remainder in 2022. With respect to fourth quarter 2020 operating expenses, I would expect them to be modestly higher than Q3, driven primarily by increased marketing spend, reflecting higher promotional and client activity in the quarter. Consistent with our past practice, this expense guidance is based on September 30th, 2020 assets under management, market and FX levels and therefore may fluctuate with these items and any discrete non-operating expenses going forward. Now moving to Slide 12, adjusted operating income improved $47 million to $407 million for the quarter, driven by the positive operating leverage in our core business. Adjusted operating margin improved 240 basis points as compared to the second quarter to 37.2%. Adjusted EPS was $0.53 compared to $0.35 a share in the second quarter, driven by lower non-operating expenses and higher non-operating income. Non-operating income included $29.2 million of net gains and the equity and earnings in Q3 compared to a $53.2 million net loss in the second quarter. The increase in equity and earnings was driven by non-cash market valuation increases primarily in our CLO holdings, which demonstrated some recovery in value in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter. Interest expense of $33.8 million was lower by 2.9% in the quarter, reflecting the reduced credit facility balance during the period. I would note the third quarter was the final quarter in which we paid dividends related to our forward purchase agreements, which settle in January and April of 2021. As a result, we expect interest expense will decrease by approximately $9 million in the fourth quarter. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 24.2% and for the fourth quarter, we estimate our tax rate to be between 24% and 25%, while the actual effective tax rate may differ due to non-recurring or discrete items. A few comments on Slide 13. We reduced our revolver balance by $236 million to $90 million in the quarter, consistent with our commitment to improve our leverage profile. In addition to using excess cash to reduce leverage, we seek to improve liquidity and our financial flexibility. To that end, our balance sheet cash position improved to $1.067 billion in Q3 from $987 million at the end of the second quarter. Our goal remains to build cash to $1 billion in excess of regulatory capital requirements, and at September 30th, we were holding approximately $340 million in excess of regulatory requirements. As we've indicated, we're building financial flexibility in these uncertain times, and we believe we're making solid progress in our efforts. We remain committed to a sustainable dividend and to returning capital to shareholders longer-term through a combination of modestly increasing dividends and share repurchases. In summary, we're focused on our strategic evaluation and reallocating our resources to position us for growth, and we remain prudent and cautious in our approach to capital management. Our focus on driving greater efficiency and effectiveness into our platform, combined with the work we have done to build a global business with a comprehensive range of capabilities puts Invesco in a very strong position to meet client needs, run a disciplined business and continue to invest in and grow our franchise over the long-term. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Marty. Marty Flanagan : Thank you, Allison. So operator, can we open up the questions, please. And Greg, myself and Allison will address them. Operator : Certainly, Mr. Flanagan. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open, sir. Dan Fannon : Thanks, good morning. I was hoping you could expand a bit on the areas of the cost cutting, you gave some buckets. But I think you also mentioned it is really not client-facing. So just want to see you know, what might be the disruption from some of these changes in cost cuts? And then also if you could just kind of size the areas in terms of percentages, maybe where that $200 million it's going to come from? Allison Dukes : Sure. Thanks, Dan. I'll start and I might let Greg or Marty chime in on the client-facing impact. Of the $200 million that we've noted, about 50% to 60% of that I would expect to come through compensation expense. And of that, I'd say about 75% will occur in 2021 and the remainder of that would fall off in 2022. The other 40% to 50% would be split across occupancy, tech expense and G&A, and that occupancy expense I expect that's going to be kind of evenly split across '21 and '22. I think the G&A component will fully recognize in '21 and the tech expense will probably be pushed closer to 2022. On the compensation side, it is primarily realigning our workforce to lower cost locations, and reallocating and reorganizing across our business to make sure we're investing in our highest capability. There were some announcements that have already been made publicly. I'm happy to let Greg comment a little bit more on that, but that's largely behind us at this point. That help, Dan? Dan Fannon : Yes, that does. But and so just then on the client-facing side, you know, we're just thinking about AUM at risk or anything you could put, we think about the investment professional components of what changes might happen? Greg McGreevey : Yeah, let me take, Dan. Really good question. So that strategic evaluation did include investment teams, as you would expect, the total assets impacted is a relatively small one, it's about $26 billion and even though that's a small amount, we really believe that the changes really improved the overall organization, improved our focus, prioritization. Maybe just a little bit in perspective from a high level, the changes were really designed on the investment side to accomplish a couple of examples. One is to enhance our investment teams and processes, so we can continue to drive performance. Two is to enhance and simplify our global equity offerings. We can talk more about that if you want to. Three was to reassign certain capabilities to stronger teams, which frankly better processes and performance. And then for the non-investment professionals that really is to reduce complexity and eliminate redundancy, and just in service levels where we needed to. So on the investment side, we talked to employees, we've had detailed conversations with clients, and by and large, those changes are completely behind us and the feedback internally and externally has been very well received, very thoughtful and I think everybody said it made a lot of sense from a strategic standpoint. Dan Fannon : Great, thank you. Marty Flanagan : Great. Thanks, Dan. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Your line is open, sir. Marty Flanagan : Good morning, Craig - Craig Siegenthaler : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Marty Flanagan : Good morning. Allison Dukes : Good morning. Craig Siegenthaler : Question's actually for Marty. Marty, do you believe Invesco at $1.2 trillion of AUM now has enough scale to be successful and I was especially interested in your comments on the distribution side? Marty Flanagan : Yeah. So great question, so let me - you know, the answer is yes and let me step back to probably the core of the question. And, as we'd talked about for last few years, you know, there's clearly a very different dynamic going on in the industry and it's driven by something very simple. Clients around the world are choosing to work with fewer money managers. And that's whether it's the retail channel, the institutional channel and, again, every geography in the world. And so what they're looking for from clients is, clients are expecting more from money managers, so it's that broad range of capabilities that we have from passive all the way to alternatives, but beyond that, they want Solutions capability, they want thought leadership, they want the ability for us to build models for them help in any way. And so that has been you know a core focus for us as a firm, and you can see it in just the growth - gross inflows, the net inflows now of you know, that the impact there. So you have to be relevant to clients, you have to make a difference for clients and that's really important. So it's capabilities. It's also depth and breadth of capabilities of services. And also, I think what you have to do too is, yes, you want to have skills so you can drive efficiencies into the organization, which we've proven to do, you know, over any number of years and just conversation today you know proves that once again, but it's really so you can reinvest back in things like technology to create a better experience for your clients. And, again, ourselves and you know, I'd say the other larger firms have done very well doing that during the global pandemic, the client interactions have never been better. And you know, much of that was driven by historical technology investments, and again, not unique to us and but I think we've all been surprised that if you have skill and capability, you can really create a difference for your clients - Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks, Marty. And I actually just had one - Marty Flanagan : Yeah - Craig Siegenthaler : Marty, I had one follow-up - Marty Flanagan : Yes, please - Craig Siegenthaler : For Craig on the strategic expense initiatives. So - Marty Flanagan : Yes, please. Craig Siegenthaler : When you say that changes will enhance the global equity offering, does this mean emerging funds in the other funds, removing teams? Does this mean shrinking the number of investment professionals and also reducing the number of products? Greg McGreevey : Yeah, so it's a combination of some of those things, Craig. So, you know, we will, you know, the global equity capabilities that we have right now, especially that we've acquired from Oppenheimer was very strategic in terms of filling some gaps within our portfolio. But we had other capabilities on the global side that we're kind of nascent to that overall effort, if you will. So many things we're going to be doing is reassigning our Atlanta-based global core equity team to our Canadian global equity team. And then realigning that Canadian global equity team into our New York team, it's going to simplify not only our overall offerings and capabilities, but it's going to be able to streamline our messaging and our branding into the kind of marketplace, so those types of things that we're going to be doing under that umbrella simplifying our global equity offerings. Marty Flanagan : And can I just - I just want to be very clear and both Greg and Allison made this point, because changes have been made. And we're done with the changes, the clients contacts have been made. And we're virtually - we're moving forward now. So I just want to make sure that there's no mystery there. Greg McGreevey : Craig, that addressed your question. Marty Flanagan : Yeah, great. Craig Siegenthaler : Yeah, great job, Greg. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, sir. Brian Bedell : Great, thanks. Good morning, folks. Maybe Allison just started out with the expense, a question to, I think you said this, but just to confirm the expense base assumptions, the dollar amounts, exclude any impact of market appreciation that are based on September 30 data. So, if we, just playing with numbers, if we normalize market returns from say, the end of the year, you know you get around $400 million or so of additional revenue. So would it be fair to just put a comp to revenue number on the compensation line on that to think about how the expense base might grow in that market return dynamic in their fortune, and then just take a few hundred million off of that? Allison Dukes : Yeah, it's a great question and obviously got a couple of ways you could think about it. So let me just try to bring a little bit of clarity to it. One, yes, all the expense guidance, the fourth quarter guidance and the $200 million target beyond that is all based on September 30th asset levels, market and FX. As you think about the $200 million reduction, and again, I expect 50% to 60% of that comes from compensations and that would be the components, that is, you know, as you reduce compensation, that is, that has the most variable component to it and that obviously fluctuates the most with any change and asset levels or market performance. The balance is really tied to discrete items across our occupancy, tech and G&A expense. And so it doesn't have quite the same dependency on market or asset level. Brian Bedell : Okay, fair enough. Yep, thanks. And then on, maybe just to talk on the sales side, Marty, if you can or you, Marty or Allison. If you could just talk about some of the key drivers that you saw for improved flows in terms of the sustainability - and your confidence of the sustainability of that into 4Q, I don't know if you want to comment on October flows so far. But do you think that you can continue to generate positive flows both in the near-term and over the long-term? And maybe you can talk on a couple of initiatives that give you confidence on that? Marty Flanagan : Yeah, let me make a couple of comments. And I'll let Allison and Greg chime in. So, yes, the answer is yes, right. And you saw a market change in flows. And again, we continue to point to look at the gross number always that's really the health indicator always. And what you've seen over the last period of time, the institutional business continues to just be very strong. And again, we pointed, you know to the pipeline, again, it is strong. And if you look to you know Asia-Pac continues to be a very strong business, EMEA coming back on track and the Americas improving dramatically. So what's behind the ETFs generally continue to just be quite powerful, fixed income is an area of absolute strength right now. And it's not just performance, it's the quality of the team, it's the breath of the team. But it's also client demand. That's a really important you know element for our flows. And you saw a marked improvement in the US, the biggest headwind continues to be where we have great confidence in the long-term. You know, the global equity capabilities, you know, including emerging markets, you know, that is something of strength as we look forward. But the headwinds when clients don't want something. And, you know, you're going as if you use the US retail channel as a proxy, because it's you know so public information. The outflows in US equities are you know a strong headwind, the second largest category out is the global equity capabilities and those are the two areas we have some real strength and get some challenges in some of our capabilities there. But it's hard to overcome that. So what you're seeing is the rest of the policy, part of the organization overtaking that, and I think that's really important. Allison or Greg. Greg McGreevey : Yeah, the only thing I'd add is, look, if you look at our business on a managed perspective, we saw significant improvement in our flows and every broad investment category on a quarter-over-quarter basis. So sustainability, I think, assuming we have continued strong performance, I think is there. In fact, if you look at our flows in the third quarter, they were positive in every category, except retail equities and retail bank loans, where bank loans were essentially slightly negative for the quarter. So when you kind of look at the overall business, institutional and retail, fixed income, institutional equities, institutional alternative and institutional and retail balanced products, all contributed to, you know, the positive flow number. So we're encouraged by that trend. But we're probably more encouraged by the magnitude and improvement in every broad asset category that really is much more of a testament to the sustainability, we think of our flows moving forward. Marty Flanagan : And I'd add one other thing. So we continue to see a lot of success coming out of the Solutions and the you know the factor capabilities and from the passive, and as you know, they are big mandates, but they are lumpy, right. So you could probably see some more lumpiness than historically we've seen in the past, but, you know, on balance, you know, that's a good thing you know from my perspective. Brian Bedell : And do you see this continuing in October of this trend from the third quarter? You know it's all short in terms of the measure, but. Marty Flanagan : Yeah, that we're not going to do that, that's not our surface. We're definitely talking month-to-month so. Brian Bedell : Yeah. Marty Flanagan : So. Brian Bedell : That's fair, that's fair. Marty Flanagan : Were likely helpful, but I don't think it's been constructive so. Brian Bedell : Okay. Yep, thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open, sir. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thank you very much. I wonder if you could expand a little on your comments about the significant growing Solutions effort and the combined company. And I guess I want to talk about the construct on how you deliver you know what you think it takes to be great and how you measure that success, because, as you mentioned, with clients of all types, consolidating providers that seems to be the secret sauce that's going to help you deliver everything that you've built here. So curious if you could expand on that a little bit. Thanks. Marty Flanagan : Yeah, I'm going to make a couple of comments, and then have Greg. So the way that we've built our Solutions business, you know, obviously very talented group of people. But what it does is, it sits across all of our investment teams globally. So they don't compete with the investment teams, they literally use the content from the investment teams. And I think that's somewhat of a minority approach, you know, in the marketplace. But also, it's, the analytical tools that have been built by the team that really enable these conversations. And we've seen the conversations with very sophisticated institutions that have resources to do their own work, and they do, but they're wanting to get a different view from organizations that have these capabilities. And again, it just changes the depth of the relationship that we have with these organizations. And, and again, it's taken all spectrums from, you know, creating models through our self-indexing capabilities, you know, creating indexes for a client for them to use for their own purposes to, you know, the more, you know, well known, you know, Solutions outcomes that people want, which, across different asset classes, but Greg. Greg McGreevey : Maybe just to kind of add to Marty's comments. Look, our Solutions business really has two primary segments. One is an enabling - enablement capability, where we're going to help in with - in conjunction with distribution to determine client needs and the best individual capability to align to those needs. And so we need you know to be great and that is really strong client engagement skills and really strong analytics. And then the second is where we're going to provide customized outcomes tailored to specific client needs across a number of different asset classes. And so they're to be great, you need very strong asset allocation skills. And so what we've done over the last five years has really made probably one of the most significant investments in the company to build capabilities in those three areas. And I think what we're seeing off of that investment that really started four years ago is a significant improvement in both our assets under management, our assets under advisement, both in the institutional channel, which is up significantly, you saw that on the pipeline chart that Allison had talked about, where Solutions is enabling over half of that business. But we've also seen a significant level of engagement and portfolio reviews in the retail side. So we got a strong pipeline within Solutions, I think that in concert with more favorable market conditions in the third quarter is going to provide additional tailwind to the business. And so we're pretty excited about, you know, just the opportunities, both, you know, in the near-term and in the long-term. Glenn Schorr : Thanks for all that. Appreciate it. Marty Flanagan : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open, sir. Brennan Hawken : Good morning, thanks for taking the question. I was curious about how you view; I know that you've spoken in the past about the fact that you're in a fairly small footprint in retail SMA. And particularly given the fact that the US retail has been a bit of a headwind for you, you've got so much momentum in other parts of the business but that one has been a bit more slow to turn around retail SMAs has been sort of the bright spot in that channel. How do you think about potential investment there? You've also got a dominant provider that will no longer be independent in the future. And so there might be increased demand for another independent provider from some firms and some FAs. So how do you view that opportunity? Where are you as far as capabilities in that market? And is that worth your while when you start to think about investment dollars here? Marty Flanagan : Yeah, it's a great question. And I think the core of where you're going, which we've always agreed with the separate investment capabilities from delivering mechanisms, and you have to have you know different vehicles to deliver, because it's different parts of the world and different channels and you're highlighting a trend where SMAs have become important in segments of the wealth management channels. And the good news is when with Oppenheimer, they have had brought over a strong SMA capability largely aligned to fixed income. And as we've turned our attention to it, that's where we're starting to see flows. We'll continue to you know expand that you know the response to client demand, I think the other area that we've talked about all the time is the rise of non-transparent ETFs, we still have our application and we're excited that we're working with Fidelity, who's a very strong partner on bringing non-transparent capability into the market before the end of the year, we'll see where that goes. As I've said, I think that's longer dated, but I'm just really highlighting the need to, we have to respond to client needs with the vehicles also. Greg McGreevey : Yeah, the only thing I'd add to that, Marty a little bit is, look, we are spending time with our SMA business, we have the legacy of business and then one that we were able to acquire with the Oppenheimer acquisition, we recognize it's a bright spot in the retail market. So I think that all kind of Marty's points, our team and capabilities are strong in fixed income. We're spending time right now in technology to really in the areas of operations, tech's efficiency and the things that are going to be requirements to kind of support that business overall. So we understand the essence of your question and we're spending time to make sure that we address that bright spots into the market. Brennan Hawken : Excellent. Thanks for that color, Marty and Greg. You also made a few comments, it sounded like, although I might have misinterpreted that, you're looking to make some investments in some of the ETF product lineup trying to expand into a flight ESG. It sounded like there might be some further development of the way - QQQ related products. That I reading too much into that or is that the case? What kind of opportunity set do you think that that will actually result in for Invesco? And if you're going to expand on the Qs? Is that going to allow for Invesco to generate better economics on some of that innovation? How should we think about that? Marty Flanagan : Yeah so in the last couple of weeks we entered - produced sort of an expansion of the Q suite. NASDAQ was a fantastic partner. And it's really following, you know, the great success with the Qs. They're complementary in nature to the QQQ, and again, they are more typical structures with more typical economics, then, you know, what we have with, you know, the marketing allowance with the Qs. So we see client demand there. It's a natural extension of the Q Suite. And as Allison spoke to, showed some of the ETF related ESG capabilities, they've been in the market for a good number of years. So the track record does matter. And there are track records there and the assets are now just really beginning to grow as people are turning you know more seriously to ESG. We have you know other focus areas in ESG as, you know, everybody's turning their attention there. But again, we have a very strong capability internally there and you know product will follow that those capabilities as we look forward. So, that's the crack at your point. Greg McGreevey : Yeah, okay. Brennan Hawken : Yeah. Thank you, Marty. Marty Flanagan : Yep. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is open, sir. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning. Given consolidation is a theme for traditional asset managers these days and given where Invesco is, with the integration of Oppenheimer and its efficiency program, is Invesco interested in pursuing - further pursuing large scale M&A? And if so, would it be practical to pursue large scale M&A in the near-term if an opportunity presented itself, given the goals you've pointed out for the balance sheet? Marty Flanagan : Yeah. Ken it's a great question. So let me put it in the context of how we think about things. We have acquired over time, obviously, the principles have not changed. It needs to be additive to the organization, it has to have complementary investment capabilities, they need to be strategic, they need to be differentiated, has to be something clients want. And I would contrast that to some of the things I've read that the notion of you know, financial roll ups is going to be the order of the day, we don't believe in that. It's disruptive, it's risky and you know, clients are not supportive of it. So we will not, you know we will continue to be the area if it makes sense for us you know we will pay attention to it. And again, always, to your point, and it's got to be strategic and it also has to be financially sound. So our thoughts and beliefs have not changed there. Ken Worthington : Yep. And if everything made sense, is Invesco in a position to pursue something near-term, like longer-term, you know, would make sense if you find the right fit after everything is digested, et cetera. But is Invesco in a position to do something, you know, now or in 2021, if that opportunity that fit all the criteria you mentioned presented itself? Marty Flanagan : Again, I can't address the hypothetical. What I can tell you right now is, we feel really good about the organization, we feel really good about what we've accomplished. You know, for us, like many other organizations, you know, COVID was not a welcome experience. It sort of knocked us off our plan for 2020 factually. We're now back on it, you can see it in these results. And we took very seriously during this period of time, you know, making sure that we had the resources against the right opportunities, and we believe we do right now. So again, I - we're - heads are down and we're executing to what we're doing and we feel really good about it. Allison Dukes : And I'd underscore our commitment to our balance sheet objectives, we are committed to continuing to improve our financial flexibility, reducing our leverage profile and making sure we're in a very strong position to weather any uncertainty that comes our way and to continue to invest in our business and can invest in our capabilities for growth. And I'd tell you that our scale is what gives us the opportunity to announce the cost target that we announced today. And we're going to take advantage of that. Marty Flanagan : And Ken let me come back to the more, just want to step back, you know, just our basic belief. So the word consolidation is thrown around a lot in the industry. And, you know, what we said in the past and what I do believe is the stronger get stronger, there's no question about that just because of the dynamic, we talked about of what you know clients are looking for from organizations. But consolidation doesn't mean that, you know, organizations are going to be buying everything, I just think I think there are many firms that no one will buy, the consolidation will happen, you know, organically, you know, clients, leaving some money managers for others, where they're better served. So I think that's how we think about it. And again, anything we'll do will be very you know very thoughtful and consistent with the principles we've laid out. But that is not our focus at the moment. Ken Worthington : Awesome, thank you so much. Marty Flanagan : Yeah, thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Alex Blostein : Great, thanks for the question. I was hoping you guys could expand a little bit on the $32 billion pipeline you highlighted on institutional side. So, maybe a little more color on the revenues or the fee rates associated with that and any notable redemptions that you're also aware of again on the lumpier side of things? Allison Dukes : Sure. Thanks, Alex you know, the pipeline, it actually looks very strong, obviously, as compared to prior quarters pretty balanced, I would say across regions and asset classes as you could see. In terms of the fee rate, it's perhaps maybe modestly higher than the pipeline at the end of the second quarter, I'd call it very modest, continues to be consistent. And it's really a strong mix of equity capabilities and fixed income that mostly drive the fee rate just a little bit higher. And we're continuing to see growth from the United States as well, which is a really strong indication, the highest we've seen from them in a number of quarters so. Overall, I'd say it's a good healthy pipeline. In terms of redemptions, nothing notable, nothing unusual. And I think we continue to be very focused on redemptions, if anything, it's really as our clients just continue to look at mix within their own mandate. I would note in terms of the institutional flows in the third quarter, about two-thirds of those were from the pipeline itself, about another third or so was from client activity. So the institutional flows we're seeing are not just coming from the pipeline, they come from augmentation of existing relationships and I think that really underscores just the strength of the franchise overall. Alex Blostein : Got you. And then my second question just around the China JV. I was hoping maybe taken a taking a step back, if you guys could talk a little bit about what sort of the total AUM base and the operating income contribution to Invesco from that relationship today. And so if you could break it out kind of revenues, expenses that would be helpful. And as you think it about scaling this over time, what are sort of the products that are resonating most? How can you sort of grow this could be more meaningful contributor to the organization? Marty Flanagan : Let me just talk you know, conceptually at a high level about China for us. If you just look at what's happening as opposed to generated product kind of for us, they're at all-time highs and largely driven by the JV. And it's just its depth and breadth of capabilities and it just continues to get stronger. We anticipate that going forward, again, institutionally, we continue to have great experience there. And it's a broad base of through launches in China and existing products going forward. So again, we just are in a very strong position there and we anticipate it'll just be a material contributor you know as we move forward. Alex Blostein : Any numbers around that? Greg McGreevey : So we have - I'd give you a couple of numbers, we have about $66 billion in kind of Mainland China overall, that footprint is across a variety of different kind of asset categories. If you look at the $8 billion of kind of flows from an asset category standpoint, they were quite diversified in positive and just about every area within Asia Pacific balanced products the largest driver of overall flows in Asia Pacific in the third quarter, you know, just related only to balanced products, I think the thing you have to think about there is a lot of diversification, given the broad, the base nature of needs within China and I think it's a broad based set of investment capabilities with very strong performance that relate to that. Alex Blostein : Great, thank you. Marty Flanagan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Michael Cyprys : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just coming back to the expense base the $200 million of net savings, I understand that net of investments, I was just hoping you could talk about how much exactly embedded in there for investments back in the business. Maybe you could talk about how you're approaching that? How you're sizing that? What gives you confidence about the right mount? And what would you say are the top three areas that you're investing in? Marty Flanagan : So let me just talk again. So we're not going to get into specifics. You know, I think, as we've all said, the work that we did was very comprehensive and very broad. So there was a lot of movement, you know, realignment of resources and against seriously we care about. And it was just talking about China is going to continue to be a contributor. So we're making sure that we have all the resources there that we need. ETFs continues to be a driver and, you know, we continue to see that, you know, as a very important priority for us. The factors continue, we have a subset of that continues to be very important. Solutions all the years that we've talked about. So again, most of the assets under management now we think are - that we have are these portable right resources, and they're in high demand areas as we go forward. Allison Dukes : And Michael, the way I just add to that is, we're focused on creating positive operating leverage, and sustaining that operating leverage. And so looking at these cost targets, it gives us the opportunity to realign our investments or permanently alter or take out some expenses, so that we have the flexibility and the capacity to continue to invest in all those capabilities, Marty spoke of. Michael Cyprys : Okay, and just on the uplift, $134 million on that slide with normalized business conditions. I guess just how do you think about the drivers there? How does that break down? And how would you describe what normalized is relative to say, pre-COVID? So for example, is it like 80% on say, TNE versus pre-COVID? How should we be thinking about that? Allison Dukes : Yeah, sure. Good question. So, you know, again, there are a couple of ways to think about this. So the $134 million, it's a rather specific number, I know, but you know, I'd tell you about $25 million or so is really - is purely a function of seasonality in compensation expense. So it has nothing to do with COVID, it's just third quarter would not be the right quarter to really create a run rate there. The remainder of $100 million or so plus, is very COVID induced. And, you know, it's hard to figure out for any of us how much of that comes back and the way in which it comes back and the timeframe in which it comes back. I couldn't tell you if we're running it, you know, 80% or 20%. I mean, I can tell you, we're not traveling. And I can tell you that most of our offices either remain closed or at somewhat of a 20% or so capacity. And so if you just think about the expenses that would be tied around that, we're not having in-person engagements with clients, you know, consistent with what you would expect everywhere. So I mean, in some respects, you could assume it's, you know, we're at 5% of what it used to be, we don't expect we'll stay there forever, we just don't know when it would come back. We do believe it comes back, we do believe there is an environment someday, where we're largely back in the office where we are traveling to see clients again, that we are in-person together again, and we do think it's reasonable to expect some of that to come back over time. I just don't know when. And then the point I made earlier that $200 million is largely independent of that it's really tied to discrete line items that have all been identified, and really has nothing to do with a COVID environment. Michael Cyprys : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is open. Mike Carrier : Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. First the turn inflows is great, I realized that the quarter fee rate was impacted by some of the rise in the non-AUM, but excluding that I think it still take down spikes on every markets. If you could provide some color on the theory on that institutional Solution inflows, more versus the overall fee rate, you know versus the prior pipeline disengage due to the trend line that we have? Allison Dukes : I would say the fee rate for the institutional pipeline and the components that is driven by Solutions, it's very consistent. So I would just think of it very consistent to what we've experienced than certainly in the third quarter, and probably, you know, a couple of quarters prior to that. Mike Carrier : Okay, and then, Allison just given the efficiency niches and where your guidance adjusted margin is right now at 37% just roughly in line when you exit the sector, when you're looking at these efficiency initiatives, is it a way to improve the margin further, like free up money to invest in the business longer-term, offsetting the structural headwinds in the industry, I'm just trying to get a sense because each firm has very you know has a different strategic, you know, kind of initiatives or outlooks in the industry. And then, if we do get a 5% rise in the markets, if you can just, you know, let us know how you think about the variable component of POS, and how that could impact the core expense you know level? Allison Dukes : So I would say, the way we're thinking about it is, we want to be able to create positive operating leverage, it's hard to create positive operating leverage quarter after quarter after quarter. But that's, you know, longer-term over the medium-term, that's what we're trying to do so that we actually have the capacity to reinvest. And we can't underscore enough our commitment to reinvesting in our business and reinvesting in those growth capabilities, because we really believe that's what drives the longer-term flow dynamics and value of the firm. And so as we think about operating leverage, you know, and we think about the fact that the fee environment is one that is there is downward pressure, it is not the same downward pressure quarter-after-quarter. But in general, at a macro level, the pressure is more down than anything. And so as we seek to maintain the fee level, as we continue to see just the growth in our ETF business and the QQQ Suite, we are looking at really creating profitability across the broad platform and thinking of these expense levers as a way for us to create capacity to continue to reinvest to drive the top line. And that's where we think we get the operating leverage. In terms of the variability. I mean, I just point to the fact that our expense base in general is about a third variable, two-thirds fixed. And so as you think about a rise in markets, that's a reasonable data point to you. Mike Carrier : Got it, thanks. Operator : Thank you for your question. [Operator Instructions] As reminder, before we take our next question, we have about five minutes left in today's conference call. Our next question will come from Bill Katz with Citigroup. Your line is open, sir. Bill Katz : Okay, thanks. Just one clarification and lot of my question have been asked. On the $26 billion of AUM that had been sort of identified with some team changes. Is that money sort of sticky at this point in time? Or do you think that there could be some subject to run off? And what might be the associated revenues with that? Greg McGreevey : Yeah, we think that it's quite sticky, Bill, we've had conversations as I mentioned before, both with the teams and our clients. And I think, you know, like I mentioned, the feedback was quite positive for the changes that we made both why we did them and strategically the rationale behind them. So you know we just don't expect there to be a significant amount of runoff related to those assets under advisement and then what we're trying to do is, use those things to strengthen the areas where we really think there is strong demand in the marketplace or move assets to stronger teams with better processes and performance overall. So clients, you know, should see that is doing a good thing kind of overall not you know, look it's tough to go through those things, but that was the right things to do strategically for the business. Bill Katz : Okay. And then just one quick follow-up. Marty, you mentioned in your prepared commentary that you are looking to take share within the ETFs. I was just sort of wondering, you know, where that share might come from? Is that within the passive bucket broadly or is that relative to active, some of the existing players I'm trying to get a sense of you know how that share would transpire? Marty Flanagan : Yeah, and those can be a combination, right. I think here we talked earlier about the QQQ Suite, it's a strong spot for us, you know, when you look at that will be an area with a very strong factor capability. And that's sort of fundamental to our ETF Suite. And so we'll continue that area. I also mentioned relatively small about $5 billion in ESG related ETFs right now, you know, it is an area of you know, as market demand is moving there, having those longer track records are, you know, are important when, so we look at that as an area of growth also, so that you should think broadly about it. And, again, I still think it's longer dated, but you know, paying attention to what happens with non-transparent ETFs is something to have, you know, as we look out into the future, and again, you know we'll start to get some sense of it as we launch sort of non-transparent along with Fidelity by the end of the year. So pretty broadly, Bill. Bill Katz : Okay, thank you very much, Greg and Marty [ph]. Marty Flanagan : Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you for your question. We have a question from Robert Lee with KBW. Your line is open, sir. Robert Lee : Great, thanks and thanks for your patience. But both questions. Firstly, thanks to the end product disclosure, appreciate it. Most of my questions been asked. But Marty, you touched on and I apologize if I missed it earlier. But, on ESG you were elaborating a bit more on how you're thinking but more broadly, is really the strategy mainly focused on ETF business where you'll have more ESG specific strategies, and then how are you really looking to incorporate into the broader you know active business as you can see the investment process, are you dissipating rolling on a broader suite of kind of thematic strategies, just trying to get a sense of that? Marty Flanagan : Yeah, let me make a couple of comments and Greg can chime in. So it's multi-tiered. So principal activity right now is, you know, embedding ESG across all of our strategies throughout the world. We're well into it, you know, some will take longer, but that's, you know it is just a reality and that's well underway. And again, I think different parts of the world are at different stages, if you aren't embedding ESG in your investment capabilities, you know, in Europe, you know, you're just not competitive and we anticipate that, you know, across the world. And then just looking at our product suites that's not ETFs alone, it continues to be you know, we'll look at active capabilities. I'd say we're probably a leader in the fixed income area with ESG been embedded in that process. And then, the other thing, we have ESG capability and, you know, thought leadership there is an area - that is an area of strength for us, and, again, taken you know very seriously. Greg, would you add? Greg McGreevey : Yeah, the thing about, you know, look, I think, we're well positioned, Robert for a lot of ESG perspective, the market is to Marty's point moving very quickly, we need to move quickly, we're prepared to do that, if you're going to think about our right now, we have roughly about $30 billion of ESG mandates by the narrowest of market definition, that's across 90,000 [ph] mandates varies by strategy and geography and client side. So you know, we view ESG strategically as something that we'll continue to grow in importance in every region will be a significant growth area for the firm, we have a desire to be a top tier global ESG manager and to Marty's point we're kind of prepared to have ESG systematically integrated across our entire platform, which is, you know, a big kind of undertaking and then we'll support that with the array of sustainability and impact products overall. So strong performance, I guess, is really key in all areas, it's critical to ESG moving forward, and that's why our model is very investment-led, you asked about how we manage this with investment-led, and we make sure our teams incorporate ESG requirements and each team's specific processes. And then we support that by a globally a key team and that provides expertise and a comprehensive set of tools. So a lot of work and I think it gives you a look and understanding and the seriousness of how we're taking ESG and how confident we do and this opportunity is going to be moving forward. Marty Flanagan : So we believe we answered the question. Robert Lee : Yes, it does. Thanks so much. Thank you. Marty Flanagan : Good, thanks Robert. And so we'll wrap up the call again. You know, thank you very much for all the questions, very thoughtful. Again, we feel good about the quarter and we feel good about the undertakings that we described today. They're all meant to make us a better and stronger firm. And we'll continue to be very focused on that as we move forward and for the ongoing conversation. So thank you very much and have a good rest of the day. Operator : This does conclude today's conference call. We thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect and have a great rest of your day.",

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. And now I would like to turn the conference call over to your speakers for today, Marty Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; and Allison Dukes, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin. Marty Flanagan : Thank you, operator, and thanks everybody for joining and Happy New Year to everybody. I think we're all very ready to turn the page on what was a very challenging 2020. And while the global pandemic remains very pervasive, we do all see light at the end of the tunnel and we look forward to 2021 with a cautious optimism that conditions will improve. Throughout 2020, we focused on executing our long-term strategy while recognizing the necessity to focus on employee health and safety, finding new ways to work and serving and delivering expected outcomes for our clients. I would like to thank all our employees and our clients during what has been a challenging period.  Over the past decade, we've been successful investing ahead of shifts in client demand, placing us in a strong position to take advantage of key industry tailwinds in the future. Our investment in these capabilities and our tremendous focus on our clients is now again producing good momentum in our business that became more visible as the year progressed.  By working better to anticipate, understand and meet client needs during the challenging times, we've achieved six straight months of net long-term inflows totaling nearly $18 billion in the second half of 2020 with progress across channels, geographies and asset classes. Retail flows improved in the second half significantly. Our solutions enabled institutional pipeline remained near record levels. We saw net inflows in Asia Pacific totaling $17 billion in the second half of the year, and improving flows in EMEA and the Americas over this timeframe. And net long-term flows in the fixed income remain robust during that period. All of these factors combined build a strong foundation as we head into 2021. And maybe the few highlights of the fourth quarter are on Slide 4 if you\u2019re kind of following along. More specifically, during the quarter investment performance for a large portion of high demand capabilities were in the upper quartiles. We had net long-term inflows of nearly $10 billion during the quarter. Long-term inflows in the fixed income capabilities continued while we saw client demand for equities within ETFs, quantitative and index strategies in particular. We saw another quarter of strong inflows in Asia Pacific region. Inflows in the Americas turned positive. Allison will provide more information in a few minutes on the flows, strategic valuation and more details of the quarter, but I would like to note we also improved our operating leverage during the period, paid our credit facility to zero and made progress improving our cash position. I would like to spend a few minutes on slides 5 and 6 to talk about our additive strength and key capabilities in areas with high client demand and our focus for 2021. Slide 5 illustrates the market opportunities we see for these key growth areas and demonstrates the majority of our investment capabilities are aligned with these opportunities. In these areas, our investment forms a strong or highly competitive and well positioned for growth.  And as we move into 2021, we plan to further expand our market leading position in ETFs in the U.S. and EMEA, in particular, and build our passive presence in Asia Pacific. We are the fourth largest ETF provider globally and our capabilities span passive, active strategies and establish in developing spectrum of ESG ETFs. And building on our 15-year legacy of innovation, we continue to develop new products in this space as demonstrated by the launch of the QQQ Innovation Suite and our first non-transparent ETFs that we delivered in the fourth quarter. Strong alternative platform and our focus is growing our private markets business led by our market leading real estate and bank loan businesses.  Active fixed income and global equity remains areas of opportunity for us and our offerings are well positioned with strong investment performance and high client demand. In addition, we are focused on our solutions efforts. And as we have seen by the contribution to the institutional pipeline, clients value this service. The ability to offer solutions that builds on the full power of our competitive set of capability and services to clients continue to be a priority for us during 2021. We continue to invest in our leadership position in Greater China. We've been managing dedicated Chinese products for nearly 40 years. We have already seen the benefits of our early mover advantage in the China onshore market through our joint venture, which was the first scene of foreign joint venture in the industry established almost 20 years ago. Turning to Slide 6. As we noted, in the third quarter, we see opportunities to invest in areas of growth aligned with our strategic plan. These areas include ETF alternatives, active fixed income and global equities, which includes emerging markets, and we will build on our market leading position in the fast growing China market and further develop our leading solutions and asset allocation offerings. Given our investment in the business over the past decade, our most recent efforts to better align the organization with our strategy, I'm confident with the talent, the capabilities and the resources, momentum to drive future growth and success. We\u2019re optimistic about the new year and remain focused on helping our clients achieve their desired outcomes, regardless of where the markets take us.  And with that, I will turn it over to Allison to get into further details. Allison Dukes : Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everyone. Moving to Slide 7, we had 61% and 70% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers on a five-year and a 10-year basis, reflecting strength in fixed income, global equities including emerging market equities and Asian equities, all areas where we continue to see demand from clients globally. Looking at our AUM on Slide 8, we ended the quarter with $1.35 trillion in AUM. Of $132 billion in AUM growth, approximately $95 billion is a function of increased market values. Turning to flows on Slide 9, our diversified platform generated long-term net inflows in the fourth quarter of $9.8 billion, representing 3.9% annualized organic growth, which generated positive net inflows in activate AUM of $400 million and passive AUM of $9.4 billion. Our ETFs experienced net inflows of $6.1 billion, including $4.7 billion in long-term ETFs and $1.4 billion in our QQQ. Our U.S. listed ETF, excluding the QQQ, had their best quarter in their 15-year history. We saw net long-term ETF flows in the U.S. focused on equities in the fourth quarter, including a high level of interest in our S&P 500 equal weight ETF, which had $2.7 billion in net inflows in the quarter.  Two of our top five inflowing ETFs were ESG related. We continue to see momentum in our ETF business and demand for ESG funds, and as Marty highlighted, the market opportunity is significant for this key growth area in 2021. Retail net outflows were $800 million in the quarter helped by the positive ETF flows. On the institutional side, we had net inflows of $10.6 billion. I'll provide a little more color on these flows on the next few slides, but importantly the growth in our passive AUM and our institutional AUM is meaningful for the firm and contributed to the positive operating leverage we generated in the period. Also, as Marty noted earlier, we're seeing the mix of ETF inflows being weighted towards higher fee generating products. Looking at flows by geography, you'll note that the Americas have net inflows of $2.2 billion in the quarter, an improvement of $6.6 billion from the prior quarter. This improvement was driven by net inflows into ETFs, institutional inflows, various fixed income strategies and importantly, focused sales efforts and improvement in redemption rates. Our global equity products improved by over $1 billion, or 37% from Q3, driven by our developing markets fund, which returned to positive net flows in the fourth quarter following negative net flows in the first three quarters of the year. UK experienced net outflows of $100 million in the quarter as positive flows into our institutional quantitative equity capability were offset by net outflows in multi-asset and UK equities. EMEA net outflows were $1.4 billion driven by institutional lumpiness and ETF outflows largely in our S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 UCITS ETFs. And finally, I noted last quarter that Asia Pacific delivered one of its strongest quarters ever with net inflows of $8 billion. In the fourth quarter, net inflows were even higher at $9.1 billion. Net inflows were diversified across the Asia Pacific region. $4 billion of these net flows were from Japan, $3.8 billion arose from our China JV, and the remaining $1.3 billion was generated from several other countries in the region. It's worth noting that we continue to see strength in fixed income across all channels and markets in the fourth quarter, with net long-term inflows of $8.2 billion, this following net long-term inflows of $8.8 billion in the third quarter and $6 billion in the second quarter.  It's also important to note that of the $26.1 billion in fixed income net inflows in 2020, 25 billion of these net inflows were from active fixed income capabilities. Active fixed income has been a growth area for us in 2020, and remains a key investment area in 2021.  Now moving to Slide 10. Our institutional pipeline remains robust at $30.5 billion on the heels of strong pull through in the institutional pipeline during the fourth quarter. This pipeline is diversified across asset classes and geographies. And our solutions capability has contributed to meaningful growth across our institutional network, warranting our continued investment in this key capability in 2021. Turning to Slide 11. You'll note that our revenues increased $135 million, or 12.4% from the third quarter, driven by higher average AUM in Q4 as well as a meaningful increase in performance fees. Net revenue yield, ex performance fees, was 36 basis points flat and flat of the Q3 yield level. The impact of rising markets on our yield was offset by modest fee rate decline from the mix shift we experienced across products in the quarter, as well as the impact of non-management fee earning AUM. We recorded performance fees of $78 million in the fourth quarter. $48 million of these performance fees arose from our real estate business and $21 million from our institutional business in our China JV, two of our key growth areas. Seasonally, we tend to see higher performance fees in the fourth quarter.  Total adjusted operating expenses increased 8.3% in Q4. The $57 million increase in operating expenses was driven by higher variable compensation as a result of both market growth and compensation related to the performance fees in the quarter.  Operating expenses remained at lower than historic activity levels due to pandemic-driven impacts to discretionary spending, travel and other business operations that persisted in the quarter. That being said, we did see a seasonal increase in marketing expenses as expected. Moving to Slide 12. We wanted to update you on the progress we have made with our strategic evaluation. As we noted previously, we conducted a strategic evaluation across four key areas of our expense base; our organizational model, our real estate footprint, management of third party spend, and technology and operation efficiency. Through this evaluation, we will invest in key areas of growth, including ETF, fixed income, China, solutions, alternatives and global equities, while creating permanent net improvements of $200 million in our normalized operating expense space. As we noted, a large element of the savings will be generated from compensation, which includes realigning our non-client facing workforce to support key areas of growth and repositioning to lower cost locations. In the fourth quarter, we realized $7.5 million in cost savings. $7 million of these savings were related to compensation expense, as depicted on Slide 12. The remaining $500,000 in savings were related to facilities which are shown in the property office and technology category. The $7.5 million in cost savings were $30 million annualized. It\u2019s 15% of our $200 million net savings expectation. Of the remaining $170 million in net savings, we anticipate we will realize roughly 50% of the savings through compensation expense. The remaining 50% would spread across occupancy, tech spend and G&A. As it relates to timing, we still expect approximately $150 million or 75% of the run rate savings to be achieved by the end of this year with the remainder recognized by the end of '22. We estimate that we will realize roughly 75% of the anticipated compensation reductions in 2021, roughly 50% of the anticipated reduction in occupancy expense also in 2021, and all of the reduction in G&A this year. The majority of efficiencies identified in our tech spend will not be realized until 2022. In the fourth quarter, we incurred $104 million of our estimated 250 million to 275 million in restructuring costs. We expect the remaining transaction costs for the realization of this program to be in a range of $150 million to $175 million over the next two years, toughly two thirds of this remaining amount occurring in 2021. As a reminder, the costs associated with the strategic evaluation are not reflected in our non-GAAP results. With respect to Q1, after improved market performance and asset inflows in the fourth quarter, we start the year with over $1.3 trillion in AUM. Given the market improvement was more back end weighted towards the end of the quarter, we expect both operating revenues, excluding performance fees, and the associated variable expenses to be modestly higher in the first quarter. This reflects the follow through from the market and slow growth that occurred over the course of the fourth quarter, even if we assume no change in markets from year end. On the expense side, this will include higher associated variable compensation than the seasonal increase in payroll taxes, partially offset by lower compensation related to the seasonal decline in performance fees and the execution of our targeted cost savings. Turning to Slide 13. Adjusted operating income improved $78 million to $485 million for the quarter, driven by the factors we just reviewed. Adjusted operating margin improved 230 basis points as compared to the third quarter to 39.5%, demonstrating the operating leverage in our model. This helped drive the $0.19 increase in adjusted EPS to $0.72 a share. In addition, we've benefited from higher non-operating income and lower non-operating expenses in the quarter. Non-operating income included $31.9 million in net gains for the quarter compared to $15.2 million in net gain last quarter. The increase was driven by unrealized gains primarily in our seed money holding. Interest expense of $24.4 million was 28% lower than the prior quarter. Q3 was the final quarter in which we paid dividends related to our forward purchase agreements, a portion of which we settled in January, with the remaining portion to be settled in April of 2021. Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 21.7%. The reduction in the rate reflects the lower taxes on unrealized gains in our seed portfolio due to the jurisdiction of our holdings. We estimate our 2021 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 24%. The actual effective tax rate may vary from this estimate due to the impact of non-recurring items on pre-tax income and discrete tax items. A few comments on Slide 14. As Marty mentioned, we reduced our revolver balance by $90 million to zero in the quarter, consistent with our commitment to improve our leverage profile. In addition to using excess cash to reduce leverage, we seek to improve liquidity and our financial flexibility. To that end, our balance sheet cash position improved to $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter from $1.1 billion at the end of Q3. $764 million of this cash is held for regulatory requirements. I will note we paid $117 million earlier in January to settle a portion of the forward share repurchase liability with the remaining liability of $177 million to be settled in April. We believe we're making solid progress in our efforts to build financial flexibility. We remain committed to a sustainable dividend and to returning capital to shareholders longer term through a combination of modestly increasing dividends and share repurchases. In summary, Marty walked through our key capabilities, the organic growth opportunity each presents and are focus on executing this strategy that aligns with these areas. We're also focused on our strategic evaluation and reallocating our resources to position us for growth. And we remain prudent and cautious in our approach to capital management. Our focus of driving greater efficiency and effectiveness into our platform, combined with the work we have done to build a global business with a comprehensive range of capabilities, puts Invesco in a very strong position to meet client needs, run a disciplined business and to continue to invest in and grow our franchise over the long term. With that, I\u2019ll ask the operator to open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question this morning is from Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. My question is on the fee rates and kind of the outlook. First, just I guess in terms of the fourth quarter, is there anything abnormal in this period? Obviously mix and beta were positive. So just want to clarify that this is a good exit kind of run rate for the fee rate. And then thinking about next year, assuming flat markets and the mix of business that you're seeing in terms of demand and institutionally and otherwise, how we should think about the trends in the fee rate for next year? Allison Dukes : Good morning, Dan. So I'd say first on the fourth quarter, your question around was anything abnormal. Let me just start with obviously we had pretty high performance fees in the fourth quarter. So excluding performance fees, as you saw net revenue yield was flat at 36 basis points in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. It's fairly straightforward in terms of what was driving that. You've got the impact of the rising markets on our yield, which was a positive of course. And then we've got some offset there, given the modest pressure we continue to see just from the client demand and the mix shift that\u2019s there. We've got consistent with industry, high interest in our passive capabilities and some churn within our active and that does put some downward pressure on net revenue yield. And this was a quarter where the impact of really strong market growth helped to offset that. In terms of what does that mean for this year, I would say that trend right there we would expect to continue. I do expect we will continue to see high interest in our passive capabilities and some continued churn within active. What does that mean for net revenue yield going forward? It's very difficult to predict, as you know. What I would point you to is that our focus is not simply on net revenue yield. We've really got the breadth of capabilities to serve our clients well. I think that's really starting to be demonstrated in the results over the last couple of quarters. And as we focus on that, we really are focusing on operating margin and making sure that we are managing our expense base to the top line of the firm and really driving profitable growth across our platform. Dan Fannon : Great, thanks. And then just as a follow-up on expenses and your commentary sequentially, both an increase in revenue and expenses, so obviously performance fees will be lower given the seasonality. So just want to clarify. You're still talking sequential comp increase from $1 perspective in the first quarter, and then also on the synergies -- the kind of expense saving, just the cadence as we think about the year. Are they more backend loaded in terms of the realization? I get the exit by year end numbers you gave, but just thinking about kind of the flow-through through the year how we should think about the timing throughout '21? Allison Dukes : Sure. Yes, let me start with Q1. And there are a lot of puts and takes as you think about it just given the really strong growth that we saw in the back half of the fourth quarter. That market growth, excluding performance fees, really did come in the back half of the year and we started the year with a very high level of AUM and you see what I see in terms of the markets thus far that we enter with strong revenue growth, as that maintains, and we hope that maintains. And then along with that we've got the associated variable compensation, and that does drive compensation higher, all things being equal for the quarter. And then we have the seasonality of payroll taxes and some pension expenses that occur in the first quarter of the year. Now, those are going to be offset by what we're doing in terms of our targeted cost saves and of course the lower compensation that we would have in this quarter, excluding performance fees. The net of all of that, the puts and takes, it\u2019s hard to say exactly given the strong run up in revenue and the associated expenses. But it's, I would say, flattish and I\u2019m talking total expenses for the quarter. In terms of the cadence of the cost saves, I think it's reasonable to look at those being spread relatively equally over the year. There may be a little bit of frontend loading into the first half of the year, but relatively equal. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Marty Flanagan : Good morning, Craig. Craig Siegenthaler : I wanted to see if you could update us on your M&A priorities. And specifically, what investment capabilities or distribution efforts would Invesco target or be interested in adding? Marty Flanagan : Thanks, Craig. So our perspective really has not changed. As we look at M&A, it always has to start, has to be strategic, it has to be additive to the business in areas of client demand where we just really don't have a competitive capability, or have the scale to compete. We also very much are focused on the culture of the organization, as I've pointed out. Historically, you have to have cultural alignment to be successful. And that will continue to be our criteria. And what we don't think it makes sense is sort of the roll-ups where there's just a lot of duplication. Clients don't like it and shareholders don't like it. It's just really hard. And so we will continue to stay away from that. Craig Siegenthaler : Got it. And then just as my follow up, when we think of potential M&A targets in the various sizes of different businesses, I'm wondering what are the largest managers by AUM that investor could target or what is the upper band of the universe of firms that you would consider acquiring? Marty Flanagan : Look, Craig, it's always facts and circumstances. And I think size is a factor. But size, the level of complexity is quite different with any organization. So it would really be facts and circumstances as opposed to some hard and fast rule. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Glenn Schorr from Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thanks very much. So a lot of good things to point to in the quarter. I do want to get a little more color on a lot of flows coming on the institutional side, retail seemed in the flat range. So wondering what efforts you can do to spur growth there. And then also, if you can focus on the outflows on the alternative side and what the plan is for private markets from here. Thanks. Marty Flanagan : Yes, a couple of things. So again, as you saw, gross flows were a record high for us. And taking them region by region, channel by channel, Allison, I think went through that pretty clearly. We continue to see momentum in the retail channels. It slowed down in EMEA as Allison spoke of. Some of that was from Brexit related sort of risk off as it came down to final negotiations. And quite frankly, there was some look over to the elections in the United States. The U.S. retail channel is really starting to make tremendous change and progress. We're not where we want to be, that's for sure. But the momentum there, the gross flows are there. We're seeing flows as you look into the year outside of ETFs in the traditional asset classes, these short duration fixed income. Emerging markets is actually picking up which is really good news as that back into flows, so cautiously optimistic. Within alternatives, it's largely been around GTR and that was really the driver this past quarter. Bank loans were also an area that we're still in outflows. As we look into this year, we'll see what the opportunities are with bank loans in particular. But again, we're obviously very, very focused on any area where we're relatively underperforming. Allison Dukes : The only thing I'd add to that on the alternative outflows was the third area we saw some outflows would be in real estate dispositions, and that would be somewhat in the normal course of that business, but it did contribute to the negative flows there. And I'd say one positive point as it relates to our retail flows is if we look at our active U.S. retail net outflows, they were actually $2.6 billion better than the third quarter. Now, they were still negative at $6.7 billion but that was an improvement of $2.6 billion over the prior quarter, really on the heels of higher gross sales and redemption levels that were significantly lower than what we saw across the industry. So signs of growth and improvement there. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate all that color? Just maybe one little follow-up on the alternative side? Do you feel like you have the suite of products you want to, Marty as you said, compete and scale effectively as growth continues there or is that one of the areas where you could see Invesco head into overtime, right, but it\u2019s right there obviously? Marty Flanagan : Good question. So, look, we clearly have a leadership position in real estate and bank loans. Private credit has been an area where it\u2019s had some good performance. We don't have the scale that we would want. The team is very strong, trying to do a three-year track record. So that's an important opportunity for us as we look forward. And again, we'll just continue to focus on expanding that business over this next year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Robert Lee from KBW. Robert Lee : Great. Good morning, Marty. Good morning, Allison. Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if maybe, Marty you could put a little bit, I guess a little bit more meat on the bone. If I think of the areas for growth talking about leveraging solutions, client engagement sales, but could you maybe dig into that a little bit about leveraging technology, the reorganization of sales function or reengineering of it, kind of maybe you could give a little bit of feel for what that is and what's driving it? Marty Flanagan : Yes. Okay, good. So, look, this has been in the making for, I don't know, four years now. And so all of a sudden, it's the overnight success. Our approach has been to have a very talented quantitative solutions team that\u2019s very strong at asset allocation, building anything from models to customized solutions for clients and also advisory to the clients, whether it be sort of the corner office suites in the retail channel, but quite frankly large pension plans around the world. And our approach has been to use our capabilities, whether it be our passive capabilities or active capabilities all the way through alternative capabilities. So it's not a duplicative set of skills. It's literally using what we've had in existence. We have built what is a very, very strong analytical tool that we use with clients as a way to help them analyze their portfolios. That's how the engagements happen and any one of those outcomes can happen simply from an advisor engagement to building a customized solution. During that journey, as you build it out, how you engage, how you faceoff with clients, there are clearly modifications to how you do that. And we seem to have found ourselves in a situation where we seem to have the formula right based on the outcomes that we're seeing. And I come back to -- this really is the fundamental topic that is driving the change in the industry is that clients are working fewer money managers. They're expecting more from money managers. So if you don't have that breadth of capability and if you don't have the ability to serve clients through these engagements, you're truly disadvantaged. And so it is really making a difference for us and we expect that will be the case in the years ahead. So hopefully, that gives you a little more color. Robert Lee : Yes. And then maybe a quick follow up just on capital management. Can you update us \u2013 in terms of the forward contract, it pretty much revolves down to zero. You had reset the dividend. You're building liquidity. But once you get through the April payment, how are you thinking at that point about your capital management priorities? Should we think that you may go back to starting to kind of restart some dividend growth or reengage in share repurchases? How should we think of kind of the priorities kind of post April full in payment? Allison Dukes : Sure. Rob, I'll take that. So, look, as we think about just sort of where we are now and as I think about rolling forward over the next couple of quarters, you'll know we built our cash balances. I'll also just remind everyone, we do have seasonality and comp expense that is seasonality and cash flow related. Comp expense in the first quarter, historically, the company has drawn on the revolver in the first quarter. We've obviously managed our cash balances a little bit higher. There is strong cash flow, just given the AUM dynamics that we see right now. I don't know what that will look like exactly as we work through the quarter. And we do have the liability to settle in April. All that said, we're in a very strong position and I continue -- I expect us to continue to build our cash balances longer term and improve net leverage. And then as I think about just what does that mean for the financial flexibility that we're looking to achieve and returning capital to shareholders, we are committed to that financial flexibility. We do want to invest in the business first and foremost to support future growth in the business. And we do remain committed to strengthening our balance sheet. And ultimately, we want to be in a position to return excess cash to shareholders. And I do expect that we'll be doing that through a stable and modestly growing dividend and eventually share repurchases. And so we are coming up soon here on the one year of having made some decisions around that and we've got the opportunity to think about what our return of capital to shareholders looks like, and we will be working through that in the coming months. I'll say that we're pleased to be in a very strong position to be having those conversations and look forward to sharing more. Robert Lee : Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Marty Flanagan : Thanks, Rob. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Ken Worthington : Hi. Good morning. Marty Flanagan : Good morning, Ken. Ken Worthington : Long-term organic asset growth was I think 3.9% in the quarter. Can you estimate your organic revenue growth in the quarter? There's lots of cross currents, inflows, outflows by different products and geography. So how does it all shake out from an organic revenue perspective? And then maybe I'll sneak in my follow up at the same time. As we think about the shift from active to passive, how is that impacting your margins? So you're cutting costs. Equity markets have appreciated meaningfully. FX is now helping. But if we exclude those and just focus on these inflows and outflows and migration to passive and solutions in your mix, does that end up helping margins? And if so, to what degree is that helping? Allison Dukes : Okay. Let me take your first one around the long-term organic revenue growth. I guess it's not a number we would disclose or think about exactly. But if you think about -- what you're looking at is excluding market and you surely look at the fee rate associated with where interest expense, as we point to every quarter, you continue to see a little bit of mix shift from some of the higher fee products to some of the lower fee products. So that does put pressure on your organic fee growth, no question. Without some market improvement in there, you would see downward pressure there. Our focus then really does shift to profitability. So I'll come to your second question. How do we think about the profitability given those dynamics, because markets go up and markets go down and we've seen the pressure that can put on the top line? As we think about the profitability and I'm not sure I'm going to answer your question exactly, I'm not sure I caught all the different puts and takes you were thinking about there, but I guess I would answer it in this way. While the absolute fee rate of some of our lower fee products would be lower, so take an ETF, for example, in the United States, the absolute fee rate there would be about half of a U.S.-based mutual fund. That said, the margin contribution is about the same, very similar, because you have lower servicing costs. So the margins on both are neutral to positive to our overall firm margins. And it really then becomes a function of volume. Because while the margin is the same, the absolute operating income yield would be lower and so you have to drive more volume over a lower fee product to contribute the same dollar of operating income that you would over a higher fee product. And that's really how we think about it. These are just the facts of our business and the facts of where demand is and making sure we're positioned to capture all of that demand, and then making sure we're well positioned to maintain our margins at a minimum, even in markets where we could be under pressure. Ken Worthington : Okay, that's super helpful. But I guess part of the core of this, and maybe you can opine on this for a second, the organic growth, organic asset growth was quite good this quarter, like 3.9%. Is that contributing to revenue or is the underlying mix such that even though it was a solid 3.9% asset growth, is that actually just detracting from revenues? Because it happens to be, EMEA was out, some alts [ph] were out, you've got high fee ETFs, but they're not quite high enough. And even 3.9% asset growth isn't enough to boost revenue growth. I guess that's kind of what I was really hoping to get. And I'm still not sure I have a sense of that answer. Allison Dukes : In a quarter like this, 3.9% organic growth is contributing to revenue. Yes, it's contributing to revenue. And then obviously even contributing more if we look at the positive operating leverage that comes from it, but you do get positive contribution. The high fee, low fee products are not necessarily always obvious as to what category they're in and you do see revenue contribution in a quarter like we just have. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Katz from Citigroup. Bill Katz : Okay. Thank you. Good morning, everybody. So first question is a two part question for Allison, then a follow up for Marty. Allison, could you just unpack the compensation dynamics between the fourth quarter and the first quarter, maybe help us understand what might roll off for the performance business? They were so elevated. And maybe the seasonal increase, if you will, just trying to get to sort of like a level of how to think about maybe the exit pacing for the second quarter. Allison Dukes : So I'll do my best to unpack that. If you look at just the performance fees and the compensation expense that\u2019s associated with those, it's going to be kind of closer to 50%. So it comes at a higher rate than what you would see in terms of the compensation associated with other elements of revenue. So that's a roll off. And then in terms of what would be higher, the seasonality of payroll taxes and some benefits, so that's somewhere in the $25 million to $30 million range. Then you've got the targeted cost saves that will be in there somewhere. We're not giving specific guidance around that any more so than what I've already provided. And I think that's probably the best way to think about it. The one thing that is not totally the same is the run up in the fourth quarter is what -- we only had that for kind of call it six weeks or so at the end of the quarter. If asset levels hold where they began the year and we've certainly seen them hold thus far into the month, you can expect that revenue and the associated compensation expense would be higher than what you would see in the fourth quarter, and that's just thinking about the typical relationship between revenue and compensation expense. Bill Katz : Okay. And then you mentioned in terms of building cash. Well, where are you in terms of your excess cash goal? Allison Dukes : Our cash balances at the end of the year were $1.4 billion. We have $764 million of that is committed to European regulatory and liquidity requirements. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research. Patrick Davitt : Hi. Good morning. Marty Flanagan : Good morning, Patrick. Patrick Davitt : So bond loans have obviously been a bright spot for you and others, but concern around kind of taper tantrum or even more significant rate shock has grown over the last few weeks with investors seemingly particularly worried about how large bond complexes will perform through that. So through that lens, could you remind us of Invesco\u2019s experience in the 2013 tantrum and maybe compare or contrast how you feel Invesco is now positioned for another tantrum or even bigger rate shock from here? Marty Flanagan : It's an interesting question. 2013 was a long time ago. But as we get through it and I suspect what's really going to matter I think the question is, where are the concentrations within your fixed income if there's something like that. And if you look at the range of fixed income capabilities that we have, it really is quite broad and heavy concentration in an area where sort of long duration shock could be quite painful to the organization. So that's my initial reflection on the question, if that's helpful. Patrick Davitt : Sure. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is on ESG. You mentioned that has a potential increase in contributors '21. If you can talk a little bit about what you think your ESG dedicated AUM is as of now? I know it's being integrated more thoroughly throughout the organization. And then talk about how much do you think that can potentially contribute to your institutional pipeline, and whether you see it becoming a bigger factor in the U.S. as well? Marty Flanagan : Yes. So, look, let me start with the bigger question gets specific. ESG is something that we're integrating throughout all our investment management teams, probably the most advanced through our capabilities; in EMEA, our fixed income teams, real estate, so we\u2019re pretty well into it right now. We\u2019re not done. But that is something that is absolutely a top focus of ours as an organization. The reality is if you are not skilled at managing ESG capabilities even within your traditional asset classes, you really are going to be challenged in EMEA. I'd say in the United States, it is moving beyond what was a conversation 12, 18 months ago to being something very, very real. And you're seeing commercial implications of it. And that is the same thing in Asia Pacific. Specifically using that more narrow definition, so we have about $34 billion in ESG AUM, but it\u2019s really quite broad. We have about 90 ESG funds or mandates that comes through. And I think the other area what we're seeing outside of institutional is really picking up on the retail basis. And right now we're the second largest provider of ESG ETFs in the United States. And there's about $9 billion in those assets. So, again, more to go, as I said. We have a developed capability, but it's also developing and we're really being quite aggressive in the area. Brian Bedell : Great. That's super helpful. And then just the follow up is on M&A. I guess from two different sides, thanks for the commentary about reiterating your stance on that. From a product perspective, how would you view adding a beta ETF franchise as opposed to a smart beta suite that you have right now? And then just in terms of overall stock price that we've seen for the asset managers in the last few years, we had a peak in early 2018, and very few managers have been able to make it back to that peak? You've tripled your stock price since the lows of last summer? But I guess what's your confidence in being able to get stock back to that peak early 2018 level organically? Marty Flanagan : So let me start with the stock price. And again, I have to be careful. That's your words, not mine. What drives stock price is operating outcomes and business momentum. And as Allison had talked about today, you're just seeing a markedly different set of outcomes in the last couple quarters. As you look into 2021, again without getting into forward guidance, it is many more tailwinds behind the organization that I've seen since 2018, and it's quite broad by region and by channel, and also within your various capabilities where we pointed out there\u2019s very, very high demand.  Now that said, there's always areas where we have areas for improvement and we'll continue to do that. But again, the tailwinds are very different than what we've seen since the middle of 2018. So from my perspective, that's going to drive stock price. With regard to adding a beta provider through M&A, again, I'll just answer the question as I had before. It all depends on facts and circumstances. It has to be additive to the organization. It can't be something that is a net negative through the combination. So again, it just really depends on the situation. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. The operating metrics in Great Wall look impressive and thanks for providing the flow. It\u2019s definitely a big contributor. But what are the options for your stake with that entity? Marty, I think in the past you've referenced getting your ownership above 49%. But I think your last comment on that was a little over a year ago. So is that still on the table? And what would be the timeframe for that? How should we think about the potential impact of you getting over 50% there? Marty Flanagan : Yes, good question. So let me answer that in two parts. So I think what has been differentiated, which is important to recall is even 49%, we uniquely have management control, so it is really operated as part of Invesco. So we operate as Invesco in total within Mainland China and that has helped our institutional business, therefore, our traditional Invesco and also we go through Invesco Great Wall, institutional also and retail. So, that's really -- the success is because we've been able to operate as really a single organization there.  With regard to the 49%, it is a conversation we continue to have with one on. It\u2019s obviously slowed down. I'd say the conversations between the U.S.-China were not helpful in advancing that. So we'll just have to see. I really can't put a timeframe on it. As clarity between the relationship between U.S. and China, if it eases I think that'll be a net positive. Brennan Hawken : Okay, that's fair. Thanks for that. Marty Flanagan : The bottom line, it's not getting in the way of our business success, so I think that's really the bottom line I want to make. Brennan Hawken : That is clear from the results, but thanks for that, Marty. Follow up is a two parter. So first, you've got some questions so far today and a bunch in the past on M&A and Invesco as a buyer, but \u2013 and just to be provocative, how should we think about you as a seller? I know -- the company's large and so the list isn't really long of who could buy you. But there are some large buyers out there talking pretty vocally about writing checks. So curious about how you would think about that. And I believe you have had -- there's been at least one Board meeting since Nelson Peltz and Ed Garden joined the Board. So could you add maybe some color on what kind of impact that has had on the Board dynamic? And any incremental details about plans or areas of focus for your new Board members? Thanks. Marty Flanagan : Good questions. It\u2019s a good way to get three questions in not two, but very good. You've done this before. So, look, with regard to -- let's be very, very clear. Today, the Board is actually dedicated to driving success of this organization. They value Invesco being an independent global asset manager. And again, the results are, as I said, you can see the momentum and can anticipate we're on a good track. So that's the first point. Secondly, within any conversation around M&A, my comments would be very similar to somebody looking at any money manager. And if it's not strategic, if there's a lot of overlap, if it's inconsistent with what clients want, it is very hard to do. And so as you say, that would get you to an even narrower set of options if you considered something like that. So, again, the criteria works both ways and I think that's important to understand. And then with regard to the Board, again, we've had a very strong Board. And Nelson and Ed and Tom Finke from Barings have joined. All three are very, very talented. Tom was the former CEO of Barings. Nelson had been around this space for a very long time. They know the space. They obviously are very outspoken about the opportunities that they see within the asset management space and the dynamics have been very good. You brought three new experts onto the Board. And again, just making sure we as an organization are laser focused on providing for clients and shareholders. And with the existing Board members, I think if anybody is on the stock, they should feel really good about it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Carrier from Bank of America. Mike Carrier : Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Just one question just on growth versus value. On the performance chart in the appendix, it looks like growth performance remained strong. The value continues to be on the weaker side. So I just wanted to get your thoughts. If we continue to get a shift towards value, do you have some active products that are performing well that can benefit from flows versus maybe what we see in the chart, which is just the average across the full category? Marty Flanagan : Yes. So, the value related equity given delays have been the area of focus for us as an organization, there\u2019s no question about relative performance. We're absolutely focused on making sure that the portfolios are in a position to perform. And again, I don't want to get too far ahead of myself, but if you look at that value suite during the fourth quarter, the relative performance was really, really quite strong. And that said, let's be clear. It's a quarter. It's not one year, three year, five years, but it was important to see that within the fourth quarter. Mike Carrier : Okay. Thanks. Marty Flanagan : Thank you. Operator : Chris [ph], you\u2019re line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Yes, great. A question on operating margin. You guys have a target in mind for this as you execute on your expense savings plan and then related, what do you think is the long-term potential for this business as it relates to operating margin? Allison Dukes : Good question. We have not set a targeted operating margin coming out of this. Our focus has really been to think about the continued dynamics that are really driving client demand and thinking about getting our business oriented to capture that demand and make sure we're doing so in the most profitable way. And we continue to see how these trends are playing out. What do I think is long term, I think that's a hard one to answer, because I think we continue to see some of these shifts. We remain committed to our active capabilities and we do believe we will continue to see interest there and demand there, and we could see even more positive growth coming from that. So, as client preferences continue to evolve, we're going to continue to evolve our platform to operate at the highest profitability we can with it. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Chris Shutler from William Blair. Chris Shutler : Hi, everybody. Good morning. Marty, what are your thoughts on the potential for direct custom indexing? And is this a place that Invesco plans to participate? And if so, how? Marty Flanagan : Sorry, I didn't get the question. I apologize. Chris Shutler : Sorry about that. Just director custom indexing, is that a place where Invesco plans to participate? Marty Flanagan : We have a self indexing capability and it actually has been an area of growing success recently. We just turned our attention to it a couple of years ago and the works really been -- it's through the Solutions Group where we\u2019ve had the greatest success in building unique indexes for clients. So again, we look at it as a real area of growth. But going forward -- what we\u2019re really looking forward is just really building that deeper relevance for our clients, and it's off to a very strong start. Chris Shutler : Okay. And then separately just on the registered investment advisor space, maybe \u2013 or just the financial advisor space overall, can you give us an update on Jemstep and Intelliflo and what's been going at those platforms? How are they growing? And at what point should we expect those to generate some meaningful flows for Invesco? Marty Flanagan : Yes, it's a good question. There is about 900 billion in assets under administration right now. And the last year has been really focused on pulling together that platform through the last couple of acquisitions. And so we're looking for this year to be the beginning of some additive growth after a period of just really pulling out that platform. So again, we'll have more to say later in the year. But we're hopeful that we're at that spot right now. Operator : And I am showing no further questions at this time. Marty Flanagan : Okay. Again on behalf of Allison and myself, thank you for your time and the questions. I appreciate the dialog and we'll be in touch. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect at this time.",

[Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Now I would like to turn the conference call over to your speakers for today, Marty Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; and Allison Dukes, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin. Marty Flanagan : Thank you, operator, and thanks everybody for joining us, and we look forward to the conversation. As we begin 2021, we remain cautiously optimistic with the vaccine rollout gaining attraction that we\u2019re emerged from the global pandemic this year. I think this is only confirmed by the increase economic activity we are all seeing, that said, risks do remain. The good news is Invesco is off to a great start this year. And as you can see in the results that were reported this morning, and if you\u2019re so inclined to follow along, I\u2019m going to speak, speaking to the highlight slide, which is Slide 3. Our investment key capabilities and the tremendous focus on our clients\u2019 continue to produce good momentum in our business. We have now achieved nine straight months of net long-term inflows. In the first quarter, net long-term inflows were $24.5 billion. This is a record level of inflows for the firm. This follows net long-term inflows of nearly $18 billion in the second half of last year. And this represents nearly a 9% annualized long-term organic growth rate led by net flows into ETFs continued strength in fixed income and net inflows into the balanced funds. And as you can see on Slide 3, the key areas that were highlighted in January, you have scale, investment readiness and competitive strength growth-to-growth in the quarter. These are areas where investment performances are strong or highly competitive. We\u2019re well positioned for growth. Retail flows significantly improved in the quarter, and we\u2019re $21.2 billion of a $24.5 billion of the net long-term flows or ETFs, excluding the QQQs, generated net long-term inflows of $16.8 billion. This is also a record for the firm, which contributed significantly to the $10 billion of net long-term inflows generated in the Americas. Invesco\u2019s U.S.-ETFs, excluding the QQQs, captured 6.7% of the U.S. industry net ETF inflows. This is more than two times or 3% market share. Within private markets, we launched two-CLOs, which raised $800 million, and we remained focused on our alternative capabilities of space where we also see the benefits of our MassMutual. MassMutual is committed over $1 billion to various strategies, including providing a credit facility, which is one of our private market funds. We had net long-term inflows of $6.5 billion within active fixed income, and within active global equities, are nearly $50 billion developing markets fund is key capability wired in the Oppenheimer transaction, so $1.3 billion of inflows. That said there are still areas of improvements within active equities, where we continue to work and remained focused on those opportunities. Net long-term inflows into Asia-Pac were $16.7 billion in the first quarter; following $17 billion of net inflows in the second half of 2020. The China JV launched nine new funds with $6.2 billion of net long-term inflows. In addition, our solutions enabled institutional pipeline has grown meaningfully and accounts were over 60% of our pipeline at the end of the quarter. Allison will provide more information a few minutes on the flows, the pipeline, the results for the quarter. But I would note, we generated positive operating leverage producing an operating margin of 40.2% for the quarter. Strong cash flows have been generated from our operations, improved our cash position resulting in no draw down on our credit facility at quarter end. Our quarter growth would be experienced seasonally higher demand on our cash flow. The board also approved a 10% increase in a quarterly dividend to $0.17 per share. Given our historical investments in the business and our most recent efforts to better align our organization with our strategy, I\u2019m confident we have the talent, capabilities, the resources and momentum to drive \u2013 to deliver for our clients and drive the future growth and success. And with that, I will turn it over to Allison to walk through the results in greater detail. Allison Dukes : Thank you, Marty, and good morning, everyone. Moving to Slide 4, our investment performance improved in the first quarter, with 70% and 76% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers on a 5-year and a 10-year basis, respectively. This reflected continued strengths in fixed income, global equities, including emerging markets equities and Asian equities, all areas where we continue to see demand from clients globally. I\u2019ll also note that our published investment performance now reflects Morningstar peer rankings for composites, where U.S. domiciled mutual fund is the most representative AUM in the composite, whereas previously, we had relied on Lipper data. This transition more closely aligned our data to the investment performance data reviewed by our U.S. clients and is more consistent with how our peers reflect investment performance. Additionally, we\u2019ve expanded the population of AUM included in performance disclosures by about $150 billion for each period presented through the addition of benchmark relative performance data for institutional AUM, where peer rankings do not exist. This approach is used by certain of our peers and we believe it more meaningfully represents the contribution of our institutional AUM to our performance metrics. Moving to Slide 5, you\u2019ll notice we reorganized our ending AUM and net long-term flow slides to group the ending AUM, and net long-term flows together for each cut of our data, by total investment approach, channel, geography, and asset class. We believe this will better illustrate our flows and the context of our overall AUM for each category. We ended the quarter with just over $1.4 trillion in AUM. Of the $54 billion in AUM growth, approximately $25 billion is a function of increased market values. Our diversified platform generated net long-term inflows in the first quarter of $24.5 billion, representing 8.8% annualized organic growth. Active AUM of net long-term inflows were $7.5 billion or a 3.4% annualized organic growth rate, and passive AUM of net long-term inflows were $17 billion or a 31.3% annualized organic growth rate. The retail channel generated net long-term inflows of $21.2 billion in the quarter, an improvement from roughly flat performance in the fourth quarter, driven by the positive ETF flows. Institutional channel generated net long-term inflows of $3.3 billion in the quarter. Regarding retail net inflows, our ETF, excluding the QQQs, generated net long-term inflows of $16.8 billion including meaningful net inflows into our higher fee ETF. Net ETF inflows in the U.S., were a focus on equities in the first quarter, including a high level of interest in our S&P 500 equal weight ETF, which had $4 billion in net inflows in the quarter. In addition to the S&P 500 equal weight ETF, we had five other ETFs that reported net inflows of over $1 billion each. These six ETFs represented $10 billion in net inflows for the quarter. It\u2019s also worth noting that our Invesco NASDAQ next-gen 100 ETFs, the QQQJ surpass the $1 billion AUM mark in the quarter following its inception in October of 2020. This is on the heels of our successful QQQ marketing campaign and sponsorship of the NCAA championship in the first quarter. Looking inflows by geography on Slide 6, you\u2019ll note that the Americans had net long-term inflows of $10 billion in the quarter, an improvement of $7.8 billion from the fourth quarter. The improvement was driven by net inflows in ETFs, institutional net inflows, various fixed income strategies and importantly, focused sales efforts. Asia Pacific delivered one of its strongest quarters ever with net long-term inflows of $16.7 billion. Net inflows were diversified across the region. $9.4 billion of these net inflows were from greater China, including $8.5 billion in our China JV. The balances of the flows in Asia Pacific were comprised of $3 billion from Japan, $1.9 billion from Singapore and the remaining $2.3 billion was generated from several other countries in the region. Net long-term inflows for EMEA, excluding the UK, were $3.7 billion driven by retail flows, including particularly strong net inflows of $1.2 billion into our global consumer trends fund, the growth equities capability, which saw demand from across the EMEA region. ETF net inflows in EMEA were $1.6 billion in the quarter, including interest in a wide variety of U.S. and EMEA-based ETFs. Notably, we saw net inflows of $0.5 billion into our blockchain ETF and $400 million into one of our newly launched ESG ETFs in the quarter. The Invesco MSCI USA ESG Universal Screened ETF. And finally, the UK experienced net long-term outflows of $5.9 billion in the quarter driven by net outflows in multi-asset institutional quantitative equities and UK equities. Turning to flows across asset class, equity net long-term inflows of $9.8 billion saw similar capabilities I\u2019ve mentioned, including the developing markets fund, the global consumer trends fund and ETF, including our S&P 500 equal weight ETF. We continue to see strength in fixed income across all channels and markets in the first quarter with net long-term inflows of $7.6 billion. This following net inflows of $8.2 billion in fixed income in the fourth quarter. It\u2019s worth noting that the net inflows and the balanced asset class is $7.3 billion arose largely from China and alternative net long-term inflows improved by $4.1 billion due to a combination of inflows in senior loans, commodities and newly launched CLOs during the quarter. Moving to Slide 7. Our institutional pipeline grew to $45.5 billion at March 31 from $30.5 billion at year end. The growth of the pipeline this quarter includes a large lower fee passive indexing mandate in Asia Pacific assisted by our custom solutions advisory team. This is an opportunity for us to offer a solutions-based differentiated passive investment to meet the needs of a key strategic client with the potential to expand the relationship over time with access to higher fee opportunities. We are also able to leverage our in-house indexing capabilities with this mandate. Excluding this large mandate in Asia Pacific, the pipeline remains relatively consistent to prior quarter levels in terms of size, asset mix and fee composition. While there\u2019s always some uncertainty with large client funding, we\u2019re currently estimating that between 50% and 65% of the pipeline will fund in the second quarter, including the large indexing mandate. The funding of this mandate will also have a slight downward impact on our net revenue yields next quarter. Overall, the pipeline is diversified across asset classes and geographies, and our solutions capability enabled 61% of the global institutional pipeline and created wins and customized mandate. This has contributed to meaningful growth across our institutional network warranting our continuing investment and focus on this key capability. Turning to Slide 8. You\u2019ll notice that our net revenues increased $23 million or 1.8% from the fourth quarter as higher average AUM in the first quarter was partially offset by $71 million decrease in performance fees from the prior quarter. The net revenue yield excluding performance fees was 35.7 basis points, a decrease of three tenths of a basis point from the fourth quarter yield level. This decrease was driven by lower day count in the first quarter that negatively impacted the yield by eight tenths of a basis point and higher discretionary money market fee waivers that negatively impacted the yield by three tenths of a basis point. These negative impacts were partially offset by the positive impact of rising markets and net long-term inflows during the quarter. Going forward, we do expect money market fee waivers to remain in place for the foreseeable future until rates begin to recover to more normalized levels. Total adjusted operating expenses increased 0.7% in the first quarter. The $5 million increase in operating expenses was driven by higher variable compensation as a result of higher revenue, as well as the seasonal increase in payroll taxes and certain benefits offset by the reduction in compensation related to performance fees recognized last quarter and savings that we realized in the quarter resulting from our strategic evaluation. Operating expenses remained at lower than historic activity levels due to pandemic impact the discretionary spending, travel and other business operations that have persisted in the quarter. Moving to Slide 9. We update you on the progress we\u2019ve made with our strategic evaluation. As we\u2019ve noted previously, we\u2019re looking across four key areas of our expense base. Our organizational model, our real estate footprint, management of third-party spend and technology and operations efficiency. Through this evaluation, we will invest in key areas of growth, including ETFs, fixed income, China, solutions, alternatives and global equities, while creating permanent net improvements of $200 million in our normalized operating expense base. A large element of the savings will be generated from compensation, which includes realigning our non-client facing workforce to support key areas of growth and repositioning to lower cost locations. The remainder of the savings will come through property office and technology and G&A expenses. In the first quarter we realized $16 million in cost savings, $15 million of the savings was related to compensation expense. The remaining $1 million in savings was related to facilities, which has shown in the property office and technology category. $16 million in cost savings or $65 million annualized combined with the $30 million in annualized savings realized in 2020 brings us to $95 million or 48% of our $200 million net savings expectation. As it relates to timing, we still expect approximately $150 million or 75% of the run rate savings to be achieved by the end of this year, with the remainder realized by the end of 2022. Of the $150 million in net savings by the end of this year, we anticipate, we will realize roughly 65% of the savings through compensation expense, the remaining 35% would be spread across the occupancy, tech spend and G&A. The breakdown for the remaining $50 million and net cost save in 2022 will be similar. With $95 million of the expected $150 million in net savings by the end of this year already in the quarterly run rate, the degree of net savings per quarter will moderate going forward. In the first quarter we incurred $30 million of restructuring costs. In total, we\u2019ve recognized nearly $150 million of our estimated $250 million to $275 million in restructuring costs that were associated with this program. We expect the remaining transaction costs for the realization of this program to be in the range of a $100 million to $125 million over the next two years with roughly one half of this amount occurring in the remainder of 2021. As a reminder, the costs associated with the strategic evaluation are not reflected in our non-GAAP results. Our expectations of our first second quarter operating expenses to be relatively flat to the first quarter, assuming no change in markets and FX levels from March 31. We entered the second quarter with $1.4 trillion in AUM driven by net inflows and market tailwinds from the first quarter. These tailwinds will have a modest impact on both revenues and associated variable expenses. The impact on expenses will be offset by lower compensation expense related to seasonality and payroll taxes and benefits, plus incremental savings related to the strategic evaluation. We also expect a modest increase in marketing related expenses as the first quarter is typically the low point in marketing spend annually. One area that is still more difficult to forecast at this point is when COVID impacted travel and entertainment expense levels will begin to normalize. The rollout of vaccines, we believe we might begin to see a modest resumption of travel activity later in the second quarter, and perhaps more in the third quarter. Moving to Slide 10. Adjusted operating income improved $18 million to $503 million for the quarter driven by the factors we just reviewed. Adjusted operating margin improved 70 basis points to 40.2% as compared to the fourth quarter. Most importantly, our degree of positive operating leverage reflected in our non-GAAP results is 2x for the quarter, underscoring our focus on driving scale and profitability across our diversified platform. Non-operating income included $25.9 million in net gains for the quarter compared to $31.9 million in net gain last quarter as higher equity and earnings, primarily from increased yellow marks were more than offset by lower market gains on our seed portfolio as compared to the prior quarter. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 24% compared to 21.7% in the fourth quarter. The effective tax rate on net income was higher in the first quarter, primarily due to an increase in income generated and higher taxing jurisdictions relative to total income. We estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 24% for the second quarter. The actual effective tax rate may vary from this estimate due to the impact of non-recurring items on pre-tax income and discreet tax items. Turning to Slide 11. Our balance sheet cash position was $1.158 billion at March 31 and approximately $760 million of this cash is held for regulatory requirements. Cash balances are impacted by the typical seasonal increases in cash needs in the first quarter related to our compensation cycle. We also paid $117 million on a forward share repurchase liability in January. In addition to using excess cash to reduce leverage, we seek to improve liquidity and our financial flexibility. Despite the increased cash needs in the quarter, the revolver balance was zero at the end of March, consistent with our commitment to improve our leverage profile. Additionally, the remaining forward share repurchases liability of $177 million was settled in early April. We also renegotiated our $1.5 billion credit facility extending the maturity date to April of 2026 with favorable terms. We believe we\u2019re making solid progress in our efforts to build financial flexibility and as such our Board approved a 10% increase in our quarterly common dividend to $0.17 per share. The share buybacks dating back to last year on Slide 11, which reflects $45 million in the first quarter of this year are related to vesting of employee share awards. We remain committed to a sustainable dividend and to returning capital to shareholders longer term through a combination of modestly increasing dividends and share repurchases. In summary, Marty highlighted the growth we\u2019ve seen in our key capabilities and our continued focus on executing the strategy that aligns with these areas. We\u2019re also executing on our strategic evaluation and reallocating our resources to position us for growth. And finally, we remain prudent in our approach to capital management. Our focus on driving greater efficiency and effectiveness into our platform, combined with the work we\u2019ve done to build a global business with a comprehensive range of capabilities, puts Invesco in a very strong position to meet client needs, run a disciplined business and to continue to invest in and grow our franchise over the long-term. With that, I\u2019ll open it up to the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. You may go ahead. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. Can you discuss the strengths and needs a bit more broadly? I know you gave a lot of detail around where the flows will come \u2013 came from it and balanced as well, being a source of the asset flows. But curious about seasonality in that part of the world versus maybe what we see in the U.S., one which is typically the strongest and then kind of the outlook for that region, given the strength that you just generated in the first quarter? Marty Flanagan : Dan was it Asia? I\u2019m sorry. Yes. Let me have a couple of comments now and Allison can speak to it also. So look, there\u2019s this little question I think we\u2019ve all talked about the strength of Asia, China in particular. China\u2019s real, China\u2019s real for us is very meaningful. You\u2019ve seen the recent growth over the last couple of years. And I\u2019d say the first quarter is really, really strong. There\u2019s no question, but the reality, you\u2019ve followed the market that had a pullback. You have to anticipate that\u2019s kind of slowed down a little bit here. That said, it doesn\u2019t \u2013 when you look at the full year, it\u2019s going to continue to be an important contributor and we\u2019re just looking for further growth in the years to come. So that\u2019s our perspective at the moment. Allison Dukes : Yes. The only thing I\u2019d add, obviously sentiments maybe shifted just a little bit there in the recent months, very strong sentiment fourth quarter, very strong sentiment in the first couple of months of the first quarter, we\u2019ve definitely seen a little bit of a softening there and we\u2019ll pull back in March and into April. So it\u2019s going to be a place to watch. I will say that broadly speaking for Asia Pacific, we are starting to see flows really start to come in a balanced profile across the region, China being very significant as Marty said. In total little north of $9.5 billion of those flows came from IGW and Greater China. But as I mentioned, saw $3 billion inflows from Japan and $2 billion from Singapore, $2.3 billion from some of the other regions. And of course, as we noted in the pipeline, we\u2019re seeing very strong mandates coming in broadly from Asia Pacific. So, I think it\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t know that it seasonality so much as maybe a sentiment that we\u2019ve got to keep an eye on there. I would note in the nine funds that we launched in the first quarter in IGW, they generated $6 billion inflows in that first quarter. Most of those were balanced equity funds. And the fee rates there are very strong. They are better than the firm average and a real meaningful contributors to our growth. Dan Fannon : Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And then just to follow-up just on the strategic evaluation that you are having progress in several quarters. Just thinking about the $200 million in aggregate, is that number, would you consider to be conservative at this point? Anything about that with that deep reinvested back in the business, or is there a potential for some upside to those savings? Allison Dukes : I\u2019d say, you definitely see us making good progress with $95 million of the $200 million. We feel like achieved at this point. The $200 million remains our net target. We are very focused and reinvesting savings and continuing to reallocate those savings into areas of growth. So at this point, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re \u2013 we would be suggesting that the $200 million is conservative. We are going to be consistently looking at how do we continue to transform our business and make sure that we are spending in the areas where we can generate the most growth and really looking at allocating our expenses and reallocating our expenses with that mindset. Dan Fannon : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. You may go ahead. Patrick Davitt : Good morning, everyone. Just give us a little more color on the kind of somewhat outsize redemption rate on the institutional side, anything idiosyncratic or a common theme you could point to in that acceleration? And in that vein, any known lumpy redemption as an offset to the very strong unfunded pipeline you\u2019ve highlighted. Marty Flanagan : Yes. I wouldn\u2019t call it any one specific thing in the institutional redemptions, but it\u2019s similar to when money comes in, it just really is hard to predict quarter-to-quarter. So I wouldn\u2019t point to an elevated level of redemptions going forward. Again, we\u2019ll just continue to follow client\u2019s desires on the timing of redeeming or giving us money. Allison Dukes : Yes. I would agree. I mean, it\u2019s lumpy, there\u2019s nothing specific happening there. The gross funding out of the institutional pipeline was about $21.5 billion. And again, you\u2019re seeing the pipeline even excluding this significant mandate, really maintain its size. And we\u2019re seeing a lot of the fundings come not just from the pipeline, but existing client augmentation activity outside the pipeline. I think it\u2019s important to remember that the pipeline is not the only source of our institutional flow. It\u2019s certainly a strong indication. But as we continue to grow these relationships and really deepen the relationship, they become much more strategic, which generates additional flows but nothing specific to point to there. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. You may go ahead. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to follow-up on Dan\u2019s question on Asia and I heard your commentary on flows by geography. That was very helpful. But could you also help us walk through what the product mix would have looked like inside the $17 billion of flows and any color in terms of channel mix retail versus institutional? Marty Flanagan : So I can hit some of the high levels and Allison can add to it. So, within China, it\u2019s heavy equities. Allison called it balanced in particular that has been historical driver. Japan continued to be fixed income during the quarter. And \u2013 excuse me, the big flows were really coming from retail, although the Japan that was institutional. Allison Dukes : And in terms of asset class mix, I\u2019d tell you the half of it is coming from balanced and the remainder coming across equity and fixed income capabilities. But our balance products they\u2019re really driving a significant amount of the flows. In terms of the retail and institutional mix, it was about $13 billion on the retail side, out of the total $16.6 billion. Craig Siegenthaler : Great. No, super helpful there. And then just as my follow-up, I wanted your perspective on the May 24 lockup expiration for MassMutual. I\u2019m wondering, is there any thought on extending that into the future? And if it isn\u2019t, could we expect some stock sales for MassMutual later this year? Marty Flanagan : Yes. So look let me to start by here. The relationship continues to be very, very strong. And yes, we continue to do more and more together, as I mentioned, just \u2013 particular around alternatives for us. There\u2019s going to \u2013 obviously not just with equity, but also with the preferred. And I can\u2019t speak for them, but what I can tell you is they\u2019ve told us that they are very happy with the relationship. They\u2019re very happy with the investment and we just anticipate that would continue. Craig Siegenthaler : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. You may go ahead. Ken Worthington : Good morning. So capital gains and dividend tax rates seem poised to rise materially for the wealthy. What do you think are the implications for wealthy investors in terms of their investments? Do you think this drives any meaningful reallocation as these new taxes go through? And are there opportunities for Invesco in product development to help these wealthy investors adapt to a much higher U.S. tax rate and probably higher taxes globally? Marty Flanagan : Ken, great question. If I knew the answer, I wouldn\u2019t have the shot probably. But the reality is like everywhere. We\u2019re very, very focused on it. And I\u2019d say where the firm\u2019s gotten to right now, even with the individual investors as you\u2019re talking about the way that we have moved our businesses, quite frankly, focus on a lot of high net worth individuals within the wealth management channels and really supported by the solutions capability that we\u2019ve developed over the last number of years. In fact, that\u2019s where it started. And so if \u2013 tax managed was a focus before, sure they\u2019re going to be continued to be a focus now. The good news is, things like municipal bonds are going to continue to be very, very important. We have very strong franchise there. But needless to say, people are going to want access to equity for growth and continue to see what we can work on. But I don\u2019t have anything very specifically on that. Ken Worthington : Okay. Thank you. And then for follow-up. Dividends and capital management, so you paid off or paid down a number of obligations through April 1, balance sheet is in much better shape than it was a year ago. So how do we think about the balance of capital return in further strengthening of the balance sheet as we look through to the rest of the year? And how are you thinking about a payout ratio for 2021? Allison Dukes : Sure. Thanks, Ken. Yes, so I\u2019d say our capital priorities are consistent with what you\u2019ve heard us say repeatedly for the last several quarters. And I\u2019m very pleased to say we\u2019re making good progress against those, and you can really see the evidence of that progress in some of what we\u2019ve announced today. We remain committed to financial flexibility, which gives us the opportunity to really reinvest in the business and support our future growth. And that is our priority. First and foremost is creating that financial flexibility to reinvest in the business and growth capabilities there. We also want to improve the strength of our balance sheet and continue to return excess cash to shareholders. So please, we were able to announce the increase the common dividend today. We are committed to stable and modestly increasing dividends. In terms of a payout ratio, we\u2019re being thoughtful about how we continue to improve the payout ratio. The decision we made a year ago to cut the dividend was not one that was made lightly as you know, it was not an easy decision. But absolutely I think we would reflect and say it was a good decision because it\u2019s given us the opportunity to continue to improve that financial flexibility through the more uncertain times last year. As we have made progress so far in some of those liabilities with the forward share repurchase liabilities both now completely paid out and are leverage well-managed. It does give us the opportunity to continue to think about modestly increasing that dividend. We felt like 10% was the right level for where we are today and the earnings profile we have today, but we think we have an opportunity to continue to improve that over time. We just want to be thoughtful and measured in our pace there. Ken Worthington : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche bank. You may go ahead. Brian Bedell : All right. Good morning, folks. Maybe Allison, just to stay with you on the top of expenses. If you can talk a little bit about the outsourcing deal with State Street. I know that\u2019s a longer-term endeavor, and I believe that\u2019s over and above the $200 million, it\u2019s really to frame the potential net savings from that. But maybe just to characterize the timing of that and whether the vast majority of the assets of Invesco that are serviceable by State Street are moving to that platform. And whether that in a normal market environment whether you feel that you have confidence that you can save up to 40% operating margin level. Ken Worthington : Sure. Thank you for the question, Brian. Yes. I mean, as you know, this is definitely a longer-term installation. You did see the announcement via State Street a couple of weeks ago. The installation is going to have benefits. There\u2019ll be realized in a time horizon that really extends beyond our existing cost transformation program. So as you know, that really runs through 2022. And as we think about the benefits that we can generate from Alpha, those are going to be things that actually won\u2019t be realized until 2023, 2024 and beyond. And so it\u2019s too early at this point for us to put any contours around what we think it could generate for us. We do expect to be able to do that at a later date. I would say broadly speaking, we absolutely expect there to be operational efficiencies and risk mitigation elimination of redundancies. I mean, all of these things are going to create real benefits as we scale over the coming years. But too early, just yet to point to what that could look like. Anything you want to add, Marty to it? Marty Flanagan : Look I think it\u2019s going to be \u2013 it\u2019s a very important undertaking for us. And front and back investment \u2013 all of our investment platform on it is going to be very beneficial to the firm. Brian Bedell : Okay. That\u2019s good color. And then Marty, just on ESG, obviously the topic you talked about quite a bit. I guess, first question is, are you able to size the ESG flows to the franchise in the quarter and the level of what you considered ESG AUM? And then secondly, maybe if you can just talk more broadly about what you\u2019re seeing in demand for those products and any update on the integration of ESG throughout the investment process? Marty Flanagan : Yes. So let me make a couple of comments and Allison can talk to it. So right now, 75% of all our investment capabilities have ESG inclusion. Obviously our intent is to be 100%. Right now that\u2019s up to 2023 our goal is to pull it in closer. If you look very specifically at ESG specific mandates, assets under management that\u2019s about $40 billion. And so to be clear, that\u2019s excluding, that\u2019s not counting ESG inclusion. I mean, that\u2019s really the way of the world. This is really dedicated ESG product offerings, where there has to be some ESG consideration within it. And the flows have been quite strong. It\u2019s really some of the historical things that within our ETF lineup. That said, what we are seeing institutional clients in particular, working with our solutions group is really creating outcomes to meet their ESG goals. And we\u2019re also leveraging indexing capabilities with a number of these institutions to meet their ESG goals. So it really no different to us, it is quite pervasive. I\u2019d say that the strongest area right now is, UK, Europe, the U.S. is following and quite frankly, in Asia, it\u2019s also very, very strong. So needless to say, if you don\u2019t have the revolver \u2013 the capabilities to be on your front foot ESG you\u2019re going to be at quite the disadvantage. Allison Dukes : Yes. I\u2019d say, the flows that would be specifically attributed to our ESG capabilities in the quarter were around $4 billion. I\u2019d say, notably we are the second largest ESG ETF provider in the United States. We have nine ETFs right now that are dedicated ESG ETFs in the United States where we have about $9.5 billion in AUM there that $4 billion is a global number inflows over the first quarter. So we are absolutely seeing real strength. It just underscoring the importance we all understand around ESG capabilities. Marty Flanagan : The other area where the bulk of it is, it\u2019s been direct real estate where you could imagine the work with clients and the other is really through our quantitative team is the other area where you have the balance of dedicated ESG capabilities. Brian Bedell : Great color. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Robert Lee with KVW. You may go ahead. Robert Lee : Great. Thanks and good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe Marty you talked about this calls in a while, but you think back over the years [indiscernible] you made some technology investments, which I believe you put under the banner of Intelliflo in UK. So maybe update us on that on strategically and where that is fits in the organization, and maybe how you start to leverage that through relationships or flows [indiscernible] Marty Flanagan : Yes. Good. So as you point out, we\u2019ve had a number of smaller bolt-ons around that technology and it has all been pulled together over the past year that was the effort last year. It\u2019s now the banner is Intelliflo where the success has really been more immediately is through something called Vision, which is a technology that is an analytical tool that we work through our solutions team with our institutional clients. The next area where we are looking to expand outside of the UK is the direct to the financial advisor channel. That again is where we\u2019re turning our attention, beginning this year to expand that. So we did take a year to pull the rest of the platform together, and it will frankly be focused on the RIA channel in particular. Robert Lee : I mean, is it possible to attach any type of demand and\u2026 Marty Flanagan : Yes. So right now, there\u2019s about $900 billion of AUA within that platform. And the core capability continues to grow. And again, the historical focus on financial advisors has not changed and we think that\u2019s, again, going to be the future is for that platform. Robert Lee : Okay, great. And that was my question. Thanks for taking it. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS. You may go ahead. Adam Beatty : Thank you, and good morning, this is Adam Beatty in for Brennan. I want to follow-up on the fee rate, which has trended fairly well recently. How would you characterize the exit rate, if you will, from the quarter versus the blended average through the quarter, whether it\u2019s kind of trending upward, trending down or what? And also in terms of the pipeline extra large low fee mandate, is the fee rate on that pipeline higher or lower than the current plan for the firm? Thank you. Allison Dukes : Yes. Thanks, Adam. Hard to decompose the trending of the fee rate, exactly, just given the puts and takes of how the calculation is done throughout the quarter, but I would tell you just generally speaking, it probably \u2013 the puts and takes, I would say, we\u2019re actually probably made the trending relatively stable. So if you think about what the fee rates sort of the change in the first quarter fee rate net revenue yield ex performance fees relative to the fourth quarter lower day count in the quarter, as I mentioned, impacted net revenue yield by 8/10 of a basis point. So that was meaningful. And then money market fee waivers were pretty consistent through the quarter. And that would have been about 3/10 of a downward impact overall in the quarter. Now I would say, baked into that was what we were experiencing in money market fee waivers in prior quarters. So it\u2019s probably about a 6/10 of a basis point impact overall in terms of the fee waivers in the quarter, it was just 3/10 higher than the prior quarter. Those were largely offset, however, by the positive impact of rising markets and net long-term flows. So that\u2019s why I say, I\u2019m not sure the entry rate and the exit rate were that dissimilar given the nature of the puts and takes inside of the quarter. And so I think, as you think about it going forward and getting to, I think probably where you\u2019re going with the pipeline as well, there were going to be a couple of things that, we think about as we think about the fee rate moving into the next quarter. One day count is less of a drag going into the second quarter. It\u2019s a very modest, and I\u2019ll say, very modest, help with just an additional day. As I mentioned, I think money market fee waivers, I think that impact will be consistent through the quarter. And so I think that\u2019s going to be a bit of a neutral, but negative impact on an absolute basis. And then it looking at the pipeline and the pipeline being very significant, obviously, an absolute side, if I exclude this large, significant Asia Pacific index mandate, the remaining pipeline actually looks pretty consistent with prior quarters, both in terms of absolute size and the fee composition. And as we\u2019ve noted in the past, the average fee rate on the institutional pipeline is below the firm average not significantly below, but I\u2019d say modestly below the firm average, and it\u2019s been \u2013 it\u2019s held quite steady for the last three or four quarters. And so I don\u2019t expect that to be a different impact. But this very significant sizable win, which we\u2019ll fund sometime in the second quarter, will be a modest drag on net revenue yield in the second quarter, more so going into the third quarter when it is fully realized on the run rate. Adam Beatty : Excellent. Makes sense. Thank you for the detail. Turning to alternatives and the flow outlook there, there\u2019s a few different cross currency had the COO issuance. Last quarter, you pointed to some kind of routine dispositions in real estate. But the pipeline looks pretty solid. So just wanted to get your thoughts on how that looks going forward. Thank you. Allison Dukes : I\u2019m sorry. I missed the very beginning of the... Marty Flanagan : Alternatives. Allison Dukes : Oh, on alternatives on the pipeline? Marty Flanagan : Yes. So it continues to be \u2013 real estate can just be very, very strong. Bank loans have come back after they have being challenged last year for sure. And GTR is really, has been the headwind within alternatives. Otherwise, it\u2019s been continuing to build out that pipeline quite strongly. Allison Dukes : Yes. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve pointed to anything notable or sizeable in terms of the pipeline or any real differences as it relates to alternatives. Adam Beatty : Great. Thank you, Allison. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. You may go ahead. Mike Carrier : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just giving the expectation for rising rates in potential inflation, I just wanted to get your sense on how the fixed income and balanced platforms are positioned for that backdrop, both in terms of intensive performance impacts and inclined demand? Marty Flanagan : Yes, look, it\u2019s a great question. I think rising rates here probably helps our fixed income outside of the United States. Obviously, from institutional investors from that perspective, I think it\u2019s really going to be the pace and the magnitude of the rise of interest rates. If it\u2019s slow and steady, I think it\u2019ll be fine. Some of the areas that will be, in midyear, things like bank loans and the like things got reset. So right now, if really not had a headwind emerge from the rising rates, but needless to say, we\u2019re paying close attention to it to the recent increase. Allison, if you want? Allison Dukes : That\u2019s a solid point. Do you got it? Mike Carrier : All right, great. And then just put ball, how many institutional pipelines, I\u2019m trying to get a sense of what change as you drive like a robust pipeline whether this quarter, last quarter over the last year, you had been investment and distribution like geographies, strategies, pricing, since you get this such a big shift relative to the past? Marty Flanagan : Yes, look, the reality is, it\u2019s sort of overnight success after multiple years of investments. And it really is a combination of the capabilities that we\u2019ve had. We just \u2013 how we\u2019re mashing off against clients around the world. And really the solutions capability, it was really, really important, but you need solutions, you need self-indexing, you need a range of capabilities and you have to have deep relationships with the institutional clients and that\u2019s all coming through. The other thing I want to maybe connect the dots. So we started talking about some of the large institutional passive mandates that have come, and that\u2019s very consistent with what we\u2019ve been talking about strategically, where every client that we deal with around the world, again, not unique to us, they\u2019re dealing with fewer money managers, they want more from us. And so that also includes a range of asset classes to create the outcomes. So historically, we did not take our indexing capability to institutional clients. Needless to say, we\u2019ve changed that recently, and it just creates a deeper, better relationship with the clients. The reality is large institutions around the world are going to use passive capabilities, and we want to be able to provide that along with the rest of the range of capabilities we have all the way from alternatives and the combination of all those things is really what\u2019s driving the change. Mike Carrier : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Bill Katz with Citigroup. You may go ahead. Bill Katz : Okay. Thank you very much for taking my questions this morning. Maybe Marty, one for you, haven\u2019t talked about M&A a little while. Just sort of, what\u2019s your latest thinking on when you look at your footprint what if anything, would make sense that you don\u2019t have and how are you thinking about maybe more aggressively leveraging the platform as you build more efficiencies? Marty Flanagan : Yes, you\u2019re right, we haven\u2019t talked about since last quarter. So I\u2019m kidding. Look, our cost has not changed, right. I think, it was really important for us to obviously complete what we did with Oppenheimer last year, obviously the pandemic didn\u2019t help getting off on to a great start after that. But if we look at the capabilities of the firm right now we feel like we have most everything we need and the things we\u2019d probably pay attention to would be areas where there could sort of people found capabilities largely probably in areas that we want to continue to expand that could be around credit. It could be around infrastructure [Audio Gap]. Is that helped, Bill? Bill Katz : Yes, that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just my second question leads into that. Just wondering if you could maybe expand your comments a little bit on what you\u2019re doing to deepen your opportunity set in the private markets? Marty Flanagan : Yes. So that\u2019s where it was going. So look, we\u2019ve been extending the real estate capability into infrastructure, but it\u2019s very early days for us, right? So it\u2019s an area that\u2019s very competitive and it\u2019s one that we want to be competitive in, half of the bank loan capabilities have continue to build out private credit, direct lending capabilities. Private credit has gone quite well the distress capability in particular, and also the team and direct lending has been building a nice track record is one to get to scale though. So that\u2019s the areas that we\u2019ve been focused on. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Mike Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead. Mike Cyprys : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question here. Just maybe turning back to your investment span, I think you had mentioned on the expense safe that\u2019s net of investment spend in the business. So just hoping you could maybe help quantify, maybe how much you\u2019re investing back in the business, or how you think about that in terms of points on the margin and how would you characterize that piece of investment spend today versus what you had been doing say two to three years ago, and how different might that pace be as you look out over the next two to three years? Allison Dukes : Let me start with \u2013 we\u2019re not quantifying what\u2019s been reinvested. So what we\u2019ve put forth is the $200 million net target, and that\u2019s really what we\u2019re tracking to. And as we think about the reinvestment, it really is, one, it can be rather difficult to trace and track the \u2013 where it\u2019s reinvested that absolute level, because we were always investing in the business. But what we\u2019re looking to do is really make some changes that are discreet line items of costs that we can take out and again, create more than $200 million. So that we do have some gross savings to be able to reinvest back into the business. And the way we\u2019re thinking about it is really about driving, operating margin. I can let Marty comment on the path and some of how the thinking may differ prior to my time at Invesco, but I would tell you, our focus now really is on delivering that profitable growth. And so, as we think about reallocating, really thinking about how do we reallocate some of those savings into areas where we think, we get the fastest growth and really drive that margin enhancement. And I think you see some of that margin enhancement and what we\u2019ve been able to deliver over the last two or three quarters. And I don\u2019t know that we can deliver that margin enhancement at that magnitude quarter-after-quarter into perpetuity. But again, it gives us the opportunity just to really leverage the scale that we think we are starting to create across the real diversified platform and making sure that our investments are in those key capabilities that really drop profitability to the bottom line. Marty Flanagan : Yes, Mike. So look up, it would be quite simple. So if you \u2013 there is \u2013 on the highlight slide, we talk about the focus on investment solutions, China, active equity, active fixed income, private markets, factors, indexes. Those have been the areas where we\u2019ve been just laser focused and they have been net beneficiaries of that. Also underneath, it really everything digital, as you would imagine. So all of our digital capabilities as we face off against client that is just clients has just changed quite dramatically for everybody last year, just advanced it quite dramatically. And I think also what you\u2019re seeing really in the platform to make it much more efficient and effective. And Alpha, Next Gen is an example of that. And it\u2019s beyond just more efficient, more effective, it\u2019s really moving everything to the cloud and also creating a data capability that really enhances our ability to get to all of the information we need to make better decisions. And so it really is quite focused. And I think it\u2019s showing up in the results. Mike Cyprys : Great. Thanks. Just a quick follow-up with the improving performance trends that we\u2019re seeing, maybe you could just remind us on how much AUM is eligible to earn a performance fees, which strategies would you say the largest contributors there? I remember, I think in the past, maybe it was real estate and just given your improving performance trend, how are you thinking about performance fee revenues for this year compared to what we\u2019ve seen in prior years? Allison Dukes : Sure. I\u2019ll take that. Our AUM that\u2019s eligible to earn a performance fee is around $58 billion. And we tend to see in terms of what comprises that AUM, it is largely real estate a number of contracts that would relate back to China, Asia Pacific, broadly speaking, but specifically China. And so as I think about it going forward, it is just inherently difficult to predict the level of performance fees. Given it varies by contract and by client relationships. So I really can\u2019t give you a lot of guidance there. I would point to the fact that fourth quarter performance fees were north of $70 billion, as you know, as I look at performance fees this quarter, pretty consistent to what we saw in the second and third quarter of last year. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily suggest that that is what you should expect every quarter, because it is so difficult to predict. But I do think looking at some of those historical trends is at least factual and somewhat helpful. Mike Cyprys : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. You may go ahead. Chris Harris : Great. Thank you. So a record quarter for flows. Flows improved in a lot of different areas. And I guess the one, one area that was a bit of a headwind with the UK. I wonder if you can talk a little bit about, what drove the weakness in the UK this quarter and how you feeling about the outlook? Marty Flanagan : Yes. So look UK equities continues to be a headwind, it\u2019s been a period of \u2013 one just the asset class, which were historically a larger manager within the asset class and historical performance. The performance is still the headwind that said we\u2019ve made the changes to the portfolio managers. I feel really good about the teams there. It\u2019s still early days for them, but that is, I believe, the main focal point there. Chris Harris : Okay, got you. And one quick follow-up for Allison, other revenue was up quite a bit in the quarter, what drove that and how should we be thinking about the run rate for that line item? Allison Dukes : Yes. It was up quite a bit. It\u2019s largely due to higher UIT and front end transaction fees. It is almost all of other revenue is transaction-based as opposed to AUM or volume based. And so it can be, I would say, as you think about a run rate, a little bit more difficult to predict, I\u2019m just double checking that. Yes. I mean, I think we had an unusually large quarter and there were some specific items in there as it relates to some of the UIT and front end transaction fees. I don\u2019t know that you should expect that same level of revenue quarter-to-quarter. Chris Harris : Got you. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. You may go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Thanks so much. I just want to ask an industry level follow-up on the M&A backdrop. And Marty, you guys obviously have done much, much better. The industry flows have been better. Margins have been done better. The markets are up and valuations have recovered some. I\u2019m curious if at all, if that changes the industry narrative and consolidation theme takes any of the pressures for that need for scale, or if you\u2019ve seen a continuation of what we\u2019ve seen so far in terms of bigger is better. Marty Flanagan : Yes. Look, I don\u2019t think it does. It provides relief for the sector, if you would say, all \u2013 rising tide raises all boats. But the reality of \u2013 where the industry does not changed. I mean, with all the characteristics of a maturing industry where again, fundamentally, I mentioned them a couple of minutes ago. Every client is expecting more from money managers. They are working with fewer money managers around the world and you really need scale in multiple levels across the organization, whether it be in investment capabilities, operational scale, the ability to invest in technology, that\u2019s just not going away. And so there\u2019s going to be consolidation, but it\u2019s going to be two ways as we talked about in the past, it\u2019s going to be inorganic put also organic, literally just money leaving to go to those firms that are performing better for the clients. And still the other reality of M&A within the sector, it\u2019s hard. I mean, you really need a skill set to be successful at it. And that\u2019s still, even if you do have those skills, it\u2019s just art and you got to be really focused and be able to execute it. So I don\u2019t think the strategic dynamic has changed quite frankly. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate that. Thanks, Marty. Operator : And that was our last question. Marty Flanagan : Operator, thank you. And on behalf of Allison and myself, thank you very much for participating and thanks for the questions and we\u2019ll talk with everybody very soon. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. This call will last one hour. To allow more participants to ask question, only one question and a follow-up can be submitted per participant. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I would like to turn the call over to your speakers for today, Marty Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; and Allison Dukes, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin. Marty Flanagan : Thank you, operator, and thank you everybody for joining us. We've reached the halfway point in the year and we're continuing to see strong momentum in our business, as you can see from the results that we reported this morning. But before I begin, I'd like to take a minute to recognize the hard work of our team at Invesco, like, almost everybody, our employees have been working in a work-from-home or a hybrid environment for more than a year now and they've achieved these results in a very challenging environment. I'd like to thank the team for their dedicated focus and adaptability during this time. And with the success of the virus, many of us have been coming back to the office and working together over the last few months and I can tell you it's good to see our colleagues once again. And we are in different stages of reopening around the globe. And one thing that I hear from everybody that is able to back to the office is how great it is to see one another and work together. And I will say, we're at our best when we're working together, collaborating and innovating. And I'm excited about the future as we continue to open our offices to more employees and welcome them back. And as always, we'll follow the status of COVID and local guidelines, as we transition back to the office, meeting client needs, helping them ensure the continued health and well-being of our employees. So now let me turn to the results. And if you're so inclined to follow the presentation, I'm going to start on slide three, which is the highlights for the quarter. We achieved a new record in the second quarter for long-term net inflows totaling $31 billion. This follows net inflows of $24.5 billion last quarter and up yearly $18 billion in the second half of last year. Growth was led by net inflows into institutional ETFs, fixed income and focused alternative capabilities. And as you can see on slide three, the key capability areas where we have scale, investment readiness, competitive strength, drove growth again in the quarter. These are areas where our investment performance is strong. We're highly competitive and well positioned for growth. Looking at our EPS, excluding the Qs that generated net long-term inflows of $12 billion during the quarter, net long-term inflows from alternatives during the quarter were $4.3 billion, including strength in our private markets business. We launched two CLOs during the period, raising $1 billion and generated net inflows into our real estate business of $1 billion. We continue to focus and invest in our alternative capabilities of space, where we also see the benefit of our partnership with MassMutual, which we highlighted last quarter. MassMutual has committed over $1 billion to various alternative strategies, materially increasing the speed with which we can get to market for the benefit of our clients. We continue to innovate with strategies for retail investors through the launch of products such as INREIT and the partnership we announced with UBS, in which we will provide bespoke global property investment services for management clients of UBS in Switzerland, other parts of EMEA and Asia. We also have $5 billion in direct real estate capital available for deployments. We had net long-term inflows of $8.8 billion into active fixed income and within active global equities, our $53 billion developing markets fund, a key capability that came with the Oppenheimer accommodation, continue to see net inflows of nearly $1 billion during the quarter. Second quarter flows, included net long-term inflows of $3 billion from Greater China and our Chinese joint venture continues to be a source of strength and differentiation for us as an organization. In addition, our Solutions-enabled institutional pipeline accounts for 35% of the pipeline at quarter end, this following the funding of a large passive mandate from Australia in the second quarter, which was enabled by our Solutions team. Allison will provide more information in a moment on flows the pipeline results in the quarter, including the continued progress towards our net savings target, but I would note the growth we're experiencing is driving positive operating leverage producing an adjusted operating margin of 41.5% for the quarter. Strong cash flows being generated from our business, improved our cash position, helping build a stronger balance sheet and improving our financial flexibility for the future. Invesco scale, investment readiness, competitive strength, position us well going forward and we continue to focus our efforts on delivering positive outcome with clients while driving. With that, I will turn it over to Allison to walk through the results in greater detail. Allison Dukes : Thank you, Marty, and good morning, everyone. If you'll turn to slide 4, our investment performance was strong in the second quarter with 72% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers or beating benchmark on a five-year and a 10-year basis. This reflected continued strength in fixed income, global equities, including emerging market equities and Asian equities, all areas where we continue to see demand from clients globally. Moving to slide 5, we ended the quarter with $1.525 trillion in AUM. Of the $121 billion in AUM growth approximately $66 billion is a function of increased market values. Our diversified platform generated gross inflows in the second quarter of $114.4 billion. This is an 82% improvement from one year ago. Net long-term inflows in the second quarter were $31.1 billion representing 10.6% annualized organic growth. Active AUM net long-term inflows were $2.1 billion and passive AUM net long-term inflows were $29 billion. The retail channel generated net long-term inflows of $9.5 billion in the quarter, driven by positive ETF flows. This represents a $24.1 billion improvement in net long-term inflows from one year ago driven by significant improvement in equities in the Americas. The institutional channel generated net long-term inflows of $21.6 billion in the quarter augmented by the funding of a nearly $18 billion Australian passive mandate. Looking at retail net inflows our ETFs, excluding the QQQs generated net long-term inflows of $12.1 billion. Our global ETF platform again, excluding QQQs, again captured flows in excess of its market share of AUM in the second quarter and for the first half of 2021. Net ETF inflows in the United States included a continued high level of interest in our S&P 500 equal weight ETF, which generated $2.6 billion in net inflows in the second quarter, following $4 billion of net inflows in the first quarter. Looking at flows by geography on slide 6, you'll note that the Americas had net long-term inflows of $5 billion in the quarter, driven by net inflows in the ETF various fixed income strategies, private market CLOs and the direct real estate net long-term inflows that Marty mentioned. Asia Pacific again delivered another strong quarter with net long-term inflows of $28.3 billion. Net inflows were diversified across the region. Nearly $18 billion was from the large passive Australian mandate that funded from our institutional pipeline in May. The balance reflects $4.8 billion of net long-term inflows from Japan, $3 billion in inflows from Greater China of which the majority was from our China JV, $1.8 billion from Singapore and the remainder arising from other areas across the region. Long-term inflows for EMEA, excluding the UK, were $1 billion driven by retail flows, including net inflows into alternative, particularly our US and European senior loan funds. ETF net inflows in EMEA were $2.2 billion in the quarter. And finally, the UK experienced net long-term outflows of $3.2 billion in the second quarter, driven largely by net institutional outflows in multi-asset and investment-grade capabilities. $2.4 billion of these net long-term outflows relate to our global targeted return capability, which has $10.2 billion globally in AUM at the end of June. The overall UK net long-term outflows in the second quarter were an improvement of $2.7 billion as compared to the first quarter net long-term outflows of $5.9 billion. This improvement was driven by UK retail primarily inflows into the European equity fund and lower net outflows during the quarter across a number of fixed income and UK equity capabilities. Turning to flows across asset classes. Equity net long-term inflows of $15 billion reflect a good portion of the Australian mandate and ETFs including our S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF that I mentioned. We continue to see broad strength in fix income in the first quarter with long-term inflows of $13.6 billion. Drivers of fixed income flows include institutional net flows into investment-grade strategy and retail net long-term inflows into various municipal funds and fixed maturity products in Asia.  It's worth noting that although we did have fund launches in China in the second quarter, they were not at the pace of what we experienced in the first quarter. You see this largely reflected in the $9.1 billion decrease in the net flows in the balanced asset class during the quarter to net outflows of $1.8 billion. Our alternative asset class holds many different capabilities and this is reflected in the flows we saw in the second quarter. Net long-term flows and alternatives improved by $4.5 billion over the first quarter, driven primarily by our private markets business through a combination of inflows from the newly launched CLO, direct real estate, senior loan and commodities capabilities. Included in these alternative flow results is also the GTR net outflow that I just noted. If you do exclude the global GTR net outflows alternative net long-term inflows were $7.2 billion quite significant in the quarter. Moving to Slide 7. Our institutional pipeline was $33.3 billion at June 30 reflecting the funding of the large passive indexing mandate in Asia Pacific assisted by our custom solution advisory team. Excluding the impact of the $18 billion passive mandate in the first quarter, the pipeline has increased in size and remains relatively consistent to prior quarter levels in terms of asset and fee composition. Overall, the pipeline is diversified across asset classes and geographies and our solutions capability, enabled 35% of the global institutional pipeline and created wins and customized mandates. This has contributed to meaningful growth across our institutional network warranting our continuing investment and focus. Turning to Slide 11. You'll note that our net revenues increased $52 million or 4.1% from the first quarter as a result of higher average AUM in the second quarter. The net revenue yield excluding performance fees was 34.8 basis points a decrease of 0.9 basis points from the first quarter yield level. The decrease was driven mainly by asset mix shift including higher QQQ and money market average balances as well as the impact of the large passive Australian mandate that funded in May. This decrease was partially offset by the improvement in markets in the quarter. The incremental impact relative to Q1 of higher discretionary money market fee waivers was minimal in the second quarter, but the full impact on the net revenue yield for the second quarter was 0.7 of a basis point. We do expect fee waivers to remain in place for the foreseeable future until rates begin to recover to more normalized levels. Total adjusted operating expenses increased 1.9% in the second quarter, a $14.4 million increase in operating expenses was mainly driven by variable compensation and marketing. Higher variable compensation as a result of higher revenue, offset by the reduction in payroll taxes and certain benefits from the seasonally higher levels that we experienced in the first quarter. We also recognized -- we also further recognized savings in the quarter resulting from our strategic evaluation. Marketing expenses increased $9.8 million in the second quarter mainly due to seasonally higher levels relative to the first quarter which is typically the low point for marketing spend annually. We also reevaluated the timing of various branding campaigns and launched targeted initiatives in the quarter across the globe. Operating expenses remained at lower-than-historic activity levels due to pandemic-driven impact to discretionary spending, travel and other business operations. However, we did resume some client activity in business travel late in the second quarter which is reflected in both marketing and G&A expense. As we look ahead to the third quarter our expectations are for third quarter operating expenses to be modestly higher compared to the second quarter assuming no change in market and FX levels from June 30. We expect that the higher AUM levels driven by net inflows and market improvement in the second quarter will have a modest carryover impact on both revenues and associated variable expenses in the third quarter. We also expect a modest seasonal increase in marketing-related expenses as spend typically increases in the third and fourth quarters. One area that's still more difficult to forecast at this point is, when COVID impacted travel and entertainment expense levels will begin to normalize. We are engaging in more domestic travel and in-person engagement. And we do expect to see continued modest resumption of these activities across the third quarter. Additionally, our U.S. mutual funds board has approved certain changes to the pricing of transfer agency services that we provide to our funds. As a result, we anticipate that our outsourced administration costs which we reflect in property office and technology expenses will increase by approximately $25 million on an annual basis. Offsetting this, will be a corresponding increase in service and distribution revenues, resulting in a minimal impact to operating income. We expect this new pricing structure to go into effect in the third quarter, and to be fully in place by the fourth quarter. Moving to slide 9, we update you on the progress we have made with our strategic evaluation. As we've noted before, we are looking across four key areas of our expense base. Our organizational model, our real estate footprint, management of third-party spend and technology and operations efficiency. Through this evaluation, we will continue to invest in key areas of growth, including ETFs, fixed income, China solutions, alternatives and global equities. In the second quarter, we realized $7.5 million in cost savings. $2 million of the savings was related to compensation expense and $5 million related to property, office and technology expenses. The $7.5 million in cost savings were $30 million annualized, combined with the $95 million in annualized savings realized through the first quarter of 2021, brings us to $125 million in total, or 63% of our $200 million net savings expectations. As it relates to timing, we still expect approximately $150 million or 75% of the run rate savings to be achieved by the end of this year with the remainder realized, by the end of 2022. Of the $150 million in net savings by the end of this year, we anticipate, we will realize roughly 70% of the savings through compensation expense. The remaining 30%, would be spread across occupancy tech spend and G&A. We expect the total program savings to be 65% in compensation of about 35% spread across the other categories. For the $125 million of the expected $150 million in net savings by the end of this year, already in the quarterly run rate, the degree of net savings per quarter will continue to moderate going forward. In the second quarter, we incurred $20 million of restructuring costs. In total, we recognized nearly $170 million of our estimated $250 million to $275 million in restructuring costs that were associated with this program. We expect the remaining transaction costs for the realization of this program to be in a range of $85 million to $105 million, through the end of 2022. As a reminder, the costs associated with the strategic evaluation are not reflected in our non-GAAP results. Moving to slide 10, adjusted operating income improved $38 million to $541 million for the quarter, driven by the factors we just reviewed. Adjusted operating and margin improved 130 basis points to 41.5% as compared to the first quarter. Most importantly, our degree of positive operating leverage reflected in our non-GAAP results was 1.8 times for the quarter, underscoring our focus on driving scale and profitability across our diversified platform. I'll also point out, that our adjusted operating margin back in the third quarter of 2019, which was our first full quarter following the Oppenheimer acquisition was 40.9%. At that time we reported a net revenue yield, excluding performance fees of 40.7 basis points. At the end of the second quarter of 2021 our net revenue yield ex-performance fees was 34.8 basis points, yet our adjusted operating margin was 41.5%. We have been building out our product suite to meet client demand, and client demand has been in lower fee products. We're focused on aligning our expense base with changes in our business mix, enabling the firm to generate positive operating leverage and operating margin improvement. Non-operating income, included $42 million in net gains for the quarter, compared to $26 million in net gains last quarter, primarily from increased unrealized gains on seed money and co-investment portfolios. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 22.8%, as compared to 24% in the first quarter. The effective tax rate on net income was lower in the second quarter, primarily due to a change in the mix of income across taxing jurisdictions. We estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 24% for the third quarter. The actual effective rate may vary from this estimate due to the impact of nonrecurring items on pre-tax income and discrete tax items. Few comments on slide 11, Our balance sheet cash position was $1.3 billion at June 30th, and approximately $750 million of this cash is held for regulatory requirements. Our cash position has improved considerably over the past year increasing by nearly $350 million, largely driven by the improvement in our operating income. Our debt profile has improved considerably as well with no draws on our revolver at quarter end. As a result we've substantially improved our net leverage position. During the quarter we repaid the remaining $177 million forward share repurchase liability in April and there are no remaining share repurchase contract liabilities. In terms of future cash requirements in the second quarter, we recorded an adjustment to the MLP liability associated with the Oppenheimer purchase reducing this liability from our original estimate of nearly $385 million, down to $300 million. We anticipate funding this liability in the fourth quarter of 2021. While we do anticipate a degree of insurance recovery related to the matter, the insurance claims process is inherently complex and we do not have an update at this stage of the timing or size of that recovery. Overall, we believe we're making solid progress in our efforts to improve liquidity and build financial flexibility. In summary, we continue to see growth in our key capabilities. We remain focused on executing the strategy that aligns with these areas while completing our strategic evaluation and reallocating our resources to position us for growth. And finally we remain prudent in our approach to capital management. We're in a strong position to meet client needs run a disciplined business and to continue to invest in and grow our franchise over the long-term. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thank you very much. Wonder if we could talk a little bit about private markets. You talked a little bit about, well, in the second quarter but curious if we could maybe get a bigger picture view of what has the highest growth potential? What specifically you're doing on the retail side to drive growth and maybe take a chance to see how -- what's your vision of how big this segment can be? Marty Flanagan : Yeah, Glenn, thank you for that. And so obviously it's been an area of focus for much of the industry. Our principal driver right now has been real estate. It's a very strong global real estate group direct real estate. Some of the more recent developments has been trying to get that into the retail channel INREIT, which is nonpublic is now available in the US, it's early days. That was also was funded by MassMutual for about $400 million, which is really important. We think that has great potential in the next year or so as it's in the marketplace based on the -- this historical performance of our real estate group. The other was really a venture with UBS and offering same thing direct real estate with some listed real estate securities through Switzerland other parts of EMEA Asia Pac. So those seem to be really immediate opportunities. And quite frankly some of our private credit has more recently been gaining attention with institutional investors. They have a better track record and with that track record we're now seeing the follow-on. So we look at this as a very important part of our business as we go forward. Glenn Schorr : Thanks. And maybe just a quick one for Allison. Allison you mentioned about the modest uptick on the expense side in 3Q. But if we could just -- I don't know if you're able to level set us on. How much below normal are we? I appreciate we don't know when normal travel, normal spend is happening. But if you just said, right now you have very normal expenses with really short markets and flows but not so normal expenses. Can you give us a way to contextualize that? Allison Dukes : Yeah, it's a hard one, because we have to look back at where we were in the last half of 2019 to try to figure out what normal might have been and not sure that that's normal going forward. And I think that's the real challenge. I'd say we're probably $10 million to $15 million per quarter below what we would have seen in the last half of 2019 and I don't expect we'll see all of that come back just when we get back to whatever some permanent state is. And I think we're ways off from that just given the international travel restrictions that look like they're going to be in place for a while. But I do think we are certainly starting to see a resumption of domestic travel within regions that are allowing it and we're certainly seeing -- as we reopen offices some pickup and just client activity overall. So I think probably a good estimate is to think about being maybe $15 million below what normal used to be. And some element of that will come back over time. Glenn Schorr : That\u2019s awesome. Thank you for that. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ken Worthington : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Super high level maybe first for you Marty. As you look to the future maybe over the next three years to five years what do you see as the most significant factor that's influencing the direction you're taking Invesco? I think if I asked that question maybe five years ago you might have said something like factor-based investing. But what are your thoughts today? Marty Flanagan : Yes. Ken, it's a good question. And I think you've raised this before. If you look at the firm right now a number of the investments that we've made over the years are coming through in a very material way and probably first and foremost the impact of China. And you're just seeing it just continued to be a source of strength for us as an organization. And quite frankly I think by many estimates within asset management globally we've seen -- I think it could be explain half of all the flows within our industry in the next five years whether that's right or not I don't know. But what I can say it's a major factor. The other element is really how solutions has been embedded in almost all of our client engagements. Institutionally, we've called it out you see that. But by the way it was also true in retail engagements that were seen. And you mentioned factors. We talked about that five years ago. It's a huge part of our ETF business and frankly our index business and is going to continue to be an important part of what we do. And as you do know just recently in the last two years we've taken that factor capability indexing capability to institutional clients and we did it with a very strategic view with recognition that clients are using fewer and fewer money managers and they want the totality of the capabilities coming from money managers. And you've seen some of the impact most recently with the IFF win in Australia, but which you really do as you become very important to clients holistically. So those would be the biggest trends that I would point to. And I think the reality it's actually happening right now. So that's my personal perspective. Ken Worthington : Awesome. Great. Thank you. And then maybe Allison you mentioned UK outflows including some outflows from GTR. Does the decline in GTR assets lower the capital that you're either required to operate within Europe or volunteer to hold to operate in Europe, or is the growth elsewhere in Europe or the UK mitigating these declines? Allison Dukes : Unfortunately, the short answer to that question is, no. The AUM decline there does not impact the regulatory capital that we have to hold. It's a little more complicated than that and it focuses a little bit more on the P&L specifically expenses than it does AUM levels. Ken Worthington : Thanks. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Lee with KBW. Your line is open. Robert Lee : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Marty I had a question for you on Greater China. So some of your competitors have opened up wholly-owned or opening, I guess, wholly-owned subsidiaries. Others have been able to take on, I guess, a majority stake. I know you've talked about it for a while but can you update us on where Greater China stands with your movement to at least economically taking a majority stake in operational units you run, but just an update on some of that. Marty Flanagan : Yes, great. So it might be some of competitors, but to remind everybody so we own 49% of the joint venture right now. Our partner Huaneng Power, we have been in conversations for two years, to take a majority stake. There has been an agreement in principle, but it has not moved forward for various reason, COVID being one of them. And quite frankly, that would be the principal reason. But it has not hurt us. And I think, this is a really important thing and to contrast our position to others, we've had management control since the beginning of the venture. And that is really has what separated our success as compared to our competitors. So we literally operate as one entity within China in the retail markets for INVESCO Great Wall, but institutionally we'll go to large institutions with the retail platform and our institutional platform. So, again, that's really what's enabling the growth. We also have a wholly-owned subsidiary focused on other elements within China. And I think, as you look at where others are, I think, what's important to look at is, separate announcements from actual has it happened. And generally, it slowed down over the last 18 months from most institutions trying to get to market with some of these new undertakings. Robert Lee : Great. And maybe my follow-up on the Intelliflo, you haven't talked about it too much for a while, but I guess a year or so ago, you launched on the Citi platform, I saw the other day, I think, it was State Farm that is going to start using the platform. Can you maybe update us on where that is, if it's meeting your expectations and if you are -- as it rolls out you do see that contributing to new product sales? Martin Flanagan : Yes. So, right now, there's about $1 trillion in assets under advisement. So you've seen some nice growth. State Farm is an important addition. Obviously, it's very early days and we have a relationship with Citi, really the focus of the past year was really pulling together the different elements of Intelliflo and creating sort of a single operating platform to go to the clients holistically and you are now starting to see the outcomes of that and will be more specific sort of events are material enough to have that conversation. But, again, we're starting to get the momentum back in the business. And, again, last year slowed down some, just with the COVID environment. But, again, we're still optimistic about the prospects of Intelliflo. Robert Lee : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Martin Flanagan : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. If I can just start with -- Allison Dukes : Hey, Brian. Brian Bedell : Good morning -- the organic base fee growth, as compared with your organic growth, if you can just, maybe Allison, just touch on what you think the outlook for the -- for the net revenue yield going into third quarter, given the shift -- given the strong growth in passive versus active in the second quarter? And can you benefit at all from lower money market fee waivers, given the rate and IOER rate? Allison Dukes : Yes. So, I mean, I'd say a couple of things. Just keep in mind, the biggest drivers of net revenue yield quarter-to-quarter is really going to be the mix of flows. And that's really just a function of client demand and making sure -- and again we feel like we have -- we're driving scale across a really well-diversified platform. So we're going to capture demand where demand exists. But that mix will certainly have an impact on that revenue yield. And market impact obviously is going to be always impactful in any given quarter. And then, money market waivers, as I noted, money market waivers right now this quarter accounted for about 0.7 of a basis point of a drag. And in terms of where do we see that going, it's -- IOER would be helpful, a movement in Fed funds would certainly be more impactful, but it isn't perfectly correlated as just that, because there are competitive dynamics as well. And so, we're going to be thoughtful about where we're positioned, vis-\u00e0-vis, the competition and making sure we're being thoughtful and smart about these waivers, sharing in them with our distribution partners across the institutional element of our waivers. And I'd note our money market waivers are kind of 80% to the institutional channel and at about 20% to retail. So we are able to share in some of these waivers as we work with our partners to ensure clients really getting the outcomes that they are expecting. So coming back to net revenue yield, I do think we'll probably see a modest sort of grind down, but what I'd focus you on is, some of the comments we were making as we look back at 2019, net revenue yields 6 basis points lower than it was a couple of years ago and yet our operating margin is higher at 41.5%. So, I recognize net revenue yield is something that we want to make sure we get into models. But really we don't think about net revenue yield quarter-to-quarter. We think about revenue and driving positive operating leverage across our platform. And I think our performance over the last year especially really drives -- really underscores our ability to do that. Brian Bedell : Yes. That's a good point. Thank you for that. And then, just on sustainable product flows, either Marty or Allison, can you talk a little bit about first of all how much did sustainable products, both active and passive drive flows in the second quarter, and then, what's your AUM and what would classify sustainable products? Just an update on that. And then, just in terms of the game plan for product launches going forward in this area, even if it's -- even if you can sort of generalize what the strategy is? Marty Flanagan : Let me make a couple of comments just on our sustainable ESG capabilities, and then I'll let Allison pick up. So, obviously for us we look at ESG as an incredibly important part of what we do. And we are absolutely focused on integrating our ESG capabilities across the whole organization. 75% of all our assets now have integrated ESG within our capabilities. I think as you know, it's really been driven by EMEA in the first instance. It's an absolute business necessity and we think it is throughout the totality of our organization. And if you look specifically at dedicated ESG assets under management is about $52 billion today. We continue to see growth there. If you look at our ETFs, we have one of the highest market shares of ESG ETFs given our long track record, and again, they'll continue to see flows because of that. So -- but again, if you look at this as just an absolute imperative for us to get right and throughout the organization whether it\u2019d be how we manage money, but also the capabilities in the marketplace and literally working with clients to ensure that we're hitting what is important to them as we work through this. Allison Dukes : Yes. I think Marty hit on most of it. In terms of flows for the quarter, they were softer than in the first quarter. I think it was a little less than $2 billion. We saw quite a bit stronger flows in the first quarter, which really, I wouldn't say there's anything specific driving the lower flows in the second quarter other than perhaps some market headwinds. We certainly saw some highs in the first quarter and a little bit of pullback from that could be -- could point to just some post-election highs that were driving the first quarter and some modest shifts from growth. Overall, our ESG capabilities continue to be quite strong in terms of the performance and demand. And as Marty noted, we're capturing more than our fair share of the market in terms of flows into the ESG capabilities. Brian Bedell : Great. Hey, thank you for your update. Marty Flanagan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open. Dan Fannon : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on your comments around balance. I think Allison you mentioned, there were fewer fund launches. That category obviously had some outflows, but performance is good. So, maybe if you could give us an update on kind of the outlook for that category? Allison Dukes : Yes. What really drove the real strength in the first quarter were the fund launches in China in particular. We had probably a high watermark just given the strength of those launches, both in terms of the size and performance overall. I think inside of shine on the JV, we have seven fund launches again in the second quarter. I think about five of them were balanced again driving about $1 billion in flows. So, it continues to be strong overall. Just some lumpiness quarter-to-quarter, I wouldn't necessarily point to anything specific beyond that. Dan Fannon : Okay. That's helpful. And then, just on the strategic evaluation and understand the targets and kind of where you sit today, but curious as you've kind of gone through this in the areas of investments that you're looking to put some of those savings in some of those buckets, if there's been any real changes from the original expectations that you're allocating more dollars to we're seeing more growth, or it seems like we're getting the same kind of message each quarter, but curious if there's any more detail around things that might be different than when you originally outlined it? Allison Dukes : I'll start and let Marty chime in there. I would say, you're getting the same message each quarter, because our strategy isn't changing. And I think it's that focus on our strategy and the continuity of that that we're -- the consistency is something I hope you'll pick up on, because there's consistency in our focus and our approach. The key areas of investment these key capabilities are things that we really do believe are the areas where we need to be invested ahead of client demand. We're seeing client demand in some of these capabilities today but we expect there to be continued demand and we're going to stay focused on those key capabilities. In terms of changes, I don't know that, I would say there's anything specific that would cause us to change. We're always going to see sentiment may soften in China a little bit. I don't think that takes away from our focus or our belief that, that is a key growth area for us despite what market sentiment or political noise may be out there quarter-to-quarter. Our solutions capability, I think we're as convicted as ever that that is a key capability for the future. And I think you really see how that is driving our growth both in the institutional pipeline and overall. Our ETF capabilities continue to be real drivers of growth as we're capturing more than our market share in terms of flows. I think our capture of flows this past quarter was somewhere around 4.2%. Our market share is 2.7%. But even more important than that is our capture of the revenue pool. We captured about 8%, a little north of 8% of the revenue pool of flows and ETFs over the last quarter which I think really points to the strength of our capabilities there how they're positioned. They are some of the higher fee capabilities relative to the ETF universe and there's real demand because they're differentiated in terms of performance and outcomes. And so I don't know that we've had any surprises as I think back over the last year. It's been a supportive market in this past year that's helpful. But that doesn't deter our focus on making sure we're aligning our cost base to deliver exactly what you've seen us deliver in this past year which is real strength in our operating margins and operating income growth. Marty Flanagan : Allison that's well said. And Dan it's no mistake when you look at the second quarter highlights when we call out the key capability areas. They haven't changed because that's where our heads down. We see that as the great opportunity for us as an organization. They align with some of those macro trends that we talked about a few minutes ago and it has been disproportionate investment from us and also disproportionate results. So, you're not going to see a change much quarter-to-quarter. Dan Fannon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. When you think about the success that you've had with your solutions offering, how do you build on that strength? And how do you maintain differentiation? Are you seeing competitors try to emulate the success that you've had there? And how do you stay a step ahead? And also, is it -- how much of this business actually repeats whether that be few quarters or a few years subsequent? I know it's early but any stats you can provide or estimates or sense you have on that? Marty Flanagan : Yes. Let me -- so it's a great question. And I can't describe what competitors are doing. But our approach was a little bit different from the standpoint of we started with recognition any number of years ago that clients wanted a broad range -- broad range of investment capabilities and that's what we've been building out as we've talked about. Importantly what we did building a solutions team is it sits on top of the investment team. So it does not compete with the investment teams it uses the investment our existing capabilities. And that is somewhat unique as best we can tell in the marketplace. And so, the client engagements are such that it's literally an engagement with the clients to understand what are they trying to accomplish with the portfolios and delivering any range of capabilities along the lines. And that's what we've seen.  The more recent one though, as I mentioned a few minutes ago was introducing index capabilities to institutions. And the totality of that is what creates the importance of relationship with clients and you end up expanding your mandates per client in these relationships. So it does -- it's early days but we're seeing it is persistent in time. And again as I said a few minutes ago we're seeing -- it's very important institutionally. It's also quite important in the retail channel also. So, we just look at it as quite frankly it's the way that business has been done as we look to the future. Brennan Hawken : Okay. And then second question more -- probably more for Allison. I know we've seen liquidity continue to improve. You laid out the idea that, we're going to be having the MLP liability funding later this year. So, still some calls on liquidity, but without question in a far better position and with those calls dramatically lower than they were a year ago. So with that in mind, what are your updated capital management priorities how should we think about, the likelihood of a step-up in buyback? I know we got the increase in the dividend recently. But how are all of those different calls on liquidity? How do they rank in your mind from here on? Allison Dukes : Sure. Thanks Brennan. Yes, the resolution of the MLP matter will be a terrific milestone for us to get through. That's been out there for a while now. It's something we've been anticipating and reserving for. And so as we think about the funding of that matter and the fact that the liability, at this moment does appear to be lower than what we were previously anticipating is good news. And we do look forward to the resolution of that in the fourth quarter. As we get through that, that does in fact clear out a lot of these I'll call them contingent liabilities, that were things we needed to be cognizant of and manage our cash flow for over the past year plus. And so as we look forward, beyond the resolution of that, I mean, I'd say a couple of things. One, we continue to focus on just the improvement of our balance sheet overall. Our leverage profile as I noted, continues to improve with the strength of EBITDA, depending on how you think about our leverage, but looking at the non-preferred element of the capital structure. I mean, we're below 1x now with the results in the second quarter. And that's strong improvement. We're going to continue to be focused on opportunities that we have to improve our balance sheet. And I don't know what that means just yet. But we do have maturities as you know that come up in 2022 and 2024. And those remain areas of optionality for us, as we think about balance sheet improvement. Beyond that, we are going to continue to be committed to that sustainable and modestly increasing dividend. We as you noted, increased the dividend last quarter. And we will continue to look for opportunities to increase the common dividend, concurrent with improvement in our performance and our results. And then longer term, resuming share buybacks, I don't know when that will be. As I said, we want to get through the MLP matter and we continue to be focused on the leverage profile. But share buybacks certainly remain an opportunity for us to continue to return capital to shareholders. Brennan Hawken : Thanks for that color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Katz with Citigroup. Your line is open. Bill Katz : Okay. Excuse me. Thank you very much for taking my questions this morning. Marty maybe a question for you, just as you think about your relationship with MassMutual. Where does that go from here, is maybe think through discuss maybe the C capital need versus maybe an opportunity to grow organically through their distribution pipe, and then, maybe any opportunity that you could see, working with them on M&A? Marty Flanagan : Yeah. Thanks Bill. So again, it has been multifaceted, as you're pointing out. So, one is, sort of a co-investor seed enabler and alternatives, that's been very, very positive, not just for the investment itself, but really the credibility of seed investor with other institutional clients. And so the retail channel is about correct me Allison about $10 billion on the retail platform right now, where the number to flowing organization within that right now. And as you know they've recently closed the acquisition of the REIT business that looks like it's going to be an opportunity for us as we move forward. So again, we just continue to work together on a very regular basis on various opportunities, as we look to the future. With regard to M&A not exactly sure what the question is, they understand our strategy very much, as an organization. And if something made sense, along the lines we've talked about in the past, that it improves our strategic position. It's complementary to our business. There's sort of if you want to call it the necessity of cultural alignment, I'm sure they would be supportive of that. Allison Dukes : Yeah. The one thing I'd say is we manage about $5 billion on the broker-dealer platform. Marty Flanagan : Excuse me. Thanks, Allison. Yeah. Allison Dukes : Secondhand flows there. Bill Katz : Okay. That's helpful. And then, just a follow-up coming back to capital management for a moment, certainly appreciate a little uncertainty, as you go to the end of the year with the liability still outstanding. But just given where the stock is trading today, against your relative positioning, I'm just surprised that buybacks would be fourth on your list. Can you talk a little bit about maybe the internal rate of return assumption you have between new business growth coming in the door versus the opportunity to buy back stock at these price points? Thank you. Allison Dukes : Yes. I mean, I don't want to imply that it's fourth on the list. And as we've said before, it's not quite as need of the waterfall as that would imply. We are being thoughtful about the timing and when we would resume buybacks. And certainly, we are thoughtful about how we think about that internal rate of return relative to other opportunities. The one thing I didn't say, and I should have said is the number one opportunity we have is to continue to invest in our own growth. And we are constantly thinking about the opportunity we have to invest in our own product launches to invest in our own capabilities, and we think that drives longer-term growth that shareholders are really looking for. Buybacks aren't fourth and last by any means but we've had a number of parallel paths we've been running over this past year and resolving some of these contingent liabilities as well as improving the balance sheet overall. We're making good progress there and we're going to continue making progress, as we think about all these opportunities we have. Bill Katz : Thank you, guys. Allison Dukes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Alex Blostein : Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question as well. I was hoping to go back to private markets discussion for a second and really zone in on the retail opportunity you see for Invesco. Maybe just a little more color on what product, specifically you're sort of aiming to penetrate the retail footprint with sort of kind of what is your go-to-market strategy there? And considering a significant amount of kind of open space and building appetite for private market solutions in the retail channel, can you get there organically, or do you think you need to acquire additional capabilities? Marty Flanagan : Yes. So it's a very good question. And I said, it was the INREIT, which is being introduced to the retail market right now to illustrate our capability. Our view is that the largest opportunity for growth for direct real estate capability is in the retail channel globally. And that's not unique to us. I think many firms have tried to figure out how best to alternative firms in particular, how to best access that channel. And it's very hard from the standpoint of those firms, if you're an alternative firm and have the capability. But you really need that retail presence with distributors, wholesalers and the like to be successful. And so there are very few firms like us that can pull that off. And so we look at this as really important development for us. So again, just what we've done with UBS and now through multiple distributors here in the United States. So we don't think that \u2013 we have the capabilities that are in demand within that channel and it's early days as far as I'm concerned for what we're going to see to move forward here. Alex Blostein : So, it sounds like organically is kind of the path here on private market all as opposed to anything inorganic? Marty Flanagan : Yes. Yes. We have plenty to give with the capabilities that we have right now in the retail channel. Alex Blostein : Got you. Great. And then just maybe a quick follow-up, Allison for you, any apologies if I missed it but can you talk a little bit about the fee rates associated with the $33 billion institutional pipeline? And then curious again within the old part of the institutional pipeline what strategies does that comprise of? Thanks. Allison Dukes : Sure. We \u2013 if I look at the pipeline and look at the fee rate, I think what we've disclosed previously is the fee rate for our institutional pipeline tends to be \u2013 it's below the firm average but it tends to be in the kind of high 20s, low 30s basis points. And as I look at the fee rate of the pipeline at the end of the second quarter, it's the highest I've seen since I've been at Invesco. And so I'm quite bullish as I look at the pipeline both in terms of the size, but it was replenished back to $33 billion following the $17 billion funding of the Australian mandate. And the composition of the pipeline itself in terms of average fee rate and the balance across those regions and asset classes, it's pretty balanced across the United States, Asia Pacific and EMEA. And in terms of asset classes kind of coming back to the second part of your question, it's actually a little bit higher on the alternative side than it has been in the last few quarters. And that's really I think again points to our private markets capabilities both our real estate capabilities as well as our senior loan capabilities. And, I think, again speaks to just the strength of those capabilities, the demand that exists in the institutional channel and our performance overall. Alex Blostein : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from Michael Cyprys with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Cyprys : Hi. It's Mike Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just a question on China given the success that you guys had over there. Just hoping you could talk a little bit about your approach to distribution in China. What's worked, what hasn't worked as well? What lessons do you take away from your deep experience in the region as it relates to distribution? And maybe you could also touch upon some of the digital distribution initiatives as well how that's evolving? Marty Flanagan : Yes. Thanks, Mike. Great question. So needless to say, it's a very, very competitive market and success is only going to come in retail channel if you are deeply embedded in China and have your business driven by the local Chinese, which is the case for us. And you have to be a little more typical that we might see in the United States where there are very important engagements with large banks insurance companies getting on platforms and service in that way. I'll say half of our retail flows right now on some type of digital platform. And it started with us with Ant Financial as we came in early I think the first foreign money manager to their very large money fund and it then expanded from that into other capabilities and then on to other platforms within the marketplace. What you'll also see is the digital engagement is at a level that is the most sophisticated in the world and how you engage with clients the demands on the organization are quite extraordinary. But by the way the benefit is it just has helped us in other parts of the world as we think of those types of engagement as they continue to evolve in different marketplaces. So from the retail channel institutionally same thing some of the most sophisticated institutional investors in the world and it is -- you just have to bring the best and brightest within the organization representing the full range of capabilities. And this is another example where some of the largest penetrations with those institutional clients multiple mandates is in China for us and it just really reflects the necessity of the depth and breadth of an organization and to be able to serve the institutional clients at a very high level. So I don't know if that's insightful, but that's what's worked for us. Michael Cyprys : Great. Thanks. And just a follow-up question maybe more for Allison around the impact of market movements on your expense base. I think in the past you've said maybe about one-third of the expense base is variable or so or moves with market. Is that still right? And then I see you called out about $18 million or so impact on the comp side for market movements on slide 9. Should we think about that being driven by the 5% market appreciation in your AUM in the quarter translating into that $18 million impact so $72 million annually. How should we be thinking about that? Allison Dukes : So a couple of things. One I'd say, yes, you're -- the portion of our expenses that would be variable in nature and primarily driven by markets, but certainly other flows would drive it as well would be about one-third. In terms of that market variable comps on slide 9 there's FX in there as well. So do keep that in mind. But, yes, you can really kind of look at that relationship of just comp to revenue even and see there's some consistency, but as revenue increases. AUM performance all of these things drive compensation and drives the increase in variable compensation. I don't -- I wouldn't point you to any break in the historical relationship there. It's still consistent with what we've guided to in the past. And, yes, so I'll leave it at that. Did that answer your question? Michael Cyprys : Sure. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Marty Flanagan : Okay. Yes. Operator, I'm sorry. Did I cut you off? Operator : Go ahead, sir. Marty Flanagan : Yes. Good. I just want to -- Allison I just -- on behalf of Allison, I thank you very much for your time and appreciate the engagement and we'll be in touch. Have a good rest of the day. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now, I would like to turn the call over to your speakers for today, Marty Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; and Allison Dukes, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin. Marty Flanagan : Thank you, Operator, appreciate it very much. And thanks everybody for joining us. And I'll make a few comments and turn over Allison so she can review the quarter in more depth and then we'll open up the Q&A as we always do. Hoping everybody's staying safe and healthy as we continue to return to normalcy and I know we're all looking for that pace to continue in the months ahead. We continue to have a high-level of engagement with our clients, which is even more important as we navigate the market uncertainty brought about by the end of economic and market upside surprises we experienced from the depth of COVID; helping our clients by providing insights and solutions, utilizing our broad range of capabilities. This approach has helped us deliver strong consistent growth over the past five quarters. And as you can see on Slide 3 if you're following along on the deck, net long term flows were $13.3 billion during the quarter. This represents over 4% annualized long term organic growth for the quarter. Growth was driven by continued strength in a number of our key capabilities, including ETFs, fixed income, China solutions, alternative global equities. Strategically, we continue to invest in areas where we see client demand we're at competitive strength. And since the third quarter of last year, we've generated $86 billion of long term inflows, an average quarterly organic growth rate of 6%, five consecutive quarters of strong growth, the direct result of the investments we've made over time to enhance and evolve our business to meet client needs. ETFs excluding the QQQs generated long term inflows of $3.7 billion in the quarter with strong market share gains in our EMEA ETF range. In private markets, we generated net long term inflows in our direct real estate business of $1.2 billion and robust bank loan product demand resulted in net long term inflows of $2 billion during the quarter. This included a launch of a new CLO. We generated net long term inflows of $11 billion with an active fixed income across the platform and within active global equities, the developing markets fund, a key capability that came over when we combined with Oppenheimer, continue to see net long term inflows of $700 million during the quarter. That said, we remain focused and continue to work on areas where there's opportunity for improvement. In addition, our solutions enabled institutional pipeline accounts for 38% of the pipeline at quarter end. Their quarter flows included net long term inflows of $6.8 billion from greater China. Our China business continues to be a source of strength and differentiation for Invesco. We continue to expect the Chinese investment management industry to be the fastest growing market in the world for the foreseeable future. We are an early entrant 20 years ago and we are benefiting from that commitment and investment and we expect to see continued growth in the years ahead. Before I turn the call over Allison who will provide more information on the China business and the results, I'd like to note that the growth we're experiencing is driving positive operating leverage, producing adjusted operating margin of 42% for the quarter. The strong cash flow being generated from our business improve our cash position and helping build a stronger balance sheet and improving our financial flexibility for the future. Invesco's depth and breadth of capabilities and competitive strengths position us well as we look forward. We continue to focus our efforts on delivering positive outcomes for our clients while driving future growth. And with that, let me turn it over to Allison. Allison Dukes : Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everyone. Moving to Slide 4. Our investment performance was strong in the third quarter with 72% and 74% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers were beating benchmark on a 5-year and a 10-year basis. This reflected continued strength in fixed income, global equities, including emerging market equities and Asian equities, all areas where we continue to see demand from clients slowly [ph]. Moving to Slide 5. We ended the quarter with $1.529 trillion in AUM, a net increase of $3.6 billion. As Marty noted earlier, our diversified platform generated net long term inflows in the third quarter of $13.3 billion, representing a 4.4% annualized organic growth rate. Active AUM net long term inflows were $6.8 billion and passive AUM net long term flows [ph] for $6.5 billion. Market declines and FX rate changes lead to a decrease in AUM of $18.6 billion in the quarter. The retail channel generated net long term inflows of $1.8 billion driven by positive ETF flows and inflows in greater China. Institutional channel demonstrated the breadth of our platform and generated net long term inflows of $11.5 billion in the quarter with diverse mandates both regionally and by capability funding in the period. Regarding retail net inflows, our ETF excluding the QQQ generated net long term inflows of $3.7 billion. Year-to-date, we have captured global ETF market share. Our global ETF platform, again excluding the QQQ captured at 3.8% market share flows, which exceeded our 2.7% market share of AUM. We have also captured a higher share of the global ETF revenue pool over this period. Our market share of the revenue pool was 5.6%. Net ETF inflows in the United States does include net long term inflows of $900 million into our QQQ Innovation Suite which crossed $3 billion in AUM, one year after its launch. Our EMEA-based ETF range generated $2.5 billion of net long term inflows in the quarter with particular strength from the IVC's [ph] S&P 500 UCITS ETF and the Gold Exchange traded commodity fund. Looking at flows by geography on Slide 6, you'll note that the Americas had net long term inflows of $4.8 billion in the quarter, driven by net inflows into ETFs as mentioned, as well as our institutional flows. Asia Pacific again delivered another strong quarter with net long term inflows of $9.3 billion. Net inflows were diversified across the region, reflecting $6.8 billion of net long term inflows from greater China, most of which arose in our JV and $3.1 billion from Japan. Turning to flows across asset classes. We continue to see broad strength in fixed income in the third quarter with net long term flows of $11 billion. Drivers of fixed income flows include institutional net flows into various fixed income strategies through our China JV, global investment grade, stable value and municipal strategies. Our alternative asset class holds many different capabilities and this is reflected in the flows that we saw in the third quarter. Net long term flows and alternatives were $2.3 billion, driven primarily by our private markets business, through a combination of inflows from direct real estate, the newly launched CLO that Marty mentioned, and senior loan capabilities. When excluding global GTR net outflows of $1.7 billion, alternative net long term inflows were $4 billion. The strength of our alternative platform can be seen through the flows it has generated over the past five quarters with net long term flows totaling $12 billion and organic growth rates averaging nearly 6% per quarter over this time when excluding the impact of the GTR net outflows over this period. Turning to Slide 7, I wanted to spend a few minutes on our business in China, particularly given the level of flows we have seen from the region over the last several quarters and the high-level of interest in our business there. Invesco launched the first Sino-U.S. JV in China in 2003 as Invesco Great Wall. We've been in the market for almost two decades with a unique JV structure and relationship with our partner. How we operate in China is differentiated from others that have joint ventures. While we have 49% ownership of the JV, our partner is a Chinese government-backed power company and has been a good partner. We've been leading the management of the JV, leveraging our global asset management expertise since the inception of this partnership. We run the business in China with Chinese management and our clients are Chinese investors. China's fund management industry is a very significant opportunity. In 20 years it has grown from almost nothing to around $3.5 trillion. It's expected to become the second largest fund management market in the world by 2025, with assets of over $6 trillion. Also, China is estimated to account for over 40% of global net flows through 2024. Invesco as an early entrant in China have developed a strong and comprehensive platform covering all business activities, including robust domestic investment capabilities with good long term performance track records. We have very strong relationships with banks and insurance companies and digital distribution has been a major contributor in recent years in terms of bringing in new onshore business. Key opportunities for Invesco in China include mutual funds, institutional clients and sovereign wealth funds. As China continues to open up and improve its capital markets, we also expect opportunities in pension reform, global investors increasing interest in investing in Chinese investments and cross border investment opportunities. The relationships, the unique business model we established with our JV partner and the amount of AUM we have sourced from Chinese onshore investors really sets us apart from other global asset managers who are newer entrants in the Chinese market. Moving to Slide 8, we have built a diversified business in China with over $99 billion in AUM at the end of September. 60% of the AUM is from retail clients and 40% is institutional. We manage AUM in all asset classes and distribution is unique. Digital distribution to retail investors have become a mainstream channel along with the traditional bank distribution channels and this is not just for money market funds. With our market position and tenure in China, we are beneficiaries of this trend. Our long term commitment and strong track record have put Invesco in an advantageous position and our strategic position and continued investment in China has resulted in a 42% annual growth rate over the last three years to-date. In recognition of the strength of business, Invesco was ranked the number one China onshore business and the number three for an asset management firm in overall China in 2020. Before we wrap up this discussion on China, in light of the recent developments around Evergrande, I want to note that our overall exposure of the direct equity or fixed income holding across the complex, including within our JV is de minimis. Market volatility and offshore markets, of course doesn't impact AUM levels and the market has been and could be volatile for future real estate developments. We remain positive towards the fundamentals of China's economy and most of the flows in our China business come from domestic onshore clients. So if anything, we've seen a flight to quality as investors look to NAV-based products like the ones IGW offers. And moving to Slide 9 to look at the institutional pipeline, which was $32 billion at the end of September. The pipeline remains relatively consistent to prior quarter levels in terms of both asset and fee composition. Overall, the pipeline is well-diversified across asset classes and geographies. Our solutions capability enabled 38% of the global institutional pipeline and creative wins and customized mandate. This has contributed to meaningful growth across our institutional network. Turning to Slide 10, you'll note that net revenues increased $31 million, or 2.3% from the second quarter as a result of higher average AUM in the third quarter. The net revenue yield excluding performance fees was 34.4 basis points, a decrease of four-tenths of a basis point from the second quarter yield level. The decrease was mainly driven by asset mix shift, including higher QQQ and money market average balances. The incremental impact from higher discretionary money market fee waivers was minimal relative to the second quarter and the full impact on the net revenue yield for the third quarter was six-tenths of a basis point. Looking forward, we expect the dynamics impacting net revenue yield will continue. The degree of which will be influenced by market direction, especially if we see a divergence and performance in areas such as developing or emerging markets where fees tend to be higher than our firm average. We do expect the discretionary money market fee waivers to remain in place for the foreseeable future until rates begin to recover to more normalized levels. One other area I want to note before moving to expenses are performance fees. Historically, we have realized meaningfully higher performance fees in the fourth quarter. These have been driven typically by a few funds each year that have reached the point in their lifecycle where they generate performance fees usually in the fourth quarter. This year, we do not expect to see performance fees increase in the fourth quarter. We expect performance fees in the quarter will be more in-line with our experience across the first three quarters of the year. This is due to vintages and our portfolio not being at the lifecycle stage of recognizing performance fees, which is typically near the end of the life of the fund and is in no way related to the performance of the funds. Total adjusted operating expenses increased 1.2% in the third quarter. The $10 million increase in operating expenses was mainly driven by variable compensation and property office and technology expense. Higher variable compensation was driven by the revenue increase in the quarter, partially offset by savings resulting from our strategic evaluation. The increase in property office and technology expenses was largely driven by changes to the pricing of transfer agency services that we provide to our funds as we noted last quarter. This change went into effect in the third quarter and resulted in a $6 million expense increase, which was offset by a corresponding increase in service and distribution revenues. As a reminder, we anticipate that our outsourced administration costs which we reflect in property office and technology expense will increase by approximately $25 million on an annual basis, or approximately $6 million per quarter, and offsetting this will be a corresponding increase in service and distribution revenues resulting in a minimal impact to operating income. Operating expenses remained at lower-than-historic activity levels due to pandemic, driven impact to discretionary spending, travel and other business operations. However, we did see a modest increase in client activity and business travel in the third quarter, which is reflected in both marketing and G&A expense. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, our expectations are for fourth quarter operating expenses to be relatively flat compared to the third quarter, assuming no change in markets and FX levels from September 30. Consistent with prior years, we expect a modest seasonal increase in marketing related expenses in the fourth quarter. And one area that's still more difficult to forecast at this point is when COVID-impacted travel and entertainment expense levels will begin to normalize. We are engaging in more domestic travel and in-person client activities and we do expect to see continued modest resumption of these activities in the fourth quarter. Moving to Slide 11, we update you on the progress we have made with our strategic evaluation. In the third quarter, we realized $5.8 million in cost savings. $4 million of these savings was related to compensation expense associated with reorganizations and $2 million was related to property expense. A $5.8 million in cost savings or $23 million annualized combined with $125 million in annualized savings realized for the second quarter and 2021 brings us to $148 million in total, or 74% of our $200 million net savings expectation. As it relates to timing, we expect to modestly exceed the $150 million target we had set for 2021, with the remainder realized by the end of 2022. We expect a total program savings of $200 million through 2022 would be roughly 65% from compensation and 35% spread across the other categories. In the third quarter we incurred $18 million of restructuring costs. In total, we recognized nearly $190 million of our estimated $250 million to $275 million in restructuring costs that were associated with the program. We expect the remaining restructuring costs for the realization of this program to be in the range of $60 million to $85 million through the end of next year. As a reminder, the costs associated with the strategic evaluation are not reflected in our non-GAAP results. Going to Slide 12. Adjusted operating income improved [ph] $21 million to $562 million for the quarter, driven by the factors we just reviewed. Adjusted operating margin improved 60 basis points to 42.1% as compared to the second quarter. Most importantly, our degree of positive operating leverage reflected in our non-GAAP results was 1.7x for the quarter, underscoring our focus on driving scale and profitability across our diversified platform. Non-operating income was $29 million, driven primarily by unrealized gains in our co-investment portfolios. Effective tax rate for the third quarter was 24.4% compared to 22.8% in the second quarter. The rate increase is primarily due to an increase in the reserved for uncertain tax positions. We estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 24% for the fourth quarter. The actual effective tax rate may vary from this estimate due to the impact of non-recurring items on pretax income and discrete tax items. Looking at Slide 13, we illustrate our ability to drive adjusted operating margin performance against the backdrop of the client demand driven change in our AUM mix and the resulting impact on our net revenue yield excluding performance fees. Our operating margin in the third quarter of 2019, which was the first full quarter following the acquisition of Oppenheimer was 40.9%. At that time, we reported a net revenue yield of 40.7 basis points. In the third quarter of 2021, our net revenue yield had declined over 6 basis points to 34.4 basis points. Yet, our operating margin has improved to 42.1%. This chart starts at the third quarter of 2019, but in fact, our third quarter 2021 operating margin is the highest since Invesco became a U.S. listed company in 2007. This is against the backdrop of a mixed driven decline in net revenue yield. We've been building out our product suite to meet client demand and client demand has been tilted towards lower fee products. In fact, the growth of the QQQ over this period is remarkable, almost tripling in size and going from 6% of our AUM mix in the third quarter of 2019 to 12% at the end of this quarter. Even though we do not earn a management fee of sponsor to QQQ, we manage the over $100 million annual marketing budget generated by the product. The marketing budget has allowed Invesco to further raise awareness about the QQQ. That increased awareness has resulted in its ability to significantly increase our market share in the ETF space. Invesco is today the fourth largest ETF provider in the world. Growth in the QQQ accounts for 2 basis points of the net revenue yield declined over the period shown on this chart. And as I noted earlier, discretionary money market fee waivers account for 6 basis point decline in the net revenue yield. These two factors alone account for over 40% of the decline in the net revenue yield over this period. Realizing our business mix is shifting, we continue to be focused on aligning our expense base with the changes in our business mix, which has enabled the firm to generate positive operating leverage and operating margin improvement. Now, a few comments on Slide 14. Our balance sheet cash position was $1.8 billion on September 30, and approximately $725 million of this cash is held for regulatory requirements. The cash position has improved meaningfully over the past year, increasing by nearly $700 million, largely driven by the improvement in our operating income. Our debt profile has improved considerably as well with no draws on our revolver at quarter end. As a result, we have substantially improved our net leverage position as shown in the top right chart on this slide. Our leverage ratio as defined under our credit facility agreement decline from 1.43x a year ago, to under 1x at 0.86 turns at the end of this third quarter. If you choose to include the preferred stock, leverage ratio has declined from just over 4x to 2.67x at the end of the third quarter. Regarding future cash requirements, we recorded an additional downward adjustment to the MLP liability in the third quarter, reducing the liability from our previous estimate of nearly $300 million down to $254 million. We anticipate funding the liability this quarter and we have ample cash resources to do so. While we anticipate a degree of insurance recovery related to this, the insurance claims process is inherently complex and we do not have an update at this stage as to the exact timing or sides of the recovery. Regarding our capital strategy. We are committed to a sustainable dividend and to returning capital to shareholders through a combination of modestly increasing dividends and share repurchases. As we look towards 2022 and beyond, we will be building towards a 30% to 50% total payout ratio over the next several years as we continue to modestly increase dividends and reinstate a share buyback program in the future. Overall, we believe we're making solid progress in our efforts to improve liquidity and build financial flexibility. In summary, we continue to see growth in our key capabilities. We remain focused on executing the strategies that aligns with these areas while completing our strategic evaluation and reallocating our resources to position us for growth. And finally, we remain prudent in our approach to capital management. We're in a very strong position to meet client needs and run a disciplined business and to continue to invest in and grow our franchise over the long term. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. You may go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. So, interesting comment about the driving towards 30% to 50% payout [ph] ratio eventually. I guess it brings up the strategic question of what's left to do? Meaning you've scaled up, you've gotten a lot more global. You brought in the board, you have China ETFs fixed income, solutions, everything that's working. So, what else would you be using your cash flow in the future besides capital return? Is that for broadening things like alternatives? I'm just trying to put that numbers question in a more big strategic question. Thanks. Marty Flanagan : Thanks, Glenn. Let me make a couple comments and Allison can chime in, too. Look, we've had the conversation. The industry is increasingly competitive and reinvesting the business is a high priority for us. And as you say, whether it be product extensions, for us, to buy more in private markets continue to focus on that business and grow there. But the investments in technology digital, they're really endless. So again, there's just a lot of demand that we would have internally and we continue to make those investments to just increase our competitiveness and continue to evolve the business in-line with the client demands. Allison Dukes : I would just add. I think you could sum that up with just -- we seek to improve and increase our strategic optionality. We want to have the ability to continue to invest in the business, we want ample cash resources for any downturn, or any sort of market volatility that could lie ahead. We want to be in position to continue to pay down our debt and we have a $600 million note that comes due next year. We do have the remaining MLP liability, which I noted has been lowered to $254 million, which is very good news. Nonetheless, that is the cash obligation in the fourth quarter and we have ample cash resources to handle that. So really, as we think about the balance sheet -- and you've seen the progress we've made over the last 18 months or so -- we really are trying to put our balance sheet in a very strong position. So we have the strategic optionality. That will include returning capital to shareholders, but we want to be in a position to really balance our priorities, which does include improving the balance sheet, investing in the business, maintaining strategic optionality and returning capital to shareholders. Glenn Schorr : Okay, thanks both for that. Thank you. Marty Flanagan : Thanks, Glenn. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS. You may go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I wanted to do just start on waivers. Allison, you flagged 0.6 [ph] six basis points, the fee rate is there. By your estimate -- I know it's going to depend upon some competitive dynamics and whatnot. But how many hikes do you think we would need before those go away? Because as the forward curve tells us, we're getting closer to that. So, I want to sharpen up the model there. Allison Dukes : Hard to say how many. I do think just the single first hike will certainly be helpful to starting to reduce those money market fee waivers. It will certainly help on the institutional client side for sure. It does depend on a lot of supply demand dynamics, which will just impact the overall availability of the securities to purchase. So, the change in said [ph] funds will be helpful. It won't be the only factor that will determine how quickly it goes away and just an increase in short term rates overall will help on the retail side as well. Brennan Hawken : Okay. I guess following up on that, was when you had waivers in the past, was there a certain threshold for short term rates where they were eliminated? I would assume something like 50 basis points would be sufficient. Is that fair? Marty Flanagan : I think that's right. I'd have to go back in the cobwebs and remember, but that sounds about you're in the right zone. And I'd come back to Allison's comment, though, too. It's going to depend on the competitive dynamics. Brennan Hawken : Of course. Marty Flanagan : But usually, all figured out [ph]. Allison Dukes : Probably not an unreasonable expectation. It's just how quickly when we get there, can we can we unwind it. Brennan Hawken : Okay, fair enough. Fair enough. Okay, thank you. And then there's been some speculation in the news about a potential tie up with you all and another large financial services firm that has a big asset manager. Curious what you can say about that and then separately, you guys have been very clear that M&A, when it's done right, is definitely a strategic consideration for you and it's something that is important and can be value created when done right. Can you maybe walk us through your priorities on the M&A front and whether or not Invesco is interested in being a seller? Marty Flanagan : I can assure you that we're not interested in being a seller. So, let's start there. But let me back up and put in context. As we look at our capital priorities outside, I spoke in a second ago about that, it's first reinvesting the business to sort of increase our competitive positioning. But then strategically, what we look at is, we look at where client demand is and if we can't fill the gap internally, we would look externally. So, it has to make strategic sense. It has to be complementary to our business. It can't be duplicate to our business. That never works. Clients don't like it, employees don't like it, and by the way, shareholders don't either. And I've come back to the point time and time again that you have to have the wherewithal to ensure you're protecting what you bought while creating a better organization. And also, very importantly, the cultural alignment matters a lot. If there's misalignment, then you're going to have a problem at some point. So, as we look at it right now, the priority is, again, continuing to build on what we have. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, it is our private markets business where we're spending no specific amount of time as we're seeing client demand in credit and particular, that's been an area in some extensions in our real estate area. So, not much different than we've talked about in the past. Brennan Hawken : Thanks for taking my questions. Marty Flanagan : Thanks, Brennan. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. You may go ahead. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to follow up on the momentum in China. You guys have been highlighting this for several quarters. The numbers have been good. Curious about the retail distribution and kind of how I guess diverse and entrenched you are with the third party, the banks and others in there, and maybe talk about if there's certain concentrations in the regions or partners? Or just a little more color on the distribution breadth that you have there. Marty Flanagan : Yes, I'll make a couple comments and then Alison will add. So, as you looked in the materials that Allison referred to, it's 6% retail, 40% institutional. The retail comes through the joint venture and it's very, very broad. Just the sheer size of the country, you end up with any number of distributors, yes, but there's the obvious banks and insurance company. But an area of real strength and growth is really that you have e-commerce distribution channels and there's many different avenues there beyond and financial where one of the firms has been quite successful. So, the concentration risk is not an issue for us and we just looked at the whole distribution landscape to continue to open and broaden. But again, it is a very competitive landscape. So don't misunderstand my comments. Allison Dukes : I don't know that I have a whole lot to add to that. I think the online distribution channels have really overtaken the banking distribution channels in terms of market share overall in China and just given the time we've had there and the strength in the tenure, we've got very strong relationships, not just across those traditional banking distribution channels, which continue to be very good. But also and that's emerging online trend and also very strong institutional relationships there, which are going to continue to be important drivers of long term growth in China. Dan Fannon : Got it and then as a follow up, Allison, could you expand a bit on the performance fee outlook for fourth quarter? Just understanding there was basically an investment gap for some period several years ago where you didn't put money to work. And so, the vintage like the timing is just off. I'm just curious how that doesn't tie to performance. Just making sure I understand the dynamics of this quarter and why before the fourth quarter of 2021 and how we should think about that maybe for fourth quarter 2022 assuming performance holds here and we would see that and would come back or normalize again next year. Allison Dukes : Yes. I wouldn't say there was an investment gap and the nature of just performance fees and how they are structured into various contracts just remains. It's very bespoke and it can be somewhat chunky and difficult to predict. There wasn't an investment gap, but as we do look at just the vintages of what has performance fees in it, that would be eligible there. It is not the typical year-end spike of what we would typically see. So no performance misses, just the way these vintages are kind of cycling through in what we see in the fourth quarter of this year. We continue to have about $58 billion of AUM overall that is performance fee-eligible. We just don't have strike dates, if you will, of 1231 [ph] or at least at the end of this year that would incur or recognize performance fees in the fourth quarter. So, our expectation is that fees in this quarter will be consistent with the experience we've had in the first three quarters of this year rather than a spike at year-end. And you shouldn't read anything into that in terms of what that means for 2022 or beyond. It's just simply a function of timing with the vintages this year [ph]. Dan Fannon : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. You may go ahead. Patrick Davitt : Hey. Good morning, everyone. You touched on this briefly in the prepared remarks, but China phones are obviously remarkably resilient, given the increased volatility we saw there last quarter. Could you give a little bit more detail on kind of the flow and investing trends you saw through that volatility? Was there any kind of drop-off in activity as the volatility got worse later in the quarter? As in short, what I'm trying to get to is do we need to worry about these flows slowing or even reversing if Chinese volatility continues to get meaningfully worse? Or do you think QQQ suggests they could be resilient through that? Marty Flanagan : I'll make a couple of comments. So, if you rewind the tape to the beginning of the year, Q1, we thought was such an incredibly strong quarter that it couldn't be repeated and slowed Samba [ph] continue to be very, very strong. Just what we're seeing is there was just movement of investor behavior from really equity capabilities that were sort of growth-focused to value-focused and just continuing to work through the broad range of capability. So, it's hard to predict what's going to happen, but we're just not seeing that fall off to the degree that you would imagine in those very volatile periods as you saw if you went back to 2015 or something like that. What's really important is the market continues to evolve in a very positive way and the regulators have been very focused on providing a greater investment and retirement savings market and you're seeing that. So, I'm not going to say that we'll never peak in [ph] that redemption, but it's been very resilient through this year, even with the volatility that we've seen. Allison Dukes : The only thing I might add, if I look back over the last five quarters, this was our second highest quarter for flows in China. And I think the volatility, no, we didn't necessarily see it trend down inside of the quarter. And in some of that volatility, you started to just hear -- I'll call it softening and sentiment really in the second quarter and you see that more in the second quarter flow results. If I look at the flows into the joint venture, in particular, it's about $7 billion, which of that product launches drove a couple billion dollars. The remainder was really through existing products, particularly fixed income. There was a lot of strength in our fixed income capability. That's different than what we saw in the first quarter where it was new product launches that drove the majority of the flows. And this quarter, it was really from our existing products. And I think that not only speaks to just the strength and the sustainability in the market, but also the breadth of the capabilities in our platform that we're able to continue to gather assets without large new product launches, just given the breadth of capabilities we offer. Patrick Davitt : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. You may go ahead. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning. The next sales picture continues to be quite solid and the pipeline continues to be strong. An area of weakness seems to be the UK. It seems like outflows are persisting in the UK, but getting better. So, a couple questions. You mentioned GTR. I think you said $1.7 billion of outflows in the quarter. How much does GTR still manage and is the expectation for continued outflows given the performance there? And then what products and businesses are working best in the UK? And what is the outlook for the UK to sort of move back broadly to positive flows in the future? Allison Dukes : Why don't I start with GTR and I'll let Marty chime in. So, in terms of where GTR is today, at the end of September 30, it was down to $8.3 billion. That was down from its peak of $30 billion. The outflows in the quarter were $1.7 billion. Now, that $8.3 billion is not entirely in the UK, but it is largely in the UK. In fact, what is reflected in the UK is about $6 billion. So, we are down to a point of at least diminishing headwinds. We do have an expectation that it will continue to decline, so I don't think we have seen a bottom there. We do expect it will continue to decline. But the headwinds are diminishing. And I think you see that just in terms of the improved outflows for the UK this quarter with $1.8 billion in outflows, which is an improvement from $3.2 billion in the second quarter. So, despite some of those outflows, we do see retail overall improving and we see good demand for active European equities and really improving redemption rates for our UK equities. So there are, I will call it 'right spots' [ph] and 'green shoots' [ph] as we continue to work through these GTR headwinds. Marty Flanagan : Yes. I'll just add a couple of things. So, I think also important when you look at the period we've been through with UK equities in particular and underperformance and sort of sentiment was quite negative in the sector, too. The combination is not very positive for results. The short term performance has improved quite dramatically in the UK equities, which is important. The ETF flows are the other area where we're seeing demand and also the institutional business. As we look forward, as Allison said, we're having some good expectations of being back in flows in the UK here. Ken Worthington : Okay, great. Thank you. Marty Flanagan : Yes. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Robert Lee with KBW. You may go ahead. Robert Lee : Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe Marty and Allison, I'd just like to go back to the greater China business. You've talked for a while, it seems like a few years, almost with the JV and maybe bringing it up to majority ownership. But I guess one question would be that since you operate it, does it really even matter getting to majority ownership? Is that even something that at this point is even possible? And then I have a follow up question after that. Marty Flanagan : Yes. You hit it right on the head. The fundamental difference that we've had as opposed to every other joint venture that we know of, there could be someone similar to us, I don't know who that is. But having a sort of management control has been the separating factor. I think most people use majority control the shorthand for management control, but we've had that. We continue to be in discussions with our joint venture partner. It's likely we'll end up with the majority, but it's not going to be a huge change in the ownership, but it's not going to get in the way at all of our development in China and the success that we've had. So, you really hit the point that is most relevant for our success there. Allison Dukes : The only change if we were to do that would be an accounting change in terms of how we recognize the joint venture on the P&L. It wouldn't change anything day-to-day in how we operate it or the success of the venture. Robert Lee : That's great. And then maybe the follow up, shift gears a bit. I haven't really talked about it too much, I think in recent quarters, but there was a time where you made some acquisition, made investments in different technology platforms and I know bringing them all under the Intelliflo umbrella. But can you maybe give us a quick update on kind of the strategic positioning or importance of that? And maybe to what extent those platforms you're starting to see some positive impact and how they're maybe helping the flow picture, if at all? Marty Flanagan : Yes, you're right. It was a combination of five smaller acquisitions to create the platform. Last year was a year of pulling it together under the Intelliflo banner. The largest and most developed of is in Intelliflo in the UK, which still has a 40% market share. We continue to look at ways to not just advance the technology, but how can we advance flows in that market. We've not seen great success with that right now, but we're continuing to challenge that. Here in the United States, the same thing where we think the opportunity is serving the all-ready [ph] market. And again, we're now just frankly turning our attention to it after really the consolidation last year. If you just look at the way digital technologies are being used in a place like China, that's really what gave us the impetus to spend time and energy there. It is proven to be stunningly successful in China. There's different regulatory barriers here in the United States in structures and the like, but we still think there's an opportunity for success there. And we'll see in the quarters ahead if we're right. Robert Lee : Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Allison Dukes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Bill Katz with Citigroup. You may go ahead. Bill Katz : Okay. Thank you very much for taking the questions this morning. So, first question is just on the opportunity to take advantage of the democratization of retail alternatives. Could you maybe expand a little bit strategically what you're doing there to gin up the volume? Certainly, the billions or so is favorable in the $4 billion [ph] overall, it's very good. But we're seeing some very big numbers elsewhere. I'm sort of wondering what you're doing to leverage both the product and distribution relationships you have? Marty Flanagan : Yes, Bill, great question. It's where we see the immediate opportunity for us as with our direct real estate business. Earlier in the year, we actually entered into a partnership with UBS using real estate capability that's being distributed in Switzerland, Asia and EMEA. We now have an in-reach [ph] product here in the United States and we're just working with our distribution partners right now to get it on the platform. It's probably going through the end of the year to get to all the platforms that we're hopeful to get on. But we look at it as a huge opportunity, just because there are very, very few competitors there. And if you look at the success and pedigree of our real estate team, it's very, very strong. But it's traditionally been in the institutional market. It has not been in the real estate market and that's really [indiscernible] going as a combination of having an alternative capability, but also that the ability to distribute into the wealth management platforms and that's what we're looking forward to, hopefully taking advantage of. Bill Katz : Great, thanks. And maybe one big picture question as well, just a follow up. Some of the distributors are talking about accelerating the direct indexation opportunity, so they'll customize thought process. How would that affect Invesco good or bad? Marty Flanagan : Well, it's hard to know. It all depends on where it could go. What we do have is we have a self-indexing capability ourselves. And I can tell you the experience we've had in building models. We use that in those model creations, so you can see that to continue to be an extension there. Also, with our institutional clients, again, we're using that self-indexing capability to build customized indexes for our institutional clients. So, we look at it as we're probably one of very few institutions that have that capability and we expect that we'd use it probably in partnership with a number of our clients and wealth management partners. Bill Katz : Thank you. Marty Flanagan : Thanks, Bill. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead. Brian Bedell : Great, thanks. Good morning, folks. Maybe just back on indexing and on the M&A front in terms of the strategic optionality that you mentioned, Allison in the comments. You mentioned, Marty, as well. How important is having a beta index franchise? As opposed to smart beta and beta ETF capability, is that a strategic imperative for you? Or do you think you can grow organically in factor-based or self-index based strategies on your own? And then also, I guess, would you consider a joint venture as an option in doing that if you had -- I assume you'd want management control of that, just like you have in China. Marty Flanagan : Yes. Look, if you just follow the flows, there continues to be demand, cap-weighted indexes and also in in smart beta. Our history really started in sort of the smart beta category and you're seeing just ever-increasing demand there. So, it's really the answer is both is what's happening in portfolios and you want to be relevant in those marketplaces. And our focus has been heads-down and continues to grow. Allison talked about the queues in particular, recognizing it's the limitation we have from a fee generation point of view, but it's been very, very important for building out our ETF platform and the reputation of the firm. So, again, we'll just continue to challenge our competitive positioning and determine which is the best way forward. But so far, I'd say our success has been quite good. Brian Bedell : If you did want to enter into an arrangement, would you consider a JV in that type of structure? Or is that not even doable? Marty Flanagan : It's hard to know. It's all facts and circumstances, so I wouldn't want to speculate on that. Brian Bedell : Okay, great. And then just on sustainable flows for QQQ and total dedicated sustainable AUM. And if you want to comment [ph] off on the Bitcoin ETF strategy between physical and futures for that option. Marty Flanagan : Yes, why don't I start on what we're doing in Bitcoin and the like. So, we've entered into a partnership with Galaxy Digital. That's who we're going to work with to build out our whole suite of ETF capabilities, underlying blockchain technology, digital assets and crypto. Our focus is on a physically-backed current -- it's going to be some time, I think, before we get into the market, right? It's at the SEC right now and we've all known that they are still working through that as a topic. We've introduced two ETFs into the markets that sort of invest in companies that build off and play on the blockchain technology and the like. We did back away from doing [indiscernible] futures back product, because we think the best alternative going forward is really the physically back route. Allison Dukes : On your sustainability question, our flows and the ESG capabilities in the third quarter was a little bit talked about $300 million positive inflows in the quarter. We continue to have about $51.5 billion of AUM that we would consider to be ESG, funds and mandates, and that really spans across 160 ESG funds and mandates in a variety of asset classes. Importantly, we remain the second largest ESG ETF player in the world. Flows were a little bit softer in the third quarter relative to what we've seen in the first half of the year. Nothing to point to one way or the other there, but our expectation is to continue to see demand for those capabilities. Brian Bedell : Great, great. Thanks for all the color. Operator : Thank you. Our final question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead. Alex Blostein : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to shift gears a little bit, maybe go back to Slide 13, Allison, and you highlighted in the prepared remarks. So, definitely impressive to see the margin expansion despite the headwinds that you've seen in the theory. But I'm curious how you're thinking about the margin trajectory, longer term, assuming a more-normalized market, which 'normalize' is always a question mark, but clearly, market tailwind has been pretty significant over the last year or so. So, with the cost-cutting program, I think most of the way through, is it still likely for Invesco to see operating leverage off of this kind of 42% level over time? Assuming, again, kind of a more normalized market spectrum? Allison Dukes : Yes. I would say a couple of things. One, in terms of outlook for net revenue yield, just how we think about the fee rates from here, the biggest driver is always going to be the mix of flows that we see. That's going to have a huge impact and as we continue to seek client demand for all of our capabilities, but certainly increasing demand for our passive capabilities, you see that downward pressure. At the same time, you can market impact and work in either direction and it doesn't work consistently across those different asset classes and capabilities. And so, it's inherently difficult to predict for that reason. In terms of though, just bigger picture, how do we think about it, I do think we'll continue to see some modest downward pressure on it just as we continue to grow our passive capabilities and we see demand for those capabilities. Hopefully, it was also helpful to kind of understand the impact that the QQQ has on that. And so while it puts downward pressure on that revenue yield, it creates a tremendous benefit for us through the marketing, support budget it provides us. And I think, really, most importantly, we are able to generate that positive operating leverage and really improve margins against us. So, where do I think it goes from here? I'd say a couple of things. One, as we come towards the end of this expense management effort that we put in place last year and we expect to complete that next year, I don't think we have to continue to do things like that in order to sustain these strong operating margins. We've got an expense base that's over $3 billion. That's a significant budget to work with. And so, how we think about it is really how do we deploy that expense base? How do we continue to reallocate where we invest against our areas of highest demand and as we build out the breadth of capabilities, that scale and the volume of flows is what continues to generate really the positive operating leverage that we're looking for and gives us the opportunity to sustain these 40% plus operating margins even with some of that downward pressure in net revenue yield. And I appreciate you asking the question, because I think it's a really important point that we wanted to drive home and we wanted it to come through today because this didn't happen by accident. It really reflects a lot of deliberate work by the company over the last couple of years in an operating expense space that really gives us the leverage we need to continue to invest in the areas of growth that we see ahead. Alex Blostein : Perfect, great. Thank you very much. Allison Dukes : Thanks, Alex. Marty Flanagan : On behalf of Allison and myself, thank you very much for joining. I appreciate the questions and engagements and I look forward to talking with everybody next quarter. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating.

[Indiscernible] more participants to ask questions only one question and a follow up can be submitted per participant. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now, I would like to turn the call over to your speakers for today, Marty Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; and Allison Dukes, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin. Marty Flanagan : Thank you, operator. And thank you everybody for joining us and Happy New Year. We did end up 2021 with a strong fourth quarter and momentum going into 2022. So we'll spend a few minutes looking back to the fourth quarter, and also take a quick look at 2021 because it really sets the context as we go into the New Year. Our focus has been and will continue to be on client\u2019s employees as we execute in this COVID operating environment. And we've embedded new ways of working together to deliver outcomes for our clients. And we've maintained our focus in six key capability areas. ETFs, Factors, Index, Private Markets, Active Fixed Income, Active Global Equity, Greater China, and Solutions. This approach has helped us generate consistent strong and broad organic growth. And we ended the year crossing over $1.6 trillion in assets under management. And as you can see on slide three, our net term, net long term inflows of $12.5 billion represents organic, annualized long term growth of 4% despite the market volatility in the fourth quarter. This is a sixth consecutive quarter of strong growth and is a direct result of the investments we've made over time to enhance and evolve our business to meet the needs of our clients and it also speaks to the broad diversification of our business. Growth was driven by continued strength in our key capability areas as we strategically invest in areas where we see client demand and have competitive strengths. For the year, Invesco delivered the strongest organic growth in our history. We generated over $81 billion of net long term inflows representing 7% organic growth rate, which is one of the best in the industry. Looking at our specific capabilities, our global ETF platform closed up a year very strong. Each yes generated net inflows of nearly $22 billion in the fourth quarter, including our flagship QQQ product. The QQQ product had an exceptional quarter generated $13 billion net inflows. For the year, ETFs globally, generated a record $62 billion of net inflows and we increased our market share in both assets under management and revenue. The Q's had an outstanding year with over $21 billion of net inflows growing to $215 billion a year round. QQQ product has become the fifth largest ETF globally; its popularity has spurred growth in the rest of our global ETF platform, and laid the groundwork for the launch of the adjacent V generating products such as the Q Innovation Suite. We launched a suite in October 2020. And it has been highly successful growing to $5 billion in assets under management by the end of 2021. We continue to see clients increasing their allocation to alternative strategies as they search for diversification, higher return, and investment to build a broad real \u2013 platform real estate to meet client demands. We are confident our ability to accelerate the growth as we look to the future. In the private real estate business, long term net inflows were $3.4 billion in 2021, comprised of new acquisition activity of $12.4 billion, and investment realizations of $9 billion. Our direct real estate assets under management grew by 12%. Our private credit business, some robust bank loan product demand, resulted in net long term inflows of $7.5 billion for the year, including the launch of several new CLOs. Our active fixed income business remained strong, generating net inflows of $9.3 billion in the fourth quarter, including $7.1 billion from Greater China and $35 billion for the year representing organic growth at 13% over the prior year. Within active global equities, although our $45 billion in developing markets fund so on net outflows in the quarter, the fund generated net long term inflows in 2021 of $20 billion, an improvement of $4.3 billion over 2020. On the institutional side, we finished a strong year with solutions enabled opportunities accounted for 35% of our institutional pipeline. Business in Greater China closed out an exceptional year of growth, with fourth quarter net long term inflows of $9.5 billion. For the year, net long term inflows were $28.7 billion representing organic growth of 32%. Business in China continues to be a source of strength and differentiation, and we expect strong growth in the years ahead. On slide four, we highlight a very strong set of results for 2021. In addition to reporting net long term inflows in 2021, we generated record gross inflows of $427 trillion, a 37% increase compared to 2020. Net revenues grew 17% over the prior year, helping drive adjusted operating income to nearly $2.2 billion, a 31% increase over 2020. Revenue growth coupled with strong expense discipline led to a 450 basis point increase in our net operating margin to 41.5%. In the second half of the year, we reported the second highest net operating margin of the company became U.S. listed in 2007. These factors start with 60% increase in our full year EPS to $3.09. Strength in our businesses generated strong cash flows, improving our cash position to the point where we are resuming our share buybacks. We intend to purchase up to $200 million in common shares during the first quarter. We remain focused on continuing to build a stronger balance sheet and improving our financial flexibility for the future. I'm pleased with the progress we've made over the last year and even more confident that Invesco was on the right path to sustainable organic growth. And as we look to the future, we're determined to continue with delivering consistent organic growth, together with our disciplined approach, expense management should enable us to generate positive operating leverage while at the same time continuing to invest in growth, the growth of our business and the efficiency of our business. I do want to take a moment to thank our employees for the continued resilience, hard work and dedication through this COVID operating environment. Their efforts are delivering the strong results you're seeing from Invesco and breadth of our capabilities in our competitive strength position as well as we look forward. We will continue to focus our efforts on delivering positive outcomes for clients while driving future growth and delivering value over the long run for our stakeholders. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Allison. Allison? Allison Dukes : Thanks, Marty. And good morning, everyone. I'll start with slide five. Our investment performance was strong in the fourth quarter was 64% and 75% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers or beating benchmark on a 5-year and a 10-year basis. These results reflect continued strength in fixed income and foreign equity, most notably emerging markets and Asian equity, all areas where we continue to see demand from clients globally. Turning to slide 6, we ended the year with over $1.6 trillion in AUM, a 19% increase over year end 2020. As Marty noted earlier, our diversified platform generated net loan term inflows in the fourth quarter of $12.5 billion representing a 4.1% annualized organic growth rate. Active AUM net long term inflows were $1.8 billion and passive AUM net long term inflows were $10.7 billion. Net market gains led to an increase in AUM of $18.4 billion in the quarter. The retail channel generated net long term inflows of 3 billion in the quarter driven by inflows into global ETF products and Greater China. Institutional channel demonstrated the breadth of our platform and generated net long term inflows of $9.5 billion in the quarter with diverse mandate, both regionally and by capability funding in the period. Inflows in the Asia Pacific region were particularly strong. Regarding retail net inflows, our ETF capabilities generated net inflows of $21.7 billion. Excluding the QQQ, our net long term inflows were $8.8 billion. As Marty noted, in 2021, our global ETF business generated record net inflows of $62 billion, which was more than 2.5 times net inflows in 2020. Our global ETF platform captured 5.6% of net new flows in 2021 increasing our market share of ETF AUM to 4.9% at the end of 2021. Our share capture of incremental ETF revenues was also above market share at 5.2%, excluding the QQQ. Looking at flows by geography on slide 7, you'll note that the Americas had net long term outflows of $4.3 billion in the quarter. While we saw strength in ETF and our institutional business, we did see pressure from select active equity strategies, including developing markets and diversified dividends. Our bullet share suite also experienced year-end maturity activity, which is expected. Asia Pacific delivered another strong quarter with net long term inflows of $12.9 billion. Net inflows were diversified across the region, including a record $9.7 billion of net long term inflows from our joint venture in China, Invesco Great Wall and $3.2 billion from other countries including Australia, with $1.8 billion in India at $800 million. EMEA excluding the U.K. also delivered a strong quarter of net long term inflows totaling $4.7 billion, representing organic growth of 12%. This was driven by strength in ETF, sales of senior loan products and institutional mandates and investment grade fixed income. From an asset class perspective, we continue to see broad strength in fixed income in the fourth quarter with net long term inflows of $9.1 billion. Drivers of fixed income flows include institutional net flows into various fixed income strategies through our China JV and EMEA, global investment grade, stable value and municipal strategies. Our alternatives asset class holds many different capabilities and this is reflected in the flows we saw on the fourth quarter. Net long term flows and alternatives were $3.1 billion, driven primarily by our private markets business, which included direct real estate property acquisitions, a new newly launched CLO and senior loan capabilities. When excluding global GTR net outflows of $700 million, alternative net long term inflows were $3.8 billion. The strength of our alternative platform can be seen through the flows it has generated over the past four quarters with net long term flows totaling over $17 billion, representing a 10% organic growth rate over this time, excluding the impact of GTR net outflows over the period. Moving to slide 8, our institutional pipeline was $26 billion at year-end. The decline in the pipeline from the prior quarter was due the funding of several significant mandates in the fourth quarter as reflected in our strong institutional inflows for the quarter. While the size of the pipeline will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, it remains consistently strong, typically running in the $25 billion to $35 billion range dating back to 2019. The pipeline also remains relatively consistent to prior quarter levels in terms of fee composition. Overall, the pipeline is diversified across asset classes and geographies. Our solutions capability enabled 35% of the global institutional pipeline in creative wins and customized mandates. This has contributed to meaningful growth across our institutional network. Turning to slide 9, you'll notice that net revenues increased $40 million, or 3% from the third quarter as a result of higher than expected performance fees as well as higher average AUM in the fourth quarter. The net revenue yield ex-performance fee was 33.4 basis points, a decrease of one basis point from the third quarter yield level. The decrease was driven mainly by asset mix shift including higher QQQ and money market average balances. The incremental impact from higher discretionary money market fee waivers was minimal relative to the third quarter and the fullest impact on the net revenue yield for the fourth quarter was six tenths of a basis point. Looking forward, we expect most of the dynamics impacting net revenue yield will continue. In addition, the first quarter contains two fewer days than the fourth quarter which always impacts net revenue yield. Regarding discretionary money market fee waivers given the current process for higher rates in the near term, we anticipate that 75% to 90% of these waivers would cease within the first 60 days to 90 days after the first 25 basis point increase in the Fed funds rate. That would result in a recovery of about four-tenths to five cents [ph] of the negative impact waivers have had on our annualized net revenue yield. Performance fees for the fourth quarter were $53 million, higher than our expectations, and were driven by certain portfolios that have annual absolute return performance hurdles, including approximately $20 million from our JV and China. Given the strong influence of the market on these portfolios, these performance fees are clearly difficult to forecast. Total adjusted operating expenses increased 3.1% in the fourth quarter, the increase was mainly driven by the typical seasonal increase we see in marketing and higher G&A expense, which were partially offset by a decrease in compensation expense. Also impacting marketing and G&A expense was an increase in client events and travel in the fourth quarter before we saw the impact of the new Omicron variant. But the impact of the new variant we have seen a slowdown of travel and in-person client activity in January, we would not expect first quarter activity to be as high as fourth quarter. G&A expense in the fourth quarter also included a non-recurring $10 million charitable contribution to the Invesco Foundation. The Invesco foundation exists to support our communities and further progress and pillars of education and financial literacy. We're pleased to have the ability to make this contribution at the conclusion of a very strong year. As we look ahead to the first quarter of 2022 consistent with prior years, we expect an increase in compensation expenses related to the seasonal increase in payroll taxes and the reset of other benefits, such as our 401k plan match. Typically, this is about $25 million to $30 million higher in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter. As noted, one area that's still more difficult to forecast at this point is when COVID impacted travel and entertainment expense levels will begin to normalize. Moving to slide 10, we update you on the progress we have made with our strategic evaluation. In the fourth quarter, we realized $5 million in savings. $4 million of the savings was related to compensation expense, reflecting the plan transition a certain roles in concert with our strategic review, and a million dollars related to a reduction in property expense as we continue to right size our facilities portfolio. The $5 million in cost savings are $19 million annualized, combined with $148 million in annual life savings realized through the third quarter in 2021 brings us to $167 million in total, or 84% of our $200 million net savings expectation. As it relates to timing, the remainder of our net savings will be realized by the end of 2022 as planned. The expected total program savings of $200 million through 2022 would be roughly 65% from compensation and 35% spread across property, property office technology and G&A expense. In the fourth quarter, we incurred $32 million of restructuring costs related to the initiative. In total, we recognize nearly 220 million of our estimated 250 million to 275 million in restructuring costs associated with the program. We expect the remaining restructuring costs for the realization of this program to be in the range of $30 million to $55 million in 2022. As a reminder, the costs associated with the strategic evaluation are not reflected in our non-GAAP results. Going to slide 11, adjusted operating income improved $16 million to $578 million for the quarter, driven by the factors we have reviewed. Adjusted operating margin was relatively stable at 42%. Excluding the non-recurring contribution to the foundation, we generated positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter. For the year the degree of positive operating leverage was 1.8 times underscoring, our focus on driving scale and profitability across the company's diversified platform. Non-operating income was $51 million, driven primarily by recognition of gains from funds that are in liquidation. The effective tax rate was 21.9% in the fourth quarter, compared to 24.4% in the third quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in the valuation allowance recorded against net operating losses and a decrease in the expense for unpaid tax positions in the fourth quarter. We estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 24% for the first quarter of 2022. The actual effective tax rate may vary from this estimate due to the impact of non-recurring items on pretax income and discrete tax items. Slide 12, illustrates our ability to drive adjusted operating margin improvement against the backdrop of the clients demand driven change in our AUM mix and the resulting impact on our net revenue yield excluding performance fees. We also illustrate the impact of the exceptional growth of our QQQ product which does not earn a management fee has had on our net revenue yield. Our operating margin two years ago in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 39.9%. At that time, we reported a net revenue yield of 40.5 basis points. In the fourth quarter of 2021, our net revenue yield declined a little over seven basis points to 33.4, yet our operating margin improved to 42%. As Marty noted earlier, the operating margins we have generated in the third and fourth quarters of 2021 are the highest since Invesco became a U.S. listed company in 2007. This is against the backdrop of a mixed driven declining net revenue yield. We have been building out our product suite to meet client demand and client demand has been skewed towards lower fee products including the highly successful QQQ product. Growth of the QQQ product over this period is remarkable growing from 7% of our AUM mix in the fourth quarter of 2019 to 13% in the fourth quarter of 2021. Even though we do not earn a management fee as sponsor of the QQQ, we manage the over $100 million annual marketing budget generated by this product. Growth in the QQQ accounts for two basis points of the net revenue yield decline over this period shown on this chart. And as I noted earlier, discretionary money market fee waivers account for six tenths of a basis point decline in the net revenue yield. The combination of the extraordinary growth in the QQQ combined with a temporary drag for money market fee waivers account for over one third of the decline in net revenue yield over this time period. Realizing our business mix is shifting, we continue to focus on aligning our expense base with these changes. This has enabled the firm to generate positive operating leverage and operating margin improvements, despite the decline in the net revenue. Now turning to slide 13, a few comments here, our balance sheet cash position was $1.9 million on December 31st and approximately $725 million of this cash is held for regulatory requirements. The cash position has improved meaningfully over the past year, increasing by nearly $500 million. We were able to drive improvement in our cash position, while also funding the resolution of the remaining contingent liabilities in 2021. These included $294 million in forward repurchase liabilities that we funded earlier in the year and the $254 million in fund shareholder reimbursements to complete the remediation of the MLP matter in the fourth quarter. We also received an insurance recovery of $100 million related to that matter in the fourth quarter. Our debt profile has improved considerably as well. As a result, we substantially improved our leverage position that the leverage ratio as defined under our credit facility agreements as 0.79 times at year end, as compared to 1.37 times a year ago. If you choose to include the preferred stock, leverage is declined from almost four times to 2.47 times. With respect to our capital strategy, we are committed to a sustainable dividend and to returning capital to shareholders through a combination of modestly increasing dividends and share repurchases. As we stated, we intend to build towards a 30% to 50% total payout ratio of the next over the next several years by steadily increasing our dividends and resuming a share buyback program. As Marty noted earlier, given our strong and growing cash position combined with continued opportunity in our valuation, we expect to repurchase $200 million in common shares during the first quarter. Overall, we believe we're making solid progress in our efforts to improve liquidity and build financial flexibility and our 2021 results demonstrate that progress. In summary, 2021 was a very strong year for Invesco. We remain focused on executing the strategy that aligns with our key areas of focus, and we continue to invest ahead of client demand in these areas. At the same time, we're focused on optimizing our organizational model and disciplined expense management. This approach has resulted in strong organic growth, driving positive operating leverage and operating margin improvement. This has also facilitated stronger cash flows, further strengthening our balance sheet and driving the improvement in our leverage profile. As we look towards the future, investors are in a very strong position to deliver value over the long run to all of our stakeholders. And with that operator, I'd ask you to open up the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just was curious, Allison, thanks for all that color on the expenses and whatnot, but if we think about the 2022 is not really off just to a great start here in the equity markets. So if we think about where we stand here year-to-date, do you have any sense about what kind of impact that could have on net revenue yield? And how -- what kind of position are you in to maintain the operating margin level, even if we see adverse equity market conditions? Thanks. Allison Dukes : Get, doesn't help either. But even in rising markets, as we continue to see really strong demand for our passive capabilities, and I think that's evidenced by some of the organic growth rates we just walked through. And we continue to see real pressure on the overall net revenue yield. And if I look at net revenue yield of our active AUM, it's actually held up pretty nicely over the last year or two years. And it's really that strong demand for our passive AUM that's creating this pressure. And so we do expect there to continue to be downward pressure on the revenue yield overall, as we continue to see that demand and the shift of our business mix. And hopefully some of the detail and the color we provided on the, the pressure that we also see just from money market fee waivers and the Q's, one of which is temporary, and maybe an opportunity if we do see rates increase over the course of this year. As it relates to then what does that mean for our operating margin? What Yes, the volatility we're experiencing so far in January, and it does put pressure on it. I mean it will require us to be incredibly disciplined from an expense management standpoint. I think we've made terrific progress. When I look at 450 basis points of operating margin improvement year-over-year, and we've got ourselves to a new a new place, a new position that we can operate within, and it might not be as high as what we experienced in the last quarter or two. But I don't think we do get anywhere near back to where we were a couple of years ago. And we're being very disciplined and very thoughtful about that exact issue, as we look at the -- our budget for the year and how we think about a pretty significant expense base. Brennan Hawken : Yes, now that the progress on the profitability has been in really, really great. So agree on that. Then shifting gears a bit to the follow up, there's the $200 million buyback you announced for the first quarter. But as you flagged there was $100 million insurance settlement. So when we, if we're thinking about calibrating to the run rate, if we, if we shift to your comments around the payout, it would suggest that the 1Q probably has a little bit of excess from that insurance recovery. And so backing that out is probably the right way to think about, it seems like the right way to think about a run rate. Is that fair? And is that the potential for more insurance recoveries behind this one? Or is that this 100 million, probably the end that we should expect? Thanks. Allison Dukes : Yes, so a couple things to point out. That $100 million recovery is actually an -- our non-GAAP results and our transaction, integration expense. So it really doesn't in our adjusted net income, you don't see it there. So it's, it's really not a factor. I do think it's important to note the resolution of that MLP matter and that it was fully resolved in the fourth quarter with the $254 million getting that liability behind us is really terrific progress after a couple of years. So I don't want that to go unnoticed because we've really cleared out all these contingent liabilities. But the $100 million recovery against that somebody irrelevant to our payout ratio targets a 30% to 50%. Brennan Hawken : No, I just meant in the $200 million balance, there was clearly some extra capital that you now received. Did that support the 200 million pace [ph] in the first quarter. That's all I meant by that not the payout ratio. Allison Dukes : Fair enough. Look at that the $1.9 billion cash balance. And so I would think about it from a cast perspective, and the fact that our cash did grow about $500 million over the year after resolution of all of this contingent liabilities $100 million insurance recovery with a positive there. It does somewhat factor into the timing of moving forward with this in the first quarter, and also our valuation and these rather attractive prices factor into the timing as well, if not now, when is in our thinking as well. Brennan Hawken : Yes, that's fair enough. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brian Bedell : Great, thanks. Good morning, folks. Again, thanks for the call outs on expenses. Just want to come back to the operating margin. And in the context of the Great Wall JV obviously, seeing really good success, they're continuing on the organic growth side, do you view that as the more scalable part of the model. And if you continue to have this type of success there, that that could be a positive contributor to the operating margin dynamic. Marty Flanagan : Yes, absolutely. I mean, as we said before, if you take a macro picture, the opportunity in China for asset managers is phenomenal. It's in, you pick your estimate out there, but there's various assessments of if you\u2019d look at the next three to five years, 50% of the organic growth in inflows could be coming from China. So being very, very strong in China is an enormous opportunity. And it's very scalable. And so we continue to anticipate continued strength of the business, and we think we're, it's a very, very strong position that we have there. And like just big enough that strength is really follow. Brian Bedell : Thanks for the color. And then maybe it's an organic growth, if you can get some color on traction in sustainable product ESG products on both the active and ETF side, and where you stand in terms of integrating ESG across the investment process. That's completely done now, and then just is that helping or do you expect that to help inflows in Europe? Both, I guess, on the institutional side, and also, your traction and gaining ETF share in Europe on that painful [ph] side as well? Marty Flanagan : Yes, let me make a couple of comments. And I was going to chime in too. So right now, if you look at our assets under management it\u2019s now 96% of our assets under management, or ESG, that's up this quarter, almost $45 million, and where they're going there, it was converted 69 funds of $45 billion to Article eight, in the fourth quarter. And let's stay on Europe for a second. ESG is as fundamental to any money managers success there. And whether it's retail or institutional, you really have to have ESG integration at a minimum, that's really our effort with Article eight, and you're going to continue to see that. So it's not just a business opportunity, its business imperative. In the U.K., and I'm going to comment right now, and it's lingering through the rest of the world. Our commitment is to have ESG integration across all of our investment teams. Right now we are 75%. So we've made very good progress. And, again, from my perspective, you're going to be out, three years out, you're really not going to probably be talking about ESG as sort of a separate category. The integration piece at least, seeing the ability could be in the light, but it's just a reality of money management right now. Allison Dukes : Let me just clean up one thing. It's not 96% of our AUM, it's $96 billion, our AUM would be ESG qualified. And as Marty said, 75% of our funds are now what we would consider kind of minimal but systematic ESG integration. Brian Bedell : Great. And then just deployed in the fourth quarter on sustainable product. Allison Dukes : Flows. There we had modest outflows in the fourth quarter, continue to see a little bit of pressure there. A lot of our ESG capabilities are somewhat I think somatic in nature as we continue to build them out. And so they could come in and out of favor, definitely continuing to see demand overall in terms of institutional mandates for these ESG capabilities, but flows, I would say were relatively soft on this flattish in the quarter. And one thing I would note in particular as we see some outflows are related to our GTR capabilities. We've talked about GTR, quite a bit. GTR was about $800 million of outflows that also contributes to what we would consider ESG outflows as well. So, there are places where we see positive flows. There are other places of pressure for very specific reasons. But overall, continue to see this as just an important component of our portfolio. And I think as Marty said, in a few years, we don't think we'll really be talking about ESG as its own separate kind of category, but rather a standard that we hold ourselves to across the board. Brian Bedell : Yes, that's great color. Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open. Glenn Schorr : Hello there, one of the first follow up on Greater China, if I could. You talked about the six new funds factoring two and a half billion in long term flows 7.2 from existing products on a base of 106 billion ending the quarter that's a really high growth rate as some of that is ramping. So I know you talked about the big opportunity. But maybe we can talk about, the next two years 2022 and 2023. On -- are there new products in the pipeline, and how box in this growth rate is probably not sustainable, but could be in in, in the early years as new funds are ramping, so let\u2019s talk about how product is moving. Thanks. Marty Flanagan : Yes, a couple of comments and Allison will chime in also. So look the year-over-year organic growth it was 32%. I mean, it's quite phenomenal. And if you look back, we've really maintained that over the last three years. And it's just say it's decades later, overnight success. So a number of things have come together. And we anticipate strong growth in the next year, two years, recognizing every market will have its volatile moments. What we are seeing last year is a very, very strong launches at the beginning of your new product. And as you're talking about some of the more recent ones. We are starting to see greater flows into existing products too. So there'll be I think that would be a sign of a market developing where you get ongoing flows into existing products as opposed to sort of a constant launch, but it'll be both as we look forward. So we're anticipating continued strong growth in China, both at a retail level and institutional level as we look forward. Allison Dukes : One thing I'd add to that is I do think in the very near term, China is experiencing some pretty new dynamics with COVID that they have not experienced in the last couple of years, while they've been in a bit of a locked in state, and they've been operating normally within the region. But now with case counts increasing, if you've extended much softening of that domestically there, and we're seeing that a little bit as we go into the Chinese New Year here soon. So I say, it's uncertain what impact some of the measures will have on just sentiment overall within the region. As a counterpoint to that, however, where we see real strength and continued demand in our capabilities within our JV is specifically for our fixed income and our balance products. And so as we continue to see, perhaps, a flight to safety and some conservatism, if we see some softening of sentiment, we were very well positioned with our capabilities through our JV. And we're seeing that so far this year. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate that. That\u2019s a perfect really to the follow up, I was curious and you alluded to the market drops so far during the volatility, it's always it's a couple of weeks. But just curious if you give us insight into both institutional client behavior as the markets get a little wacky here. Allison Dukes : I think we try to stay away from real flow updates enter quarter, but I will, or in for months. I will say this, I think you could see with some of the publicly available data that with what we can control in terms of sales and redemption rates and the like, we feel very good about where we are so far in the year. And one of the benefits of having a very broad and diversified platform is we have that breadth of capabilities as people look to rebalance and shift some of their allocations we\u2019re able to capture a lot of the flows even in a risk-off environment. At the same time, there's a lot of pressure in the market and a significant amount of volatility, as we all experienced yesterday, in particular, and I think the next couple of days, with the Fed meeting, and the minutes coming out of that are going to be quite informative as well. And so with what we can control, we feel very good about it. And I say, the conversations with clients continue to be very constructive and very positive and we're where we need to be. But this is an interesting market. Glenn Schorr : Appreciate that. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America Securities. Your line is open. Craig Siegenthaler : Good morning, Marty, Allison, hope you're both doing well. And congrats on the 7% organic growth this past year. Allison Dukes : Thanks, Craig. Craig Siegenthaler : So I'm sorry about this. But I have another one on China. And I just wanted update on your effort to increase your equity stake in the joint venture, because I don't think you've done that yet. But you're, you're working on that. And then also you previously disclosed as the percentage of flows that come from digital platforms, like and financial, I think it was trending around 50%, before 4Q. So I don't know if you have an update on that number either. Marty Flanagan : Yes. And hope you are doing too, and hope you had a good New Year. So just on the -- we continue to be in dialogue with our joint venture partner to increase our stake over 50%. So a positive conversation, we've not accomplished that. That said, I'll come back to the most important element is that which differentiates us even though we have 49% of the ownership, we have management control. And we have had since the beginning, and that is really what has allowed us to be so effective and successful in China. So that's the main point to look at. But we do feel in time that we will be able to end up a majority stake in our joint venture. It is not impeding progress at all. Secondly, with regards to digital platforms, they continue to be really very, very important part of the market dynamic there. And the number really hasn't changed. It's still about 50%. But again, it's a very strong part of the future success that we'll see in China. Craig Siegenthaler : And then just for my follow up on the private REIT business, you have the U.S. business and then you have the global distribution partnership with UBS. It looked like the U.S. vehicle only raised about 16 million through month end November. And I don't have the December number yet but I was wondering if you could update us on the progress of those two products and any kind of flow or AUM detail. Marty Flanagan : Yes, I'll make a couple of points. Just the -- we're still in the process of onboarding various institutions and I don't want to get too specific but it is now being on board in the United States and it will probably take you into the second quarter of this year before we would get to a level where we feel that it's sufficiently boarded at the various places that you would hope it would be. But again it's an area of great opportunity for us. And the recessions been very, very strong. It's just literally, the, the due diligence process of working through those types of things. Craig Siegenthaler : Thank you, Marty. Marty Flanagan : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Lee with KBW. Your line is open. Hi, Robert, please hit your mute button. Robert Lee : Sorry about that. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. And Happy belated New Year to everyone. Hope you're both doing well. There may be my first question, like to just go back to maybe begin to flows a little bit. So I mean, obviously, even strong organic flow growth for the year. I mean, that's great. But you may be begin a little bit since there was such a focus on fee realization rates and whatnot, help us better, maybe get a sense of the economic impact of the inflows. I mean, I don't know if you have, for example, the net revenue, net organic revenue or EBITDA growth, maybe that'd be a better metric, anything that can help us get a better sense of the economic impact you're seeing from inflows? This will be my first question. Allison Dukes : We don't disclose it in that way. And the way that I think where you're going. I mean, I'd point to a couple of things, which is with the strong organic growth rate and we're generating positive organic revenue throughout the year on the flows. There are points of strengths and points of, challenges against that. And as I noted, the active and that revenue yield inside of our active capabilities is actually held up pretty strong, it's barely moved in the last couple of years. And it's really just the challenges we have there with just the demand is not as strong as it is for our passive capabilities. And so what I would point you to is, and I, we've talked about this a few times as well, in our passive capabilities and our ETFs in particular, I'll point that out. Our operating margin that we generate from that is, consistent whether a little better than the firm average operating margin, it takes a higher volume, that's more of a scale play for us. And so as we continue to really see the positive demand for those capabilities, we are able to not only generate positive organic revenue growth, but also really contribute both operating absolute operating margin and absolute operating profit and sustain our operating margins at the same time. Robert Lee : Great, thank you. And maybe as a follow up, going back to expenses I mean, can you just remind us, as you were given a difficult start to the year, with the market so far, can you just remind us kind of how much flex or variability you feel like you may have in the expense basis, that may be linked to, whether it's pre-tax, operating income or asset levels or flows, just trying to get a sense of what's kind of a natural built in Flexi could have to respond to more difficult revenue to start the year. Allison Dukes : Sure. A couple of things one, about a third of our expense base is variable in nature. And so we would expect that to flex up with stronger revenue and flex down if we don't see it. And so, that's point one and the two thirds of our expenses, and that is more fixed in nature. That's really some of where we continue to look at our expense discipline, and where we can look at opportunities to unlock costs, and some cases allowing that to fall to the bottom line and other cases, reinvesting it in places where we think it can be more productive for us. And so we do feel like we have continued opportunity there. We've made good progress on our strategic review, as we've talked about, where the 267 million, they're still got a little ways to go. Our real estate properties portfolio is a place where we continue to make progress and we continue to look. And that's an element of a fixed expense that we continue to evaluate in an operating environment. But not only is it different than it was a couple of years ago, it continues to evolve. And we're being responsive to that as is everybody else right now, and really looking at how do we continue to unlock some of the fixed costs there. Robert Lee : Great, thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. Just a follow up, one more for you on expenses. As we think about the sequential change from 4Q to 1Q, and you highlight it as normal seasonal stuff, but curious about this past fourth quarter, where you had elevated performances, what we should normalize for compensation within that, and then the other maybe one time or items to think about the kind of 1Q to I\u2019m sorry 4Q to 1Q effects kind of the market impact. Allison Dukes : Yes. Compensation expense maybe to speak to it sort of broadly, it tends to run somewhere between 38% and 42% of our revenues. If you just look at that on an annualized basis, that's been the range in which we've operated for quite some time. And 2021, it was 38%. So it's on the low end of that range, which is what you would expect in a really strong year. And so I think that is still a very reasonable range to be thinking about, as you think about just our overall compensation expense, regardless of revenue, whether it's coming from, from performance fees or management fees, that that range is the right range to think about. Looking towards expenses in the first quarter overall, I would say a couple of things. Look, marketing tends to be seasonally high in the fourth quarter, you certainly saw that in the fourth quarter of this year, we've got the $25 million to $30 million increase that is the seasonality and compensation expense. And the other point that we're trying to get our own arms around is we did start to see something that looked like a return to normal in the fourth quarter and the Omicron variant really didn't impact in person activity and travel until we were almost on the holidays. And so we were pretty active, right? So that and then things changed, just as the holidays would have brought a natural sort of closure to things for a few weeks. And we obviously haven't seen any traveler engagement really pick back up just yet. I do think we'll start to see some return of that later in February. We're certainly hopeful. And, I think that's an area that we hope continues to grow throughout the year. We've said that now for a while, and we just haven't seen it. But fourth quarter was the first time we started to feel like it was close to normal. So hard to guide as to whether or not we as to when we see the pickup, but I do expect it comes down a bit in the first quarter relative the fourth quarter. Dan Fannon : That's helpful. And then just looking at slide 12, I mean appreciating obviously, the what you've been highlighting around the margin expansion versus to see, mix shift that's happening, but if we flat markets assume for the next couple of years, and the trends hold is margin expansion for you still part of the story, or we think about that more maintaining and without markets as you have this mix shift that's ongoing. Allison Dukes : So sorry, as I was flipping to slide 12, you're asking if markets hold so they level for the markets hold is operating margin expansion, a possibility? Was that your question? Dan Fannon : With the same underlying mix shift and flows? Yes. So just markets out? Allison Dukes : Yes, I'd say it is the -- I would be thinking about flat-to-modest expansion in a market where an environment where markets hold, and we continue to see this mix shift. The question is really just the pace of the mix shift. If it's, if it's quite fast that we're looking at flat, if it continues at the pace we've seen, we could get some modest expansion out of that. We said before, we don't intend to run our business with an ever increasing operating margin. And I'll reiterate that. And we do feel like we're in a pretty nice operating range, we would be happy to see it, improve some, but we're not going to start the business in order to allow it to grow. We've got some key investments, we want to continue to make ahead of where we see demand. And so, I think that in a flat markets with real mix shift could get us to a flat operating margin. Marty Flanagan : Yes, and I do just want to reiterate that, it's really important for us to continue to invest in the business. And we're going to continue to do with along the way that we've been have you continue to look at areas of opportunity and look at our expense base, can we reallocate and invest, and it's going to be in those areas of clients demand where there's growth, that's going to continue to be ETFs factors, private markets, etcetera, and also the investment of technology that we need to do. So it's, it's a really, really competitive marketplace. And one of the things that's really important is, as we drive results for shareholders, we're also investing in the business for shareholders and for clients. And that's really what was reflected in the results that we had this year. And, again we're going to very much stay focused on that path as we go forward. Dan Fannon : Thank you Allison Dukes : Operator, do we have any other questions? Operator : Yes. Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning. Marty, I wanted to step back and think, bigger picture. It's a new year. So maybe first Happy New Year. Invesco had a great year in 2021. But as we look at the stock price over a longer period of time, the stock price is at about the same level as it was a decade ago. And it seems like Invesco has executed well, on a value creation roadmap that resulted in size and scale in better positioning, but one that hasn't really been reflected in shareholder value creation as measured by the stock price. So you have an activist investor that continues to build a position in the company. I guess, are you thinking about things differently in terms of how you're approaching shareholder value creation, when you're making investment and capital allocation decisions? And as you think about driving improved results for shareholders, what is sort of top of mind for you, as you think about you know, 2022 and beyond? Marty Flanagan : Yes, look, it's a great question. And that doesn't go beyond this either. And I think what's really important is get the result that you're talking about share price. From our perspective, you really have to deliver results for clients, and you have to do it a very thoughtful and meaningful way and ensuring that we're hitting with all the constituents need. And I think again, you just look at where the business has evolved, we think we've evolved it very strongly to meet those needs. And it's been reflected in the operating results. And so our perspective is continue to be very focused on that, and also not just clients, but with shareholders in mind. And in time, this share price should reflect that. Just today, as we talked about looking to buy back our stock, we think it's a very, very attractive for all the reasons that you've laid out. Allison Dukes : I mean, I would only add to the valuations frustrating to us. And so what we focus on is what we can control and where we can influence. I think as Marty said, really making sure we're delivering for clients and building out our capabilities so that we are capturing client demand, the 2021 results would point to our success, and that's one of the highest growth rates in the industry. And we're certainly winning vis-\u00e0-vis the competition there. We also made meaningful progress with 450 basis point improvements in our operating leverage. I mean it was important, we had some work to do there. And we needed to get ourselves back into the right operating range. And there was a lot of hard work that went into that. And we feel very good about the work that we've done there. And that falls to the bottom line. And then the balance sheet needed some work. And we've made tremendous progress in strengthening the balance sheet and continue to work on that and put ourselves in a position to do further work on the balance sheet as the year unfolds. And so as we look at, what should influence that return to shareholders, we think we're making real progress against each one of those. And it's not a quarter-to-quarter game, and it's a long term game. And we're going to stick to this plan, because we think it's actually really yielding the results that investors are looking for, and certainly has the support of our board as well. Ken Worthington : Well, I know it's a tough question, but it's great to hear your comments. Thank you again. Marty Flanagan : I'm glad you asked. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Patrick Davitt : Hey, good morning everyone. A quick follow up on Brennan's re-purchase question, eyeballing it looks like the 200 million in 1Q would already get you to the 35% to 50% payout. So should we assume that's more of a one-off or when we're modeling this or assume a resumption of more regular repurchases in every quarter beyond that? Allison Dukes : Hard to say this yet, you're right, that does get us into that range. And we did feel like the timing was right to actually move further aggressively on it for all the reasons that we talked about earlier, and feel good about that. Whether or not we will continue to do more as the year unfolds, I think we'll just have to address that as the year unfolds and results will dictate that. Patrick Davitt : Alright, fair enough. And then mass mutual recently announced a new reinsurance platform with Centerbridge and bearings, acting as the asset managers, just curious how you think that news fits with your relationship with them? And does it change your thinking on the opportunity for managing more of their assets at all? Marty Flanagan : No, it does not. And as I said, it's a very strong relationship, obviously, to board members on our board, they own 60% of the company. They've been very helpful and supporting our alternative business, they'll continue to do that. We couldn't be more aligned, and it's a very strong relationship. Patrick Davitt : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Katz with Citigroup. Your line is open. Bill Katz : Okay, thank you very much for taking the question this morning. So Marty, I think you've mentioned that you hope to deliver some operating leverage going fully VAG spend in your opening remarks. And then Allison maybe sort of qualified that. You're not here with infinite margin improvements. So as we look into maybe 2023, can you unpack maybe your gross spending rate and then the net spending rate, just kind of see as you get to the final part of your $20 million realization, how we should be thinking about the core expense growth into 2023 as I appreciate we\u2019re sitting here in January 22? Of course. Allison Dukes : Yes, I can go ahead and tell you, we're not going to give guidance into 23. I think, yes, we've tried to give some color as to what we expect in the first quarter and the operating margin within which we intend to operate. Marty Flanagan : Yes, and Bill I think you're asking a question was connected to some of the other questions that were asked. You're trying to do many things here, right? You're trying to invest for the future and be competitive to drive results for clients and ultimately, shareholders. And we think we've done that, right. If you look at the business today, look at where it was five years ago, is a very attractive business invested in China, ETFs, private markets, etcetera. That just was not where Invesco was five years ago, 10 years ago. And at the same time, we talked about the margin expansion year-over-year. With that expansion, we've also been able to invest in the business to improve our competitive positioning. So you're really trying to do any number of things all at once, and we're showing that we can do that. Bill Katz : Okay, thank you. And then just one last one for me. Thanks for taking both of them. So a couple of your competitors have been spending pretty aggressively to build out their platforms, particularly alts [ph] bucket. I think you guys are probably a little bit further along strategically. But how do you think about M&A from here? I know you certainly gave us some guidance around terms of capital term. But how does M&A incrementally fit into discussion from here? Marty Flanagan : Yes, you're going to get tired with the answer cause it could be the same one. But look, we look at business very strategically. And we look at where client demand is coming from, and can we meet our client\u2019s needs, and we're always going to look internally first, to develop what we can. And when we come up short there, that's when we'll start to look to the market. And it has to be a capability that there is client demand for it. It's, additive to our capability sets. And it's something that we think also can fit very nicely within the business from a cultural point of view. So, again, our first focus is internally, but we will continue to pay attention to the market when it makes sense. Bill Katz : Thank you. Marty Flanagan : Thanks, Bill. Operator : Our last question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Michael Cyprys : Hey, Marty, Allison, thanks for squeezing in here. Just want to circle back on expenses. You mentioned one third of the expense base is variable about two thirds fixed or so I guess where would you like to see that mix over time? And how do you see that evolving? And when you think about the margin, more medium to longer term, where do you see that operating margin is it mid 40s? Achievable? Does that make sense for the business? Have you think about that? Allison Dukes : In terms of the variable set mix, I think it's, it's actually probably accurate where it is. And I don't necessarily see it evolving to be terribly more variable over time. So, I think one things we focus on quite a bit is driving scale over that fixed expense cost is actually where we deliver that operating margin growth. And in terms of where we could be, look 450 basis points of improvement one year was pretty extraordinary. I don't expect to replicate that year, after year after year. We had work to do to get it back and to the range where we are. The strategic review that we have been in it's not easy, but looking at those opportunities that gave us, we gave us the chance to look at a lot of good opportunities that made sense for us. In terms of where could you be, could you beat mid 40s overtimes? That's a longer term comment. I couldn't tell you by when or how. And certainly we need some very supportive market dynamics behind that as well. So I'll never say never. But I can tell you, it certainly won't be in 2022, probably not in 2023 because we really are focused on investing in the business. And getting to a margin of that level in the next couple of years would require us to do things as I think Marty noted a few times that just really aren't tenable because it would not position us well in terms of investments that we need to build the platform for the future. And so, I think in the short term, the low 40s is a really good operating range for us to be in. Michael Cyprys : Great, I'll leave it there. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks so much for taking the question. Allison Dukes : Sure, thank you. That was our operator. I think that brings us to the end. Operator : Yes. Thank you for your participation today. You may disconnect at this time. Marty Flanagan : Thank you very much.",

To allow more participants to ask questions, only one question and a follow-up can be submitted per participant. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to your speakers for today, Marty Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco; and Allison Dukes, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Flanagan, you may begin. Marty Flanagan : Thank you very much, Operator, and thanks, everybody, for joining us. And as typically what we do, I will hit some of the highlights, Allison will give more details of the results and then we will open up to Q&A. So I am going to start on slide three, if you happen to be following along with the deck. Solid business momentum continued during the first three months of the year. We did have net term -- long-term inflows of $17.2 billion in the first quarter. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of net long-term inflows and our annualized organic growth rate in the quarter was 6%, despite the market backdrop we are all experiencing. This is a key outcome of the broadly diversified set of capabilities we go through the past decade and in this volatile market environment, we continue to be extremely focused on our clients and the strength and diversification of our business enabled us to continue anticipating in meeting their evolving needs. In the first quarter, we continue to see strong demand for our key capability areas in particular ETFs and Fixed Income. We maintain our focus on -- an investment in several key areas including ETFs, fixed income, Factor, Index, Private Markets, Active Global Equity, Greater China and Solutions. These purchase help us generate consistent, strong and broad organic growth rate, and we ended the quarter with $1.6 trillion in assets under management. Looking at our specific capabilities, our global ETF platform closed out a very strong quarter. ETFs generated net inflows of $19 billion in the first quarter. This includes the flagship QQQ product. We did increase market share in both Egypt assets under management and revenues and Allison is going to spend a few minutes today going more depth into the ETF platform. We continue to see clients increasing their allocation to alternative strategies as they search for diversification and higher returns and Invesco has build a broad and competitive platform across real estate and private credit to meet these clients demand needs. We are confident in our ability to accelerate growth in these capabilities in private real estate. Net long-term inflows were $300 million in the first quarter. This comprised of new acquisition activities of $2.1 billion and investment realizations of $1.8 billion. In our Private Credit business, robust bank loan product demand resulted in net long-term inflows of $3.1 billion, including the launch of two new CLOs. Our Active Fixed Income business remained strong, generating long-term net inflows of $2.5 billion in the first quarter, including $2.2 billion from Greater China. Our Active Global Equity business, our flagship products including Invesco Developing Markets Fund did see net long-term outflows of $1.5 billion due to the impact of the geopolitical environment that we are experiencing. On the institutional side, our solutions-enabled opportunities accounted for 30% of our institutional pipeline at the end of the quarter. Within Greater China, our JV had net long-term inflows of $3.2 billion in the quarter and our business in China continues to be a source of strength and diversification and we expect continued strong growth in the year -- years ahead, while recognizing the near-term headwinds in China. But the momentum in our businesses generated strong cash flows, improving our cash position to the point where there is some share buybacks in the first quarter, buying back $200 million in common shares during the quarter. Our focus on building a strong balance sheet and improving our financial flexibility put us in a position to take advantage of an economically attractive opportunity to redeem $600 million in debt that matures in November, which will now be redeemed in early May. Given the strong momentum in growth in our business, the Board has also approved a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend and as we look forward we will determine the magnitude first, excuse me, delivering consistent organic growth, together with our disciplined approach to expense management, which should enable us to generate attractive operating margins over the long-term, while at the same time, allowing us to continue investing in growth and the efficiency of our global business. Invesco\u2019s position as an investor and client led firm differentiates us in the marketplace, combined with the depth and breadth of our capabilities, our competitive strength we are well positioned to win in a dynamic operating environment. We continue to focus our efforts on delivering positive outcomes for clients, while driving future growth and delivering value over the long-term for our stakeholders. With that, I will turn it over to Allison. Allison? Allison Dukes : Thank you, Marty, and good morning, everyone. I will start with slide four. Our investment performance continue to be solid in the first quarter, with 59% and 68% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers or beating benchmark on a five-year and a 10-year basis. These results reflect continued strength in Fixed Income, Balanced Products and Asian Equities, all areas where we continue to see demand from clients globally. Moving to slide five, we ended the quarter with $1.6 trillion in AUM, a decrease of $55 billion from December 31st. As Marty noted earlier, our diversified platform generated net long-term inflows in the first quarter of $17.2 billion, representing nearly 6% annualized organic growth. Active AUM net long-term inflows were $800 million and passive AUM net long-term inflows were $16.4 billion. Despite the inflows, market declines and FX rate changes lead to a decrease in AUM of $85 billion in the quarter. The retail channel generated net long-term inflows of $10.4 billion in the first quarter, driven by inflows in the global ETF products. The institutional channel demonstrated the breadth of our platform and generated net long-term inflows of $6.8 billion, with diverse mandates both regionally and by capability funding in the period. Regarding retail net inflows, our ETF capabilities generated net inflows of $19.2 billion. Excluding the QQQ, our net long-term inflows were $18.7 billion. I will provide a little more commentary on our global ETF platform on the next several slides, but before I do, let me take a moment and touch on flows by both geography and asset class on slide six. You will note that the Americas had net long-term inflows of $7.9 billion in the quarter. While we saw strength in ETFs and our institutional business, we did see pressure from select active equity strategies, including developing markets and the diversified dividend funds. Asia-Pacific saw net long-term inflows of $5.6 billion, representing organic growth of 11%. Net inflows were diversified across the region and included $3.2 billion of net long-term inflows from Invesco Great Wall, our joint venture in China. EMEA, excluding the U.K., also delivered a strong quarter of net long-term inflows, totaling $5.9 billion, representing organic growth of 16%. This was driven by strength in ETFs and sales of senior loan products. From an asset class perspective, we continue to see broad strength in Fixed Income in the first quarter with net long-term inflows of $4.8 billion. Drivers of Fixed Income flows include institutional net flows into various Fixed Income strategies through our China JV, global investment grade, stable value and various Fixed Income ETF strategies. Our alternative asset class holds many different capabilities and this is reflected in the strong flows we saw in the first quarter. Net long-term inflows and alternatives were $7.6 billion, representing organic growth of 15% and was driven primarily by our Private Credit business. This included two newly launched CLOs and net long-term inflows into our senior loan capabilities. In addition, we saw net inflows into commodity ETF in both the Americas and EMEA. When excluding global GTR net outflows of $1.6 billion alternative, net long-term inflows were over $9 billion. Strength of our alternative platform can be seen through the flows that is generated over the past five quarters, with net long-term inflows totaling nearly $27 billion, representing a 12% organic growth rate over this time, when excluding the impact of the GTR net outflows. Now, moving to slide seven, as Marty noted earlier, given the strong growth in our ETF and other Index capabilities, we wanted to provide a little more detail -- a more detailed view on the business. With over 15 years of experience managing Indexed assets and a team of seasoned ETF professionals in different strategic regions, Invesco\u2019s Index business has always differentiated itself, due to the innovative and value-added nature of our products. Examples of this include first-to-market types of products, like the Invesco Senior Loan ETF, distinctive families of ETF, like the low volatility suite, the bullet-share ETFs and our diversified range of commodity pool. We created the fast growing QQQ Innovation Suite just a little over one year ago and it has grown to $5.4 billion at the end of the first quarter. We managed $528 billion in ETFs and other Index capabilities. The platform is diversified in terms of strategies, asset classes and client geographies. Over the last 12 months, net inflows into ETFs and other Index capabilities were $87 billion, a 21% growth rate. Net inflows into Global ETFs over this period were $66 billion, which is a growth rate of 17% and new fees from these flows were $130 million, a 16% increase over the prior 12 months. Now turning to slide eight. Over the past five quarters, the ETF industry has seen over $1 trillion of net inflows, a 12% growth rate. Over the same period, Invesco\u2019s 17% growth rate has exceeded that of the industry. In addition, our market share flows has exceeded our market share of ending AUM for four quarters of the last five quarters, increasing our overall Global ETF market share of 40 basis points over this period to 4.9%. Moving to slide nine. Invesco is the fourth largest ETF AUM advisor globally. Our platform is much more diverse than just bulk beta. We continue to innovate our product line, focusing on specialized strategies in growth areas, such as smart beta, commodities, Fixed Income and more niche traditional beta. These capabilities carry higher fee rates compared to bulk beta fee rates. On a fee basis, we ranked fourth in the industry with a 5.6% market share of annual fees. Given the commoditized nature of both beta products, almost 60% of the industry ETF AUM carries a fee rate of less than 10 basis points. In contrast, our ETF capabilities are anchored on strategies that help investors achieve targeted investment goal. The value add proposition of our ETF business is expressed through sought after products. If you exclude the QQQ, over 90% of our ETF AUM has a fee rate 10 basis points or higher, with the average fee rate being 33 basis points. Our ETF flows in the first quarter were also differentiated, with over 80% of our ETF net inflows being in products that carry a fee rate of 10 basis points or higher. Looking at net flows in these higher fee products, our market share was nearly 14% of the industry, almost 3 times our market share of ending AUM. Slide 10 shows that the ETF industry is expected to almost double in size to $18 trillion or 18% annually by 2025. Invesco is well-positioned to continue to gain market share. With our global scale, as well as being a leader in commodities, smart beta, Fixed Income and our focus on innovative and thematic offerings such as the QQQ Innovation Suite and ESG products, we are positioned to capture client demand around the globe. Our ability to capture flows in excess of our market share is driven by a number of factors, including our understanding of markets and clients, multi-decade ETF relationships in institutional and wealth management channel, a fast growing European ETF product lineup that is now the second fastest growing ETF business in the region and our ability to build loyalty with a new generation of retail investors. Finally, the brand recognition of the QQQ elevates Invesco\u2019s visibility in the global ETF market. The QQQ products have become the fifth largest ETF globally. Its popularity has spurred growth in the rest of our global ETF platform and laid the groundwork for the launch of adjacent fee generating products as part of the QQQ Innovation Suite. We launched that suite in October 2020 and it has been highly successful, growing to $5.4 billion by the end of the first quarter, as I previously noted. Now, moving to slide 11, our institutional pipeline, with $29 billion at quarter end, consistent with the prior quarter level. Pipeline remains strong and has been running in the $25 billion to $35 billion range dating back to late 2019. Pipeline also remains relatively consistent to prior quarter levels in terms of fee composition. Overall, the pipeline is diversified across asset classes and geographies. Our solutions capability enabled 30% of the global institutional pipeline and created wins and customized mandates. This has contributed to meaningful growth across our institutional network. Turning to slide 12. Market volatility had a significant impact on our first quarter net revenue. This is most evident in the $93 million decline in investment management fees from the fourth quarter, as noted on the slide. Prior quarters leading up to the first quarter, we have been generating strong year-over-year net revenue growth, growing at a 17% rate in the second half of 2021. This was being driven by both strong markets and organic growth. As the first quarter unfolded, pressure from market volatility negatively impacted net revenues. As a result, our net revenue were essentially flat year-over-year. We did see improvement in money market fee waivers during the quarter, a short-term rate increased and the fed rates raised 25 basis points in mid-March. The net money market fee waiver impact had been running in the $20 million to $25 million range per quarter. The impact declined to $12 million in the first quarter. We expect the impact will decline to near $5 million in the second quarter and by the third quarter, we expect little to no impact from money market waivers. Total adjusted operating expenses were up about $10 million or 1% as compared to the first quarter of 2021. $6 million of the increase was due to certain changes to the pricing of transfer agency services that we provided -- that we provide to our funds, which went into effect in the third quarter of last year. The increased impacted property, office and technology expenses, which was offset by corresponding increase in service and distribution revenue. Taking this into account, adjusted operating expenses were essentially flat year-over-year. Reductions in employee compensation were offset by higher marketing and G&A expenses, partly due to higher reopening activity in these areas, as compared to the first quarter of 2021 when there was no travel. Going forward, the degree of activity in these areas is expected to increase as travel continues to come back. Moving to slide 13. We are very close to our goal of achieving $200 million in net savings this year. In the first quarter, we realized an additional $6.4 million in cost savings. $3 million of the savings was related to compensation expense and $3 million related to a reduction in property expense as we continue to right size our facilities portfolio. The $6 million in cost savings of $26 million annualized combined with the $167 million in annualized savings realized through 2021, brings us to $193 million in total or 96% of our $200 million net savings expectation. In the first quarter, we incurred $22 million of restructuring costs related to this initiative. In total, we recognized approximately $240 million of our estimated $250 million to $275 million in restructuring cost associated with the program. We expect the remaining restructuring costs for the realization of the program to be up to $35 million. As a reminder, the costs associated with the strategic evaluation are not reflected in our non-GAAP results. Now, moving to slide 14, adjusted operating income decreased $8 million from the first quarter of last year to $495 million, driven by the factors I previously noted. Adjusted operating margin was 39.5%, slightly lower than the first quarter of last year. EPS was $0.56 a share versus $0.68 a share last year, with the main driver being lower non-operating income. In the first quarter of 2021, equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates was $37 million, favorably impacted by the improving CLO valuations at that time, as compared to $4 million in the first quarter of 2022. Other gains and losses declined $30 million from last year to a loss of $20 million in the first quarter of 2022, driven by lower mark-to-market valuations of our seed capital due to negative market performance. The effective tax rate was 24.2% in the first quarter. We estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 24% and 25% for the second quarter of 2022. The actual effective rate may vary from this estimate due to the impact of non-recurring items on pre-tax income and discrete tax item. Slide 15 illustrates our ability to drive adjusted operating margin expansion against the backdrop of the client demand driven change in our AUM mix and the resulting impact on our net revenue yield. Our operating margin two years ago in the first quarter of 2020 was 36%. At that time, we reported a net revenue yield ex-performance fees and excluding the QQQ of 41.8 basis points. In the first quarter of 2022, our net revenue yield declined 5.2 basis points to 36.6 basis points, yet our operating margin has improved to 39.5%. We have been building out our product suite to meet client demand and client demand has been skewed towards lower fee passive products as evidenced by the mix shift between active and passive AUM. Realizing our business mix is shifting, we continue to be focused on aligning our expense base with these changes. This has enabled the firm to improve and maintain strong operating margin, despite the client demand driven decline in net revenue yields. Now a few comments on slide 16, our balance sheet cash position was $1.3 billion on March 31st and approximately $708 million of this cash is held for regulatory requirements. The cash position improved from the first quarter of 2021, even as we deployed $200 million in cash to fund share buybacks in the first quarter. Our leverage ratio, as defined under our credit facility agreement was 0.8 times at the end of the quarter and if you choose to include the preferred stock, the leverage ratio was 2.5 times. There is being substantial improvements in our leverage profile over the past year. As Marty noted earlier, our stronger balance sheet and financial flexibility put us in position to capitalize on an economically attractive opportunity to early redeem the $600 million of senior notes that have a maturity date of November 30the of this year. A short-term interest rates increase in the first quarter, the make-whole related to an early redemption of the debt, became attractive enough to provide a financial benefit to redeem the debt early and it will be fully redeemed on May 6th. This will save us approximately $11 million in interest expense over the period beginning in early May through what would have been the November 30th maturity date. The make-whole and other fees will be approximately $5 million based on current indications, and these will be recognized at the time of redemption. Both the savings and the fees will impact interest expense. With respect to our capital strategy, we are committed to a sustainable dividend and to returning capital to shareholders through a combination of modestly increasing dividends and share repurchases. As we stated, we intend to build towards a 30% to 50% total payout ratio over the next several years. We completed the previously announced share buybacks of $200 million in the first quarter and our Board approved a 10% increase in our quarterly common dividend. Overall, we believe we are making solid progress in our efforts to improve liquidity and build financial flexibility and our first quarter results demonstrate that progress. We remain focused on executing the strategy that aligns with our key areas of focus, continuing to invest ahead of client demand in these areas. At the same time, we are focused on optimizing our organizational model and disciplined expense management. This approach has resulted in a stronger and more resilient operating margin. This has also facilitated stronger cash flows, further strengthening our balance sheet and driving the improvement in our leverage profile, putting us in position to capitalize on opportunities such as the early debt redemption. As we look toward the future, Invesco is in a strong position to deliver value over the long run to all of our stakeholders. And with that, I will ask the Operator to open up the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks very much. Good morning, Allison and Marty. Allison Dukes : Good morning. Brian Bedell : Maybe just to start with the ETF presentation and thanks for all of that detail. Just thinking about that the -- sort of the base fee organic growth potential in the ETF business and how you called out the sort of the higher fee rates and the product development about here sort of a term runway for further product development in this area, whether that\u2019s coming mostly from the innovation side or just add-ons to other products maybe including thematic ETFs and sort of your optimism maybe for this overall ETF fee rate excluding the QQQs to potentially increase over time? Marty Flanagan : Yeah. I will make a couple of comments. Look, I mean, if you just look at the franchises, Allison, went through, I mean, has evolved enormously over the last -- from when we got into 2006 and it is an absolute source of trend and the fundamental strength really as the non-cap weighted part of the business and product innovation and development is as fundamental to success in ETF business. So, we anticipate that to continue. And -- yeah, and again, I think, the results speak for themselves and we would anticipate that to continue as we go forward. Sound if that\u2019s helpful, Brian. Brian Bedell : Yeah. That\u2019s helpful. Sure. There is a lot more to come in the future. And then maybe just on the geopolitical backdrop, what you are seeing, obviously, a lot of cross currents in China, of course, with lockdowns accelerating, and then of course, the whole situation in Europe. Maybe if you could just comment on how you are seeing flow trends evolve into the second quarter now that this is going on longer and within Europe, whether you are seeing a difference in the U.K. versus the continent in terms of sales growth, in terms of whether the geopolitical situation there is affecting one region with versus the other? Marty Flanagan : Yeah. Look, it\u2019s a great point and it is a contrast, right? But there is definitely a sentiment headwind both in China and in Europe, and I\u2019d say, largely for different reasons, right? It is really the Russia-Ukraine situation, which is quite acute on a comment and at the U.K. It has, I\u2019d say, the first element was a slowdown and people sort of moving more towards risk off. We will just have to see as we go forward. It is just so hard to predict if it sort of settles into -- still a horrible situation, but you could see some sentiment sort of balance out there. With China, routes are different. I mean, it is COVID and this is -- they are in the worst situation with COVID since the beginning and that has definitely impacted sentiment and it is impacting flows from really Equity products, Fixed Income products and we continue to be in flows there. But again, I think it\u2019s an economy that the leadership is very focused on and they want growth, they need growth and anticipate they are going to do what they need to support the growth in China. Allison Dukes : And I\u2019d say, picking up on your question do we see a difference in sentiment between the U.K. and Continental Europe, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d point to a difference in sentiment related to the geopolitical issues going on there. I think if you look, it\u2019s kind of peel back the results in the first quarter, the impact of the outflows on our GTR product are felt most acutely in the U.K., as the majority of that is based in the U.K., some headwind in Continental Europe. But in terms of sentiment, a little bit of a shift -- a bit of a risk-off sentiment and a shift in the commodities, which is certainly driving some of the strength in our ETF flows in the first quarter, but I wouldn\u2019t point to any major differences between the two areas. Brian Bedell : Okay. Great. That\u2019s clear. I will get back in the queue for a couple of follow-ups. Thanks. Marty Flanagan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So I am curious about the -- how should we -- how we should think about fee rate pressure. I know it\u2019s always a tricky one to think about. But maybe something that might help a little bit is to think about it tactically. What did you see in the trends through the quarter and then based upon what we have been seeing so far, I know the markets are really volatile. So not necessarily asking for a forward look, but maybe what was the exit rate and what are the general trends here so far quarter-to-date when we think about drilling up and at least, tactically? Allison Dukes : I will do my best, Brennan, to take a stab at that. It is rather difficult as you know. Maybe I will start with just a reminder that the net revenue drivers are always going to be organic growth mix of flows in AUM and market dynamics. Over the last year, we have also had the impact of money market fee waivers, which as I noted, we expect that to be going away. But trying to unpack that and develop a view around where we see it going over the next quarter or two is very difficult, maybe kind of again separating what are some of the trends we see. But if we look at, in particular, the decline in our active net revenue yield and we do provide some additional disclosures around active versus passive net revenue yield in the appendix of the presentation this quarter. I think some of what we see there is just this divergent market beta, where both our emerging markets and China equities have underperformed relative to the developed market indices, and so that\u2019s put real pressure on our active net revenue yield. We have also seen outflows, particularly in developing markets and some of our other higher fee Active Equity products, while experiencing inflows into Active Fixed Income, which, of course, are going to be on the lower end of the fee range. Then, you look at the passive net revenue yield and some of the declines there and that\u2019s really a more, I\u2019d say, recent impact of some of the really sizable low fee large institutional Index mandates that we put into the AUM mix last year, think IOOF, as well as some of the growth of our ETFs in EMEA and the Innovation Suite, which while the Innovation Suite is fee generating, it will be on the slightly lower end of our passive fee rate. So those are some of the trends that we are experiencing. I think the biggest issue looking forward will absolutely be market dynamics, as I think about, what we could expect in the second quarter and third quarter. Marty Flanagan : And I\u2019d add to it, Brennan, it\u2019s the right question to ask and you continue to be focused on it and we as a team, too. But you have to ask the question hand-in-hand with profitability and I think what we have demonstrated is that, we have been continuing to drive profitability with this movement in Phoenix and internally, and Allison talked about it, we continue to make sure our resources are aligned are right sized against where we are seeing the profitability within the organization, and again, I think, that said, that look back from 2020 forward, I think, demonstrates that we have been able to do that and we intend to continue to do that, too. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks for that. And Marty, it\u2019s a great segue and it kind of tees up the next question, which is the environment has been challenging volatile, certainly seems like there is less risk appetite here, at least in the near-term. So, how are you guys thinking about the expense base here this year? Compensation trend seemed a little bit better than, certainly, we had been expecting, is that better than expected comp sustainable in the near-term? How should we be thinking about truing up our outlook for expenses and how are you guys thinking about managing it, given the environment? Marty Flanagan : Yeah. Allison Dukes : Sure. Marty Flanagan : I will make a couple of comments and give to Allison. Look, I think, you are hitting out on the high points. The first thing you have to do to be successful is you can cost cut yourself to success. We have been very focused on it over the last few years, as Allison has spoken, too. But really, we are in a position where driving the resources against things that really matter for the future. That\u2019s what we have been doing and also in this environment of what matters of clients and employees, ensuring that we are keeping that right balance where clients continue to have confidence in us as an organization, and quite frankly, the talent in the organization to keep some energized against generating the results. And so, that is something that we continue to be very focused on and we will continue to do it. But ensuring that we are being responsible and I will stop and have, Allison, pick up on that and make some comments. Allison Dukes : Yeah. Thanks, Marty. So, a couple of things. One, just a reminder, our expense base is about a third variable and two-thirds fixed. So when we think about that variable component of the expense base, it just can\u2019t react fast enough when you have a pretty strong market downdraft, like what we experienced late February and through March, and of course, we continue to experience that as we make our way through April. So it takes some time for that variablized expense base to fully catch up to the lower revenue. And at the same time, two-thirds of our expense base is fixed, and I think, that\u2019s an area where we have been spending a lot of time. As you know, the last couple of years, really thinking about our overall cost structure and making some choices as we think about how to continue to shift that and lighten up some of the cost structure and we have made really good progress we believe, where the $193 million of that expense base really well addressed over these last couple of years. Getting back to your observations on comp. Comp is well managed, because we have been just really thoughtful and disciplined around headcount over the last year or so. And so while there is seasonality in our compensation expense in the first quarter and it does tend around $20 million, $25 million higher than the fourth quarter, comp was pretty well managed against that as we look at headcount, and of course, the variable part of our compensation expense reflects the lower revenue we experienced in the first quarter as well. As I think about the rest of our expense base, you see where we have continued to make some progress on our facilities expense. We will continue to address our facilities portfolio overall, as we just think about our footprint and the role the office plays in our future and take advantage of some opportunities there. But the other thing I\u2019d point to, as we have been experiencing, that\u2019s very low to no travel environment for some time now, and as I think about our expense base going into the second quarter and beyond, I do expect we will continue to see some pickup in activity. We saw some pickup in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. We get the start-stop as we all understand from kind of country-to-country and region-to-region. We still remain completely closed in China, as an example, but we are seeing travel really start to pick back up and clients wanting to see us again across North America and Europe. And so, with that, I expect a little bit of pickup in activity. I do not expect us to get back to pre-COVID levels for a variety of reasons, but I do expect it to be -- to trend just a little bit higher from here. Long way of saying, while we do think there will continue to be this market pressure and revenue pressure, we will be thoughtful and selective in managing our expense base, but not major reactive, because it\u2019s really important that we continue to invest for the business that we expect will be here a year from now, despite from the geopolitical tension we experience right this on. Brennan Hawken : Yeah. Thanks for that. Very, very thorough response. Just one clarifying question, Allison. You made reference to reviewing the facilities footprint. Do you have any expected timeframe for when you all might have an idea about what that review will suggest for changes? Allison Dukes : I\u2019d say it\u2019s ongoing, because leases are -- they are rolling and so as we have the opportunity to make decisions, we have being thoughtful and selective, just given that we work in a different environment than we would have a few years ago. So, that\u2019s going to be an ongoing opportunity and I point just beyond our facilities portfolio to a lot of components of our expense base as opportunities arise to address that and we are going to be very thoughtful about where we continue to invest and where we may be able to free that up to invest somewhere else. Brennan Hawken : Thanks for all the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open. Glenn Schorr : Thank you. I am curious, we have seen different markets. I am just curious on the higher rates and the impact on flows. You have obviously mentioned and benefited from the floating rate in bank loan product. You also mentioned some flows into some Index product salespeople derisk. Can you give us the full lay of the land on where the pluses and minuses are coming impacted in the higher rates and what to expect as the fed does its thing because I think it\u2019s always a little more on the positive side than people expect that if you take rates for impact of big outflows and there is some different moving parts? Thanks. Marty Flanagan : I will make a couple of comments, and Allison will also. So, Glenn, you are hitting on really the topic. I mean, so where we have seen flows. Allison sit in the high marketing our Fixed Income, short duration bank loans. We have a very strong commodity suite within the ETF business. We have had that for a very long time and it\u2019s really just, in this market has become quite popular, as you would imagine, real assets is another one, direct real estate, it will continue to be an opportunity for us. Quite frankly, we are seeing marked improvement in our value equity capabilities and that\u2019s sort of in an asset class over the last decade. There\u2019s not been a lot of interest. We will have to see what the client demand is for that, but strong investment performance coming on the back of it. So, again, what we are going to -- it\u2019s really the breadth of this product line up that is sort of one answer to the marketplace and I think we are well suited for the environment that we are going to go into it. Allison Dukes : And the only thing I\u2019d add to that is just, not surprisingly, investors are going to be looking for more floating rate credit sensitive assets and that\u2019s really what you see driving the strength than our senior loan flows and where we would continue to see demand. And I think it\u2019s, again, the breadth of the capabilities we have there, well positioned to capture that demand. Glenn Schorr : Thank you. And maybe just a follow-up on -- related to MassMutual, obviously, an even bigger owner now, can you remind us what you are managing for the general account, what kind of flows you are getting out of retail and what the future holds in terms of the future synergies between the two organizations? Thanks. Allison Dukes : Sure. I will take that. So in terms of what we are managing for them. We manage about $5 billion on the broker dealer platform. They have also committed over $1 billion to various Invesco alternative strategies. So the relationship is, I would say, mutually beneficial and have the opportunity to continue to grow and expand from here. As you know, they are a larger owner. They continue to be very bullish on the overall profile of Invesco and our opportunity to continue to grow market share and position our product capabilities to capture the demand that\u2019s out there. So we are working with them really on both sides of the ledger, as we think about the opportunity we have to manage more on their broker dealer platform and also the opportunity that we have together to co-invest in various alternative capabilities and strategies. You want to add anything to that Marty, okay? Marty Flanagan : Again, it\u2019s a very strong relationship strategically and we are both looking for ways that we continue to mutually benefit from the relationship as we go forward. Glenn Schorr : Thank you for all that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Lee with KBW. Your line is open. Robert Lee : Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe a question on the Great Wall JV, so just wanted to see, when you think about the economic impact of it. Obviously it\u2019s been a strong source of about flows, the last couple of years even if it\u2019s slowing down right in the moment. But what\u2019s the right way to think of the economic contribution? I believe most of non-controlling interest is from the Great Wall JV or so we are trying to think of its impact is it as simple as just adjusting that for your 49% share or is there a different way that we should be thinking of it? Allison Dukes : Yeah. Let me start with, when you look at our non-GAAP results, we look at that in terms of revenue you see 100% and then below the line we back out the 51%, we don\u2019t know. So we can spend some time walking through that making sure that\u2019s clear. But that\u2019s how it\u2019s reflected in the P&L. So you see 100% on the topline, but by the time you get to the bottomline, we reflect 49% of our ownership. Robert Lee : Okay. And maybe\u2026 Allison Dukes : Is that answer your question, Rob. Robert Lee : Well, yeah, I guess, if I think of the 20 -- I guess my understanding was that not been $29 million of non-controlling interest was mainly the 51% that flows was mainly the Great Wall JV, right, so that be that 51%? Allison Dukes : That\u2019s correct. Robert Lee : Yeah. Okay. Great. And then\u2026 Allison Dukes : That\u2019s correct. So as -- yeah -- go ahead. Sorry. Robert Lee : No. No. That -- well, please to make sure your comment, sorry. Allison Dukes : No. There is nothing else to add. Sorry, go ahead, Rob. Robert Lee : Okay. Just back and forth, but sticking with the Great Wall JV and I know this has come up in the past and I know for a while you have been looking at how do you get a majority stake and can you update us on that and more specifically, given that understanding of operational control of the JV and you run it day-to-day, year-to-year, but can you maybe update is what kind of maybe safeguards you feel like you have, you haven\u2019t been able to get to the majority ownership still a minority ownership, even though operational control other safeguards, we should be thinking of that kind of help protect your position in that joint venture? Marty Flanagan : Yeah. Let me make a couple comments and that look you are hitting on the most important part and from the beginning we have had management control and that\u2019s really why we have been successful and that has really been the competitive differentiator with us versus many of our competitors in the market. The reason for not getting to majority this in and out on COVID, it\u2019s just not helpful, right? It\u2019s just a lockdown and every time that we start to get too. It really was geopolitical elements, I\u2019d say probably two years ago and it\u2019s really been more of that COVID lockdown right now and until that comes down. I might been -- we are not going to get -- we are probably not going to get it done for a few quarters, we will just have to see how that goes. The desire is there on both parties, the pathway is something that we know what we want to accomplish and we will, in time, but I would not be worried about the risks associated with relationship. It is very strong and very well laid out for us as an owner. Robert Lee : Hey. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Marty Flanagan : Thanks, Rob. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Katz with Citigroup. Your line is open. Bill Katz : Okay. Thank you very much. Thanks for taking the questions. Good morning, everybody. So, maybe to start with the balance sheet a little bit. Appreciate the update on the debt for May. And as you think about into the second half of the year, could you talk a little bit about what your priorities might be, how much sort of residual cash you are willing to run with on the balance sheet between sort of the excess cash and required cash and then maybe the delta between incremental debt repurchase versus share repurchase, just given where the stock is trading? Thank you. Allison Dukes : Sure. So, I\u2019d say, in terms of priorities, just overall, our capital priorities are consistent in just, first and foremost, reinvesting in the business to support future growth. We continue to prioritize that and will and you have seen that and I think that\u2019s what\u2019s put us in a good position to capture the flows we did in the first quarter despite a really challenging environment. Next is to maintain a strong balance sheet and then return excess cash to shareholders. So I actually think we check each one of those boxes nicely in the first quarter as we had the opportunity to further strengthen the balance sheet and return cash to shareholders through the dividend increase and share repurchases. As I think about moving forward, when we get on the other side of redeeming the debt, and I will point to the fact that we will be using a combination of cash, and perhaps, some draw on the revolver to early redeem that $600 million and so it does -- we have been building cash in anticipation of paying that debt off at the end of this year. We pulled it forward by six months and it\u2019s a bit of a challenging environment as well in terms of just cash flow generation being slightly weaker than we would have expected or hoped for in 2022, just given the market pressure dynamics that we are experiencing through revenue. So, against that, I think, we will continue to be focused on building cash, so that we can be in an opportunistic position to reinvest in the business and to think about continued progress on the balance sheet. Our next debt maturity won\u2019t be until 2024. So we have got some time in advance of that next $600 million maturity. I think I missed the last part of your question. I think you asked something about share repurchases? Bill Katz : Well, I am just trying to understand, like, as you think about in the second half of the year and you pay down debt and hopefully all should stabilize. But how much residual cash you will put on the balance sheet and then when you sort of look at the stock trading sub-20 versus your next debt payment not coming due until 2024? How to think about just sort of buyback versus further husbanding of capital? Allison Dukes : Sure. I think, in general, we would love to see cash be somewhere around, and I mean, in generality tier, $1.5 billion or so. That just puts us in a nice comfortable position beyond our regulatory requirement to have cash for opportunistic needs and also whether any downturns. And I do think, as we think about this year, we are cautious not knowing what the environment might hold from this point forward. We are watching closely and we are going to be -- we are going to air on the side of conservativity as we think about the impact the market might have on our overall revenue dynamics and cash position. So I don\u2019t know if we are husbanding cash so much as being very thoughtful and prudent as we think about our balance sheet and keeping our balance sheet in a very strong position. We are operating in a different environment than we were two years ago. When I think about the first quarter of 2020 and how much pressure that put on our balance sheet and on our profile overall, we are in a much, much stronger position two years later because of the work that we have done and because of our prudent approach to the balance sheet and this would not be the time to back off that strategy. Bill Katz : Understood. Just as a follow-up and apologize a bit of a two-part unrelated question. Just I might have missed your commentary, Allison, just on the sequential decline in the Equity earnings line. And then the bigger picture question, just as we look at the alts bucket, can you talk a little bit about what you have coming in terms of opportunity for growth into maybe second half of this year in flagship funds or just general new product initiations? And then could you sort of clarify how much you are sort of getting tapping into retail democratization, I thought I heard $300 million, just wanted to see if I heard something different? Thank you. Allison Dukes : Let me take the first one. Just in terms of equity and earnings, if you think about first quarter of 2021, there was a gain of about $36.7 million. That\u2019s because of the CLO marks at the time. So you had just CLO mark to market moving in a pretty strong upward direction in the first quarter of 2021 and compare that to this quarter, which was about $4 million. So, just modest gains there, but again, this is all just mark to market unrealized gains and losses. So, that\u2019s the difference year-over-year. As it relates to alternatives and opportunities going forward, I will continue to point to our private markets capabilities and what we have -- for the last couple of quarters talking about both in terms of real estate and our senior loan capabilities. You are certainly seeing both of them be in demand right now, particularly the senior loan capabilities as we noted, just given the investor move towards short-term floating rate credit-sensitive assets that provides a really significant opportunity for growth in that asset class for the balance of the year, but also our private real estate business does, as well as we continue to grow our capabilities there. Marty, do you want to add anything there? Marty Flanagan : No. Rightly said. Allison Dukes : Okay. Marty Flanagan : Got it. Bill Katz : Thank you, all. Marty Flanagan : Thanks, Bill. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ken Worthington : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Different parts of the real estate market have bounced back. Others are still struggling. So, I guess, how are Invesco\u2019s direct real estate portfolio? How is it positioned and performing here and it does look like that both Invesco Asia and Invesco U.S. Direct Fund have been in market more recently. So how is fundraising going in those products, if they haven\u2019t yet ramped up? And I guess maybe lastly here, the outlook for real estate transaction fees. I think you called it out in the quarter as being, I think, $10 million or $11 million in the quarter, are we back to normal for those transaction fees, and if so, what does normal look like from here versus the depressed level that we saw more recently? Thanks. Allison Dukes : All right. Let me try to take that maybe in reverse order. On the transaction fee, I think, you are pointing to that $10 million transaction fee that we noted as in other revenue and that\u2019s really a property disposition fee within private real estate. And so net inflows were about $300 million in real estate, but there\u2019s, obviously, transaction activity behind that and was pretty broad across the platform. I think we commented on the acquisition activity it was about $2.1 billion in the quarter, but the realization, which is what can trigger the property disposition fees was about $1.8 billion in the quarter. And so, yeah, from time-to-time, you are going to trigger some of those property disposition fees. I don\u2019t know if we could point to normal, because it\u2019s going to be somewhat episodic and nature, depending on the nature of those dispositions. And then, I think, I will add on to that, it\u2019s important just to remember that a large percentage of that AUM through realization doesn\u2019t actually leave Invesco. It\u2019s really redeployed into new properties. And so I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d point to that as normal or something we should expect quarter-to-quarter. As I think about just, again, coming back then to the part of your question around our real estate portfolio, it\u2019s pretty well-positioned and well-diversified across the different real estate classes, multifamily, office, industrial, retail. We have obviously been quite thoughtful over the last few years, given some of the various pressures on some of those categories. It\u2019s also well diversified across regions. It is a global business. And so, our strategy is not to be too concentrated at any one particular area or asset class and I think they are -- we feel like they are pretty strong growth profile, growth dynamics for that one going forward. Ken Worthington : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Marty Flanagan : Thanks, Ken. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. So I wanted to follow up. I appreciate the comments on the balance sheet and flexibility in the capital and priorities. I guess the one area that hasn\u2019t been discussed is just M&A and so curious about your appetite for potential M&A in this type of backdrop alternatives or private market capabilities expanding that certain areas of focus or if it\u2019s in terms of priorities, this is just further down the spectrum and not really something you are focused on at this point? Marty Flanagan : It\u2019s a good question and I would really point to, right now, as Allison has been talking about just on this call, really private markets is a very important area for us and we have two fundamental strengths that we have been talking about and our head is focused on growing those organically right now. But if there was an opportunity in the alternative space that complemented our current portfolio, we would surely be very open minded to it. That would be the priority as we thought about M&A. But it\u2019s -- we are not waiting to continue to build that business, we are continuing to invest in it. Dan Fannon : Got it. And then a follow-up on just the institutional pipeline, I am curious just the solutions business, if you could talk about the kind of client profile that you are typically having success with and expand upon that? We know some of the larger mandates last year, but kind of on the ongoing business? And then within active equities, which also is a little bit larger slice of the pie. Can you talk about what strategies are driving, or whether demand is on that front from the institutional pipeline that you guys disclose? Marty Flanagan : Yeah. Let me talk about solutions. So it\u2019s -- the client practice is very, very broad. It\u2019s from corner office wealth management teams in the United States using the solutions capability to large sovereign wealth funds around the world. So it really serves all different types of clients in doing various different services for them. But as we said, it\u2019s been fundamental to our success institutionally and very supportive of our wealth management business also. Allison Dukes : And I think, Dan, maybe coming to the other part of your question there, part of what we are seeing in terms of the growth and active equities in the pipeline would be driven by China and some of the institutional mandates that we are seeing through our JV there. I would point to, I mean, you note the pickup and just the overall component of active equity, not surprisingly. As a result, I\u2019d say, the average fee rate of the one non-funded pipeline, well, it continues to be within a range of high 20s, low 30s. It\u2019s on the high end of that range as you would expect and our alternatives mandates continue to grow there as well. So the pipeline is shaping up quite nicely. It\u2019s certainly a leading indicator, we believe, of future AUM growth and we are pleased with how that\u2019s shaping up. The pull-through this quarter was a little bit lower than usual, somewhat in the normal range, but lower as we just saw some pushing of those mandates out, given some of the geopolitical risks and a little bit of a pause on that, but the pipeline itself is shaping up quite nicely. Dan Fannon : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Patrick Davitt : Hey. Good morning, guys. Just one on the ETF disclosure, the fee premium, obviously, that you highlight in the deck is a great position to be in. But I think there\u2019s a question if that doesn\u2019t just mean that those funds are lagging the broader ETF industry in terms of seeing more compression. So, first, to what extent are you seeing pressure from competitors on those higher fee products in the ETF side, and second, what gives you confidence for those higher fee rates are defensible in the long run through the lens of what we have seen with other ETFs, more passive like ETFs? Marty Flanagan : Yeah. It -- so, look, where the fee pressure really comes in bulk beta, right? Where there\u2019s any number of competitors and it\u2019s easy to get into. Obviously, it\u2019s dominated by a few. There\u2019s just been less of that across the industry once you leave that and it\u2019s largely, because there aren\u2019t many dupilcative ETFs and they are generating the returns and the results that clients want, and I would say, as long as clients are feeling they are getting value for the ETFs, the fees will stay in place. Allison Dukes : And in the bulk beta side, there\u2019s just very little -- there are very few ways to compete other than through fees and in the states in which we operate, there is the opportunity to differentiate. And so, I don\u2019t know that we would say the fee pressure is lagging, because you really can\u2019t create a differentiated product offering there. Patrick Davitt : Thanks. Operator : Next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Michael Cyprys : Hey. Good morning and thanks for squeezing me in. Just maybe coming back to expenses, I think, Allison, you mentioned the expense base as one-third variable, two-thirds fixed. I guess, where would you like to see that over time and what\u2019s the opportunity to shift more of the expense base to variable and what actions might be -- might you be able to take? Allison Dukes : I would always love to see it go more towards variable and if we had that opportunity, we will push everything we can. But it\u2019s not totally realistic. So, I think, the opportunity we have is just really longer term and it\u2019s broader based. As we think about the fact that our business continues to shift and you see that through everything we have discussed this morning and the real demand for our passive capabilities, it\u2019s creating a fundamental shift and just the revenue dynamics of our business, aand against that, we have got to be very thoughtful about positioning the chassis of our expense base. And so some elements of that are going to be fixed, but we have got to address even the fixed components to really reflect where demand is today and where we expect it\u2019s going to continue to be three years, four years, five years from now and where we have the opportunity to variabilize the expense base, we will. Compensation is a pretty highly variable component of our expense base. We are a people driven business and we will continue to be a people driven business. And so, that gives us opportunity, but we are thoughtful about how we use that opportunity as well. So it\u2019s hard to say exactly where else we can go, but I think the biggest thing we can do is continue to address some of our fixed costs. I will point back to the property portfolio as an example of that as we think about facilities and the opportunity we have to take some fixed cost out. That\u2019s how we are thinking about really adjusting the operating expense base going forward. Michael Cyprys : And just given some of the changes that you have made to the expense base already, I guess, what would you expect the pace of expense growth to be over the next few years assuming flat markets? Allison Dukes : That\u2019s hard to say, of course, given the inflationary environment we are operating in. I think in a lot of ways inflation doesn\u2019t hit us in quite the same way it hits other industries. But I am not sure we felt it entirely yet either. I will point to travel as an example of that. I think the inflationary pressure on travel is going to find its way back into our expense base and that of others. I just don\u2019t know how long that environment might persist or whether or not it resets to some new level that we have to contend with. I think we can manage our expense base reasonably well, again putting aside market, and the real unknown is just the overall macroeconomic environment and the inflationary impact on the expense base. I think that\u2019s the bigger, probably, pressure, I am not going to call it risk, but upward pressure on our expense base as we think about just managing our business going forward. Michael Cyprys : Great. Thank you. Marty Flanagan : Okay. Well, thank you very much. I appreciate the engagement in the discussion and have a good rest of the day. Much appreciated. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s conference. You may all disconnect at this time.",

Now I'd like to turn today's meeting over to your host, Mr. Greg Ketron, Invesco's Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Greg Ketron : Thanks, operator, and to all of you joining us on Invesco's quarterly earnings call. In addition to our press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address today. The press release and presentation are available on our Web site at invesco.com.

The only authorized webcasts are located on our Web site. Marty Flanagan, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Allison Dukes, Chief Financial Officer, will present our results this morning. After we complete the presentation, we will open up the call for questions. Now I'll turn the call over to Marty. Marty Flanagan : Thank you, Greg. And I'll start on Slide 3, which is the highlights of the quarter. So let me start on that page, if you will. So the market environment we have experienced for the first half of this year has been one of the most challenging in decades, global equity and debt markets delivered the worst first half returns we've seen in decades as investors reacted to uncertainty associated with rising fears, recession fears, higher inflation, interest rate hikes and geopolitical tensions. Against this backdrop for the industry and despite seeing the first net long term outflows quarter in two years, our diversified product line has maintained net inflows in key capability areas, notably ETFs, active fixed income, Greater China, where we maintain leadership positions. Our global ETF platform generated inflows of $4.8 billion in the quarter, the equivalent of a 7% annualized organic growth rate. Our ETF product suite remains differentiated from competitors with a strong presence in higher revenue, higher growth segments such as smart beta, and we continue to gain market share during the quarter. Our active fixed income business generated net inflows of $2.2 billion with strong flows into shorter duration strategies given the market backdrop. Our business in Greater China delivered $1.8 billion in net [volume] long term inflows this quarter. Growth was driven by our China joint venture, where we saw strong demand for fixed income capabilities as investors saw risk of assets. As we showcased previously, our business in China is uniquely positioned as a result of many years of investment and hard work building relationships with our clients and key stakeholders in the region. Growth in China continued despite difficult business conditions, which included COVID lockdowns in major cities. We are optimistic that the economic outlook in China is beginning to improve as COVID shutdowns ease and the government takes steps to boost the economy. As markets recover, we are well positioned to capture future growth in the fastest growing market for asset managers in the world. I also wanted to highlight our institutional business, which was in net inflows for the 11th consecutive quarters with $1.5 billion. The channel has been a steady source of growth, and we have made tremendous progress in building the business to nearly $0.5 trillion in assets under management. The channel is well diversified by asset class, led by fixed income and alternatives as well as geography where we have a significant presence in each of the three global regions. We're proud to serve a broad range of client types and our pipeline continues to be solid. Our solutions capability remains integral to the success in this channel and enable a third of our pipeline this quarter. We expect our institutional business to remain a key strength for us in the quarters ahead. Despite broad based growth and key capabilities and net outflows and equity strategies were $7.7 billion in this quarter and drove overall net negative outflows in active global equities, in particular, we experienced net outflows in investor preference for risk off trades, led to higher reductions in the quarter, including our developing markets fund, we saw $2.6 billion of net outflows. We look at Invesco's ability to weather this volatile period, and our focus on building a stronger balance sheet has resulted in much greater flexibility. As I mentioned last quarter, we took advantage of the economically attractive opportunity to early redeem $600 million of long term debt. As a result, the total debt outstanding at the end of the second quarter is at the lowest level since 2015, and our leverage profile has been steadily improving. We've increased cash return to shareholders this year via share buybacks along with a 10% dividend increase we announced in April. The progress we've made on the balance sheet will allow us to take advantage of future opportunities and continue to invest in our business and increase return to shareholders over the long term. We met our target of $200 million in annual cost savings from our strategic review. Our focus will now shift to ongoing expense management discipline and we will be deliberate as a management team in continuing to scale our business platform, global business platform, and invest in key areas of growth. In this uncertain environment, clients seek an investment manager that can partner with them to meet a comprehensive range of constantly evolving needs and solve their most challenging problems. Our broad set of investment capabilities and a differentiated platform we've built positions us well to continue to meet our client needs and compete in a dynamic market environment. Looking ahead, we will balance managing through near term volatility while continuing to build a business that can compete and win over the long term. When the global industry growth resumes, we are well positioned to capture demand across a wide range of client types and investment capabilities. Challenging times truly separate great companies from the pack, and we are confident that our unwavering commitment to client needs will distinguish Invesco as one of the top firms in our industry. With that, I'll turn it over to Allison. Allison? Allison Dukes : Thanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with Slide 4. Our investment performance continued to be solid in the second quarter, with 55% and 60% of actively managed funds and the top half of peers or beating benchmark on a three and a five year basis. These results reflect continued strength in fixed income and balanced products, areas where we continue to see demand from clients globally. Moving to Slide 5. We ended the second quarter with $1.39 trillion in AUM, a decrease of $166 billion from March 31st, as significant market declines and FX rate changes contributed to $160 billion of the decline. As Marty mentioned earlier, we experienced our first net long term outflow quarter in two years with $6.8 billion in net outflows. Despite that, our business has proven resilient and our relative net flow performance in the period was among the strongest in our peer group. Our passive business continued to grow $4.5 billion in net long term inflows. Growth in passives was offset by $11.3 billion of net long term outflows and active capabilities. The institutional channel continues to demonstrate the breadth and resilience of our platform with $1.5 billion of net long term inflows in the second quarter. The channel has been a consistent source of growth and has now been in net inflows for 11 straight quarters. We continue to see mandates fund across a diverse range of capabilities. And as I'll discuss later, our pipeline remains solid. Global market volatility weighed on the retail channel this quarter, which experienced $8.3 billion of net outflows, primarily in the Americas and EMEA. ETFs and index strategies remain a key growth area for Invesco and were a source of relative strength in the second quarter with $4.8 billion of net long term inflows. Excluding the QQQs, Invesco captured 6.1% of industry net inflows, significantly higher than our 3.2% share of total industry assets under management. Moving to Slide 6. We experienced a slowdown in net flows across all regions this quarter amidst exceptional market volatility. Net flows were positive in Asia Pacific, inclusive of $2.2 billion of net long term inflows into our China joint venture. As we've showcased previously, we are uniquely positioned in China and expect growth to accelerate there as the economy recovers and COVID restrictions ease. Consistent with industry trends, net flows slowed in the Americas and EMEA with both regions and net long term outflows for the quarter. From an asset cost perspective, we saw strength in fixed income in the second quarter with net long term inflows of $4.8 billion. Drivers of fixed income flows included our China JV, stable value and several fixed income ETFs. We experienced net outflows in alternatives this quarter as net inflows in direct real estate mandates and two new CLOs were offset by net outflows in bank loans and our global targeted returns capability. Year-to-date, net inflows into alternatives were $5.9 billion, equivalent to a 6% organic growth rate. Excluding $2.5 billion in net outflows and global targeted returns, organic growth in alternatives is 8% year-to-date. As global markets declined significantly in the quarter, we experienced $7.7 billion of net outflows in equity capabilities. We continue to see higher redemption pressure in some of our larger equity funds, particularly in global and developing market equities, which accounted for $6.6 billion of the net outflows. Now moving to Slide 7. Our institutional pipeline was $24 billion at quarter end, a decrease of about $5 billion from the prior quarter due to fundings during the second quarter as well as normal fluctuations in the timing of client investments. Our pipeline has been running in the [$25 billion to $35 billion] range dating back to late 2019, so this is close to the lower end of that range. While the pipeline is strong, we're seeing some delays in mandates funding due to market uncertainty and expect that the typical funding cycle may lengthen by one to two quarters. The pipeline also remains relatively consistent to prior quarter levels in terms of fee composition with an average fee rate running between the mid-20s and mid-30 basis point range. Overall, the pipeline continues to be diversified across asset classes and geographies. Our solutions capability enable 33% of the global institutional pipeline and created wins and customized mandates. This has contributed to meaningful growth across our institutional network. Turning to Slide 8. The significant declines in global markets over the past several months have impacted our revenue base. Second quarter 2022 net revenue of $1.17 billion was 6% lower than last quarter and 10% lower than the second quarter of 2021. Despite the volatile market backdrop, net revenue remained 13% higher than the second quarter of 2020, the last time we experienced this type of broad market decline. Money market fee waivers abated during the quarter after the Federal Reserve raised rates twice to combat inflation. The net money market fee waiver impact had declined to $12 million in the first quarter of this year, and it was less than $4 million in the second quarter. Moving forward, we do not expect money market yield waivers to materially affect our revenue base. Total adjusted operating expenses of $762 million were up $4 million or less than 1% as compared to the first quarter of 2022 and flat to the second quarter of 2021. The client and employee compensation due to seasonally lower payroll taxes and variable incentive pay were offset by increases in other expense categories. G&A expenses were $17 million higher than the first quarter as we incurred $14 million of fund related expenses during the period that we do not expect to recur in the future. The increase in property office and technology expenses can be attributed to additional rent associated with the move of our Atlanta headquarters to a new development in Midtown Atlanta in early 2023. We took possession of our new building in April as we build out the space while continuing to operate from our current Atlanta office. As a result, property and office expense will remain $2 million to $3 million above the eventual run rate for the next four to five quarters. As COVID restrictions eased across North America and Europe, we saw a meaningful return of client activity and business travel, which contributed to increases in marketing and G&A expenses that I will cover on the next slide. Interacting in person again with our clients and our colleagues around the globe is integral to our success as we transition to our new normal ways of working. We remain highly focused on disciplined expense management while continuing to deliver for our clients. Moving to Slide 9. As of the end of the second quarter, we have met our initial $200 million savings goal from our strategic evaluation program. As compared to a normal pre-COVID run rate of expenses, we have delivered $213 million of annualized savings across employee compensation, our facility portfolio and third-party spend, which includes a lower new normal level of travel and entertainment expense. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, our travel and entertainment expense ran at significantly depressed levels as COVID mitigation measures were put into place and business travel slowed to near zero. Over the past quarter, we saw a meaningful resumption of business activity as restrictions eased across North America and Europe. We spent approximately $14 million on travel and entertainment this quarter. If we look back to the second half of 2019, travel and entertainment expenses averaged around $25 million per quarter in that pre-COVID environment. Given our new normal ways of working and various measures we've put in place, we do not expect to see travel revert to pre-pandemic norms. We believe that our experience in the second quarter is approaching a new normal range for quarterly spending, and we expect to recognize at least $5 million in savings per quarter or $20 million annualized as compared to prior levels of activity. Moving forward, we will continue to focus on maintaining expense discipline and scaling our global business. We employ a continuous improvement mindset and will take full advantage of efficiencies where there are opportunities. In the second quarter, we incurred $5 million of restructuring costs related to this initiative. In total, we\u2019ve recognized approximately $247 million of our total estimated $250 million to $275 million in restructuring costs associated with the program. As a reminder, the costs associated with the strategic evaluation are not reflected in our non-GAAP results. Going to Slide 10. Adjusted operating income decreased $129 million from the second quarter of last year to $412 million, primarily due to lower revenue as a result of the market declines. Adjusted operating margin was 35.1% as compared to 41.5% in the second quarter of last year. EPS was $0.39 as compared to $0.78 last year due to lower operating and nonoperating income. In the second quarter, equity and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates was a negative $8 million as a result of unfavorable changes in CLO valuations compared to a positive $40 million a year ago when valuations were increasing. Other gains and losses were negative $29 million this quarter as compared to a positive $25 million a year ago, driven by lower valuations of our seed capital associated with market declines. The effective tax rate was 24.8% in the second quarter. We estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 24% and 25% for the third quarter of 2022. The actual effective rate may vary from this estimate due to the impact of nonrecurring items on pretax income and discrete tax items. On Slide 11, you can see how our asset base has evolved over the past two years as client demand has skewed towards lower yielding passive products, we have tailored our product offerings to meet that demand and experienced significant growth in passive and money market offerings. Realizing that our business mix is shifting, we continue to be focused on aligning our expense base with these changes. While the declines in global markets pressured our margins this quarter, operating margin of 35.1% is within a normal range for where we are in the business cycle and remains above our second quarter of 2020 levels, the last time we experienced a market drawdown of this magnitude. As I mentioned earlier, we will continue to be vigilant in prudently managing expenses and would expect margins to stabilize and eventually expand as markets recover. I'll conclude with a few points on Slide 12. Our balance sheet and cash position was $937 million on June 30th, a decrease of $396 million as compared to last year. The lower cash balance was due to the $600 million early debt redemption in May at economically attractive terms. To help facilitate the early payoff, we carried a balance of $185 million on our revolving credit facility at the end of this quarter. We expect to repay that balance in the near term and begin to build cash again over future quarters. In terms of the benefits, the early redemption resulted in a net $6 million of savings with the make whole fee and other transaction related expenses being $5 million in the quarter and interest expense savings of nearly $11 million this year. Second quarter interest expense included the make whole fee and other related expenses that totaled $5 million, offset by nearly $3 million in interest expense savings. For the third quarter, we expect interest savings of nearly $5 million and for the fourth quarter, over $3 million. This will result in interest expense being lower by these amounts in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. Our leverage ratio, as defined under our credit facility agreement was 0.7 times at the end of the second quarter. If preferred stock is included, it was 2.6 times. Both metrics are an improvement over 0.9 times and 2.9 times from one year earlier as our total debt outstanding reached its lowest level since 2015 at $1.7 billion. Overall, the progress we have made in managing our cost base and building balance sheet strength has given us a strong base from which to operate an ample flexibility to navigate the current drawdown in global markets. We're confident that by continuing to execute the strategy we have laid out across our key capability areas, Invesco will continue to grow organically over the long run and be the go-to partner for our clients while delivering value to our shareholders. With that, I'm going to turn it over to the operator, and we'll open up the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Ken Worthington : I guess maybe first, gross sales slowed, which doesn't seem surprising given market conditions but the slowdown was particularly pronounced in the Asia Pac region. And I think you commented on some equity funds, but I wasn't sure if it's that region. I was hoping if you could walk through the slowdown in Asia Pac maybe by asset class and by region there? And help us understand how activity levels are developing in the region for the second half of the year? Marty Flanagan : Let me make a comment, and Alison can pick up, Ken. So we did see, obviously, a slowdown in net inflows in Mainland China, as we've highlighted. But in fact, we continue with net inflows there. I would say the sentiment is turning somewhat more positive from where it was and still challenged, the COVID lockdowns really is a negative sentiment impact in the area, but we are having a greater confidence in sort of the economic rebound and quite frankly, the the consumer response to back to investing in the region. But Allison, do you want to make some more specific comments? Allison Dukes : I mean I would just say kind of looking at what drove Asia Pacific over the quarter. I mean, certainly, the slowdown, put quite a bit of pressure on it. But as we break it down and kind of look at maybe the China JV in particular, continues to be our growth driver inside of the region. Within the JV, we delivered $2.2 billion of net long term inflows. That was really driven by primarily six new product launches, which drove the majority of those net inflows and I would say those mostly skewed towards fixed income. So not surprisingly, more demand for fixed income than we would be seeing for equities at the moment there given just some of the overall sentiment pressure. As we look across the region and look at Greater China and Greater China, we did see, I would say, some offsetting net outflows primarily driven by outflows in our maturing fixed maturity products. Australia had an outflow quarter as well, that was primarily driven by outflows in our GTR product, which has remained under pressure, as we've talked about over a number of quarters. And then I would say some of that was balanced by inflows in Japan, where we continue to see strong demand for fixed income products in Japan. So a little bit of, I think, mixed bag in the quarter, strong demand for fixed income, which, of course, we're seeing in a number of places, but certainly in the China JV and in Japan. Ken Worthington : And then just on the balance sheet. The way you've pitched it is from a position of strength, you've delevered somewhat or even meaningfully. I think the stated goal, $1 billion of cash in excess of regulatory requirements, which gives Invesco the flexibility sort of when it needs it. How flexible is the balance sheet right now? It looks like the cash is pretty small over that regulatory requirement, but you've got a huge revolver that you can tap. Given you've pursued deals in more challenging times in the past, just walk through how you see the flexibility of the balance sheet right now for your ability to do transactions, if interested? Allison Dukes : Let me take the first part of that and then let Marty chime in as well. I would say a couple of things. One, the stated goal you mentioned is pretty old. It's been a few years and candidly, it predates my joining the company. We actually haven't had that goal in a few years. I think I'd shift it to some of what we've been guiding to more currently, which is we're looking to just strengthen the balance sheet overall, and that's not just through cash balances, there's obviously a cost to carrying a whole lot of cash, particularly when we have some debt to take care of at the same time. So I think you've seen a lot of our focus and kind of cleaning up a lot of the contingent liabilities and then starting to manage some of the capital structure at the same time. So I'd guide you towards that just as you think about what are our balance sheet objectives overall, and that's to really put the balance sheet in a place where it's strong, particularly in times like this, I think about how much stronger the balance sheet is now than when we were in the last downturn a couple of years ago. And that's giving us that optionality to do a number of things this year. We did engage in $200 million of share repurchases in the first quarter and then, of course, taking advantage of the opportunity to early redeem $600 million in notes. We want to stay opportunistic and give ourselves the flexibility to do the same for the next maturity, which is in January of 2024. What does that mean though for our overall priorities? I would say our first priority is to reinvest in the business. It is much more cost efficient to grow organically than it is to go out and acquire inorganically. That doesn't mean that there's a change in our strategy from an inorganic perspective. But I think we've really demonstrated over the last couple of years that we have ample ability to invest in our business and grow our capabilities and really thinking about some of our key growth capabilities like private markets, our fixed income platform, our ETF franchise, our China JV, all the areas where you're really seeing us demonstrate the growth pretty consistently over the last several quarters. It's because we've been creating that capacity to invest in our own business while at the same time, keeping our eyes open, should there be the right opportunity. Now market conditions are certainly going to be rather choppy for that at the moment. But in terms of the opportunity we have with the breadth of our franchise to continue to invest in it, I think we're very bullish on our own opportunity to grow the franchise we have. Marty Flanagan : Allison, that was well said. I don't have anything else to add. And can I just sum it up with the highlight that we're focused on reinvesting in the business in the areas of growth. We continue to look to reallocate resources where we are growing. Easy deciding harder to do, but we continue to make progress there. And we've -- right now, we have the greatest flexibility we've had in a good number of years. So we feel like we are in a position of strength. Operator : The next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Curious, a few comments on being focused on expenses. Allison, you gave some color on T&E normalization and sort of calibrated for what the experience has been so far. But when we think about how much flex there is in the expense side, you guys normally talk about a 30% component that's variable. But is that still the right way to think about the rest of the year? And how much are you thinking about trying to do more given the challenging environment? And would that be more of a back half of the year event, or would it be more like a well, the budgeting process for 2023 starts in probably just a few months and so it\u2019s better to focus there so as not to be disruptive to investments and try and balance the competitive dynamics? Could you maybe help us think about how you're framing that at this point? Marty Flanagan : Brennan, let me make a comment and Allison will also chime in. So look, we said time and time again, and you followed this sector for a long, long time. It is very difficult for an asset manager to adjust expenses in the short term to follow such a drawdown in the market. Quite frankly, we don't try to do that. We look at it in two different ways. One, it's in a period of uncertainty, which we are right now. We hit the brakes. We do all the things that you would imagine we would do, look at things that are technical ways to slow investing in the business, we are doing that. And then we look longer term that we continue to adjust accordingly and is largely focused on trying to find ways to reinvest to in the areas that Allison talked about where we're seeing growth. And so it's really a two pronged approach. And we've done it historically, quite effectively, we'll continue to do that. But Allison, will you please add to that? Allison Dukes : I mean, I'd say a couple of things. As you think about our overall compensation expense, about a third of that is variable. So that obviously flexes pretty quickly with the change in revenue for the most part. It's not a perfect relationship, but it's fairly quick given just a variety of incentive compensation plans that we would have driving overall incentive comp. It's much more difficult to adjust overall compensation nor would we necessarily want to. We want to be really thoughtful about positioning our expense base not just for the short term but the medium term as well. And I think that really underscores a lot of Marty's points. So I think probably the essence of your question is where do we go from here. I would say a couple of things. On compensation, compensation tends to fluctuate in that 38% to 42% as a percent of revenue range. You should expect us when revenue draws down as quickly as it has, and we expect it to be under pressure this year that we'd be on the higher end of that range. Underneath that, we're going to be really thoughtful about making sure we're allocating resources and being very thoughtful about just hiring overall and where we position that next hire and how we really manage against the opportunities we have and what's critical versus not critical. I think that's the essence of how we manage in the short term from here. Certainly, a challenging quarter to have revenue under so much pressure and a return to that kind of wide open travel environment at the same time. I don't think we ever would have expected those two events to occur in the exact same quarter and it put enormous pressure on the top line and the expense line at the same time. We do expect that travel normalizes from here, again, the new normal that I talked about earlier. And we'll be really thoughtful about travel in this environment as well. When our clients want to see us, we want to stay in front of our clients as it's as important now as ever in times of real volatility to be in front of our clients, but we can also be very thoughtful about our internal gatherings and some of the discretionary spend we have from there. So it's hard to give you exact answers on all of this, but hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color as to how we're thinking about operating and how we're managing in this environment. We do think we're managing from a position of strength, but we're going to be very thoughtful about all of our actions and decisions. Brennan Hawken : Thanks for that. That's very, very thorough from both of you. I appreciate it. In the quarter, we also saw Mass Mutual increase their stake. Could you maybe talk about dialog and how dialog with them has progressed, and whether or not you can continue to explore expanding that strategic relationship to potentially bring even more benefits beyond the obvious ownership tie-up? Marty Flanagan : The thing to look at is they increase our ownership stake in the company. And they have great confidence in the organization. We continue to have very good strategic conversations. We're extremely wide ranging, and it's just a constant dialog of where can we opportunistically work together and that continues. So again, I just plan on seeing a deeper, broader relationship in the quarters and months ahead in years end. Allison Dukes : I mean the only thing I would add is they continue to be opportunistic because I think they have a very long term view on the opportunity that's there, and there's a really deep partnership that continues to grow and expand. And I think this is a mutually beneficial relationship on a lot of sides and you're seeing that as they continue to take a long term view on the overall opportunity in the common stock. Brennan Hawken : Has there been any corresponding adjustment to the positioning on their platform or any shift in how you guys are ranking as far as flows on their platform go or anything like that? Allison Dukes : I think we continue to be the second largest broker dealer in terms of AUM on their platform. I think we're their largest in terms of sub-advised and DCIO mandate. We manage about $5 billion on their platform and an additional $5 billion in variable annuity and sub-advised AUM. I'd say, in addition to that, we've got about over $3 billion in other investment relationships with them, which consists of their investment in our alternative strategies in terms of their co-investment and our investment strategies and some of our alternatives capabilities. So I mean, it's a rather broad relationship. Marty Flanagan : And I'd add, Brennan, that's all really valuable, but in particular, them being an anchor tenant, co-investor and our alternative capabilities is really meaningful. It's not just from the money itself but in the investment, but really the credibility it comes as an anchor tenant when we go to market and you with your background, recognize how important that is. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Cyprus with Morgan Stanley. Mike Cyprus : Just given the market volatility with rising rates, just curious to hear a little bit of what you're hearing from your institutional clients just in terms around asset allocations. What sort of changes are you hearing, your clients thinking about contemplating just given the volatility, the rising rate backdrop, how do you see that also impacting 60-40, which had probably the worst quarter in many decades? So just curious how you see that evolving from here? Marty Flanagan : I'm sure you're having endless conversations with your clients, too. And I will say it's all over the map, I would say whether it was institutional or retail, and these are broad comments. Largely, everybody hit the brakes in the first part of the quarter, just what is going on, what's the depth of this, where is it heading? And now the conversations are moving more towards, and I'll speak more towards institutional investors. For us, where are the opportunities, how should we think about our asset allocation. There is an absolute focus on movement towards where should the asset allocation be in an inflationary environment. The conversations around duration and fixed income, some people actually thinking less exposure to fixed income, greater exposure to things like real estate. So again, it's really -- there's no single answer and it's probably as broad a conversation that I've had with clients. As long as I can remember, there's no common theme of where the next step is for any one institution. That said, the good news is the breadth of our capabilities puts us in a position where we can serve any one of the decisions that many of these institutional clients will take. Mike Cyprus : And just a follow-up question, if I could, just on ESG. I guess two prongs here. One, maybe you could just update us a little bit on some of your initiatives, remind us how much in AUM and flows you guys are seeing. And then just more broadly on ESG, what sort of risk and opportunities do you see from increased ESG regulation but also regulatory scrutiny on ESG products that we're seeing come to the industry? Marty Flanagan : Let me hit the more macro points and turn it to Allison. I will say it's fascinating. The ESG conversation has evolved quite dramatically, I'd say, over the last six months. And it is a different conversation in different parts of the world where the EU, in particular, the UK dramatically far ahead of where the United States is and much more specific on what ESG means and how to implement ESG within the portfolios. The good news about it is you have a road map, you know what you're doing. Obviously, here in the United States, it's a very different conversation client by client. And from our perspective, what we've done everywhere is we don't have a top-down policy when we think about ESG. It is really client-driven, portfolio management driven, supported by an ESG team and that's how we have implemented it. It is harder in the United States, I'd say, in particular, because the road map is not there. There is absolutely -- obviously, you'd see the others, regulatory push that is coming to be much more specific on climate. And ESG, I ultimately think a framework will be very, very helpful. But in this current moment, it's really quite challenging. Allison, do you want to pick it up from there? Allison Dukes : I mean I would just say in a couple of the specifics as of the end of June 30th, we managed $77 billion in ESG AUM across over 200 funds and mandates, that's about 6% of our overall AUM. So it's quite a bit lower on an absolute basis relative to where we were in the first quarter, but that's really a function of the market declines and some of the outflows. We did see about $2.4 billion in outflows in that ESG AUM and that was really driven by active retail and in particular, our GTR and some of our quantitative equity strategies. So it's kind of consistent with -- it's really a subsection of some of the outflows we've been talking about in terms of other categorization. Beyond that, we really think about our AUM in terms of trying to move towards what we would consider a minimal but systematic integration of our ESG integration. And we've got about 85% of our AUM currently under this definition of minimal but systematic integration. And our aspiration is to get all of our AUMs under the same kind of integration category, and it's really thinking about our ESG approach as being defined and consistently applied across all -- from all of the portfolio managers and really ESG considerations being used consistently in the investment decisions. But again, that all is kind of under the banner of some of the macro themes that Marty gave you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Maybe if I could just focus on some of the investment in the T&E and getting out on the road more and talking with financial advisers on the retail side. Maybe if you could just, I guess, characterize the current environment. Is it similar to what you described on the institutional side, Marty, in terms of sort of initially being frozen? But now obviously, with markets down a lot, there's a lot more opportunity. And do you think getting on the road more and getting out in front of advisers that, that will have a demonstrable positive impact on sales growth in the retail channels? Just maybe your outlook on that as we move forward in the second half. Marty Flanagan : Look, a couple of comments. I'd say spending time with both wealth management platforms, advisers and institutional clients, frankly, now in the United States and Europe, it\u2019s [palpable], the different engagements, obviously, with clients. I think we've all said that to one another. And again, everybody on this call has been having that same experience. There is just -- Zoom is wonderful, but it is just not the same. And it does advance relationships and exchange of thoughts and opportunities, there's no question in my mind. I'm not going to tell you that it's going to drive sales straight up through the moon. I just don't think you can make that correlation but it is clearly a net positive. And it is something, as Allison said, we are going to be very disciplined on discretionary travel internally, although we think that's important. We can live without that we have for the last few years. But we are really -- we're just going to continue to be with our clients because we think that's so important for the business and the relationships that we have. Brian Bedell : And then just a follow-up on longer-term expenses. Obviously, you're continuing to manage expenses diligently in this environment. Any commentary about sort of structural expense saves from migration of the custody and back office. I think you're using the [State] Alpha platform and that converts, I think, over a longer time frame, the Alpha platform in [stage three], that is over a longer time frame of a couple of years. Can you talk about what -- how that might -- is that material to impacting the cost base when that migration occurs, or is that more futuristic? Marty Flanagan : So it is an important undertaking for us and it's probably two to three years out. We are at the stage of starting the sort of rolling implementation. It is very broad. It's very deep. It's quite complex, as you would imagine, because it is really a total step back on our operating platform. And we think it's really meaningful and important for the future of the organization, what we're trying to do with data and et cetera, no different than, again, every organization on this phone. There are other areas. Again, Allison had spoke to, we are looking very hard within the organization, and it is sort of a muscle that we -- are have been developing over the last few years that is getting stronger and stronger of challenging ourselves where the dollars spent. And is that the right spot for the dollar, or should it be reallocated towards growth and driving operating income. Allison hit the areas, you know the areas whether it be China, ETFs, et cetera, and the private markets. That said, there will be times where in that process, we'll say the best place for this dollar to go is to the bottom line. So we are pulling on all of those levers. And we just constantly do it in a downturn where our market doesn't make us wake up and think we should do it, this is core to what we do. And I think, again, as we continue to point out over the last couple of years, you can see with the movement in the effective fee rate and our ability to maintain margins is something we keep pointing to. Again, in this downturn, protecting margins is a much more difficult thing to do. And I would just reiterate the point that Allison had said earlier. Markets will return. And in that period, you'll see the expansion of our margin, again, while, in fact, we continue to invest in the future or make the decision have that next dollar drop to the bottom line. Brian Bedell : Thanks for the color. I have a follow-up, and I'll get back into the queue. Operator : And our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : So I guess I want to pull out a little more from you in terms of your thoughts on clients. You both mentioned lower gross sales but kind of flat redemptions, which in a way in a market downturn is reasonable. So you have a growing ETF franchise. Do you think as people come back as markets settle eventually, do people come back via the ETF over single stocks and mutual funds in your mind, what have you seen in the past? And then which inflation protected products and higher interest rate position products do you think might see some of that shifting money? Marty Flanagan : Yes, a couple of comments. So first of all, what I'd say it's hard to predict the future in this immediate moment. But again, that's what we're all meant to be doing. The ETF is sort of in wealth management platform. So the ETF is obviously a vehicle of choice. The mutual fund still has a place. It doesn't have the same focus right now that SMAs and ETFs has. But in fact, it's an important part of it. We do see -- we believe that, that vehicle will continue to be a part of the answer going forward. That said, what really matters is the investment capability that's within each of the vehicles. We look at that as a primary driver as you move to what are the areas of asset classes that will be more interesting in this environment. Bank loans will continue to be with -- you're going to continue to see the commodity suite of within our organization with the active passes, continue to be an area of focus. Real estate is another area of focus for the organization. So there are a number of areas that, again, clients are turning to, and you've seen that over the prior year or so. And quite frankly, there is greater conversations on retail platforms of a movement back towards focus on value suites of equities, which needless to say, that has not been an area of focus over the last period of time. Allison, anything you would add to that? Allison Dukes : No, I actually -- I think you covered it. Glenn Schorr : Maybe just one other thought process on product preference. You have a growing private markets business even in this backdrop. I'm curious, just big picture thoughts on performance, client interest flows, opportunities and as a comparison to all your other public market-oriented vehicles. Marty Flanagan : Again, hard to totally compare and contrast. But look, we've all seen the growth in private markets over the last decade. It continues to be an area of focus for us where we have areas of strength. It continues to be an area of growth and accelerating growth, and we are turning our attention to continuing to organically drive that growth, and it is a part of any conversation that we're having with our institutional clients, in particular. And now the wealth management platforms looking for ways to find exposure to alternative capabilities for us. The most prominent one that is coming down the path right now is here in the United States on the wealth management platform and quite frankly, it's been quite successful, outside of the United States through a joint venture we've done with UBS. So again, it continues to be an area of focus for us, a continued area of growth as we look forward to the quarters ahead. Allison Dukes : I mean I just -- I'd add to that. I think we continue to see really strong originations overall, inflows into our private markets capability, particularly particularly into our direct real estate business of late. You've got kind of a confluence of factors and events happening there as there's perhaps a shift in some preference for some real assets in this environment and at the same time, you're starting to see given the downturn in the equity markets. From an allocation perspective, you've got maybe perhaps some overexposure to real assets at the moment, to real estate at the moment relative to benchmarks, and so that's going to take some time to normalize out. But despite that, we continue to see very strong growth in overall client commitments to direct real estate in the first half of the year. And obviously, very strong interest, primarily from our institutional channel. But as Marty noted, with the growth that we have and some retail focused strategies, we're starting to see some positive signs there. We've got quite a bit of dry powder in our business, and that's really the capital we have from clients that has not yet been deployed in terms of direct mandates. And that's really kind of captured in that one not funded pipeline on the institutional side and the growing allocation we have there to alternatives really does point to the growth in the direct real estate business. So I mean, I think overall that we're very cautiously optimistic that we could continue to see good growth there. And I'd say on the senior loan side, at some point, there will be some desire as credit spreads start to widen for exposure there. At the moment, it's been really managing the interest rate exposure but there will be credit risk exposure that clients are going to be seeking and that's going to bode well for our platform also. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Dan Fannon : I wanted to talk about performance. And looking as you look at your active franchise and are there products or categories that you see that are performing well that have the potential to grow at a faster pace as the market becomes more stable or the gross sales environment improves? Looking at your US value, it looks like that when your number has gotten a lot better. I don't know if you just kind of think about it, as you look at all the various products, anything that stands out that has the potential to really -- to potentially improve in any way? Marty Flanagan : So if you look -- a few comments. If you look at the fixed income, suite of products continue to be strong and demand continues to be there. Obviously, shorter duration fixed income at the moment. And you would be surprised if the market environment that we're in, you also highlighted, if you look at the US value franchise, the performance has improved quite dramatically. That has been an area of -- out of favor from a demand point of view, from an industry -- not unique to us, but from an industry perspective. Quite frankly, I've been in many number of conversations over the last number of months where there's a conversation of people turning to US value as an asset class. And if you ask me that question, 12, 24 months ago that's just was not on the horizon. The other area that's really important to us is the global equity franchise emerging markets in particular. And the performance is challenged at the moment. That said, I think it's some of the most just as by arguably the most talented emerging markets manager in the business and its shorter term performance is improving quite strongly. And that's going to be an asset class and even though it's not in favor right now, it's going to produce spectacular results for clients and no doubt return to net inflows in the quarters ahead. Dan Fannon : And then just a question on China and the backlog or the outlook for new funds. I think that's around six new funds with just under $2 billion in flows in the second quarter. How do you think that's tracking for the back half of the year? Allison Dukes : Hard to say exactly. I mean, I would say, overall, let me compare -- maybe second half of '22 may not look all that different from the second half of '21 -- first half of '22. Let me say that again and make sure that's clear. Second half of '22 may not look that different from the first half of '22 in terms of new product launches in China. I do think it's highly dependent on just where they go with COVID measures. And so really how the government thinks about the economy there and some of the growth they may be stimulating. So we're going to be watching that very carefully, and we're going to be positioning product very carefully against that. Relative to '21, it's certainly lower and different. In terms of our new product launches last year, you would have seen more balanced and equity focused products. What you've seen so far this year is a little more fixed income focused, which makes sense just given where sentiment and client preference is at the moment. So not sure if that's helpful. It's hard to say given the measures that are continuing to evolve there but that's generally how we're thinking about it and what we'll be watching for. Marty Flanagan : And Dan, here's how I think about it, and you're asking the right question. So where we believe China is in sort of the economic cycle, it's looking towards a rebound, so they're ahead of the United States and Europe. There is a lot of focus on the leadership to stimulate the economy for all the reasons that we know about. So I look at those two powerful forces of reason to be optimistic. The one to be cautious about is just what Allison said, it is still a very challenged lockdown COVID environment, although they are easing. And so is it and let's say, if you sort of model through COVID, you have those other two factors holding true, we continue to look at China as being a contributor and a growing contributor again. Time frames are hard to determine. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Patrick Davitt : So the active bond inflows, I think, were pretty notable relative to what we're seeing in the industry, right, where the active bond flows look like it's going to be one of the worst quarters ever. I saw the comment about short duration in the deck, but it still seems like a pretty dramatic departure from what the industry saw. So anything else you could point to about your mix strategies and/or how you distribute these products that you think caused such a dramatic positive break with what the industry is seeing on the active bond side? Marty Flanagan : You're right, from an industry perspective, the results are very, very strong. And it really is just a reflection of the depth, breadth and capabilities of the team and the way that they've gained confidence within the channels. I don't know that I would highlight anything other more specific than that, but a recognition of the talent and how we are interfacing with our clients. So again, it's wonderful to see when you're relatively outperforming what is a very challenging market environment. Allison Dukes : The only thing I'd add to that is China. China definitely helped drive some of the strength in fixed income as well. And I think that points to us again, the underlying strength we have in our positioning in China. Greg Ketron : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : And our last question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Bailey : This is actually Ryan Bailey on for Alex. So the first question I was going to ask was around the net revenue yields. Some of the market headwinds, particularly FX, I think, got worse later in 2Q. So can you give us a sense of what the exit rate was for the net revenue yield versus what was reported for 2Q? Allison Dukes : We\u2019ve really -- that revenue yield really is a function of overall averages. It's average AUM, there's really not an exit rate in it. If you think about what was driving net revenue yield inside of the quarter, I mean, it is almost entirely explained by the declining equity markets and then secondarily, but also very importantly, the continued growing asset mix shift that we're experiencing towards our passive products. You have some positive offsets in that just in terms of the abatement of money market waivers and an extra day in the quarter, but net revenue yield really is pretty simply explained by the overall declining equity markets and the pressure we experienced in that along with the mix shift in our AUM. In terms of exit rate and how you should think about it for the future quarters, I would say we would expect to continue to see demand for our passive capabilities. We expect to continue to see pressure on our equity AUM just given the exit rates in terms of the market impact on the quarter. And so I would expect to see net revenue yield continue to grind a little bit tighter in the quarter. But I'll just remind everybody that we really focus on both revenue -- net revenue yield is just an output, it's not an input and it doesn't reflect changes in the fee rates. It's really just the mix shift and the overall market impact. We continue to focus on revenue stabilizing it for now, growing it and really managing our expense base against that and for the business profile, not just that we have today that we expect to continue to evolve and shift to in the coming years. Ryan Bailey : And maybe just to hit on that last comment around expenses. Allison, I think you mentioned that you expect the margin to eventually stabilize and then expand as markets return and that 35% was kind of the right place to be in for the business cycle. I guess just as we think through the dynamics for the next quarter, the challenging market for 2Q, is it fair to think that maybe we slip a little bit below where we where for 2Q as we enter next quarter? Allison Dukes : I mean, I do think that when you think about where asset levels were at June 30th and just the entry point into the quarter with asset levels, you can certainly net revenue will continue to be under pressure in the quarter. And so while we are hyper focused on expenses, as you've heard us talk about, you can't expect what's the overall impact of that. In terms of operating margin, look, if we continue to see equity markets under this kind of pressure throughout the quarter, it will be difficult. But I think it's reasonable to expect operating margins going to be maybe at or slightly below where it was in the second quarter. Lots of moving parts and the market being the biggest driver in that, but we're going to continue to stay focused on managing what we can commit, what we can manage and controlling what we can control. And I think we're wrapping up here, but I'll just close with we are operating from a position of strength there. We do have expense discipline measures in place that give us the opportunity to be very thoughtful about the margin from here. And our balance sheet is in a strong place and we have the opportunity to be opportunistic and to continue and invest in our business. And that's most important, because these markets will stabilize. And I think we're really well positioned in terms of our key capabilities and supporting our clients and growing with them from here. Marty Flanagan : Well, let me just say thank you for your time. Thank you for your questions and engagement. And look forward to being in touch with everybody over the next months before we visit once again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. You may all disconnect at this time.",

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Greg Ketron, Invesco's Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Greg Ketron : Thanks, operator, and to all of you joining us on Invesco's quarterly earnings call. In addition to our press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address today. The press release and presentation are available on our website invesco.com. This information can be found by going to the Investor Relations section of the website. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slide two of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix for the appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. Finally, Invesco is not responsible for and does not edit or guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized webcasts are located on our Website. Marty Flanagan, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Allison Dukes, Chief Financial Officer, will present our results this morning. After we complete the presentation, we will open up the call for questions. Now I'll turn the call over to Marty. Marty Flanagan : Thank you, Greg. And those so inclined to follow along, I\u2019ll start on Slide 3 and the highlight page. So the challenging backdrop continued in the third quarter as most major equity and bond market indices moved lower. Investors continue to behave cautiously seeking risk-off trades that impact industry flows as well as the level and mix of assets under management. The dynamic environment we are in favors money managers that have a broad diversified range of capabilities that meet the client's demands in this market. Invesco continues to prove to be one of the few global investment managers that can do that, with net flows momentum in market leadership positions in areas of high client demand. Despite historic market declines, the firm generated net long-term inflows this quarter in active fixed income, Greater China, and our institutional channel. All three of these areas have also garnered net long-term inflows on a year-to-date basis, along with our global ETF business and the private markets capabilities. I'll begin with our active fixed income capabilities, which has been a steady source of growth this year and is a testament to the diversity of the investment platform. The asset class generated net inflows of $3.7 billion in the quarter with strong demand from clients of Asia Pacific. We managed nearly $380 billion back to fixed income across the full spectrum of investment offerings, vehicles serving retail clients as some of the world's largest institutions. Our Greater China Business delivered $2.1 billion of net long-term inflows this quarter, Invesco Great Wall, our China joint venture, has fueled our growth and we continue to successfully launch new products, most notably in fixed income. We've grown consistently in the last several quarters despite the recent difficulties faced by the Chinese economy as a result of our strong local partner and our long-standing reputation as one of the top global investment managers in China. Our leading position in China is a result of many years of investment and hard work. As China and the global economy eventually recover, we expect our growth to accelerate in the fastest-growing market in our industry. Our institutional channel generated net inflows for the 12th consecutive quarter with $3.9 billion led by clients in Asia Pacific. The business has proven resilient throughout COVID-19 pandemic in the market downturn we're experiencing in 2022. Growth in institutional business as a result of investment our distribution team, the range of capabilities we bring to market and the build out of our solutions capability over the last several years, which is increasingly becoming a differentiator for Invesco. Despite volatility in the risk-off sentiment impacting global markets, we continue to win new mandates and our pipeline remain solid. We look forward to continuing our partnership with many of the world's leading organizations to meet the challenges of this uncertain time. While net inflows into ETFs are relatively flat in the third quarter, demand for ETF slowed industry-wide -- despite the slowdown, we maintain the leading position in ETFs and we expect to see growth rebounds as market volatility eases. On a year-to-date basis, we have generated strong organic growth and gained market share. We have continued investing in our private markets capability and we have experienced net outflows in the third quarter. Over the past year, we have generated organic growth against a very volatile market demonstrating the strength of our alternative platforms. Key to our alternative strategy is our strategic relationship with MassMutual, which is meaningful and continues to strengthen. In addition to managing over $10 billion in broker dealer, variable annuity and self-advice assets prior to this decline, we have over $3 billion in other investment relationships with MassMutual. This includes nearly $2.5 billion in commitments to various Invesco alternative strategies. The commitment for MassMutual has been growing over time and work on various strategies, including $400 million committed to our INREIT product. Having a partner like MassMutual as an investor adds significant reputational impact to our third-party investors. Considering the combined investment we haven't seen in co-investment vehicles, which totals $900 million, along with $2.5 billion in commitment from MassMutual in various alternative strategies is compelling partnership that enables us to bring products to market more quickly and brings with it the strong reputational backing of a world-class financial institution. While growth continued in key capability areas I mentioned, the firm experience net long-term outflows of $7.7 billion during the quarter, equity strategies would have been under pressure industry-wide, were the largest contributor to net outflows totaling $7.4 billion for the quarter. Client demand for emerging markets remain subdued and our developing markets fund had $2.8 billion in net outflows in the third quarter. While near-term headwinds persist, we have confidence that the equity global capabilities will be a driver of growth in the future when global markets recover and client demand for this important asset class returns. As we discussed last quarter, significant progress has been made building a stronger balance sheet position to help us weather this market downturn. We ended the quarter with a zero balance on over revolver and total debt outstanding is at the lowest level in years. Our cash balance increased over $1 billion and we maintain the flexibility we need to sustain investment in key growth areas. Last quarter, we mentioned that we met our target of $200 million in annual cost savings from our strategic evaluation. As market volatility continues, the need to maintain a disciplined approach to expense management is paramount. We are re-examining all aspects of discretionary spending relative to the environment we are in and we will be focused on near-term hiring and critical growth initiatives. We continue to thoughtfully balance managing through near-term market headwinds while investing for long-term growth. As always, we remain focused on helping clients meet their investment objectives invested in areas of strategic importance, scaling our operating platform, and efficiently allocated resources. By executing our long-term strategy, I'm confident Invesco will maintain this position as one of the leading firms in the industry while delivering compelling returns to shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Allison. Allison Dukes : Thank you, Marty, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with Slide 4. Investment performance continued to be solid in the third quarter with 57% and 62% of actively managed funds, and the top half of peers or beating benchmark on a three-year and a five-year basis. These results reflect continued strength in fixed income and balanced strategies where we continue to see strong client demand. Performance lags benchmark and certain equity strategies, but we experienced improvement over the past quarter in several key funds. Turning to Slide 5, we ended third quarter with $1.32 trillion in AUM, a decrease of $67 billion from the end of the second quarter. Global market declines and foreign exchange movements reduced assets under management by $72 billion, partially offset by total net inflows inclusive of $10 billion into money market products. As Marty noted, the firm experienced net long-term outflows of $7.7 billion this quarter amid continued market volatility. Active capabilities accounted for most of the outflows totaling $7.3 billion for the quarter, while passive net outflows accounted for the remaining $400 million. We sustained organic growth in several of our key capability areas and our net flow performance remains strong relative to industry peers. A driver of our resilience and relative outperformance has been the institutional channel, which delivered a 12th consecutive quarter of net inflows with $3.9 billion. We generated the strong inflows despite not renewing a $2.5 billion relationship during the quarter. While clients are carefully considering new fundings in these challenging markets, our growth in the institutional channel accelerated from the second quarter, and we continue to see new mandates fund across geographies, asset classes and the risk return spectrum. Offsetting growth and institutional were $11.6 billion of net outflows and the retail channel this quarter, primarily in the Americas and EMEA, as investors continue to seek lower risk exposure amid extreme market volatility. Net flows into ETF vehicles were relatively flat in the third quarter, with $300 million in net long term outflows. Demand for ETF slowed industry-wide. That driver, coupled with net outflows and commodities, and bank loan products created net flow headwinds for Invesco. Offsetting this were net inflows into fixed income ETFs, the low volatility suite and our Q-to-Q innovation suite led by the Q-to-Qm. Despite the slowdown in the third quarter, we maintain a leading position in ETF and we expect to see growth rebound as market volatility eases. On a year-to-date basis, net long term inflows into our ETF franchise are $23 billion, equivalent to a 12% organic growth rate. We've also gained market share year-to-date. Excluding the Q-to-Q, Invesco captured 4.7% of industry net inflows, higher than our 3.1% share of total industry assets under management. Now, turning to Slide 6, we experienced continued net outflows in the Americas and EMEA primarily in the retail channel. Growth picked up in Asia Pacific with over $5 billion of net long term inflows this quarter, led by China and Japan. Our China joint venture contributed $2.1 billion of net inflows, including $1.8 billion from nine new products launched during the quarter. As Marty highlighted, our joint venture remains a key strength and we expect growth to accelerate there as markets recover. Fixed Income capabilities have been a reliable source of growth for Invesco for several years now. Despite one of the most difficult bond markets in years, the third quarter was no exception to that reliability with $6.5 billion of net long-term inflows. The firm has now experienced net inflows into fixed income strategies for 15 straight quarters, a testament to the breadth of our offering as well as our strong investment performance in the asset class. Alternatives experienced net outflows of $5.3 billion in the third quarter. The largest drivers of net outflows were bank loans and commodity ETFs, which have attracted net inflows year-to-date, but saw investors pull back in the third quarter. While growth may slow in the near term as investors carefully consider asset allocations, we're confident that our alternatives business will be strategic driver of growth in the years to come. In fact, over the past volatile year, we've generated a 4% organic growth rate, excluding outflows and our GTR product, demonstrating the strength of our alternatives platform. Finally, as Marty noted, we experienced $7.4 billion of net outflows in equity capabilities. Global and developing market equities continue to account for the majority of net outflows in the asset class, with $4.3 billion in the quarter, including $2.8 billion from our developing markets fund. Moving to Slide 7, our institutional pipeline was $23 billion at quarter end modestly lower than $24 billion last quarter. Client fundings increased in the third quarter as compared to second quarter, and we continue to win new mandates despite the challenging environment. Our pipeline has been running in the mid 20 to mid-$30 billion range dating back to late 2019. So while this is at the lower end of the size range, we still see the pipeline as robust given the uncertain market environment. As we noted last quarter, that uncertainty is causing some mandates to take longer to fund and we would estimate the funding cycle of our pipeline is now in the three to four quarter range on average, as compared to two to three quarters previously. In summary, the pipeline continues to reflect a diverse business mix across asset classes, investment styles and geographies. Our solutions capability enabled 38% of the global institutional pipeline and continues to be a differentiator with clients. Turning to Slide 8, significant decline in global markets this year have put downward pressure on our revenue base. Net revenue of $1.11 billion in the third quarter was 5% lower than the prior quarter, and 17% lower than third quarter of 2021, primarily due to decline in active asset levels. Total adjusted operating expenses were $741 million, a decrease of $21 million from last quarter and $31 million as compared to the third quarter of 2021. The drivers of the decline from last quarter with G&A expenses, which were $11 million lower than last quarter and marketing expenses, which declined by $7 million consistent with the seasonally lower activity we often see in third quarter as well as the decline in discretionary spending. We also saw a slight decline in employee compensation expenses. Drivers of the decline from the third quarter of 2021 were compensation expenses and property office and technology expenses, despite the $3 million and duplicate rent for our new Atlanta headquarters that I mentioned last quarter. Embedded in our third quarter 2022 spending is continued investment in growth capabilities, as well as several transformational projects that will enhance the effectiveness of our corporate functions and enable us to reap the benefits of scale as markets recover. Current projects include a technology enabled human resources transformation, moving core finance systems to the cloud, and the foundational elements of the Alpha NextGen program. The savings we achieved in our strategic evaluation and the continued discipline we have installed have enabled us to make these strategic investments without meaningfully growing technology expensive. Compensation expenses declined $45 million, or 9% from the third quarter of 2021. Given the pace and magnitude of the market decline, it will take some time for certain elements of our expense base to adjust with lower revenue. We managed variable compensation to a full year outcome in line with company performance and competitive industry practices. This can cause quarter-to-quarter fluctuations and compensation expense. Historically, our compensation to net revenue ratio has been in the 38% to 42% range, and periods of revenue growth the ratio tends to move towards the lower end of this range, similar to 2021 when the ratio declined to 38%. During periods of revenue decline, as we are experiencing this year, the ratio tends to move towards the upper end of this range. Year-to-date, our compensation to net revenue ratio is 40%. If assets remain at quarter end levels, the full year ratio would continue to trend towards the upper end of the range driven by the lower net revenue base. Given the uncertain market environment, we are diligently managing expenses and evaluating all aspects of discretionary spending. We continue to invest in our key growth capabilities and we're focusing near term hiring in those areas. We will differ hiring for certain other positions as we focus our efforts on critical initiatives. As always, we remain focused on meeting the diverse needs of our clients and investing where it's necessary to do so. Finally, we are proceeding with investments and foundational technology projects that will enable growth and support future scale and our operations. Balancing these objectives will allow Invesco to provide rewarding careers for our employees, position our business for future growth and prudently manage our expense base. Moving to Slide 9, adjusted operating income was $369 million in the third quarter $43 million lower than the second quarter due to lower net revenue driven by market declines partially offset by lower operating expenses. Adjusted operating margin was 33.3% as compared to 35.1% in the second quarter, and an all-time high of 42.1% in the third quarter of last year. Earnings per share were $0.34 as compared to $0.39 last quarter, driven by the same factors that impacted adjusted operating income. The effective tax rate was 28.7% in the third quarter, due to a change in the mix of income across tax jurisdictions, including non-operating losses in lower tax entities. We estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 26% and 28% for the fourth quarter of 2022. The actual effective rate may vary from this estimate due to the impact of non-recurring items on pre-tax income and discrete tax items. I'll conclude with a few points on Slide 10. Maintaining balance sheet strength continues to be a top priority, particularly as we navigate this uncertain environment. Total debt was managed lower in the third quarter to $1.5 billion as of September 30 and we ended the quarter with a zero balance on a revolving credit facility. Our cash and cash equivalents balance is over $1 billion, an increase of nearly $100 million from June 30. Our leverage ratio as defined under our credit facility agreement was 0.7 times at the end of the third quarter in line with last quarter. Our leverage ratio improved from 0.9 times in the third quarter of last year despite lower EBITDA driven by the significant market declines. If preferred stock is included, our third quarter leverage ratio was 2.8 times. In this challenging environment, Invesco is strategically aligned to areas of high client demand. And we have the financial flexibility that will allow us to navigate current volatility while continuing to invest in the future. We will be extremely thoughtful in managing expenses through the near term, so that we can rapidly scale when recovery takes place. We maintain our unwavering commitment to serving the needs of our clients in any market and delivering long term value for our shareholders. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brian Bedell : Great, thanks. Good morning, folks. Maybe I could just start off on the expense side, Allison, you mentioned a couple of things on the initiatives that you're working on for the transformational projects. Any sense of sort of how much that might lower the expense space going forward? And then also related to that, on the comp to revenue, 42%. Should we think of that as a potential quarterly ceiling? Or as you indicated, they can be lagged and therefore can go over 42% in a really bad market and then you seek to calibrate that soon, soon thereafter? Allison Dukes : Sure. Good morning, Brian. Let me take the first one. So on the transformational projects, I'm not ready to provide any further estimates on what that could do in terms of lower expenses. The way I would think about it, and I wouldn't even say not ready, I'm not sure it's just the right way to think about why we would be doing it. A lot of this is to avoid, I would say future costs and it's also to create scalability. So some of the things we're doing in these enterprise systems, with our financial systems, with our human capital systems, moving our data into the cloud, it will reduce tech debt over the future. It will also give us the opportunity to scale as we just moved more data into the cloud and just have a more nimble infrastructure and continue to globalize the corporate functions that support our large operation.  We've talked about Alpha NextGen in the past, and we'll talk about it a whole lot more I'm sure in the future. Those are some early foundational investments that we're making in the middle and back office that will streamline and harmonize our operations and create efficiencies over time, but not necessarily from a P&L perspective that you'll see just yet. And there's quite a bit of investment that's going in along the way. On the comp-to-revenue side, our range is typically 38% to 42% on a full year, and we really don't look at it quarter-to-quarter. The quarter-to-quarter fluctuations are always there just as revenue fluctuates, but also as you have seasonality and things like payroll taxes and FICA. So we really look at it and manage to a full year basis, we're on an annual comp cycle and year-to-date, through the third quarter we were at about 40%. So as we think about what the full year look like, I'd say it'll be on the higher end of that range, not the lower end. And as we noted last year, full year 2021, we were closer to 38%. Brian Bedell : That makes sense. Allison Dukes : Hopefully that helps. Brian Bedell : Yes, yes, definitely. And then maybe if I can ask about fixed income, again, that's been a strength as you pointed out, as we now are in a much higher yield environment just coming into fourth quarter versus even just the third quarter. Maybe if you can talk about both on the retail demand side, if you're seeing that work into the channels yet, if you're seeing the sales pick up on retail funds. And then also on the institutional side, if you can comment on to what extent you think pension plans may reallocate to fixed income and how you are positioned there and could we see this really offset your equity outflows near-term? Marty Flanagan : It's a great question. Look, where rates are going, you've seen what's happened, everybody's shortened, gone, very conservative. You are -- you've not seen that move yet, but the conversations are brought in very, very much looking at the full spectrum of a fixed income with a race where they are making fixed income, longer data capabilities much more attractive. That's on the institutional side. As you know, institutions tend to be much less volatile, but they will make tactical allocations accordingly. On the retail side, again, I'd say it's too early. But all indications are -- it's - I would anticipate a broader range of investments into fixed income because of where the yields are moving. Brian Bedell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open. Brennan Hawken : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I was hoping to follow up on the expense outlook, Allison. You flagged a bunch of investments that you're making, including laying the groundwork for Alpha. So as we're thinking about entering into 2023, I know you're probably in the middle of the budgeting process now. So it's an early asking for an early read here. But should we continue to expect that there will be pressure to make investments and continue to like, gross out initiatives like Alpha, which maybe ultimately lead to some efficiencies, but could result in expenses being maybe a little bit more stubborn and inflexible in the near-term? Is that fair for thinking about 23? Or is it too pessimistic? Allison Dukes : It's a great question and it's a hard one to answer exactly and certainly not going to give firm expense guidance just yet. We are deep in the budgeting season. But let's just talk maybe, generally about how we think about the expense base and what we can manage and what we can't manage. There is some variability in our expenses. As you know, we've always guided to that about a third of our expenses are variable. It's -- you see it primarily on the compensation side, you're certainly seeing that this year. I think I'd point to a couple of things. One, despite this really challenging environment, we are managing to keep expenses kind of flat to down on most line items relative to last year. And that's because we are continuing to invest in a lot of these growth areas that we don't think it makes sense to pause on. It just simply wouldn't be good business for us to pause on key foundational transformational projects that really puts the firm in a position to grow and to scale and to be where we need to be to support our clients. So as I think about how stubborn or not our expenses, I think a couple of things, I'd reiterate the comments I made around discretionary expenses. There are elements of discretionary expenses that we're looking at very rigorously. We're being very thoughtful about hiring. We're really focused on our key growth areas and managing our hiring against that. You've seen us, I think, do some pretty good work on facilities and some of the fixed costs that we have that we think we can continue to unlock and reallocate into areas of more transformational growth. And we'll continue to make progress against some of those areas as well. I don't feel like these investments hamstring our ability. I really don't. I think it actually puts us in a position to scale and recover faster when markets do turn and they will. Marty Flanagan : Yes, Brennan, Allison is exactly we are looking at everything you would imagine and hopefully would do and is responsible for us to do it. And as you say in the short-term, the - more discretionary things you can make some progress. It's not going to change anybody's lives, but it's exactly the very responsible thing to do and we're just very focused on building scale within the organization. And that snapback will be very, very strong. And again, I would point you to what we've done historically, and if we continue to be very focused on putting the firm in a position of great success. Brennan Hawken : Sure. I recognize it\u2019s a balance, which is how I tried to position the question. Okay, transitioning to revenue, fee rate was under more pressure than I had actually expected. Should we expect that fee rate to continue? Maybe could you give us an idea about what the exit rate or the October rate kind of look like? Is that that showing continued pressure just given the general profile of markets through the quarter? And just as sort of a more nitty item, the other revenue has been under some pressure. I know there is a transactional volume there. Is this sort of a floor - reasonable floor to think about for the other revenue? Or could this continue to come down? Allison Dukes : Sure, thanks, Brennan, those are good questions. Let me say on the fee rate one, as you know, we really don't manage the fee rate. And then the net revenue yield in particular is just an output of a whole lot of different factors. And so maybe thinking about what drove the net revenue yield declines in the quarter and then extrapolating that to what could that mean for the future. The biggest pressure on that revenue yield is the declining equity markets, and in particular, the declines in emerging markets and developing markets, global equities, emerging markets, they are a meaningful part of our portfolio. And so the market declines in those particular asset classes further exacerbate the pressure on our fee rate. You also seek to see asset mix shift and the demand that we experienced for money markets and the risk-off exposure. So while we've benefited on one side of the ledger from the growth and some of those risk-off exposures, certainly we've got real pressure and the asset mix shift at the same time. You also saw a decrease in the other revenue from those in the other revenue line item. And I'll get to that in a second that you asked about. And so those are all the sort of the downward pressures, what could that mean for the future? I mean, I think, look, there are a few things going on. One, the ending assets under management was quite a bit lower about $95 billion lower than the average AUM for the quarter. So it's going to continue to put pressure on revenue, which will put pressure on just the overall fee rate yield that comes out of that. If we expect to continue growth and passive, which we do, they come at lower fees. And at the moment, given the geopolitical tensions, I would expect continued pressure and some of those emerging markets developing markets categories as well. So this does put pressure on the overall yield there. All that is dependent upon where assets were at 930. And of course, all that subject to change as the markets do what the markets will do over the balance of this quarter. Other revenue, as you noted, that was about $9 million lower than the prior quarter. And that was really due to lower transaction fees, in particular in global real estate and some front end mutual fund fees. So it's a function of activity levels. I don't think it's a new normal necessarily, but if you think about just the activity levels, and just really the pretty outstanding volatility we experienced inside of the third quarter and it did put pressure on that category, and that will recover as activity levels recover. Brennan Hawken : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open. Glenn Schorr : Thanks, appreciate it. I'm curious on your comments on the retail side. Obviously, in an environment like this retail is going to outflow That's unfortunate, but it's going to happen every time. But as they transition towards low risk exposures as they try to capture yield, I'm curious on what you can specifically do to capture that demand, your presence obviously is huge in the channel, your product mix is great. There's rising demand on fixed income ETFs. I'm just curious on what can be done on the education front, how can you hold the channel's hand so to speak and do a better job of capturing some of those outflows? Marty Flanagan : Yes, you're exactly right. I think we're uniquely positioned here. Right. So with the range of capabilities that we have there's no discussion unless you start there. And but secondly, just the capabilities on the distribution side, things like investment consulting in the field, working with financial consultants, all the financial advisors in the marketplace already, the conversations are positioning for when you get back in the market, whether it be equities or fixed income. And those are real conversations. I'm sure it's happening everywhere. But we have the ability with the capabilities we have and also the coverage we have in the market, but also with the marketing digital capabilities we\u2019re informed in the engagements that we have. So from my perspective, you don't want to turn into one quarter, two quarters, I don't think you're that far out, you're probably closer to the bottom than the top. And with that, you'll get reallocation into a broader range of capabilities. Glenn Schorr : A part of on-going processes I guess. Marty Flanagan : Yes, yes. Glenn Schorr : So I heard the comments on what outflows on the alternative side, again, product of the environment. But can we focus a little more on your private market side what it may be just refresh. What investments are being made now and where you're seeing client demand, and if that could be an offset going forward as well? Marty Flanagan : Yes, so real estate continues to be a very dominant asset class for us, and also, parts of within credit bank loans CLOs, about more challenging in the short term, where people are nervous about recession and impact on credit. But that said, there are two areas where opposition continually seek growth, and it's an area of future focus very much. The other very specific area that we've been talking about is getting some alternative capabilities into wealth management channels. We continue to be very focused on that. And from my perspective, 2023 should be the year when we start to see greater traction in leading the way, and there'll be something behind that on the debt side. So that is another area of absolute focus for us as an organization. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Thanks, Marty. Marty Flanagan : Thanks Glenn. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning, thanks for taking the questions. Maybe to further the discussion on expenses, looking to think about how we can think about the concept of scalability better here, maybe starting, what cost line items do you think are going to be most impacted by improved scalability and maybe which are not I would assume, as G&A and tech that are really going to see the scale benefits. And I think Invesco maybe historically thought about margins on incremental revenue of somewhere, 50%, 60%, maybe 50%, 60% plus. The investments that you're making in scalability, take margins on incremental, incremental revenues to levels that are different than what we've seen in the past. And is it like a little bit? Or is it maybe meaningfully better given what you're doing? Allison Dukes : Let me start with the first one around, where should we see the most scalability. And I think you're right, it would be the G&A and tech line items. But I'd also point to marketing; marketing is a pretty scalable line item as well. And one that, it's also a little bit, you can pull back on some of the discretionary expenses and marketing, but we're not going to pull back on travel and being in front of our clients at precisely the time when they need to see us and we need to be in front of them. And we need to be actively talking to them. And so I do think is, is I think about what that looks like on the upside. It doesn't budge quite as much on the way up, and there's some benefits there as well. In terms of and maybe I'll let Marty chime in on sort of relative to the past, since mine is only a couple of years back. But I would say in terms of the expenses, where the investments we're making and some of these technology projects doesn't give us even more scalability. I think perhaps, it's really necessary to think about where the firm's been and where we've come from. We closed the Oppenheimer acquisition just on the eve of COVID. And so you started to see, you saw a material increase in the size of the firm, just on the eve of what has now been a few rather volatile, challenging years. But what we are doing in terms of just further integrating all the various aspects of the firm and creating a unified system and platform across many different parts of the overall enterprise framework, all of this will allow us to just grow and scale from here, I think in a more seamless fashion because you just don't have the redundancy and systems that are very difficult when the data is not in the cloud. And so it gives us flexibility to adjust our platform and to serve our clients in ways that would have just been much more difficult. Said differently, without doing this we'd be spending a whole lot more to make any nimble shifts in the environment. Marty Flanagan : Yes, let me add. So if you look at not too long ago when our profit margin was over 40% Is that a cap? The answer's no. So if we had the same local assets under management when we complete this work we will be north of that operating margin. So and how does that happen and this might be too much information, but literally application rationalization that is happening pretty holistically because of a new set of technologies that really didn't exist in the past that can allow that to happen. Also just going looking at, what clients are looking for in front to back the breadth of capabilities, if it's inconsistent with where client demand is, we're looking from sort of all front to back, support structures around that. That's where you get the scalability. And those are the efforts that we're on right now. And it's hard to explain in a simple line item, because they're holistic and how we look at things. So that has been scalability within our capabilities to the client demand is really the headline. And there's a lot of detail underneath it. Ken Worthington : Great. Thank you. And then maybe just following up U.K. pensions, to what extent did you see stress in the U.K. pension market. Did that flow through to impact Invesco either in 3Q or as we began 4Q? And given that Invesco has been building out fixed income and solutions globally, might there be a change to the U.K. LDI pension market? And does that make for an opportunity for Invesco? Marty Flanagan : Yes. So the good news is we did not have any LDI exposure. So that will be an impact. I do think post -- call this event, it will definitely open up opportunities for other managers and capabilities like we have now. Is that next quarter? Likely not. But when you look through next year, I suspect there's going to be some real opportunities. Ken Worthington : Thank you. Allison Dukes : I will say, I do think part of what we experienced there, you did see clients looking to meet some of these obligations. And so they were liquidating some of their positions and we were on the receiving end of some of that. So we didn't -- we didn't see nothing there in terms of the overall impact, and that's just kind of part of the overall, I'd say market stress and volatility we've been managing through. Marty Flanagan : Actually, that's a good point. So it's analogous to when there's pressure on money funds or in the financial crisis, if you had a very liquid money fund portfolio, you became a source of funds. And that's a little bit what happened with some of these LDI situations. Ken Worthington : Okay. Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open. Dan Fannon : Thanks, good morning. Wanted to follow up on fixed income and specifically, active fixed income domestically. Can you talk about which products and capabilities you have that are either with good performance or already kind of scale that could benefit from what is the potential for kind of larger flows. And I guess if they're separate between institutional and retail in terms of the products that would be helpful also. Marty Flanagan : I'll make a couple of comments, and Allison can chime in. So it's a broad suite of capabilities, and it's really highly performing across the fixed item team. So that's really good news. And it's not all is available in retail and institutional simply because of demand within that marketplace. So -- we have the long-term record stability of team and demand coming. So we look at it as just a real opportunity for us over the next few quarters. Dan Fannon : So I guess is that core, core plus, I guess I don't know what the funds are. Could you talk about what the actual products are. Marty Flanagan : Anything from short duration core, core plus bank loans, credit, it's the whole suite, Dan. Allison Dukes : Munis. Marty Flanagan : Munis is a very strong capability. That was outflow last quarter. Dan Fannon : You would characterize them all at scale already. Marty Flanagan : Not every single asset -- fixed income asset class is not a scale, which we've talked about. So direct lending is not at scale, some of the distressed credits not at scale. So -- we have a number of them at scale with performance backers and talented managers. Dan Fannon : Okay. And then just a follow-up on the China. There are several product launches in the quarter, and that seems to be kind of a continuing trend. Is there a backlog as we think about kind of launches here into the fourth quarter or into next year that you can quantify or talk to? Allison Dukes : Hard to quantify that exactly. I mean, yes, just to reiterate, we saw about $2.1 billion in inflows into our China JV. And of that about $1.8 billion came from new product launches. Those were mostly in fixed income asset classes, which -- it makes sense in this environment. We do tend to see a lot of fixed income and balanced interest less so equity at the moment, though historically, we certainly benefited from some of the equity funds that have been launched in more risk-on environment. That is -- it is just a function of a dynamic of that market. Hard to point to a backlog, but I guess I would say it differently and say this is kind of the way that market functions. And I don't expect that to change in the near term. I do think the overall $2.1 billion just really, again, speaks to the resiliency of that market. And the fact that we invested quite early ahead of many of our competitors in that market, and we're really well positioned to capture some of the flows there in both challenging markets and better markets. This has certainly been a more challenging year for China, though. Dan Fannon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Katz with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. William Katz : Okay, thank you very much for taking the questions this morning. Just three for me, just maybe just round out discussion. Can you tell me when you say you think fixed income picks up that really seems logical, where do you expect that allocation to rotate from? Is it cash, equity, private market alternative allocations -- what -- I know you obviously have a very broad client franchise? But what generally can you say in terms of where the money might come from? Marty Flanagan : Bill, it's a great question. And the reality is every client is different. So -- but what I would say just as a general comment, if you look in wealth management platforms, in particular, cash levels and you'll notice and everybody on the phone to this cash levels are very, very high. And I think allocations in equities and fixed income, the first quarter call is going to be cash levels. I can't speak for how the other movements would happen, just again, as every individual and every institution is very different than their profile. But I'd start with very high cash levels as a funding source. William Katz : Okay. That's how I figure it. Second question is just going back to China. You certainly have very impressive sort of new product opportunity. Could you just sort of step back a little bit, and where do you think you are in terms of the maturation of the platform itself? How many more incremental products do you think you can roll out -- and then is it -- or is it -- and/or is it a function of sort of scaling those products? And I think the average is about $200 million in what you sort of said this morning, but how big can these things get? Is there a proxy? Is it U.S. as a marketplace? Is it Canada? How should we be thinking about maybe the end look for that platform? Marty Flanagan : Yes. It's a really good question, Bill. And it is a different market than the United States and just a couple of comments. It's extremely competitive. And performance matters. There's a lot of alpha there. So the vast majority of all the capabilities in the marketplace are active, whether it be equity or fixed income, balanced products there also. But it has profile of fund launches, which is not atypical, Korea was the same way for a good period of time. I think it will mature to on-going investments into the products in the marketplace, but that that's going to come with time. And just the sheer size of the market, you're going to realize at some point, they're going to be very, very, very big portfolios. And I'd imagine starting to move away from product launches as the primary element of raising assets under management but that's probably 2, 3, 4 years before it starts to happen. William Katz : Okay. Thanks for the patience answering all the questions. Final one for me, we haven't talked about in a while. M&A just given what's going on between the sort of the rolling over of also the reduction in sort of trailing 12-month EBITDA, improvement in the leverage ratio, but nonetheless, still pretty fat leverage ratios when it concludes preferred. How are you thinking about reinvestment back into the business versus any kind of acquisition, and within that acquisition, where are you most focused at this point in time? Marty Flanagan : Yes. Good question. The story has not changed. Every next dollar is reinvestment back in the company right now. And if you look at what we've just talked about today, the key capabilities that we highlight, we see great opportunities very much in those areas, and that is where our focus is. We don't see a whole lot of gaps in our capabilities back to the conversation Dan had mentioned are we at scale in all the areas that we want to be now. And if we don't have the capability, and we don't think it would take too long for us to build it, that's when we would go to the market. So our view would be consistent of -- it has to be strategic, it has to be something client demand. It has to be something that's complementary, little overlap with the organization, financials have to work and this got to be cultural alignment. So that's just not change. This is how we think about it. That might lead you to more bolt-on acquisitions in sort of the alternative space. But right now, I don't see a whole lot moving as best we can tell public market prices versus the view of a seller are not aligned right now. So -- but it's not a focus. It's the focus on the organization. Allison Dukes : I would just chime in on that. I would say there's nothing about our balance sheet or our share price that's changing our focus. Our focus continues to be that the greatest investment we have is to continue to grow organically and invest in ourselves. We've got a really strong, well-diversified platform today. I think you see the benefits of that. You really -- you saw it in these last few quarters where our flows continue to outperform the broader peer set. We continue to have real pockets of strength, pockets of resiliency and it's a testament to the diversified platform that we have. And so as we think about the opportunities we have from here, we see an opportunity to continue to invest in ourselves and grow these capabilities in a much more efficient, shareholder-friendly way than anything we could ever do inorganically. And at the same time, we are making progress on the balance sheet, and we are returning capital to shareholders. I think we've made really significant progress on the balance sheet over the last year. Certainly, over the last two years, you saw it even in this quarter as we grow cash and continue to manage debt levels down with every sort of opportunity we have. And at the same time, we're returning capital to shareholders and have done so pretty thoughtfully over the course of this year despite the challenging environment. So yes, we're more constrained than we would like to be given a really challenging industry backdrop, but the diversified platform and the opportunities we have to continue to invest in ourselves and grow some of these key growth capability areas. We're pretty bullish on the opportunities we have within our own portfolio. William Katz : Thank you so much for taking all the questions today. Marty Flanagan : Thanks, Bill. Allison Dukes : Thanks, Bill. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Cyprys. Michael Cyprys : Hey good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to circle back on the private market alternatives. I was hoping you might be able to update us on the progress of the private REIT product that you guys have, just in terms of the traction getting on platforms. And then in private credit, I hear are the comments around maybe not at the scale where you'd like it to be, but maybe you could talk about some of the steps you're taking to more meaningfully scale your private credit initiatives. Marty Flanagan : Yes. Great. Thank you. So the in-REIT capability right now, it's about $1.1 billion. It continues to -- we continue to on-board it. Are we where we want to be with all the onboarding? No, we're not done. We'll continue to make progress. It just continues, as I said last call, it's just -- it's a slog to get through it. We will though, and that's why we think it's a 2023 topic for increasing flows beyond the level that it's at right now, the performance is very, very strong. And we're behind that. There is another capability that we hope to get into market next year, more income type credit capability. With regard to private credit starts with a very, very good team. And they're seasoned. They have a very good track record. They'll be back in the market again, raising money and its performance, track record and team, and that's where we are right now. And with dislocations, we think of greater opportunities for them. And just holistically, what we're doing around the private markets platform is just ensuring we have all the resources that we need to compete to make a difference from the investment teams all the way through operational effectiveness and everything else you would hope that we would be doing. We look at as a real opportunity for us. Michael Cyprys : Great. Thanks and just a follow-up question maybe on the balance sheet and capital management. So you paid down the credit facility in the quarter. I guess just what are the opportunities here that there might be for incremental debt reduction before, I think the next maturity is in 2024. And then more broadly, how are you thinking about capital management priorities into 2023? And what do you need to see before buybacks could resume? Allison Dukes : Sure. Thanks Mike. So in terms of the debt from here, you're correct, the next maturity is at the very beginning of 2024. In terms of how are we thinking about it look, now it's a pretty attractive slug of capital just given where rates are moving. We certainly always have the opportunity to redeem something early. You saw us do that with the \u201822s earlier this year. Not sure what we'll do just yet, but we're always thinking about what that could look like in the trade-off as we continue to grow cash. We have made substantial progress against our debt this year. And so now we're in a position where we're rebuilding cash. You saw cash grow by $100 million with the revolver pay down at the same time this quarter. And so as I think about it, more than anything, I'd say we're thinking about it from a net leverage standpoint at the moment as we work to build cash, particularly in a volatile environment. As we think about returning capital to shareholders, first and foremost, we're committed to our common dividend and a steady increase in that common dividend, and we start there. And then we think about excess capital as the form of returning capital to shareholders in terms of share repurchases. So should we get to a point where we make the balance sheet progress we want to make, and we've got excess cash, then we can think about share repurchases. And we think about that sort of year-to-year. And certainly, it's a difficult environment to be thinking about it. And at the moment, as we are looking to continue to make progress against the balance sheet and make sure we weather a rather volatile market environment, but we will return to that at some point. Michael Cyprys : Great. Thank you.\\ Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Your line is open. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks, good morning everyone. I wanted to start with a longer-term question on China. You used to highlight a McKinsey target for 40% of global industry net flows from China over the coming years. Currently, do you think China can drive about half of flows or 40% of flows? And also any perspective on the mix between domestic and then foreign players like your Great Wall JV would be helpful, too. Thank you. Marty Flanagan : Yes. Look, I do, right? It's -- the fundamentals are strong second large economy in the world. They continue to develop capital markets they must to support the growth that they have. They continue to develop a retirement system, which they must do, again, for the population even with the geopolitical topics they are absolutely committed to continuing to open up the capital markets and for organizations such as Invesco. And as I said a few minutes ago, everybody joining just as -- it's a very competitive market. It's going to continue to evolve. But there's no question in my mind that when the economy strengthens, you're going to see flow levels increase to for sure, back to the levels that we saw before and they're going to grow from there. So we look at over the next 3 to 5 years is a very, very important market. With regard to -- what was the question about the competitors? Craig Siegenthaler : Also the mix between domestic businesses there and then also the foreign managers and foreign JVs like your Great Wall joint venture. Marty Flanagan : Yes. So again, we can point to -- we have something, I believe, on our website, Andrew Low went through. There's very specific information in there. Allison Dukes : It's a presentation from last summer that had some disclosures, yes. Marty Flanagan : So core looking at that. But from a local joint venture, we're at the top of the pack, which is great. Again, it takes us about with all the market movements, I think we're the 12th largest money -- local money manager -- excuse me, the 12th largest money manager in the wealth management channel in China. Now that could change now because of levels that's under management. So that was the last picture that I saw taken. So it's really competitive against the local managers. And as you know there are a number of foreign money managers that I think the very important thing that we point to that has differentiated us and will allow us to have the success that we've had is we've had management control with joint ventures from the beginning in many of the other joint ventures the form money manager had an ownership stake, but did not have management control. And that has really been a big movement where when you see our competitors making a point that they've taken a majority stake in their joint venture. What that really means is a movement towards them we're managing the joint venture. So we've seen that all the last number of years. So we like the position we're in. We're not naive to the competition levels, but the opportunity is a material one. Craig Siegenthaler : Thank you, Marty. And just for my follow-up, I\u2019ve a more short-term question probably for Allison. But other revenues declined by $9 million sequentially on an adjusted basis. I think most of that was probably real estate transaction fees, but -- can you talk about the drivers of that decline? And then just given sort of a muted backdrop, I wanted your perspective on if $48 million is roughly a floor given that 3Q was a bad backdrop and those fees probably were low? Or do you think there could be incremental downside risk from 3Q levels into 4Q or 1Q? Allison Dukes : So it was both real estate but also front-end mutual fund fees. So it was really kind of transaction volume driven is the way to think about it. No, I don't necessarily think I guess what I would say is, it's transaction volume driven. It doesn't necessarily mean that it continues to decline from here. I don't think we're setting some new level, very volatile quarter, given the risk-off environment that we've been in, it obviously impacted market levels, but also activity levels and transaction levels, as you saw, it was pretty holistically challenging. So really just a function of the quarter we're in, not necessarily a harbinger of where we will be from here. Craig Siegenthaler : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Patrick Davitt : Hey good morning guys. Most of my questions have been answered, but just a quick follow-up on the tax guidance. Is it fair to assume that the 4Q guidance of 26% to 28% is kind of a good run rate for the quarters beyond? Allison Dukes : Very hard to say. It really is a function of where the market will be and the mix of jurisdictions and where our operating -- rare income will be across those jurisdictions. We do expect -- we said in the fourth quarter for it to be 26% to 28%, I can't say just yet as to whether or not that's where it will be in 2023. It's possible it could be a little bit lower, but it's very much dependent on whether or not we start to see a market recovery. In particular, you see a real impact on our non-operating losses, which were our non-operating gains. Those are booked in some lower tax jurisdictions. And so when there are gains, it's quite beneficial to us at a lower tax rate. But when there are losses, we don't get the benefit of those losses. And so just hard to predict, but we'll give more guidance on the first quarter when we get to January. Patrick Davitt : Thank you. A - Marty Flanagan : Okay. Look, thank you, everybody. I appreciate the engagement with the questions. Always very helpful, and we'll be speaking with you soon. Have a good rest of the day. Allison Dukes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. You may all disconnect at this time.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. Now I would like to turn the call over to Greg Ketron, Invesco's Head of Investor Relations. Greg Ketron : Thanks, operator, and to all of you joining us on Invesco's quarterly earnings call. In addition to today's press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address today. The press release and presentation are available on our website, invesco.com. This information can be found by going to the Investor Relations section of the website. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on slide two of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix for the appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. Finally, Invesco is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized webcast are located on our website. Marty Flanagan, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Allison Dukes, Chief Financial Officer, will present our results this morning. After we complete the presentation, we will open the call up for questions. Now I'll turn the call over to Marty. Marty Flanagan : Thank you, Greg, and thanks everybody for joining us. And I'm going to start on slide three if you're following along, which is the fourth quarter highlights. The fourth quarter concluded a year of significant headwinds and volatility in global markets. Seemingly, no geography or asset class was immune to the S&P experienced the worst year since 2008, NASDAQ Composite declined over 30%, MSCI Merchant Markets Index nearly 20%, and bond markets, typically the safe heaven when equity suffer, declined significantly due to rise in interest rates with the global aggregate bond index declining by more than 15% for the year. This resulted in the worst markets we've seen in decades. Rising COVID infections in China and tax loss harvesting in developed economies as the year came to a close made for a challenging organic growth dynamic in our industry. Despite industry challenges in 2022, we're pleased to see key capabilities in areas with high client demand continued to deliver organic growth, offsetting net outflows and capabilities that experienced redemption pressure as investors express a preference for risk-off assets. Key capabilities that delivered net long-term inflows for the year included ETFs, fixed income, Greater China and the institutional channel. The firm's ability to deliver these outcomes demonstrates the strength and resilience of our diversified platform in the face of extraordinary market headwinds. Although, market showed signs of stabilization in the fourth quarter, the uncertain backdrop continued to weigh on investor sentiment and impacted client demand. Invesco separated itself from most industry peers by generating net inflows in key capability areas led by strong growth in ETFs in the quarter. Our fixed income business and institutional channel continued to build on our track record of organic growth, generating net inflows for 16 and 13 consecutive quarters, respectively. The depth and breadth of our investment capabilities that Invesco brings to market that position the firm to return to organic growth when investor sentiment improves. Invesco ETFs delivered $4.3 billion in net long-term inflows during the quarter. For the full year, ETFs brought in $28 billion of net long-term inflows, the equivalent of 11% organic growth rate. Our ETF lineup remains differentiated for most competitive offerings with a focus on higher value, higher revenue market segments like smart beta, and we continue to drive innovation in space with products such as our QQQ Innovation Suite. Fixed income capabilities in the institutional channel have been pillars of organic growth for several years now and growth persisted in both of these areas in the fourth quarter with $800 million and $900 million of net inflows, respectively. As Allison will discuss later, our institutional pipeline remains at healthy levels. And as interest rates stabilize, we have a significant opportunity to capture growth in fixed income capabilities in 2023. Our business in Greater China performed exceptionally well during 2022, building on our leading position in the world's fastest-growing market class asset managers. We experienced modest net long-term outflows of $600 million in the fourth quarter due to significantly higher redemptions in fixed income throughout the industry in China and rising bond yields stroke net asset values for fixed income securities lower. Despite these challenges, we raised over $3 billion from new product launches during the quarter in China. For the full year, our China joint venture delivered $7 billion of net inflows, the equivalent of 11% organic growth rate. Market sentiment in China will be mixed for the next few months as the country works through the transition period of higher COVID infection, stabilizing interest rates and redemptions turned to more moderate levels. That said, there are also signs that the outlook for the remainder of 2023 is improving, and I'm optimistic for a return to organic growth rate throughout 2023 in China. Although, we maintain momentum in key capabilities, the firm experienced net long-term outflows this quarter of $3.2 billion. Active global equity remains the biggest drag on organic growth with $6 billion of net outflows in the fourth quarter, including $3 billion in our developing markets fund. As we discussed previously, client appetite for these assets have been lower than in the past, but I'm optimistic, redemptions will slow this top client appetite for risk assets will eventually return. We entered 2023 with a strong balance sheet, giving us the needed flexibility to operate strategically in this environment. Long-term debt remains at low levels, the lowest in 10 years, and our cash balance increased to over $1.2 billion at year-end. As we discussed last quarter, we continue to be disciplined in our approach to expenses, tightly managing discretionary spending and limiting higher roles that are critical to support the organization and future growth. We are thoughtfully managing market headwinds while investing for the long-term. We remain focused on identifying areas of expense improvement that will deliver positive operating leverage as the market recovers and organic growth resumes. We are being extremely thoughtful about capital resource allocation in this environment, and we will be well positioned to maintain investments in areas that deliver future growth. Looking ahead, we are partnering with our clients to meet the most pressing needs in this dynamic environment. We've dedicated the past decade to build a breadth of investment capabilities and solutions mindset and operating scale at Invesco that few in the industry can match. I'm proud of our talented -- what our talent employees have accomplished in 2022 on behalf of clients and stakeholders, and I'm optimistic for return to organic growth when market sentiment eases. Market direction may be uncertain, but I'm confident that Invesco is prepared to meet challenges that will arise in 2023 and well positioned for future growth. With that, Allison, I'll turn it over to you. Allison Dukes : Thank you, Marty, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with slide four. Overall, investment performance improved in the fourth quarter with 61% and 63% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers or beating benchmark on a three-year and a five-year basis, up from 57% and 62% in the third quarter. These results reflect strength in fixed income and balanced strategies where there is strong client demand. Performance lacks benchmark in certain equity strategies, but we experienced improvement over the past quarter in several key funds and short-term performance is trending positively in several U.S. and global equity strategies. Moving to slide five. We ended 2022 with $1.41 trillion in AUM, an increase of $86 billion from the end of the third quarter as most market indices partially recovered from prior quarter lows. Global market increases, foreign exchange movements and reinvested dividends increased assets under management by $61 billion, and total net inflows were $25 billion, inclusive of $30 billion into money market products. As Marty mentioned earlier, the firm experienced net long-term outflows of $3.2 billion this quarter, equivalent to a 1% annualized organic decline. Despite some stabilization in global financial markets, industry growth remained subdued in the fourth quarter and Invesco's net flow performance was among the best in our peer group. Passive capabilities returned to net inflows this quarter was $7.3 billion, while net outflows were $10.5 billion in active strategies. Several of our key capability areas continued to deliver positive organic growth, including ETFs and fixed income as well as the institutional channel. These capabilities also delivered positive organic growth for the full year along with our Greater China business, which enabled Invesco to offset outflows and strategies that experienced net redemptions as investors sought risk-off trade throughout 2022. Invesco\u2019s ETF lineup was once again a driver of net long-term inflows in the fourth quarter with $4.3 billion. Net inflows were inclusive of $2.4 billion in maturing BulletShares ETFs, which are included in our gross redemptions. Growth this quarter was broad-based. Our top-selling ETFs included the S&P 500 Equal Weight, the NASDAQ 100 QQQM and Invesco Senior Loan ETF. For the full year 2022, net long-term inflows into our ETF capabilities were $28 billion, equivalent to an 11% organic growth rate and we gained market share. Excluding the QQQs, Invesco captured 3.8% of industry net inflows, higher than our 3.1% share of total industry assets under management. Institutional channel has been a steady source of growth and that continued in the fourth quarter as the channel has now achieved 13 straight quarters of net inflows. For calendar year 2022, the channel achieved net inflows of $13 billion or a 4% organic growth rate. We sustained new fundings across geographies, asset classes and the risk return spectrum throughout the year, despite the very challenging market backdrop. This demonstrates the diverse range of client relationships we have nurtured as well as the differentiated set of capabilities that we bring to the market. Retail net outflows were $4.1 billion in the fourth quarter, a meaningfully lower pace of outflows than the prior quarter as the channel achieved positive flows in Asia-Pacific and ETF flows improved in both the Americas and EMEA, despite an uptick in investors harvesting tax losses as the year ended. Moving to slide six. Net outflows declined quarter-over-quarter in Americas and EMEA, primarily due to improvement in ETF net flows. Net inflows in Asia-Pacific were $3.3 billion, led by Japan and Australia. Our China joint venture experienced modest net long-term outflows of $400 million in the fourth quarter as fixed income products experienced a meaningful industry-wide spike in redemptions throughout China and a rapid rise in COVID-19 cases impacted the Chinese economy and financial markets. Despite that, we raised over $3 billion in the fourth quarter from new products and investors showed signs of shifting back into equity products where we garnered $1.8 billion of net long-term inflows. Looking at full year 2022, our China joint venture delivered $7 billion of net long-term inflows, an 11% organic growth rate, and we're gaining market share. Building on Marty's points from earlier, the Chinese market may remain in transition in the short-term and through the first few weeks of 2023, the higher redemptions we experienced in the fourth quarter have persisted driven by fixed income. This dynamic may be a drag on net flows in China through the remainder of the first quarter, though we expect to be launching new products after the Chinese New Year, and there is increasing optimism for the rest of 2023. Longer term, we remain one of the best positioned asset managers, and what is expected to be, the world's fastest-growing market for asset management. Fixed income capabilities sustained organic growth in the fourth quarter with $800 million in net inflows. The firm achieved net inflows in this area, despite the heightened redemptions on the Chinese fixed income products as well as a $2.4 billion outflow related to BulletShares ETFs that reached their planned maturity last month. As interest rates stabilized, we have a diverse platform of fixed income offerings with strong investment performance across the full range of risk appetites and durations that are positioned to capture future growth. Alternatives experienced net outflows of $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter. Liquid alts accounted for more than two-thirds of the net outflows driven primarily by commodity focused ETFs. These strategies experienced net inflows for the full year, but gave back gains from the first half of the year. Private markets net outflows were $1.6 billion, primarily due to outflows and bank loan strategies. Net outflows in the active equity strategies have been concentrated in global and developing markets equities, which experience $6 billion of net outflows in the quarter, including $3.1 billion from our developing markets fund. Moving to slide seven. Our institutional pipeline was $30 billion at quarter end, an increase from $23 billion last quarter. Despite the challenging environment, we are winning new mandates, notably in fixed income and active equity in the fourth quarter, which contributed to the increase. Our pipeline has been running in the mid-$20 billion to mid-$30 billion range dating back to late 2019, and we\u2019re pleased to see the pipeline this robust given the uncertain market environment. As we\u2019ve noted previously, that uncertainty is causing some mandates to take longer to fund and we would estimate the funding cycle of our pipeline has extended into the three to four quarter range versus the two to three quarters prior to the market downturn. Our solutions capability enabled one-third of the global institutional pipeline in the fourth quarter, and it remains a differentiator with clients. The pipeline reflects a diverse business mix that has helped Invesco sustain organic growth in the channel throughout the full business cycle. Turning to slide eight. Markets partially recovered in the fourth quarter, but the significant market declines that we experienced in the third quarter, especially in September, drove assets under management lower at the start of the period. Net revenue of $1.1 billion -- $1.11 billion and the fourth quarter was flat the prior quarter and 19% lower than the fourth quarter of 2021. That\u2019s primarily due to lower active assets under management. Total adjusted operating expenses were $769 million, an increase of $28 million from the prior quarter, and a decrease of $27 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Compensation expenses increased by $8 million as compared to the third quarter, inclusive of incentive comp paid on the $56 million of performance fees earned in this quarter. As we\u2019ve discussed, we manage variable compensation to a full year outcome in line with company performance and competitive industry practices. Historically, our compensation to net revenue ratio has been in the 38% to 42% range on an annual basis. During periods of revenue decline, as we experienced in 2022, the ratio tends to move towards the upper end of this range. For the full year 2022, our compensation to revenue ratio was 41%. At current AUM levels, we would expect the ratio to trend towards the higher end of the range for 2023. As a reminder, looking to the first quarter, we expect seasonally higher compensation taxes and benefits of $20 million to $25 million consistent with prior year trends. We would expect this to be largely offset by lower incentive compensation on performance fee revenue after seasonally high revenues received in the fourth quarter. Marketing expenses were $4 million higher than prior quarter, consistent with the seasonally higher activity we typically see in the fourth quarter. Though marketing expenses were $9 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2021. Property, office and technology expenses were $6 million higher than the prior quarter. As we\u2019ve mentioned previously, we\u2019re in the process of moving to our new Atlanta headquarters, which we expect to be complete by the middle of this year. However, we may experience moderate delays as a result of flooding that took place when bitterly cold temperatures cause pipes to burst around Atlanta in December, and we\u2019re working with relevant parties on a resolution. In fourth quarter, we also incurred $2 million of expenses related to the decommissioning of our current office building. These expenses are not repetitive in nature. Technology expenses in the fourth quarter included investment in ongoing technology programs that will benefit future scale, such as upgrading our human resources operating environment and the move of our financial systems to the cloud. G&A expenses were $10 million higher than prior quarter, influenced by $4 million of foreign exchange rate revaluations associated with the impact of currency movements on our balance sheet, and an additional $2 million of value added taxes paid in non-U.S. jurisdictions. As I mentioned earlier, we are investing in foundational technology projects that will enable future scale in our operating platform. These expenses span SG&A and property, office and technology expenses, and they are included in our results. We\u2019re investing in our key growth capabilities, while balancing the need to diligently manage expenses in this uncertain environment. We have focused near-term hiring in the growth areas that we\u2019ve outlined and deferred hiring for most other positions. Over the longer-term, we\u2019re building a platform that will rapidly and efficiently scale, delivering positive operating leverage and margin expansion as markets recover. Now moving to slide nine. Adjusted operating income was $339 million in the fourth quarter, $30 million lower than the prior quarter due to flat net revenues combined with higher operating expenses. Adjusted operating margin was 30.6% as compared to 33.3% in the third quarter and 42% in the fourth quarter of 2021 prior to the steep market declines that we experienced in 2022. Earnings per share was $0.39 as compared to $0.34 due to higher non-operating income driven by gains on our seed capital and co-investment portfolios as markets increased from third quarter lows. The effective tax rate was 26.9% in the fourth quarter lower than 28.7% in the prior quarter due to losses and lower tax jurisdictions last quarter that did not recur. We estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 25% and 27% for the first quarter of 2023. The actual effective tax rate may vary from this estimate due to the impact of non-recurring items on pre-tax income and discreet tax items. I\u2019m going to conclude on slide 10. Maintaining a strong balance sheet remains a top priority, further underscored by the volatile environment that we have been navigating. Total debt was managed lower to $1.5 billion as of December 31, which is the lowest level in 10 years. We built cash in the fourth quarter as we ended the year with over $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, an increase of more than $200 million from September 30. Our leverage ratio as defined under our credit facility agreement was 0.8x at the end of the fourth quarter, slightly higher than the 0.7x the third quarter as declining markets have led to lower EBITDA. Our leverage ratio was flat in the fourth quarter of 2021. If preferred stock is included our fourth quarter leverage ratio was 3.2x. In the face of one of the most challenging markets of the past half century, Invesco continues to capture client demand in high growth areas, and our net flow performance has been among the best in our peer group. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve been building balance sheet strength and financial flexibility needed to navigate these uncertain times. We will be extremely disciplined in expense management and resource allocation, while ensuring that we are meeting the needs of our clients and positioning the firm for long-term growth. With that, we\u2019re going to go ahead and open it up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Glenn Schorr with Evercore, your line is open. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thanks very much. Just my question is on great trend. I\u2019d like seeing obviously opening up a little bit, getting the $3 billion new flows on the new products. I guess my question, as we watched this develop over the last couple of years, you seem to get great flows when you launch new products. We don\u2019t talk much about the legacy or the older products. I wonder if you could just give us a little more color on. Is the bulk of the flows come through the new issued pipeline? And the reason why I ask it is, historically you\u2019ve done best from a profitability standpoint when your products hit real scale. And you seem to be developing a huge set of new products, but most of the flows come through on day one. So I wonder if you could help with that color that\u2019d be great. Thanks. Marty Flanagan : Yes. Glenn, let me start and Allison, please chime in. So look, it\u2019s very -- that\u2019s really how that market is operating right now. In time you had to get a little mature to something more similar to the United States where you\u2019ll have your launches, there will be fewer of them and you\u2019ll have the ongoing flows into those capabilities. But there are follow on inflows, but really the bulk of it comes through these launches. And again, it\u2019s just unique to the market. That said, I think it\u2019ll evolve over time. But I just want to -- again, Allison hit on this, I did. It\u2019s a really volatile time over the next few months here, but we just think the future is very, very bright in China for us. And when the COVID transition completes itself, we anticipate 2023 being a very strong year in China. Allison Dukes : Yes. Glenn, I would maybe say if you think about the flow drivers in China, I mean it\u2019s maybe with these new product launches, maybe somewhere half to two-thirds in any given quarter might come from these new product launches. It\u2019s not all of it, but it is as Marty said, it is a -- it\u2019s really the way the market works there right now. It\u2019s certainly a less mature market. And for now that is a large driver of flows. I don\u2019t want to leave anyone with the impression that\u2019s 100% of the flow drivers each quarter. But it\u2019s an important part of functioning in that market and is an important driver of market share growth overall. To your point, it\u2019s nice to see flows coming from beyond China and across the region. But it\u2019s an interesting time in China right now. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Thanks, Allison. Maybe one quick one for you on expenses, so the -- or I guess margins in general. Market was up -- your AUM was up 6.5% in the fourth quarter, so some of that\u2019s going to flow through into the first quarter revenue. So maybe you could start, just help us with the jumping off point on starting the first quarter. Because sometimes there\u2019s some seasonal items on the expense side, so just how to think about the jumping off point in Q1? Thanks. Allison Dukes : Sure. There are many puts and takes. I think as we think about the revenue side of it, you\u2019re right, markets have been a little bit better only a few weeks into January. That\u2019s certainly a positive. But I do think it\u2019s really important to underscore the mix shift that we saw in our portfolio overall in the fourth quarter. We pointed to the $6 billion of outflows in two particular active equity strategies, developing markets as well as global and international funds. Those are -- that has an impact overall in the jumping off point as we think about the revenue dynamics. At the same time, a lot of encouraging signs as we\u2019ve pointed to, as we see real strength in inflows, in our ETF capabilities and fixed income in particular. But as you certainly understand that comes at a different revenue level than what we\u2019ve experienced as we see some of the remixing of the portfolio. So while market could be a positive this quarter, there\u2019s also a bit of a headwind in the jumping off point in terms of remixing relative to prior quarters. As we think about expenses, overall I noted in comp expense, you should expect a usual seasonality of $20 million to $25 million in the first quarter. That would be offset by what we would -- would not expect any recurrence and performance fees like we saw in the fourth quarter just given the seasonality there. And of course the market will be what the market will be, we\u2019ll adjust for that. So hopefully that gives a little bit of color as you think about some of the puts and takes. Overall it\u2019s a difficult environment to navigate because you see a lot of forces moving at the same time and we\u2019re trying to get our arms around that as well. Operator : Thank you. And now Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Great, thanks. Good morning folks. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just one more on expenses, Allison, just to finish that thought, just the -- I missed the number I think that you said in property office and technology that seemed like it was one-time in 4Q. So did you also want to get the jumping off point there? I realized that you\u2019re going to have some duplicate expense I think in the first half, as you transition to new headquarters. But maybe just an outlook in that context for 2023 if you can. And then also in G&A considering that spiked up in 4Q, but it sounds like you\u2019re working on some cost saves during the year in G&A. Allison Dukes : Sure. Let me do my best to try to walk through a few of these. On property office and technology, a couple of points on some of, what we\u2019re experiencing really specific to our Atlanta headquarters. As a reminder, we\u2019re carrying the cost of two headquarters right now. That will persist for a few more quarters. That\u2019s somewhere between $2 million to $3 million of incremental expense. We had a $2 million non-recurring charge in the fourth quarter related to decommissioning the existing, or I\u2019ll say outgoing headquarters we are in. We also pointed to some uncertainty, because we had a pipe burst in our new building on Christmas Eve and that happened around Atlanta and that will cause some delay in moving. And so there is a little bit of uncertainty right now as we try to work through what all of this means. That combined with G&A, in G&A, we pointed to a lot of FX revaluations and higher VAT taxes in the fourth quarter obviously FX has been a pretty meaningful driver in some of the significant movements we saw over the last few quarters there. I would say, overall as we think about property office and technology, and G&A, I will just continue to underscore a lot of these key foundational projects that we are working on and they really spam those two categories in terms of both technology and professional services. We have been -- we are working on installing in a new HR environment. We are wrapping up moving all of our financial systems to the cloud, and we are in the early stages of Alpha NextGen. And so as these projects are rolling off and rolling on there is quite a bit of investment and focus right now and really creating scale for the future. Overall, as I think about G&A for the year and the fact that we do expect to be back in a full travel mode this year, and we do expect the reopening of China to allow us to get back to a really important region that we have not been able to get to for the last three years. I expect G&A this year on an average basis is somewhat consistent with G&A last year on an average basis, when you think about some of the efficiencies and our -- discretionary expense management we\u2019re trying to manage, but at the same time, the reopening of travel as well as some of these foundational investments we are making. Brian Bedell : That\u2019s fantastic color. Thank you. And then just to follow up on the revenue side, obviously the revenue yields pressured, sounds like a lot of that came in the Oppenheimer Funds complex given just the outflows there. So two part question would be, are you seeing increasing demand or risk appetite given you foreign markets and especially emerging markets are starting to year off pretty well in performance? Are financial advisors that you\u2019re speaking with starting to warm up to that are seeing some risk on appetite from their clients and can that help their revenue yield if that rebounds? Probably not in 1Q, but as we move through the year. Marty Flanagan : Yes. I\u2019ll make just a comment. The contrast is dramatic, right? If you went through last year there was really no interest at all in emerging markets in particular very much risk off and the like, it\u2019s too early. But what we are seeing is, starting to be some early interest in emerging markets in China, driven by China, quite frankly. And developing markets in Q4 had some very, very, very solid performance, which needs to have, and it\u2019s a really talented team. So the answer is, if the client appetite is there we should do quite well, which would be a nice change from this past year. Brian Bedell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the alternative suite of products. You saw some outflows. This is the second consecutive quarter of a little more elevated outflows. But you did highlight private credit? Or as seeing inflows, and I think you said some of the liquid strategies goes. Could you talk about the mix of fees within alternatives and kind of where the positive and negatives are shaking out? Allison Dukes : Sure. I\u2019ll start, Marty, chime in. I mean, I would say a couple of things as we look at alternatives, again, a lot of what we saw in terms of outflows would be the liquid alternatives. So commodity ETFs in particular, currency ETFs. So, I think from that perspective that would be -- those would be lower fee alternatives that were flowing out. Boiling that down to private markets that also was an outflows at about $1.6 billion, but that was largely driven by global bank loans, direct real estate, we were an outflows to the tune of about $200 million there. So that\u2019s really, again, realizations net of acquisitions there, negative $200 million. Continue to gather commitments and have a fair amount of dry powder and direct real estate about $7.5 billion coming into the year overall on that side. On a private credit perspective, I think it\u2019s been a -- it\u2019s an interesting environment. It was an interesting year for private credit overall, just the floating rate nature of loans and some of the attractive fundamentals there have helped mitigate losses, but certainly as recession fears kind of persist and trying to navigate what that may or may not look like, that certainly impacts credit appetite overall. And so we continue to navigate that. I think we, coming into this year, we\u2019re bullish on all of our private market asset classes. We feel like we\u2019re really well positioned. We feel very good about the funds that we have launched and will be launching and that they\u2019re going to be well positioned for where we expect to see client demand this year. But certainly your perspective on higher yields and what the attractive entry point is going to really dictate how our flows come together as we make it quarter-to-quarter through thus. So, overall I think we\u2019ll continue to see good strong demand there. But the liquid alt and some of the movements and currencies and commodities have put overall downward pressure on the flows there. Dan Fannon : Got it. Thank you. And then I think, Marty, you mentioned for fixed income, obviously the positioning and is positive and you\u2019re helpful for pickup and demand, but I think you need to, you said interest rate stabilizing is the kind of key factor for decision making. So, as we think about growth sales or redemption activity, do you feel like it\u2019s more stagnant and so we kind of get more of a direction of where rates are on a global basis and then we start to see much more assets in motion? Marty Flanagan : Yes, absolutely. So, look, I think that\u2019s true of equities also, right? Some certainty to the future is going to be a really, really important thing for how investors react this year. But for fixed income, absolutely that\u2019s going to be the case. It\u2019s on the back of a broad set of capabilities, very good performance. And I\u2019ll just follow on to Allison\u2019s point in REIT, which we\u2019ve talked about over the last year. It is now being launched on a very important Wirehouse, which is one of the things we\u2019re waiting for. And we\u2019re also in development of some follow on capabilities in our private markets that will end up in the wealth management channel. But again, that will be a multi quarter introduction. But we\u2019re now underway. So it\u2019s again, this won\u2019t be immediate, but we\u2019re now moving forward, which is a really important thing for the firm. Dan Fannon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Now, Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. We\u2019d love to start on flows. Marty, you had some commentary in the press release suggesting, you were waiting on a recovery in flows, some of the indications, maybe a week start to China, slower funding on the institutional side. So are you all generally signaling that you\u2019re expecting flows to remain soft here, just given that uncertainty that you\u2019ve talked about based on what you can see in the activity here? Marty Flanagan : Yes, look, I think that\u2019s a rational line would get you there, right? But as I say, we\u2019re, from my perspective, we\u2019re a lot closer to the end of the uncertainty than the beginning. And what we point to is just look at our relative flows, vis-\u00e0-vis our competitors how we\u2019re positioned. There\u2019s a lot of things that are going well and you don\u2019t need a lot of change and sentiment to really start to make a really meaningful impact in our flows. And so as they say, they don\u2019t ring the bell at the bottom, but we\u2019re a lot closer to that, and I think that\u2019s going to be a really positive development for Invesco. Allison Dukes : Yes, Brennan, I might point to just the improvement we saw from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. Look, it\u2019s a dangerous game to predict flows, and we\u2019re certainly not going to try to enter that game, but as we look at the drivers coming out of the quarter and just some of the overall market sentiment right now, we saw the decay rate. Yes, the decay rate in third quarter was 2.9%. That improved to a negative 1% in the fourth quarter and some really positive drivers there that again, this is a dangerous game, but we would expect those to continue to hold up through the first quarter. So the ETF platform in particular and our strategies there 7% organic growth in the fourth quarter. Despite some of the tax loss harvesting and the bullet shares maturity, again, a lot of strength coming into the year there. Fixed income for the reasons we\u2019ve just discussed have has performed well and certainly hinges quite a bit on the rate environment. But we feel like the fundamentals are strong there. We\u2019re well positioned. The institutional channel does seem to be coming back underscoring Marty\u2019s point that perhaps we\u2019re closer to the end than is the beginning. And so, as we saw a lot of institutions sit on the sideline, and remix depend -- waiting on some conviction that, that could improve here at this quarter. Active equities very difficult quarter for us in the fourth quarter. I think a lot depends on just some of the earlier conversation around developing markets and as people find the right time to come back into that asset class and that exposure just diminishment and that headwind will help us quite a bit. And then the wildcard at the moment is China. What\u2019s happening there is really unique. And as they\u2019ve changed their COVID strategy and done a 180, it\u2019s having a real impact, but we also expect that to be relatively short term and the fundamentals are really still strong there. So, I think, we feel maybe a little bit better than we did a quarter ago. But that sure is a hard place to be at the moment because it\u2019s been a wild ride of a year. And we\u2019ll see where things go over the next month or two. Brennan Hawken : Thank you for that all that color. That is very, very helpful. Shifting gears a little and thinking about real estate and your capabilities there. Allison, I believe you made some positive commentary on how the year shook out there on the real estate front. And I think, Marty, you referenced that you\u2019re getting close to a warehouse launch on a product. I guess, number one, on the wealth management side, have you been looking at what some other products and some of the struggles and the gates that we\u2019ve seen in some of these products on the retail side? And how are you making adjustments? How you\u2019re thinking about structuring your own product in light of some of the lessons learned there? And then, on the institutional side, there\u2019s been some press around the queue building on redemptions and yet prioritization sort of given to the not addressing the queue, but rather addressing the needs of sustained investors, which makes perfect sense. It\u2019s just how are you managing maybe that delicate customer service dance in order to make sure relationships aren\u2019t damaged? Marty Flanagan : Yes, it\u2019s a great question and needless to say it\u2019s been in front of everybody. Look, we\u2019ve not had that issue. I\u2019d also say we don\u2019t have the magnitude of size that where that has been sort of topical. So again, our client experience has been very different. But again, I recognize the relative scale that is what comes along with creating availability into these capabilities. And I think that\u2019s -- that would be a lesson for the market. And I think if you want to get exposure to some of these capabilities in extremely challenging times, you\u2019re going to run into some situations like that. And my personal perspective is if we do a really good job educating investors and they have the time horizons that\u2019s necessary for these exposures, they\u2019re going to do really well. So I would not make a decision not to have -- to provide access to individual investors during just an extremely challenging time. So I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s helpful, but that\u2019s how I think about it. Brennan Hawken : And then on the institutional side? Marty Flanagan : I\u2019m sorry, can you repeat the question? Brennan Hawken : Yes. There was some press coverage around the institutional -- your institutional capabilities on commercial real estate and the fact that you -- there\u2019s a large queue rather of redemptions, but they\u2019re -- given the illiquid nature, it\u2019s going to take time to work through that. And there\u2019s prioritization given to the existing investors in the actual strategy. And so just it\u2019s an understandable dance to try to balance, but how are you sustaining and maybe limiting damage control as far as relationships go around that inherent friction? Marty Flanagan : We\u2019re not experiencing what you\u2019re describing. So when there are reductions, it\u2019s -- we have very, very strong relationships with our clients and they\u2019re managed really quite well. So we\u2019re not feeling the friction that you\u2019re referring to. So\u2026 Brennan Hawken : Okay. I\u2019ll follow up later. Thanks. Marty Flanagan : Thank you very much. Yes. Operator : Thank you. Now, Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Craig Siegenthaler : Hey, good morning, everyone. Allison Dukes : Craig. Craig Siegenthaler : So given the rise that we\u2019ve seen in interest rates, I just wanted to see if you have a view on the potential reallocations in the fixed income in 2023? And also do you have a view within that on the potential mix between active and passive? And then how do you think Invesco is positioned within that to win these potential rebalancing? Marty Flanagan : It\u2019s a great question and I\u2019ll give you an answer. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s wrong. But net-net I think getting, the rise in interest rates get into more natural interest rate levels is healthy for the marketplace. I think it\u2019s healthy for active equities over time. And again, as I said before, once it sort of hits its stability level, I think it\u2019s good for different types of asset classes and fixed incomes say. I really don\u2019t know what the relative allocations are, but it\u2019s been a long time that you\u2019ve had a market where it\u2019s positive for stock pickers and active equity. And yes, my personal view, once you get relative outperformance, you\u2019ll start to see money go back to active equities and various elements of it. And that would probably not be a popular view. And history suggest that that\u2019s not been the case. But that\u2019s how I think about it. Craig Siegenthaler : Thank you, Marty. And maybe just a follow-up on the other question on real estate, maybe asking a different way. So we have really great I think visibility into your liquid public funds and also INREIT\u2019s investment performance. But maybe could you talk about how some of the performance in the other products, the private products trended in 2022? I\u2019m especially looking for core real estate debt and also the opportunistic drawdowns? Marty Flanagan : Look, I don\u2019t have a specific performance in front of me, so hard to answer the question. What I will say it\u2019s a strong -- a very, very strong team. The core capability is, it\u2019s just a fundamental strength to the organization and the client relationship has been very, very strong over an exceeding long period of time. So again, I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t have the specific performance that you\u2019re asking about. Craig Siegenthaler : No worries. Guys, thanks for taking my questions. Thank you, Marty. Marty Flanagan : Appreciate it. Operator : And now, Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Hey Marty and Allison. Quick, maybe just a quick follow-up to Craig\u2019s question around fixed income. I was hoping you guys could give some details around Invesco\u2019s position with some of the specific products that you feel most kind of optimistic about if the recent recovery and fixed income flows from the industry continues. And how are you thinking about your ETF positioning in fixed income versus the active book in fixed income? Marty Flanagan : I\u2019ll make a couple comments. Just with our -- within the ETF franchise, fixed income continues to be an opportunity for us, right? The strength has come historically from equities. We surely think we have the capabilities to grow off the ETF franchise and fixed income. So we would look at going into the year. With regard to fixed income in particular, the suite of capabilities of performance is really quite strong. So it\u2019s really going to be driven by what we see in our client demands. There\u2019s been the munis, in the retail channels in the United States, muni bonds is a very attractive all the short duration elements. Bank loans continue to be very strong. So again, it depends on the market and where we are. But Allison, do you have any further insights from your perspective? Allison Dukes : No, I mean, I think, whenever it is that inflation at least -- well, inflation declines and you start to see some pausing with the Fed and rate movements, I think we expect total returns to be strong overall. We would expect that to be sometime in 2023. I think Marty hit on the areas of real strength. Munis, certainly, we see that as our customers continue to focus on taxes as being an area that we expect to hear even more bullish sentiment over the course of this year. Our global liquidity is held up very nicely and we expect demand to continue there. Fixed income SMAs that\u2019s been a very strong area for us that continues to be a wrapper that\u2019s in real demand. Stable value has been a leading capability for us for a very long time. So, I think, it really does depend on your perspective on rates and credit of course. But we do expect there to be an inflection point and continued demand across a lot of our capabilities this year. I think overall net flows are still favoring ETFs over some of our active strategies, but we feel well positioned in both. Alex Blostein : Got it. Thanks for that. And then, Marty, you mentioned strong balance sheet and I think the commentary you\u2019ve made around it is sort of enabling you to operate strategically. Could you expand a little bit on that? Does that just mean sort of build liquidity and then eventually resume more active capital return program? Or do you think this environment opens up incremental M&A opportunities for Invesco? Marty Flanagan : Yes. Let me make a comment then Allison can pick up. So, what we\u2019ve been using our balance sheet for right now, and we\u2019ve talked about it in different ways are really investment that are going to continue for any other company to grow in the future. So the alternative capabilities, this scenario, where we\u2019ve been using the balance sheet. Yes, we\u2019ll continue to do that. And you\u2019ve heard us talk over time. MassMutual has been an amazing partner helping us to really augment our balance sheet to a very material degree. So that\u2019s really been the more specific we\u2019re talking about now in some of these foundational enterprise programs that Allison was referring to. They might not be \u201cinteresting\u201d if they\u2019re necessary, but that\u2019s what creates scale within an organization. And so that\u2019s the other way that we\u2019ve been using very, very short term. But Allison, you want to pick up more on the other elements of the balance sheet? Allison Dukes : Yes, I mean, I think, Marty hit some of the high points. But again, we just continue to be focused on supporting our future growth and maintaining a really strong balance sheet to do that. And part of that is continuing to be really good stewards of our capital overall, being very thoughtful about the debt on the balance sheet, which has been top of mind for us and we\u2019ve been shipping away at and feel really good about the progress we\u2019re making there, making progress there. It\u2019s freeing up capacity for us to again, continue to focus on our own future growth. Some of that is investing in our product launches. We are fortunate to have a really good strong strategic partner there with us. But we continue to really prioritize investing in ourselves, both in terms of our product launches, but also the technology projects and some of the foundational capabilities that we know are really going to be necessary to create the scale and this business that we expect to have over the coming years. Hopefully, that\u2019s helpful? Alex Blostein : Yes. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Bill Katz with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Bill Katz : Terrific. Thank you very much for taking the questions. Appreciate all the colors so far. Marty and Allison, you both mentioned sort of the longer-term outlook for China does sound very strong. Could you help unpack a little bit about where you have a queue for product launches for 2023? And if you could break down the mix between equity and fixed income and other assets in the region? That\u2019d be super helpful. Allison Dukes : Sure. Well, I\u2019ll take a stab at it. I would say in terms of product launches, overall, hard to say exactly, but I\u2019ll tell you the demand there does favor balanced and fixed income products over equities. So it would probably skew a little bit more to the balance side than fixed income than equity. But that\u2019s not a perfect science, as I think about just the mix overall in China. I would say it\u2019s skews probably 50% or so balanced and fixed income maybe as much as 60%. Balanced is a very popular asset class there. So equity is probably a little bit smaller in the overall mix there relative to what you might expect to see and a portfolio in the United States. Bill Katz : Okay, thank you. And just to follow-up certainly hear you on sort of all the different drivers for flows. When you think about the base fee rate exiting the year entering 2023, where does that sit today and should we presume sort of a gradual decline just given the ins and outs between across geographies products and distribution channels? Allison Dukes : Yes, I mean, I would say the factors that impacted the net revenue yield and the just the overall base fee rate in the fourth quarter, we would expect a lot of those to continue into the first quarter primarily as we continue to benefit from the demand for our ETF and our passive strategy. So while that is a significant positive, and we are capturing demand where demand is right now that does put downward pressure on our average fee rate. And we would expect a lot of those trends to continue into the first quarter at developing markets in particular in global equities. And what happens there in terms of redemptions and demand overall, that will remain a headwind. If nothing else, just given the exit rate of those particular asset classes in December as we come into this year, that does put downward pressure overall because of the outflows that we experienced in the last probably three quarters there. And overall though, I\u2019ll just say, as I do every quarter, we\u2019re not focused on managing to a net revenue yield or an average fee rate. We\u2019re focused on managing the operating income and operating margin of the company overall. And so while we see that downward pressure given the mix shift in our portfolio, and that mix shift really did accelerate in 2022. We are really focused on how do we continue to operate the business to create scale and to get to scale and these passive capabilities. We\u2019ve taken market share, we\u2019ve gained quite a bit in terms of our organic growth over the last few years, but we\u2019re not at scale in those capabilities and getting to scale and continuing to remix our expenses and reallocate against these higher growth capabilities is our primary focus. And that\u2019s what\u2019s ultimately going to give us the opportunity to improve operating margin. Bill Katz : Thank you very much. Operator : And now Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Patrick Davitt : Hi, good morning everyone. Most of mine have been asked, just one quick one on credit ratings. I think S&Ps on record is saying their ratings and outlook are based on the expectation that your leverage ratio with the preferred will be in the two and a half times to three times range, which you went over in 4Q. I suppose the market recovery could already have that back below three times, which could you speak to any potential risks to your capital return or new investment outlook around that issue? And based on your past experience, how much of a grace period can we expect from the ratings agencies after kind of breaching that three times bogey for one quarter? Allison Dukes : Hi, Patrick, I\u2019ll take that. Look, we are -- we\u2019ve had no conversations with S&P that would indicate we have a risk there. I think the important point is all the work we have done in continuing to manage our debt balances lower. So, while EBITDA has declined, given the market impact, one would expect that to be more temporary in nature. Given we do expect there will be an inflection, excuse me, in the market at some point. And at the same time we\u2019ve managed not only the debt on the balance sheet to the absolute lowest level in 10 years, but managed a number of contingent liabilities that would\u2019ve been present when they made that statement two to three years ago. Those have all been taken care of as well. So in terms of the overall liabilities, we\u2019re in a significantly better place than we were when they made that statement a few years ago. We did receive an upgrade last year from Fitch. We do feel like we are overall in a good position as far as our credit ratings are concerned. Patrick Davitt : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Mike Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Mike Cyprys : Hey, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me again here. Just to follow-up on expenses, Allison, just coming back to the transformational project that you were mentioning earlier. I guess just how much might that lower run rate expenses as you kind of look out over the next couple of years, and as you think about expenses for this year, how are you thinking about the bookends for growth rate and expenses? Allison Dukes : So in terms of transformational projects, lowering expenses in the next couple of years, I would say they will not contribute to lowering expenses in the next couple of years. As we\u2019ve noted before, the Alpha NextGen is really our most significant investment that we will be making. We will be in the next couple of years deep into the investment period of that, and then we\u2019ll be running parallel for some period of time before we can start to streamline and decommission apps on the other side. So, we are several years away from seeing the benefit of that investment. Again, it\u2019s the right near-term and long-term move for us as a company overall as we think about building to the scale we want to be at in the next five years, seven years, 10 years. But it\u2019s an investment and it will take some time before we see the payback on that investment. In terms of the bookends of expenses, look the biggest driver of that\u2019s going to be comp and the biggest driver of that\u2019s going to be market related. And so as you think about the variability and our expenses and what could move, the most beyond our expectations and beyond some of the guidance I already gave it would be compensation related. The good news in that is that comes with revenue. And I think that right now as we think about what expense flex we have on the year? I want to make sure it\u2019s clear, we are managing discretionary expenses at every level and really focused on the must haves only, and all the nice to haves are things we are foregoing. But there are a lot of must haves in this business that we think really position us well to capture demand over the next several years. And we want to stay the course on that even in some of these challenging market conditions. And we\u2019re reallocating the discretionary expenses to some of these foundational investments that we think will serve us well and create the operating leverage for the future. Mike Cyprys : Great. And just a follow-up question on the cash position, $1.2 billion, how much of that is discretionary? And how do you think about the scenario where buybacks might resume? Thank you. Allison Dukes : So the $1.2 billion, about $640 million is held for regulatory purposes, so it\u2019s a little bit higher than the last quarter, and that\u2019s really FX related. So you could consider the amount above that $640 million roughly discretionary. As I think about buybacks, I\u2019ll just underscore our capital priorities. The first is supporting our future growth, and we\u2019ve got a lot of investments we want to make in ourselves, and we think that\u2019s going to serve shareholders the best over the long run. We want to focus on maintaining that strong balance sheet and continue to focus on the leverage levels that we have and managing those down. And we also continue to focus on returning capital shareholders, but that we\u2019re going to do first through dividends and steady dividend increases, and it\u2019s really excess cash that we\u2019ll think about for buybacks. Mike Cyprys : Great. Thank you Allison Dukes : Marty, anything else? Marty Flanagan : Yes, excuse me. I get off mute. I do want to follow-up just on this conversation on expenses. So there\u2019s some longer term investments that Allison was talking about, which we\u2019ve talked about some, and then the obvious elements around discretionary. But as a management team, we are absolutely focused on what we call, driving scale within the organization against capabilities that are in client demand. And we\u2019re deeply into that process and we\u2019re constantly doing it. And from that, you get the opportunity to make a decision to invest in a capability for a client, let\u2019s say, or have it dropped at the bottom line. So that\u2019s another element that we have been working on very, very diligently. And it\u2019ll make us a better company, but at the same time, at some point the markets recover, you\u2019ll get further operating leverage with, from the organization. So, I think you should look at it as three different elements, and that\u2019s nothing new. You\u2019ve seen us do it, time and time again. And it\u2019s a normal practice from us and again, it\u2019ll just create better outcomes for sure, shareholders and clients. Operator : Our last question is from Mike Brown with KBW. Sir, your line is open. Mike Brown : Great. Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask you a couple follow-up questions on the real estate business. So, I believe the total real estate exposure for Invesco is around $92 billion and $75 billion or so is in the direct real estate side. So within direct real estate, how much is tied to the U.S. and then how much is tied to office and retail? Allison Dukes : I would say in terms of how much is tied to the U.S., probably around two-thirds is probably roughly, I\u2019d have to -- we can follow up with you on specifics there, but I\u2019d say roughly. We\u2019ve been managing our exposure to office and retail quite a bit over the last couple of years, three years probably in particular. And really favoring asset classes like cold storage and industrial and medical office buildings and, some of the asset classes you would expect us to be in. So the story around retail has been known for quite a long time, probably five years or six years. Office has obviously been quite challenged since the advent of COVID and we\u2019ve been managing those exposure. So those are not a real concern overall. And as I think about really where our acquisitions have been focused over the last two or three years, they\u2019ve been in these areas of real high demand. Multifamily would be another example of an asset class we\u2019ve been favoring. Mike Brown : Okay, great. Thanks Allison. And then just specifically in terms of some of the line items here, how much does real estate contribute to performance fees? So of the $68 million, how much was from real estate, and then how much do real estate transaction fees contribute to other revenue? Allison Dukes : So on the performance fees this quarter real estate was the majority of the performance fees. If I think about prior years, you would\u2019ve seen more coming from IGW China overall than what we saw this year. So the two biggest drivers in any given year would be China and real estate, but in 2022 it was definitely coming more from real estate. In terms of other revenue, I would say it\u2019s a -- I\u2019d have to come back to you on what portion of it is. I will say the increase in other revenue in the fourth quarter was driven largely by higher real estate transaction fees. Mike Brown : Okay, great. Thanks for the color there. Marty Flanagan : Okay. Well look thank you very much everybody appreciate the engagement, the questions and we\u2019ll be chatting next quarter. So have a good rest of the day. Thank you. Allison Dukes : Thank you. Operator : Conference has concluded. Again, thank you for your participation. Please go ahead and disconnect at this time.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Greg Ketron, Invesco's Head of Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may begin. Greg Ketron : Thanks, operator, and all of you joining us on the call today. In addition to the press release, we've provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address today. Press release and presentation are available on our website, invesco.com. This information can be found by going to the Investor Relations section of the website. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slide 2 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix of the appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. Finally, Invesco's net response before and does not edit or guarantee the accuracy of our earnings call transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized webcast are located on our website. Marty Flanagan, President and CEO; Andrew Schlossberg, Invesco's Head of Americas and who will become President and CEO upon Martin's retirement on June 30 of this year; and Allison Dukes, Chief Financial Officer will present our results this morning. After we complete the presentation, we will open up the call for questions. Now I'll turn the call over to Martin. Marty Flanagan : Thank you, Greg. And I'm going to start on Page 3, which is the highlights for the first quarter, if you want to follow along. The early part of 2023, provided investors and money managers reason for modest optimism as most major financial markets gain ground in that period partially offsetting the significant declines we saw last year. Inflationary pressures showed some sign of easing and the COVID-19 pandemic are all now [ph] behind us. That said, heightened level of volatility persists in the financial markets reacted with cash in March as we experienced several bank failures during that period. Investors once again, safety and risk-off assets and net flows across the industry were pressured again. Although organic growth remains lower across our industry, Invesco supersite platform generated $2.9 billion net inflows in the first quarter, margin return to organic growth. This progress is especially significant considering the mix feature for the industry overall during the quarter. Growth this quarter was driven by areas in which we've invested for years and have been intentional in cultivating deep client relationships. Fixed income capabilities, the institutional channel, ETFs, all experienced strong net inflows during the quarter. Each of these areas has demonstrated Invesco's ability to sustain growth throughout the full market cycle. Fixed income delivered net flows for the 17th straight quarter, while the institutional channel has now been in net flows for 14 straight quarters. As we'll discuss later, our pipeline remains strong for telling well for future growth. Our solutions business helped drive the institutional business to net long-term inflows of $6.6 billion in the quarter. Meanwhile, net long-term flows in ETF vehicles have now been positive 10 out of 11 last quarters. Growth in the ETF business is broad-based with net inflows this quarter, both equity and fixed income strategies. I'm confident that investor appetite at returns to risk assets have we will see significant growth in this area.  Net flows in active equities remains a headwind but improved meaningfully compared to our experience in 2022. Net long-term outflows in global equities were $2.5 billion in the first quarter including $1.2 billion from our developing markets fund, while still a challenging environment. This was the best out flow before this quarter in the asset class since 2021, with net outflows being less than half the net outflows in the fourth quarter. As we discussed on our last earnings call, the Chinese markets have continued to be unsteady for several months as the country is in the midst of transition period post COVID-19 policies and higher interest rates led to an uptick in fixed income redemptions industry-wide, consistent with that industry direction, our Greater China business experienced $2.9 billion of net outflows in the first quarter, primarily in the fixed income [ph] I just mentioned. Despite the near-term challenges, we remain extremely bullish on the opportunity in China over the long term. We ran 12 of 160 refund companies operated in China and remain the largest foreign known asset manager in the fastest-growing market in our industry. We expect to be in the market for new product launches during the second quarter, and we are optimistic for recovery inflows on the balance of 2023. Let me briefly touch on our private market capabilities. We experienced net long-term inflows of $600 million in the first quarter. We were very active in the CLO market and raised $1.5 billion from three new CLOs launched in that period. Real estate transactions slowed across the industry as markets were in turmoil and the banking sector and the higher interest rates made financing more difficult. However, our direct real estate portfolio has performed well. It is diversified across geographies, sectors and investment styles. Allison will get into great detail in just a few minutes. While we expect the growth may be more challenging real estate due to market conditions on our portfolio is well managed, and we continue to source new opportunities and are having constructive conversations with our clients, investing in growing our business, maintaining a strong balance sheet and providing a steady return capital to our shareholders, made as a top priority. I'm pleased to note that our board had approved a 7% increase in quarterly common dividend to $0.20 per share effective this quarter, which reflects our strong cash position and stable cash flows despite the uncertain markets we've been facing. Long-term debt continues to run at the lowest levels in over a decade. And we've recently renewed and increased the size of our credit facility from $1.5 billion to $2 billion, providing us significant flexibility moving forward. Lastly, as you're aware, last -- in February, we announced that Andrew Schlossberg will take over's President and CEO when I retire on June 30. Schlossberg has more than 20-year career at Invesco. Andrew has successfully led several large businesses and earn the respect of clients and employees, the Board of Directors and executive leadership team. Andrew, our highly experienced executive leadership team are well placed to lead Invesco into the next chapter. I'm excited for the future of the firm as we build on our market-leading position to further accelerate growth on our Andrew's leadership and that of the executive leadership team.  This is the most talented experienced leadership team Invesco's ever had, from Andrew, Alison and the rest of ELT. I could not be more excited. I will continue to work with Andrew and the team as Chairman Emeritus from June 30 through the end of 2024. Before we turn over the call to Allison, I'd like to introduce Andrew, invite him to say a few words. Andrew? Andrew Schlossberg : Great. Thank you, Marty, and good morning to everyone. Let me start by saying how grateful I am to Marty for his tremendous leadership as Invesco's CEO these past 18 years. Marty has truly been a visionary in the industry, and he's positioned Invesco extremely well to win in a fast-changing environment. And during my 22 years at Invesco and working closely with Marty during his tenure as CEO, I've seen it have been a part of the evolution of our firm. And during this time, we have routinely updated our strategic priorities ahead of changing client needs, evolve the leadership and develop the talent of the firm. And I'm looking forward to the opportunity to build on this strong foundation and a legacy that Marty and our team have developed over many years of hard work and dedication for our clients, our shareholders and everyone at Invesco. I know that we have the right capabilities. We have deep client relationships, strong talent and an experienced executive leadership team in place to be a force in the asset management industry for years to come. I'm also looking forward to assuming the CEO role at a time when, once again, our industry is going through a meaningful change with new technological developments, enhanced client delivery capabilities and a high bar for investment quality. As an organization, we're committed to our growth strategy and the key capabilities that we've been discussing with all of you, including ETFs, Greater China, private markets, active fixed income and active global equities and our solutions offering. Our executive leadership team is focused on further enhancing these capabilities and evolving these strategic priorities, both at pace and with conviction. And as Marty noted, we're very well positioned to capture demand and develop even deeper relationships with our clients over time. I'm also committed to driving a high level of profitable growth and financial performance, continuing to further strengthen our balance sheet and return capital to shareholders. And finally, I'm excited to engage more deeply with the investment community, and I look forward to spending time and working with all of you in the quarters and years to come. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Allison to provide a more detailed look at our results. Allison Dukes : Thank you, Andrew. And good morning, everyone. I'll start with Slide 4. Overall, investment performance improved in the first quarter with 64% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers or beating benchmark on both a three-year and a five-year basis, up from 61% and 63% in the fourth quarter. We have strong performance strength in fixed income and balanced strategies for their solid client demand. Performance lacked benchmark and certain U.S. equity strategies, but performance is trending positively and a number of global equity and alternative strategies. Turning to Slide 5. We ended the first quarter with $1.48 trillion in AUM, an increase of $74 billion as compared to the last quarter as most market indices posted gains despite continued volatility. Market increases, foreign exchange movement and reinvested dividends increased assets under management by $65 billion. Total net inflows were $9 billion, inclusive of $8 billion into money market products. I'm pleased to note a return to organic growth as we generated $2.9 billion in net long-term inflows in the first quarter. The improvement in net flows, given the ongoing uncertainty in financial markets, further demonstrates the diverse nature of our business mix and should once again place Invesco among the best-performing asset managers in terms of organic growth. Asset capabilities generated net inflows of $5.4 billion while net redemptions and active strategies moderated with net long-term outflows of $2.5 billion in the first quarter as compared to $10.5 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Key capability areas, including ETFs, fixed income and the institutional channel, all contributed to our growth this quarter. Invesco ETF generated $2.8 billion of net long-term inflows in the first quarter, equivalent to a 4% annualized organic growth rate. Volumes have been down across the ETF industry from the record highs experienced in the first quarter of 2021 through the first quarter of 2022. But as Marty noted, our ETF business has now been in net inflows for 10 out of the past 11 quarters. The NASDAQ 100 QQQM was one of our top-selling ETFs this quarter and has now grown to over $8 billion in AUM since its launch in late 2020. We also saw strong flows into our S&P 500 Equal Weight and BulletShares corporate bond ETF. Partially offsetting growth in equity and fixed income ETFs were $2.5 billion of net outflows and currency and commodity ETFs, which are included in our alternative asset class. We experienced net outflows of $3.7 billion in the retail channel during the first quarter. Net flows were roughly breakeven in EMEA, while Asia-Pacific and the Americas were both in net outflows. As Marty highlighted at the top of the call, the institutional channel garnered net inflows for the 14th straight quarter to $6.6 billion. We were net inflows in all three of our global regions and growth accelerated to 7% on an annualized basis. After several quarters of strength in institutional fixed income, equity mandates were responsible for our largest fundings in the first quarter. Advancing to Slide 6, net flows by geography improved as compared to last quarter and turned positive for the quarter in both Americas and EMEA. This was mainly due to slower redemptions in the retail channel as well as the funding of several institutional mandates. Net flows were breakeven in Asia-Pacific and net outflows in our China joint venture were offset by growth in Japan and our Hong Kong institutional business. Looking at flows by asset class, net outflows and active equity strategies improved in the first quarter, led by moderating of redemptions in our global equity capabilities. Net outflows in global equity strategies were $2.5 billion in the first quarter, including $1.2 billion from our developing markets funds, compares to $6 billion of net long-term outflows in the fourth quarter, which included $3.1 billion of outflows from developing markets. Fixed income capabilities garner $2.5 billion in net long-term inflows despite higher redemptions in Chinese fixed income products that Marty spoke of earlier. Growth in fixed income this quarter spanned both taxable and tax exempt offerings as well as the full range of vehicle types, including mutual funds, ETFs and SMA. This reflects the breadth and depth of our global fixed income franchise, and we see opportunity in this asset class over the remainder of this year. Alternatives experienced net outflows of $3 billion in the first quarter. Private markets net inflows were $600 million, driven by the launch of three CLOs that raised $1.5 billion in aggregate and direct real estate net inflows of $600 million.  Offsetting growth in these areas of private markets were net outflows in bank loan strategies. Currency and commodity ETF net outflows, as I mentioned earlier, were the primary driver of alternative net outflow. I'd like to take a moment to highlight our direct real estate portfolio, which had $73 billion of assets under management as of March 31. Through our real estate business, we offer the full range of investment styles across the risk-return spectrum, and we invest primarily in real estate equity. We also invest in real estate debt, which comprises less than 10% of our global real estate portfolio.  Our direct real estate holdings are well diversified by property type. Commercial office properties comprise about one third of our assets under management. Apartment and other residential properties account for nearly one quarter and industrial properties about one fiffth. The remaining 20% of our properties span retail and specialty sectors, including mixed-use development, self-storage and medical. Finally, we are diversified by geography within each property type. By total asset value, 40% of our office holdings are in EMEA and Asia-Pacific where the market dynamics affecting demand for office space are significantly different than those in the United States and because the adoption of remote working model is much lower outside the U.S. Several of our direct real estate funds use leverage but were measured in our approach and the average loan-to-value across our direct real estate funds was approximately 30% as of December 31. These figures may fluctuate over time, and they vary across specific funds. As Marty mentioned earlier, real estate transaction activity slowed during the first quarter and we would expect activity to be muted over the balance of the year until markets find more stable footing. Longer term, we expect private markets and more specifically, direct real estate and private credit to be a driver of growth and we are in a strong position to capture that demand. And now moving to Slide 7. Our institutional pipeline was $22.1 billion at quarter end, a decrease from $30 billion last quarter. We had good pull through from our pipeline in the first quarter, which contributed to $6.6 billion of net long-term input. Our pipeline has been running in the mid-20 to mid-$30 billion range dating back to late 2019. So this is on the lower end of that range, but we view this pipeline as strong given the market environment and the significant fundings that took place in the first quarter. As we've noted previously, market volatility is causing some mandates to take longer to fund, and we would estimate the funding cycle of our pipeline is running in the three to four quarter range versus the two to three quarters prior to the market downturn. Our solutions capability enabled 14% of the global institutional pipeline as of the first quarter as well as several of the mandates that funded recently. We embed solutions into our client interactions, and we have ongoing engagement about new opportunities. The pipeline reflects a diverse business mix but has helped Invesco sustain organic growth in institutional for more than three years now. Turning to Slide 8. Net revenue of $1.08 billion in the first quarter was $32 million or 3% lower than the fourth quarter and $176 million or 14% lower than the first quarter of last year. The decline from last quarter was mainly attributable to a seasonal decrease in performance fees which were $50 million lower and two fewer days in the first quarter, which accounted for nearly $25 million in lower net revenue. This was partially offset by higher investment management fees of $25 million. The decline from the first quarter of last year was due largely to lower investment management fees driven by lower AUM levels. Total adjusted operating expenses in the first quarter were $749 million, $20 million lower than the prior quarter and $9 million lower than the first quarter of 2022. Compensation expense increased by $12 million as compared to the fourth quarter as seasonally higher payroll taxes and benefits were largely offset by the lower incentive compensation paid on performance fees.  Included in compensation expense this quarter is $13 million of costs related to executive retirements and other organizational changes. We expect to recognize approximately $20 million of additional costs related to executive retirement in the second quarter. As we discussed, we managed variable compensation to a full year outcome in line with company performance and competitive industry practices. Historically, our compensation to net revenue ratio has been in the 38% to 42% range, trending towards the upper end of that range and periods of revenue decline. At current AUM levels, we would expect the ratio to continue to trend towards the higher end of that range for 2023 when excluding the cost pertaining to executive retirement. Marketing expenses of $28 million were $6 million lower than the prior quarter, coming off the seasonal highs we typically see in fourth quarter. Marketing expenses were modestly higher than the same quarter last year by $2 million. Property, office and technology expenses were $5 million lower than last quarter, primarily due to lower software costs and $2 million of property decommissioning associated with our Atlanta move that did not occur. On that note, I'm happy to share that we are speaking to you from our new global headquarters in Midtown Atlanta as we completed our move earlier this month. G&A expenses of $95 million were $21 million lower than the prior quarter partly due to lower third-party spend on technology projects. As we discussed previously, we continue to invest in foundational technology programs that will enable future scale. These expenses span G&A and property office and technology expenses and spend may fluctuate from period to period.  In the first quarter, we also benefited from $10 million in indirect tax credits. We do not anticipate these tax credits will recur at these levels going forward. We maintain an extremely disciplined approach to expense management and are focusing hiring and investment in the key capability areas that are driving our growth. As Marty and I have discussed previously, optimizing resource allocation to efficiently drive growth has and will continue to be a top priority for the organization. Now moving to Slide 9. Adjusted operating income was $327 million in the first quarter, $12 million lower than the prior quarter due to lower net revenue, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Adjusted operating margin was 30.4% broadly in line with 30.6% in the fourth quarter, but lower than the 39.5% a year ago prior to significant market declines. Excluding $13 million of costs related to retirement and other organizational changes, first quarter operating margin would have been 31.6%, an increase of 100 basis points as compared to last quarter. Earnings per share of $0.38 was $0.01 lower than prior quarter and $0.18 lower than the first quarter of '22. Excluding these expenses related to executive retirements and other organizational changes in the first quarter would add $0.02 to earnings per share. The effective tax rate was 24.1% in the first quarter, lower than 26.9% in the prior quarter, primarily due to nonoperating gains on seed money investments and lower tax jurisdictions. We estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 25% for the second quarter of this year. The actual effective rate may vary from this estimate due to the impact of non-recurring items on pretax income and discrete tax items. I'll wrap up on Slide 10. As you heard earlier from Marty and Andrew, building balance sheet strength remains a critical priority. We're making steady progress and total debt of $1.5 billion is at its lowest level in more than a decade. We ended the quarter with $889 million of cash and cash equivalents and 0 borrowing on our credit facility. The first quarter is typically a period of seasonally higher cash fees, and we anticipate building cash in the coming quarters. Our leverage ratio, as defined under our credit facility agreement was 0.8 times at the end of the first quarter, in line with both last quarter and the first quarter of 2022. If preferred stock is included, our fourth quarter leverage ratio was 3.4 times. As highlighted earlier, we're pleased to note that our board approved a 7% increase in our quarterly common dividend to $0.20 per share, effective this quarter. This reflects the strength of our balance sheet, cash position and stable cash flows despite the uncertain markets we have been facing.  We also renewed our credit facility for another five years with favorable terms as well as increasing the capacity of the facility from $1.5 billion to $2 billion. This builds additional flexibility for managing our balance sheet as we prepare to redeem the $600 million senior note maturing in January of 2024. Markets have remained volatile thus far in '23. There have also been signs that a modest recovery could be on the horizon. Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we made this quarter, returning to organic growth, tightly managing expenses and methodically building balance sheet strength.  Our firm has successfully navigated market volatility in the past. We're poised to emerge stronger in a market recovery and capitalize on future growth opportunities where they emerge. There's a lot of hard work ahead of us, and I'm excited to partner with Marty, Andrew and the executive team as we lead Invesco into a new era. And with that, we'll ask the operator to open up the line to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Your line is open. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks, good morning everyone. Allison Dukes : Hey, Craig. Craig Siegenthaler : So my question is on China. So you're seeing bond flows improve really throughout much of the world, but not in China. And I'm guessing the comparatively low interest rate backdrop in China versus the U.S. could be one factor. But can you talk about what's driving the net redemptions in China, not just in your Great Wall JV but across the industry? And also any perspective you have on a rebound, especially given pretty strong long-term dynamics, including aging populations and retirement? Marty Flanagan : Yeah. I'll make a couple of comments and Allison, Andrew can chime in. So as I said, our view has not changed. It's the single greatest opportunity in asset management, and we have a very, very strong position there. You're right. What's really happening is really coming out of this COVID period and frankly, Andrew and I, with the leadership, we were just in China two weeks ago, and I feel they're absolutely focused on economic growth. You can actually feel it as the energy is very, very high. I anticipate the markets will start to follow that in investor behavior behind that. And for sure, by the second half of the year, if not before. And we do look at this first quarter and early December last year is really a transitional period and the redemptions that you saw in fixed income there. But again, we're starting to see behavioral change and frankly, starting to look towards some more balanced equity products to -- in China. So we continue to be bullish about the long term. Allison Dukes : Yeah. I would just say specifically, Craig, I mean, what you saw is the yields really increased in the fourth quarter, and that obviously drove prices lower. And that caused a bit of a spook and it really set investors to redeem and drive redemptions higher industry-wide. So I think to your point around what are we seeing in the industry, and that was really an industry phenomenon that drove that behavior.  It was very pronounced coming into the first quarter. We've definitely seen it begin to moderate the first quarter unfolded and feel better as we're starting the second quarter for sure as we see what's happening there. That also drove product launches lower. And as you know, product launches drive a lot of the flow activity in China. And so in the first quarter, we only launched four products, and they were relatively low in terms of the flow capture there. And again, that was consistent with a lot of the industry dynamics.  We're optimistic to see more in the second quarter. We have a pretty strong pipeline of product launches, and we're optimistic that market sentiment is improving modestly and a lot of the dynamics in that phenomenon should have played itself out. Craig Siegenthaler : Great. Thank you, Allison. And just as a follow-up, I really appreciate those details behind the real estate business. But as you take a step back, how much of that $73 billion of AUM is in vehicles that can be redeemed versus vehicles that are more permanent or long term and can't be redeemed? And then is there any high-level data you can give us to give us some comfort around especially the office portfolio? I'm thinking loan-to-value, interest coverage, ratios like that. Allison Dukes : Sure. Let me take a stab. I'm not sure if I could answer exactly what percentage could be redeemed. I think what I would say is, in general, through cycles we see on average about 5% to 6% of our AUM and a redemption queue. You would expect it to be a little bit higher than that in times of market stress. You'd expect it to be a little bit lower in better markets. And I'd say we're probably running a little bit higher than that 5% to 6% at the moment, but it's not in a disconcerting way. It usually takes a few quarters to fully fulfill some of those redemption requests. And then we also see that in times of equity market recovery, some of those redemption requests actually get canceled. So you manage through, and we'll see where it goes, but we don't feel any sort discomfort with where it is now nor is it unusual relative to past cycles as we think about coming into COVID.  I would note, we've been managing our office exposure down since COVID began in March of 2020. So when you look at where our office exposure was coming into 2020, it made up about 45% of our total portfolio. Today, that's down to about 35%. And as we noted, that's going to be even lower in the United States, and we've been managing it down more aggressively in the U.S. It's going to trend quite a bit higher in places like APAC, where you just have not seen an impact to the office enviroment. In terms of loan-to-value, I would say, generally speaking, it's about a 30% loan to value, it's not running a whole lot higher than that. I will also say in terms of our lenders and the sources of that leverage, it's very well diversified. No concerning exposures anywhere and we feel like we have a lot of diverse good sources of funding, and those have held up really nicely. Craig Siegenthaler : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open. Daniel Fannon : Thanks, good morning. Andrew, I was hoping if you could expand upon the areas of growth, ETF, active fixed income, China solutions, all the areas that have been listed in the presentation and you talked about -- Marty and team have talked about for some time. Curious about how you're thinking about on the margin changing those areas of increased focus or less given the market backdrop today is much different than probably when these were outlined initially a couple of years ago? Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah. Thanks, Dan. Look, like I said at the beginning, over the whole course of my career, the last 20-plus years at Invesco, we've been continuously updating our strategic priorities and adjusting and changing where client needs are going and where we anticipate them going. And I've been a part of putting together those strategic priorities that Allison and Marty have been talking to you all about over the last year or two, and I frankly don't see any of those really changing in terms of our priorities at all.  But what I would say is how do we come up with them. And they're really a function of where we believe client demand will grow and where we think we have competitive strength to build on. And so the areas that I would highlight will sound similar to what you've heard before. I'd really emphasize the barbelling of client needs between also private markets, and ETFs and indexing is a huge part of the growth and where we have strong franchises.  We've talked about China as a growth market for us, and we believe in that regardless of geopolitics and ebbs and flows and cycles. We have strong franchises and active fixed income and solutions and we're going to continue to scale those. And we're going to ensure we have quality and differentiation in our active equity with an emphasis on global in particular. And we're going to continue to build scale through the back and middle office transformations we've been talking about with investments in both foundational technologies and innovation for enhancements.  And I guess what I'd say is we'll continue to look at those and evolve them. The team is highly focused on executing -- we're going to continue to accelerate the pace with regard to that and continue to get sharper on our strategic execution to deliver. So that's pretty much where we are right now, and we'll continue to keep you updated. Daniel Fannon : That's helpful. And then, Allison, just wanted to clarify some of the expense numbers you gave for the quarter. I think you said there was a $10 million onetime benefit. I think that was in G&A. But maybe if you could talk about what the kind of right run rate as we think about the rest of the year based upon what we got here in the first quarter in terms of expense levels? Allison Dukes : Sure. So yes, I noted that there was a $9 million indirect tax credit that was in G&A, and that would not recur. So you shouldn't expect that. I also noted that inside of comp expense, we have an unusual $13 million of retirement expense related to our executive changes. And we expect to incur another $20 million related to the same in the second quarter of this year.  And so when you think about the $9 million that won't recur plus the next $20 million of retirement expense, I would say beyond those, we would expect we can hold expenses roughly flat for the next few quarters, adjusting for variable comp, of course, and that's roughly flat as all things being equal, but we would adjust variable comp in line with market changes. Daniel Fannon : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open. Adam Beatty : Thank you. And good morning. This is Adam Beatty in for Brennan. Just wanted to ask about the institutional pipeline and maybe the pipeline to the pipeline, if you will, how discussions are going there, products or areas of interest. And I think in the past, you've also said that the blended fee rate on the institutional pipeline is roughly the same as the firm-wide blend. Wondering if that's still true after all the 1Q fundings? Thank you. Marty Flanagan : Yeah. Let me make a couple of comments, Allison will chime in here. So let me talk about outside of the United States, as I mentioned, Andrew and I were just out in Asia. The client interactions in China are very strong. We continue to expect growth there institutionally. Japan, also, we look at that as a market fixed income market, in particular, actually the equity. There's demand for equity in Japan, which has been a while since that's been the case, global equity in particular.  And Australia, the client interactions are very strong and that market, in particular, is very much along the line what Andrew just mentioned have been very barbell oriented probably the most extreme that sort we sort of run into and we're positioned very strongly against that, whether it be in private credit is an area of more recent interest where historically it has been I believe real estate and you've heard of our success on the passive side in Australia.  And the same thing in the UK, it's the institutional market continues to be an area for us, fixed income, in particular, actually [indiscernible]. So it's all heading to right way institutional but -- Andrew Schlossberg : I mean, we're well positioned with the strategies that Marty was just alluding to, where we're seeing more and more investor interest be it private markets or indexing fixed income, multi-asset, all sort of in demand. One thing I'd say is Allison can maybe share a couple of details definitely with dislocation that's going on in the market over the last several quarters, we are seeing institutions sort of rethinking their allocations. It's putting decisions in motion that we think are going to be opportunities for us to capture. At the same time though, it is delaying some of those decisions as they're looking for more clarity. So it's a bit of both ends of the spectrum story. Allison Dukes : Yeah. Adam, I just add on the fee rate. And the fee rate does tend to run from -- it ranges from mid-20s to mid-30s basis points. It has been actually holding up very nicely. If you think about the information that we shared on Page 7, you can see a large portion of the pipeline is comprised of active equities as well as alternatives and specifically, that would be private markets primarily.  So it is running on the higher side. I was pleased to see the active equity component of it, recognizing we had some meaningful active equity fundings in the first quarter, and the pipeline is replenishing nicely in a really well-balanced way. It does reflect the barbelling that Andrew noted, but it's holding up nicely in terms of fee composition. Adam Beatty : Excellent. Thank you for all that detail. I appreciate that. And then just a quick follow-up on G&A, and you had a couple of callouts. But just in terms of the sort of third-party spend, I was wondering if that was unusually lower what the trajectory might be looking like for that in the future, just in terms of cost control, it sounds like you've got that pretty well in hand. But just curious on the outlook there? Thank you. Allison Dukes : It was on the low side this quarter, and I would expect it to fluctuate more. I don't expect that lower third-party spend would hold necessarily. But as we noted, the technology, foundational enhancements we've been making, you're going to see that show up in G&A and property office and technology. So I think my comment earlier in response to Dan's question around excluding the indirect tax benefit and excluding the retirement expense, I would expect expenses to be roughly flat for the next few quarters, all things being equal. Adam Beatty : Got it. That's great. Thank you, Allison. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Katz with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Bill Katz : Okay, thank you very much. Marty, congratulations on your next phase of your career and Andrew as well. So just coming back to the private market, private credit opportunity. Could you maybe talk a little bit, go into the next layer down in terms of where you see the opportunity on direct lending? And then incrementally, where else you might sort of need to spend? And then, Andrew, you mentioned you're seeing some reallocations by institutions. Can you talk about where they're coming from to fund some of the new opportunities? Thanks. Marty Flanagan : Let me have a couple of comments and I'll say here. So first of all, Bill, thanks for your comments. The fundamental strength is bank loan CLOs, and that is the core of the franchise. We have been building out the same direct lending. We do see that as an opportunity. We also know some crowded space. But we have good capabilities for performance. So that is a focus for us in private credit also where we are certainly see a manager institutionally led. Frankly, Australia tends to be an area that's focused on right now on our capabilities. So we'll see where that goes. But again, those are two add-ons of our core capabilities there, and we think there's opportunity. Allison Dukes : I don't know if I'd add anything there. I'll say this, and I'll let Andrew chime in because I think you actually interacted that last part of the question there. In terms of where we expect to -- how we expect to continue to fund growth in the key capabilities, I would just say that's exactly what we've been doing for the last two years. And so as you think about the fact that we've been managing expenses lower for the last 18 months. Obviously, that's been against a very challenging market backdrop.  We've been investing throughout and we have been reallocating ever since we did our strategic review a couple of years ago, consistently reallocating expenses to fund these key growth capabilities. So the growth of China, the growth of private markets, the growth of our fixed income business, our ETF franchise, we have been investing all along the way and really holding expenses very tightly managed, well maintained alongside that. So I just want to make sure it's clear that's not a new strategy. That's exactly what we've been focused on as a team. Andrew Schlossberg : And Bill, thanks for the question. What I would add to Allison's last point and then to pick up on Marty's is just to emphasize what Allison said that reallocation is going to continue. And it's going to continue towards private markets, both our real estate equity and debt and our private credit, which comprises the bank loan strategies that Marty was talking about as well as direct lending and distress that. We see demand over the long run continuing to grow there.  In terms of your question about where we're seeing money come from, it's a little early to pinpoint it exactly. But a couple of things we're seeing. One, we're actually seeing people moving beyond their passive cap-weighted benchmarks and actually moving out to other forms of indexing, but also into active strategies, both on the equity and fixed income side, which we think is a real positive thing. We're also seeing them kind of reallocate across their private markets and alternative portfolios leaning more towards some of the things that we were emphasizing in credit. But again, that's early days as people are working through their private portfolio is taking a little bit longer. So those are some of the areas where we're seeing movement. Bill Katz : Okay. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, you mentioned that to continue to build the balance sheet as you go through this year in anticipation of sort of paying down the debt in January of next year. Looking beyond that, could you talk a little bit about capital management priorities and how you think about M&A, what you might need versus capital return? Thank you. Marty Flanagan : Yeah. Let me make comments and turn it over. So -- just at a high level, our priorities don't change. It has not changed, and Andrew and Allison can talk about it, is really reinvesting in the business. And I think we've probably done the best job that we've done as a management team of reallocating into areas of growth and sort of squeezing cost out of areas that are less an opportunity as you go forward.  We've always looked at M&A as fueling a strategic gap if we can do it organically, and that really has not changed. But Andrew, why don't you pick up with your thoughts there? Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah. I mean just to absolutely emphasize what Marty said, the commitment to our balance sheet and improving it remains a significant focus for me and the executive leadership team moving forward. We'll continue the priorities that Allison and Marty have described. With regard to M&A, just as Marty said, we feel really good about the portfolio of businesses we have, the geographies, the position to our clients, and we feel like we have scale and strength to move forward with the business we have today. We'll continue to pay attention to the M&A environment, but it's not the priority at the moment. Allison Dukes : I think the only thing I would add to all of that is our strategy is to put our balance sheet in a position where we can be opportunistic. We feel very good about the capabilities we have, but we're very focused on improving the balance sheet. I'm very pleased that we were able to raise the $2 billion in the midst of this environment over the last six weeks. We've got a terrific, very supportive group of lenders. I think it puts us in a great position to be able to continue to manage our leverage profile down both at the upcoming '24 to be able to pay that off of a combination of cash and usage of the revolver.  And beyond that, our next maturity is in 2026, it's $500 million. I think we'll be in a terrific position to continue to manage our capital structure down from there. So I think if anything, we feel like we're on our front foot, and we continue to put ourselves in a position to operate on our front foot. Bill Katz : Thank you. Marty Flanagan : Thanks, Bill. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. First, Marty, it's been a pleasure working with you all these years. First Franklin then Invesco. So best of luck on the next step in your career. On China and Asia, as mentioned a number of times, money coming out of fixed income, where is that money going to? Is it largely cash? Or is it some of it going into equities given the rally we've seen there? And is there a better opportunity to capture that money as it transitions from one asset class to another?  And in terms of maybe what's going on in Asia outside of China, I think we sort of danced around this a couple of times. But to what extent are higher rates impacting the demand for some of Invesco's more popular yield-focused products like bank loans to real estate and CLOs? I think like you said you raised three CLOs that seems to be contrary to what we're seeing elsewhere. So you're having success there and then bank loan seems more standard with outflows. So how does this all sort of circle around the demand for Asia for these higher-yielding products? Marty Flanagan : Yeah. Let me make a couple of comments and thanks for your comments, and by the way, 18 years goes very fast as you all know, and that's just here. So let me -- Allison will hit on this. So what we've seen in China and say, in the retail market right now, I mean, you are definitely seeing the beginning of investor confidence strengthened, and so we are seeing moving more towards balance products and equity products there, which is not in the case for some period of time.  And again, as I said, Andrew and I were just there. You just can sense the confidence growing in the marketplace. So we anticipate that to continue to grow. When you -- the institutional clients, there are like -- all of them are very, very sophisticated they don't move their portfolios that much. I understand the point, I'd say they're probably more reflective at the moment of where do they want to see the market settle out for their investments. So we don't know if there's any real great insights there.  What we are seeing in Japan, for example, there is interest in active fixed income, which has really not been experience for us recently, it's been more passive, and also growth in some global equity capabilities, again, which is not what we've seen for a number of years. I talk about Australia, so I won't go there but Andrew what would you add? Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah. The one thing I'd say in the long run, Ken, to the question on China, the single biggest opportunity is the retirement market development in China. And so the notion of looking at more traditional asset allocations and a long-term asset allocations, we think is going to begin to find its way into that marketplace.  Also, the digital sort of distribution and the way that digital is the primary way that retail investors invest, there is a higher turn. But that also means that they're able to kind of look at the trends and we're starting to see some of the equity movement even early on there. So that's all I'd add for now. Ken Worthington : Great, thanks very much. Marty Flanagan : Thanks Ken. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Michael Cyprys : Great, thank you. Good morning. So just a question on the Greater China business. Just curious how you think about the stickiness and duration of AUM in your Greater China business versus other regions of the world. I think if we look overall, your retail business has about 3.5-year duration or so for your retail customers. Just curious how different that is in China? How do you see that evolving over time? And then how does the cost of gathering new flows in China compared to, say, the U.S. business? Marty Flanagan : Yeah. Again, I'll make a couple of comments and Andrew can chime in. So -- but we're very bullish. I mean, it is a single largest opportunity in asset management. Just if you look at a global flows into the industry, China is going to make up third of those flows over the next three to five years. And that's just for all the reasons that we know the size of the population, the absolute focus on developing a retirement system and so very different than most markets. You're not in over in dollars, there's new money coming in. So if you're strongly placed, you're going to grow and we are strongly placed.  Also very differently that ever started it on so much the money probably half the flows are coming through a digital wealth platforms right now. It's actually astonishing just -- and financial, for example, they have 800 million clients and so you don't need a lot of money to make a big impact.  So I'd say we're just early days in what you're going to see happening. So the cost structure, I think it's also very important to know, it's a very, very competitive market. It's probably most might be the most competitive market in the world. So it's not easy to be successful there, and it's not inexpensive to operate there. But Allison can speak in more details. It's very profitable, and we have scale and it's reflected in the margins that we have. But --- Allison Dukes : Yeah. I would say, look, it's accretive to the firm margins. It's a well-scaled business, even though we think we've got a lot of room to continue to grow it, but it is accretive to the firm margins overall. And while it is a competitive marketplace, as Marty noted, we're the 12th largest asset manager in China and the -- we're the largest foreign asset manager. The 11 ahead of us are all Chinese owned. And so we are very well positioned. We are a very competitive player. We have an opportunity to really not only grow as the market grows there, but also take market share as we've been able to do in the last few years. So in terms of the cost of gathering, I think it's a very well-managed accretive business overall. Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah. And the only thing I'd add just -- and it was reminded actually being on the region recently, as Marty mentioned, I mean it's we're very well regarded in the market. And our reputation has been built over 20 years. In fact, we're celebrating our 20th anniversary this year of IGW, of Invesco Great Wall, and being in that market for a long period of time, not only build the scale that we have today that Allison was mentioning, but also just the reputation with all parts of the ecosystem there. And so we think it's a real differentiator, just the longevity of our JV. Michael Cyprys : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Patrick Davitt : Hi, good morning, everyone. I think this was the first quarter of meaningful UK inflows in many years. Could you flesh that out a bit more? Is there something unique or lumpy that happened? Or are you starting to sense a real positive shift is finally emerging there? Thank you. Marty Flanagan : Look, I'll make a comment, Andrew, and EMEA for a number of years. So he was lucky enough to be there during the Brexit. So perspective. A lot of changes happen and a lot of good work. I feel really good about what's happening in the UK, and around the continent. I was in institutional retail, and there's been a lot of focus there. There was a big institutional mandate that funded this quarter, but I'd say the underlying fundamentals are strong. And we anticipate -- also noted, all things being equal, we anticipate to be a net inflow here for the year, but Andrew you want to add. Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah. I mean, it's all -- we've always had a high-quality sort of active focus in the marketplace in the UK, in particular, our legacy on the equity side and the performance is getting -- has gotten stronger in those asset classes and as some demands come back, we're capturing it. So I'd say it's largely on the back of good investment performance. Allison Dukes : Yeah. On the yields of that investment performance, we're seeing retail redemption improve overall. And so obviously, the UK is working through their rate environment and their economic environment, much like we are -- we think we're really well positioned to capture additional flows, though, as rates stabilize and as sentiment at some point, improved over there as well. Patrick Davitt : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, all. Thanks for taking the question. This is Luke on Alex's behalf. As part of Andrew's announcement, you guys highlighted a number of other operational realignments. Can you just help frame the operational benefits of these and any potential cost saving opportunities that could be realized? And over what period of time do you think that could occur? Thanks. Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah. So I'll pick up on some of the benefits, and I'll let Allison chime in as well here. So there's a few, and let me start at the top. We definitely believe it's going to help us accelerate the execution of the strategy and the strategic priorities we've been outlining. We think it's going to help us internally streamline some decision-making, simplify ourselves and be able to move at pace, and that's what's required by our clients right now to move at pace and to deliver good results and quality service.  We think that these changes will also help us enhance our investment quality over time. And ultimately, we think it's going to help us further leverage the global operating platform and the scale that we've built over time. Allison? Allison Dukes : Yeah. Look, I wouldn't point to cost savings just yet. There are a lot of ins and outs and puts and takes as we're thinking about reorganizing around these changes, but really chiming in on Andrew's comments. We're very focused on making the organizational -- organization simpler and more streamlined so that as we gain scale, we can generate additional operating leverage and really starting to get ourselves organized in a way that we do not have to grow expenses too much as markets improve. But more importantly, as we grow organically and create that organic fee rate growth.  So I think at this point, we think these changes are going to be very helpful, and they organize the company in a more simple way. And we'll look forward to sharing more as we continue working away. Marty Flanagan : And let me just wrap up. So the other really important thing and we've been talking about it here today and previously, this will absolutely facilitate being able to reallocate assets or dollars in time and expertise to areas of growth. I have a high degree of confidence and Andrew and Allison and the team, I said that before, is going to be the most experience and talented team that Invesco has ever had and a high degree of confidence in the future and what they're going to be executing against. So it's really very exciting for clients, employees and shareholders very importantly. So with that, thank you very much, and we'll talk to you in July. Allison Dukes : Thank you. Andrew Schlossberg : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. You may all disconnect at this time. Speakers, you may stand by for post conference.",

[Operator Instructions] Today's call is also being recorded. Now I'd like to turn today's meeting over to your host, Mr. Greg Ketron, Invesco's Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Greg Ketron : Okay. Thanks, operator, and to all of you joining us on Invesco's quarterly earnings call. In addition to today's press release, we've provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address. The press release and presentation are available on our website, invesco.com. This information can be found by going to the Investor Relations section of the website. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slide 2 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix or the appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. Finally, Invesco is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized webcast are located on our website. Andrew Schlossberg, President and CEO; and Allison Dukes, Chief Financial Officer will present our results this morning. And then we will open the call up for questions. First, however, I'd like to turn the call over to Marty Flanagan, Chairman Emeritus, who retired as CEO on June 30 after 18 years to provide a few comments before we get into the second quarter results. Marty? Marty Flanagan : Thank you, Greg. And before I turn the call over to Andrew and Allison, I want to say it's been a pleasure to work with all of you over the years. It's really been an exciting, challenging [indiscernible] participate in a fascinating industry that has continued to evolve and change, but always seeking to create better outcomes for clients and shareholders. Over the years, I've learned from my engagement with all of you, all the key stakeholders, clients, analysts and shareholders, which has been instrumental in the success of Invesco. I'm immensely proud of this organization and the talented people around the world that make Invesco what it is. There's a tremendous opportunity for the firm going forward. Invesco has the right strategy, the right team leading this organization into the future while navigating a challenging current market environment. The reality is that the strategies across firms in our industry are not very different. What separates winners and losers are those organizations that can execute effectively across all cycles and market conditions. Andrew, Allison and the rest of the executive leadership team and our broader senior leadership team, represent the most talented and experienced team Invesco has ever had. They are laser focused on accelerating the growth strategy and making the necessary changes for the benefit of clients and shareholders. This is a team very well prepared and knows how to execute and deliver for all stakeholders. I'm confident in Andrew's and the leadership team's ability to achieve the full potential, and I look forward to seeing the firm to do great things in the years ahead. Thank you. Andrew, I'll turn it over to you. Andrew Schlossberg : Thanks very much, Marty, and good morning to everyone. I'm pleased to be speaking with you today, and I look forward to continuing to work with all of you on the call. It's an absolute privilege to lead a global investment management organization built with such a solid client-centered foundation and which possesses significant potential as we focus on delivering value for clients while innovating to meet their evolving needs. We have exceptional talent, robust investment capabilities, deep relationships with clients and a strong presence in key markets across the globe, all of which positions us well to stay in front of and lead during a period of growth and change in the asset management industry. At our core, we will be focused on delivering investment excellence for our clients. While we are pleased to have a strong foundation, we are not at all satisfied with our results to date and we are committed to improving our performance by simplifying our organizational model, aligning our expense base, strengthening our strategic focus, being agile and innovative in advancing our use of technology and executing at pace. We believe this will lead to outstanding client experience, attraction and retention of top talent and an enhanced ability to generate profitable growth for the future. I could not be more confident in the talented, experienced and collaborative team we have in place to take advantage of opportunities in the market and address the challenges confronting our clients and our industry. I want to again thank Marty for his visionary leadership that has provided Invesco, the foundation to capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead. With that, I'll start today's presentation of second quarter results on Slide 3 for those following along. In the second quarter, financial markets showed signs of recovery even as investors continue to grapple with significant uncertainty. Recovery was uneven across sectors and geographies and while the headline moves and market indices were positive, the underlying client environment continues to be relatively cautious given the uncertain economic backdrop. Market gains were narrowly distributed, U.S. equity market increases were concentrated in large-cap technology stocks, while non-U.S. equity markets, most notably emerging international and China as well as most long-dated bond index returns were flat or negative. Client actions in the quarter remained risk off, resulting in slower industry growth and long-term assets while cash strategies continue to account for a historically large proportion of client portfolios. We did see an uptick in investor appetite for risk assets in June, providing some optimism for a broader recovery on the horizon. Across our investment platform, performance is steadily improving in several of our key global equity capabilities and our fixed income performance remains robust across the board. Building on the delivery and quality of investment performance remains a key focus for me and for the management team. From an asset flow perspective, in the second quarter, Invesco's diversified business continues to deliver for our clients and prove resilient against market and industry challenges with sustained organic growth in several key capability areas where there is continued high client demand. The largest driver of growth in the quarter was our global ETF business. Net long-term inflows accelerated to $5.7 billion, more than double the growth we experienced in the first quarter and higher than our AUM market share. Our ETF capabilities have demonstrated the ability to sustain growth through the full market cycle with organic growth in 11 of the past 12 quarters. Our business maintains a revenue profile that is differentiated from competitors with the concentration of strategies, including things like alternative beta, commodities, senior loans and laddered maturity products. I'm also pleased to note that our business in Greater China returned to organic growth this quarter with $1.6 billion in net long-term inflows. While the higher fixed income redemptions the industry experienced earlier this year have abated, organic growth in China's asset management industry has remained slower so far this year and overall assets raised by new fund launches across the industry sent to their lowest levels since 2019. Despite this, Invesco Great Wall raised $1.4 billion from six new product launches in the second quarter, which ranked us fifth amongst all asset managers in China, which is well above our overall number 12 ranking in that market. As the China economy recovers, we are extremely well positioned to capture additional market share in the world's fastest-growing asset management market. Client preferences for risk-off assets did continue to benefit our fixed income franchise across both institutional and retail channels, including mutual funds and SMAs. We generated a positive $1 billion in net long-term fixed income flows this quarter, extending our streak to 18 consecutive positive flow quarters. Our money market business continues to show strong growth and market share gains. We brought in $15 billion of net new assets this quarter, and we've moved into the top 10 of money market managers in the U.S. institutional channel. We expect our overall fixed income franchise to continue to grow and benefit from our strong investment performance and the greater clarity we expect on the horizon as the interest rate picture becomes more clear in coming quarters. Within active equity strategies, we did experience net long-term outflows of $4.5 billion in the second quarter, global and emerging market equities, where client demand has been slow to recover, and industry flows remain negative. This accounted for nearly 70% of our active equity net outflows. While headwinds have persisted in the asset class, net outflows for Invesco in developing markets were $1.2 billion. This is consistent with our experience last quarter, but meaningfully lower than last year. I'm optimistic for further stabilization of net flows in these key investment strategies as performance continues to improve and when client demand for risk on assets returns. As we discussed on our last earnings call, growth in private markets has been more challenging this year due to overall market conditions, and we experienced $1.7 billion in net outflows in these areas during the second quarter. Despite the near-term headwinds, we have an excellent track record in both private real estate and private credit sectors, and we are well positioned to capture long-term growth in these asset classes, particularly in the underpenetrated wealth management channels in both the U.S. and globally. We expect our private markets and alternative capabilities to be an engine of growth in our future years and Allison is going to provide much more color on that business later in her comments. From a client and channel perspective, retail and wealth management flows were modestly positive in the second quarter, while our institutional channel had $2.2 billion in net outflows. This is the first outflow quarter in three years. And this comes following an especially strong quarter for fundings in the first quarter, where we had $6.6 billion of net inflows. As Allison will discuss later, our pipeline remains robust and a significant portion of our one-not-funded mandates are in higher yielding equity and alternative strategies. The longer-term growth of our institutional channels is a testament to our strength of that business and the depth of our client relationships that we have built over many years. As such, I am confident that we will again see robust growth in this channel as client caution abates and as reallocations begin to occur across this part of the industry. Building balance sheet strength, continuing to invest in key growth areas and returning capital to shareholders are top priorities for us. To that end, I'm pleased to note that in the first half of June, we repurchased $150 million in common stock. We are able to capitalize on an attractive valuation because of the strong balance sheet position that the firm has worked hard to build over the last several years. We are determined to continue to build on that progress. We are also committed to driving a high level of financial performance in Invesco. We will keep our clients and service levels front and center while also striving for accelerated profit growth. The leadership changes we announced in February have put us in a position to unlock more opportunity for the firm, and we continue to implement related organizational changes in the second quarter. We are taking action to simplify the company and eliminate sources of complexity that were necessary in the past, but may no longer be appropriate today. This will help us shift investment to our strategic priorities and areas of growth while ensuring our clients continue to receive investment quality and the exceptional service that's one of the hallmarks of Invesco. The primary benefits of these changes will be seen over time as revenue growth recovers and we take advantage of our further scale. At the same time, we are taking actions that will enhance our near-term profitability and have identified an initial set of cost savings. Work will continue to identify an action, additional efficiencies and enhancement opportunities and Allison is going to provide further detail on those efforts shortly. Although there is lots of work to do, Invesco is well positioned to take advantage of opportunities and address the challenges confronting the marketplace. I could not be more confident in the team that we have in place to execute on the opportunities that Marty created over his 18 years as CEO of Invesco. With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Allison for a closer look at our results, and I look forward to your questions. Allison Dukes : Thank you, Andrew, and I also want to convey my appreciation to Marty for his leadership. Good morning to everybody joining us today. I'm going to begin on Slide 4. Overall investment performance improved in the second quarter with 66% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers or beating benchmark on both a three-year and a five-year basis. This is an improvement from 64% for both time frames in the first quarter. We have excellent performance in fixed income across nearly all capabilities and time horizons. Performance lagged benchmark in certain U.S. core and gross equity funds. Performance in global and emerging markets equities has been a headwind, but we are encouraged to see steady and meaningful improvement emerging in this asset class. Turning to Slide 5. AUM was $1.54 trillion at the end of the second quarter, which was $55 billion higher than the last quarter. Technology stock surged in the second quarter, and as a result, QQQ AUM reached $200 billion, an increase of $27 billion as compared to the end of the first quarter. Market increases and additional products, foreign exchange movements and reinvested dividends combined to increase assets under management by a further $15 billion. Net inflows in the money market products were $15 billion, and net long-term outflows were $2 billion. Despite the net long-term outflows for the quarter, we exited the quarter with strong momentum after more than $2 billion of net inflows for the month of June. We expect that we outperformed most peers on a net flow basis, another data point demonstrating the value of our breadth of capabilities in a difficult environment for our organic asset growth. Client demand for passive capabilities was strong. And as a result, we garnered $6.4 billion of net long-term inflows in the second quarter. Offsetting the growth in asset was $8.4 billion of net outflows and active strategies. Through growth in our key capability areas, we are recapturing client demand as it moves to favored capabilities led this quarter by growth in ETF and our business in Greater China. Our global ETF franchise delivered a strong quarter, growing at a 9% annualized organic growth rate with $5.7 billion of net inflows. Our top-selling ETFs included the S&P 500 Equal Weight and the QQQM, which grew to over $13 million in AUM after posting $3.3 billion net influx. Innovation remains a key strength in this area, the QQQM, which was launched less than three years ago, now representing the fifth largest ETF in our lineup. Currency and commodity ETFs, part of our alternative asset class experienced net outflows of $1.1 billion during the quarter. We delivered net inflows of $200 million from retail clients in the second quarter, an improvement from $3.7 billion in net outflows in the prior quarter. A rebound in Asia Pacific net flows was the primary driver of growth. More specifically, we've experienced strong growth in Japan for several quarters now, ending the second quarter with $54 billion of AUM. Our Henley Global Equity and Income Fund garnered $1.6 billion of net inflows from Japanese clients, making it the top selling retail fund in Japan on both a quarterly and year-to-date basis. Moving forward, we are well positioned in this important market and Japanese markets are experiencing some of the most constructive conditions for risk on assets in many years. Offsetting growth in the retail channel was $2.2 billion of net long-term outflows in the institutional channel, primarily in the Americas. The channel remains in net inflows year-to-date after $6.6 billion of net inflows in the first quarter. Further, we have a robust and diversified one-not-funded pipeline. Moving to Slide 6. Net long-term inflows resumed in Asia Pacific with $1.5 billion in the second quarter due to the growth I just discussed in Japan and a rebound to net inflows in our China joint venture. Net outflows were modestly negative in the Americas and in EMEA. Looking at flows by asset class. Fixed income capabilities experienced net inflows for the 18th straight quarter with $1 billion. Drivers of growth this quarter included China, where we launched an institutional fixed income product and our tax-managed SMA capability, partially offset by net outflows in EMEA ETFs. Net outflows in global and emerging market equities continued to be a headwind in the second quarter with $3 billion of net outflows, including $1.2 billion from our emerging market spot. Encouragingly, this is similar to the net outflows experienced last quarter from emerging markets and below the redemption rates we experienced last year. We are optimistic that headwinds appear to be further diminishing in emerging markets. Alternative net outflows were $3.4 billion in the second quarter. Public alternatives accounted for $1.9 billion with $1.1 billion concentrated in commodity and currency ETFs as commodities have been out of favor across the industry in recent quarters. Private markets net outflows were $1.5 billion, inclusive of $1 billion of net outflows in direct real estate strategies. As we move to Slide 7, I'd like to take a few minutes to highlight our global alternative platform, which had $182 billion in assets under management as of June 30. Although market conditions have made it a challenging year for organic growth in the asset class, we have high conviction that alternatives will be one of the key pillars of our long-term success. Within alternatives, we have a diverse range of capabilities, including $72 billion of public alternatives, spanning commodity strategies, listed real estate and hedged and macro strategy. Real estate is the largest component of our private alternatives platform, with $72 billion in direct real estate AUMs at the end of second quarter. Invesco competes throughout the capital stack by investing in direct real estate and originating real estate debt. Our direct real estate business offers a range of investment styles, including core and core plus strategies as well as funds with higher return strategies. Our private credit platform is the second component of our private alternatives business with $38 billion in assets under management, anchored by our bank loan capability that holds U.S. and European securities. We have over 30 years of experience managing senior corporate loans, relationships with over 2,000 unique companies and more than 200 private equity firms. More recently, we began to offer direct lending to middle-market companies as well as opportunistic investments in special situations and distressed credit. On Slide 8, we want to provide a deeper look at our direct real estate portfolio, where we have 40 years of experience investing on behalf of our clients worldwide. Our direct real estate holdings are well diversified by product property type. Commercial office properties comprise about 35% of our AUM. Apartments and other residential properties account for approximately 23%. And the AUM share of industrial properties, about 22% at the end of the second quarter. The final 20% of our AUM is invested in retail and specialty sectors, including mixed-use developments, self-storage and medical. Focusing on office properties specifically, since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we've been deliberately managing our exposure down, particularly in the Americas and EMEA as market dynamics have shifted with attitudes towards remote work. In the first quarter of 2020, 42% of our institutional open-end AUM and core and core plus strategies was comprised of traditional office properties. At the end of the second quarter, it was 27%, and our exposure in the Americas was reduced by about one-third. Several of our direct real estate funds use leverage but were measured in our approach and the average loan-to-value across our direct real estate funds was approximately 35% as of March 31, 2023. These figures may fluctuate over time and vary across specific funds. We serve our clients through a range of vehicle types and manage liquidity in accordance with the established bylaws of each fund. Approximately half of our AUM is in institutional separate accounts or closed-end funds with a predetermined life. The remainder in open-end vehicles that manage redemptions on a best effort basis. In our open-end funds, redemption requests go into a queue and are mainly met by net investors into the fund. Investors in our open-end strategies are highly sophisticated institutional investors that understand it may take several quarters to work down a redemption queue while preserving the fund performance for all investors. Of our full business cycle, we would expect funds to average a redemption queue of 5% to 6% of NAV. This can fluctuate higher in times of market volatility like we've been experiencing recently. As of the end of the second quarter, all of our open-end funds were operating according to normal redemption protocols and our real estate teams have successfully navigated market cycles for four decades. Real estate activity has been slower during the first half of 2023, and we would expect activity to be muted in the near term until market conditions improve. In the long run, we expect that investor demand for private market capabilities will grow significantly, and we're well positioned to capitalize on that growth. Let's all move to Slide 9. Our institutional pipeline was $22 billion at quarter end, consistent with last quarter. Although we experienced net outflows in the second quarter, our institutional business remains in net inflows for the year-to-date, and we continue to win new mandates. Our pipelines have been running in the mid-20 to mid-$30 billion range, dating back to late 2019. So this is on the lower end of that range. We view our pipeline as strong given the market volatility we've been experiencing and the $6.6 billion in net inflows that occurred in the first quarter. As we've noted previously, some mandates are taking longer to fund in this environment, we would estimate the funding cycle of our pipeline is running in the three to four quarter range versus two to three quarters prior to the market downturn. Our solutions capability enabled 35% of the global institutional pipeline in second quarter and we're pleased to see this share increased from 14% last quarter. We embed solutions into our client interactions, and we have ongoing engagements about new opportunities. The pipeline reflects a diverse business mix with alternative and active equity accounting for 40% of the total associated assets. Now turning to Slide 10. Net revenue of $1.09 billion in the second quarter was $83 million lower than the second quarter of 2022 and $15 million or 1% higher than the first quarter. The decline from the second quarter of last year was due largely to lower investment management fees, driven by asset mix favoring lower-yielding strategies. The sequential quarter increase was primarily due to higher performance fees earned on private real estate mandates, a $4 million decline in other revenues partially offset the increase in performance fees. A shift in asset mix has had a meaningful impact on our revenue due to the uneven performance across key market indices as well as investor preferences for passive and risk of strategies, including demand for money market products. Total average AUM for the second quarter of $1.49 trillion, with $32 billion or 2% higher than the first quarter. However, $25 billion of the increase was in QQQ average AUMs for which we do not earn management fees. A further $4 million of the increase was in money market AUM. Meanwhile, average passive AUM ex-QQQ was up $3 billion and average active AUM was flat to last quarter. As compared to the second quarter of 2022, total average AUM increased by $38 billion or 3%. The primary driver was a $58 billion increase in average money market AUM given the risk of investor sentiment of the past 12 months. Average assets in the QQQ were $12 billion higher than the second quarter of 2022. Average passive AUM, excluding the Qs, increased by $9 billion while average active AUM declined by 5%. We believe that a meaningful portion of the asset mix shift that has occurred is a product of market movements and risk of sentiment, and those pressures should abate as preference for risk assets, returns and conditions improve. That said, growth in investor preference for passive exposure and solutions capabilities is a long-term secular trend, and we continue to reposition our cost base to align with changes in our business mix as we build greater scale in key capability areas. Total adjusted operating expenses in the second quarter were $789 million, $27 million higher than the second quarter of 2022 and an increase of $40 million from the prior quarter. Included in our second quarter operating expenses were $27 million of compensation expenses related to executive retirements and organizational changes. In the second quarter of 2022 expenses of this nature were not included in our non-GAAP results as they were included in transaction, integration and restructuring expenses. We recognized $13 million of such expenses in the first quarter of 2023. Also impacting second quarter compensation expense with higher incentive pay on $22 million of performance fees partially offset by a seasonal decline in payroll taxes. As Andrew noted, we are simplifying the organization to position the firm for greater scale and profitability as we grow our revenue base. The majority of the $27 million of compensation expense I mentioned was related to executive retirements and the balance was a result of other organizational actions taken in the quarter. We will action further adjustments to our operating model over the remainder of 2023 and would expect to recognize approximately $20 million of additional costs associated with these decisions in the third quarter. The full benefits from our simplification efforts will be seen over time as we generate revenue growth and margin recovery. To this point, we have identified $50 million of annual run rate expense savings that will be realized by the beginning of 2024. Work is ongoing to quantify and action additional opportunities, and we will keep you informed on our progress. As we've discussed, we managed variable compensation to a full-year outcome in line with company performance and competitive industry practices. Historically, our compensation to net revenue ratio has been in the 38% to 42% range, trending towards the upper end of that range and periods of revenue decline. At current AUM levels, we would expect the ratio to continue to be at or slightly above the high end of the range for 2023, when excluding the cost pertaining to executive retirements and other organizational changes. Marketing expenses of $32 million, $4 million higher than the prior quarter, indicative of the seasonally higher activity we typically see in second quarter. Marketing expenses were $4 million lower than the second quarter of last year as we are tightly managing discretionary spend in this revenue environment. Property, office and technology expenses were $2 million higher than the first quarter primarily due to higher software costs, partially offset by the end of overlapping rent now that we have completed the move to our new Atlanta headquarters. G&A expenses of $114 million increased $19 million from the prior quarter. Second quarter expenses included approximately $7 million in spending on our Alpha NextGen program, which was previously included in transaction, integration and restructuring expenses. Going forward, these costs will be reflected in our non-GAAP results. We would expect quarterly average spending on Alpha NextGen to remain at the same level for the next few quarters. As we mentioned on our last call, we benefited from indirect tax credits in the first quarter, a reduction in credits received drove a $3 million increase in expenses quarter-over-quarter. The remaining increase in G&A expenses related to higher project spending for ongoing technology improvement initiatives as well as normal fluctuation that we can see in G&A period to period after relatively lower spending in Q1. Looking ahead, we expect G&A expenses in the third quarter to be flat to modestly lower than the second quarter. We're balancing continued investment in our key growth areas and technology programs while diligently managing discretionary spend, and we are limiting hiring to key growth areas and critical positions. We've also been increasing our use of lower cost locations where it makes sense to do so. As an executive leadership team, we are committed to driving profitable growth in the coming quarters. Moving to Slide 11. Adjusted operating income was $302 million in the second quarter, which included the costs related to executive retirements and other organizational changes. Adjusted operating margin was 27.7% for the second quarter. Excluding the costs related to retirement and other org changes, second quarter operating margin would have been 250 basis points higher. Earnings per share was $0.31 in the second quarter, excluding those same expenses related to executive retirement and organizational changes, second quarter earnings per share would have been $0.05 higher. The effective tax rate was 24.7% in the second quarter. We estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 25% for the third quarter of 2023. The actual effective rate may vary from this estimate due to the impact of nonrecurring items on pretax income and discrete tax items. I'll finish on Slide 12. Building balance sheet strength has been an unwavering priority, and I'm pleased to note that our cash balance increased in the second quarter to $1.01 billion, and that with $1.5 billion of outstanding debt that lowered our net debt to less than $500 million. We were able to achieve this reduction in net debt while also repurchasing $150 million of common stock in the quarter, or 9.6 million shares, equivalent to 2% of the total common shares outstanding. The share buybacks occurred at an average price of $15.65, which we viewed as a very attractive opportunity. The improvements we have made on the balance sheet in the past several years facilitated our ability to take advantage of this opportunity. Our leverage ratio, as defined under our credit facility agreement was 0.7x at the end of the second quarter modestly lower than last quarter. We are committed to building an even stronger balance sheet, and our goal is to bring net debt excluding the preferred shares down to zero in 2024. We have an opportunity to further address outstanding debt with the maturity of the $600 million in senior notes at the end of January. We ended the second quarter with nothing drawn on our revolving credit facility. To conclude the resiliency of our firm's net flows performance in a difficult market for organic growth is evident again this quarter, and I'm pleased with the progress we're making to simplify the organization and build a stronger balance sheet while continuing to invest in key capability areas. As a firm, we're committed to driving profitable growth and a high level of financial performance, and we're confident that we have the right talent, mindset and strategic positioning to do so. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thanks. Appreciate it. Just a follow-up question on real estate. So obviously not unique to Invesco, but just given higher rate, some problem areas and long-tail workouts across parts of real estate demand is low as you mentioned. So curious if you could just sum up what's the overall message on the health of the current portfolio? I think you put all that extra disclosure to tell us it's good. But I wonder if you could just comment that. And two more importantly, what do you think the environment does need to look like for demand for real estate related products to improve? Because that would be a big growth driver for when we get there. Allison Dukes : Sure. Why don't I start. I'd say the overall message on the health of the portfolio is, yes, as you said, it's good. Look, it is in terms of where we are from a cyclicality perspective, it's been a challenging environment. That's not unique to us, and that has a lot to do with some of the \u2013 just the backup and transactions in that market as rates have increased, the return profile, the ability to put leverage on some of these transactions, it's more difficult. And that's caused a back up, a slowdown in some of the transactions, which slows down activity overall. That said, as we tried to highlight some of the detail we provided, our portfolio is performing very well. And we are long-term, very optimistic about how we're positioned. And I would say everything is performing as one would expect in an environment like this. And we think we've made a lot of good strong decisions to diversify that portfolio, especially managing down the office exposure in advance of some of the downturn of the last year, and we feel good about where we're positioned overall. What does it take to see activity pick back up? I definitely think normalization in the leverage markets will help quite a bit. That has been, obviously, with some of the bank challenges that started in the first quarter and progressed into the second quarter. That wasn't helpful. But as you start to see, I think, some conviction around the rate environment stabilize and you see banks and leverage markets performing at a more normal level. We'll start to see activity pick back up. I think demand remains strong. I guess the last thing I would say is, certainly, we saw some challenges as it relates to institutional allocations. When you saw equity markets and fixed income markets declined pretty significantly over the past year that cause a lot of institutions to be overexposed in real estate as equity markets and fixed income markets improve, the denominator effect is less of a concern, and some of the allocations there come back in line with what's expected. And that's going to be \u2013 that portends well for the future pipeline. Andrew Schlossberg : And Glenn, I'd just add that as we look forward to opportunities, recall our portfolio is fairly global. So the dynamics are pretty different outside the U.S. than the U.S., and it's a pretty diverse national footprint as well in the United States. Also I'd say is real estate debt is something we're hearing increased demand for and have capability there, and we're going to continue to focus on opportunities in the debt side of the market. And then the last thing I'd say is, while the institutional market is fairly well penetrated, the wealth management markets in the U.S. and globally we see tremendous opportunity where portfolio allocations are less than 1% to things like real assets at the moment. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate all that. Allison, one other quickie. On the comments on the $20 million in the third quarter and $50 million for \u2013 by the end of 2024 and identified efficiency savings. Should we be thinking that it is all falling to the bottom line like or is there a netting effect in terms of the ongoing investments that you're making? Thank you. Allison Dukes : Sure. Good question. Thank you. And let me clean that up a little bit. $20 million in additional costs that we expect to incur in the third quarter with $50 million of net realized savings that we expect to be realized in the beginning of 2024, not the end. And so yes, to answer your question, that would be net savings that we would expect to fall to bottom line tax affected, of course. Glenn Schorr : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I'd like to touch on sort of at a high level here, Andrew. You referenced changes you wanted to make to simplify the organization. Allison added some additional color in the context of costs. But could you maybe either give us a frame of reference around what you think could help to simplify the organization. And is this \u2013 is this an opening salvo and something you intend to approach over the course of many years. And how should we think about maybe like incremental updates on your approach as you get your hands around and get settled into the seat? Thanks. Andrew Schlossberg : Sure. Thanks, Brennan. Good questions. Maybe just to start at a high level of what we're trying to achieve. So our aim of simplifying and streamlining the organization, obviously, is to generate better profit growth, but it's also to improve quality of investment performance. We want to simplify the organization so we can accelerate more quickly strategic execution, and we want to be able to use our scale and leverage that we have in the business. So what we did was we started this process earlier this year. And to answer your question, it's going to continue through the course of this year and going forward. This is an ongoing effort to continue to reposition our business for where client demand is. A few examples of some things that we've been working on and will continue to work on. One is around investment team simplification and quality improvement. So for instance, we brought together three multi-asset strategy teams into one. We're further bringing together our fixed income platform around the world. We've enhanced leadership, global leadership with our co-CIO structure and fundamental equity. So things like that around investment team simplification, we'll continue to focus on. We're also looking to globalize core elements of our client engagement and client delivery. So we combined leadership in the Americas and EMEA. We established a single marketing organization. We're globalizing digital platforms, and we're taking out complexity in our product platform. We combined our ETF and SMA and custom index leadership and reduced our product line by over 150 products. So lots going on in the client delivery side. And then we're simplifying and reviewing our operating and enterprise models sort of end-to-end looking for ways to take advantage of those front-end changes and move them through the cost base and be more efficient. And then the last thing I'd say, which I think speaks to what we're going to continue to do going forward is evolve the culture. And so we're going to be tightening our execution edge as a team. We're going to be simplifying our operating and organizational models, which we've started, and we're going to enhance the accountability around profit growth. So you should expect to continue to hear updates from me and Allison regularly about these efforts. Brennan Hawken : Thanks for all that color Andrew. Much appreciated. For my follow-up question on real estate, sort of following on to Glenn's question. So you break out traditional office \u2013 traditional U.S. office, which is great. But what \u2013 how would you defined nontraditional office, I guess? And what would that do to those numbers? And then when we look at the difference in the allocation to traditional office from 20% down to 13% in the Americas over that three-year sorry, 1Q 2020 to 2Q 2023. How much of that were disposals versus price declines in the assets? Allison Dukes : Let me take maybe the second one first. That would primarily be dispositions. The vast majority of that would be deliberate choices that were made, not declining asset values there. So it's been a rocky environment but not an entirely terrible one to try to exit and reposition that portfolio. So I think we were I think our timing was good in a lot of ways, we moved quickly, and we've been able to, I think, show the results very quickly. So that \u2013 there's a good news story there, not a bad news story. In terms of what's \u2013 I'm not sure I followed your question on traditional office versus not in traditional office. Brennan Hawken : I guess I was just \u2013 yes, I was just trying to understand office like is the overall office exposure actually larger than what you guys define as traditional? Or did you just use the term traditional just to define the office sector broadly? Allison Dukes : No. It's not larger than what we would define. If you think about what's outside of what we would consider traditional things like medical office buildings and things that we would truly consider to be different than mid-rise, high-rise kind of office exposure. Brennan Hawken : Got it. Okay. Thanks for that. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking my question. Just about staying with the private alternative platform theme. I guess as we sort of look forward, just a couple of some of the potential bigger drivers within this bucket. So maybe if you could just size the redemptions that you're currently running at for the open-end strategies that you talked about in real estate. And then the opportunity going forward, particularly in direct lending, to what extent do you think you can expand these strategies given potential pullback in banks? And is that something that's more of a near-term development or really more to longer term? Allison Dukes : Yes, I'll take the first one. I'd say the redemption rates in the open-end strategies. And again, what we tried to do was narrow down the percentage of our portfolio that is an open-end strategy. And with that, normal redemption rates through the cycle would be kind of 5% to 6%. And as we noted, we'd be on the higher side of that. We would be above that range. And it varies though and it varies quite a bit across the different products. So on average, it's a touch higher than where we are today. Operating though very normally and very consistent with what we've experienced in cycles like this over 40 years in the business. So more than anything, I think what we hope to convey is it's quite normal and quite manageable. And there are no liquidity issues or concerns across any of those individual funds. I'd say maybe, Andrew, you want to take direct lending. Andrew Schlossberg : Yes. In private credit, we've been building out our capabilities over the last few years in distressed and in direct lending. And demand, both from institutions and emerging from high net worth retail or wealth management continues to \u2013 we continue to see it. We continue to have asset raises and focus both in the U.S. and in Europe. We expect to continue to see that demand for the reasons you described. I'd say given that we're relatively new entrant into that space, and we're building our reputation it will be a driver, but it will take some time for it to be, I think, a meaningful part of the private markets, enterprise like our private real estate franchise is. Brian Bedell : Got it. That's great color. And then just on the cost side, Allison, maybe on the AlphaGen program, it sounds like that $7 million run rate is sort of \u2013 it's a cost number, but I guess is that \u2013 should we be considering that to be like a net cost number of savings? And I guess, do we have any idea yet longer term as you get that platform completely on to and integrated with Alpha, any sense of sizing what potential cost savings can come from that initiative longer term? Allison Dukes : Yes. Great. Thanks for the question, Brian. So on A&G, just a reminder of one thing I've said that we've had A&G costs for the last year plus in our transaction integration and restructuring expense. And with that, you discontinued after the first quarter, you do see our cost base now fully loaded through our GAAP financials with the cost that we are incurring for Alpha NexGen and some of these organizational-related changes as well. So it is a difference that does cause changes in our overall operating expense base I noted that it was about $7 million in the second quarter and that we would expect it to be at about that level for the next few quarters. We will be hard at work on Alpha NexGen really through 2024 and into 2025. So we will be providing ongoing updates, but I think that's a reasonable expectation for the cost right now. In terms of savings, savings will come once we are able to go live. And we do not \u2013 we will not be going live until we are in 2024. And then we will be running parallel for some time. And then savings and rationalization really is something that would occur on the other side of that. So as we get closer to 2025. So we're ways off from providing you estimates on how our expense base could improve over time. But we are entirely focused on a successful execution right now, and we do expect the cost that we saw in the second quarter to remain in our cost base for some time as we really focus on the execution here. Brian Bedell : Yes. It's great color. Thank you. Andrew Schlossberg : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Your line is open. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Buyback activity was quite strong in the quarter. You paid out 170% of your earnings power. And I think most of the buybacks just came in the month of June. So how should we expect your share repurchase effort going forward to trend. And will it be more consistent than in the past or more episodic? Allison Dukes : Thanks, Craig. I think, look, as we've noted all along, we've had several priorities that we've been working really hard on making parallel progress on and one of which has been improving the balance sheet overall. And improving the balance sheet is what gave us the capacity and the flexibility to be opportunistic in the second quarter and execute on those buybacks. And we were pleased that we were able to do so and to do so without any additional borrowings on our credit facility and continuing to manage our net debt down. So \u2013 those are the types of things we need to see to put us in a position to be opportunistic going forward. We were not particularly pleased with our price when we were staring at something that started with $14. And so we did have the opportunity in the second quarter to make some progress there. And I think you should expect over time that we're going to be disciplined and diligent and continuing to improve our balance sheet. But where we see opportunities to return capital to shareholders, we're going to do so as well. Craig Siegenthaler : Thank you, Allison. Just as my follow-up, money market flows continue to be strong. You've doubled this business in less than three years. Can you just update us on the drivers? And can this trajectory continue even if overall trends like broker cash sorting slows? Andrew Schlossberg : I'll make a couple of comments, maybe and then Allison can jump in. We're really pleased with the growth and it was deliberate. I mean we focused on quality in the cash management, money market side, client engagement and pricing, and it paid off. We saw $15 billion in inflows this quarter. It's important to remember, 85% of our business is institutional. And we don't expect that to change. We're very strong there. We've moved into the top 10, and we're taking market share I think with high yields continuing for some time, it's going to continue to be a drive on demand, and we expect to continue to take share. Allison, I don't know. Allison Dukes : Got it. Craig Siegenthaler : Thank you, Andrew. Andrew Schlossberg : No problem. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Alexander Blostein : Thanks. Good morning everybody. So maybe we can just kind of wrap up the private markets growth strategy through a couple of questions here. I guess when you look at the real estate business, to your point, there are a number of challenges facing over the next several quarters. and in private credit, some of the growth areas, whether it's direct lending and kind of distressed or opportunistic credit are newer, and you highlighted that it's going to take a little bit of time for them to contribute. So how are you thinking about organically turning this business into a positive net flow mode over the near term? Or do you think it will require some inorganic opportunities to add more product breadth as well? Andrew Schlossberg : Yes. So we're \u2013 I'll start by saying we're very focused organically. We think the spaces we're in, in private real estate and in the private debt side of the markets are the places we want to be. We'll continue to look over time, obviously, to grow that organically. And if things present themselves to extend off of that, we'll pay attention. But our focus right now is growing them organically. In addition to some of the things that Allison already covered on the recovery on the institutional side of things, which will \u2013 we think will happen in time. The real growth driver for our real estate business is going to be through the wealth management channels. We started that effort several years ago. We've seen strong placements for our nontraded REIT strategy, and we're going to be and continue to be in market with strategies like those, including on the debt side of real estate. And as I mentioned, the penetration in wealth management for the industry is less than 1% with most expectations getting it to 10% to 15%. That will take some time. So we think with an offering like we have in a pedigree, combined with our wealth management distribution strength in the U.S. and in Europe, that that's going to be an amazing opportunity. We've invested in those areas already. So the growth is going to come to us in the next couple of years, and we think it could be meaningful. So those are the areas that we're going to be focused on in addition to the institutional space. Alexander Blostein : Got it. Thanks. And for my follow-up, Allison, just around Alpha NextGen, obviously, it's been taking longer. It's a complicated transaction, so that's all fair. But what has gone right, what has gone wrong? Why do you think it's taking longer than sort of original expectations? And on the other end of that, do you think there's going to be room for you guys to negotiate fees down at the ultimate kind of end game of this transaction given the fact that it's taken longer than expected? Thanks. Allison Dukes : Well, so I would say, look, it's been a strong partnership with State Street. We've worked closely on the execution of this for the last couple of years, and we have been negotiating around the ultimate cost of this, and it is an important partnership on both sides. And I would say both parties have been responsive and thoughtful as to both the cost and the time that's involved here. So you should expect that's ongoing, not something that happens on the back end. What's gone right or wrong? I think that's harder to answer. And I guess I would say, in many respects, it is large and it is a bit unturned for both parties. And so we've been working together to try to do this in a way that's very thoughtful and provides the benefits we're looking for, for our business. So I think if I could say anything, I would say probably everything going harder and longer than you expect in large-scale technology implementations. And I don't think that's unusual, but one that we are certainly making our way through. We feel good about where we are right now. We feel good about the attention of all teams from both parties and the work that's underway. The fact that it's taking a little longer than we expected. I don't see it as a huge negative, but one that is just something that we're figuring about as we go along on both sides. Andrew Schlossberg : Yes. The commitment is high from \u2013 obviously, from both parties and other related parties that are working on it, we're really heads down trying to get the execution and implementation done, and we feel good about that. Alexander Blostein : Got it. All right. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Mike Brown with KBW. Your line is open. Michael Brown : Great. Thank you very much. In China, it looks like there's been a regulatory mandate to limit the fee rates for products there to 1.2%. Has that already begun to impact China, Great Wall? Or is that something that will kind of come through later this year? And then as you look to next quarter, can you just expand on maybe some of the puts and takes we should consider here for the fee rate when we think about next quarter, maybe that exit fee rate, if you will? Allison Dukes : Sure. Let me start with China. That was just announced in early July, so just a couple of weeks ago. So we are evaluating what that means for our portfolio right now. Our estimates right now is that those fee cuts will impact about $24 billion of AUM, so about 28% of our portfolio there. It's early, and we are still working through a lot of this in terms of both timing and overall impact. The timing is perhaps here in the third quarter, but certainly into the fourth quarter as we anticipate revenue being on a net basis lower, somewhere between $5 million and $10 million per quarter. Now that's for all of the JV. And of course, we own a 49% share of that. But with that lower revenue, there's also lower compensation changes that come with it. So the ultimate impact to net income will be much lower than that. And I think we'll be able to provide clear guidance around all of that at the end of the third quarter. Overall, I'd say we actually are really well positioned with that change just given our more mature market positioning in China overall. As a reminder, we're the 12th largest asset manager there, the largest foreign \u2013 and we have a very mature business, having just celebrated our 20th anniversary there. And we actually think this reform is really going to facilitate high-quality development of the overall mutual fund industry in China, and that's going to just serve to accelerate growth and really better serve investor needs. So while there is a near-term impact, we actually think this portends well for the overall growth of the industry in China and that we are well positioned to capture some of that growth. To your question around fee rate and what that means, what we expect from an exit perspective going into the third quarter. We've definitely seen continued declines in our overall net revenue yield, and that's really a function of mix shift dynamics. We gave a lot of color on that in the prepared remarks around just the uneven recovery across asset classes and the particular impact of the risk off sentiment in our overall net revenue yield. I'll say we are not seeing fee pressure, but we are seeing high demand for some of our lower fee assets even within our passive assets. We see high demand for some of our lower fee capabilities there. As an example, our two largest selling ETFs in the second quarter were the QQQM and the S&P Equal Weight 500. And those would both be on the lower end of kind of our fee range for our passive capabilities. So on the one hand, we're incredibly pleased that we continue to capture flows and we're well positioned in areas of client demand. On the other hand, that does continue to put some pressure on our fee rates. What does it mean going forward? I think we expect the mix shift dynamics to continue. That said, we're pleased with some of the recovery we're seeing in some of our active equity strategies, both in terms of market recovery and diminished headwinds as it relates to redemptions and improving sales particularly as we see performance recover in areas like our developing market strategy. So net-net, I think you should expect continued modest pressure, certainly dependent on market recovery dynamics from here. Andrew Schlossberg : Yes. If I can just go back to China and just for \u2013 just to add a couple of comments, a couple of additional comments. I mean, certainly, market sentiment post-COVID has been a little more negative, and it's been slow. But I think the Chinese government's pro-growth reforms and the things that policies and actions underway. We're starting to see some of that demand come back. And I'll just reemphasize something Allison said, which is our strong position there and our conviction about the Chinese asset management markets growth. It is very early days in terms of investors' sophistication and asset classes. It's very early days in retirement markets and our position being there for 20 years with close to $100 billion in assets under management, good performance, a good reputation and a bit of a moat around competition coming in, really bodes well for long-term success in China, and we're looking forward to seeing that for the years to come. Michael Brown : Great. Appreciate all the color there. And then just as a follow-up on the other revenue line that was down again sequentially. I know last quarter was impacted by lower real estate transaction activity. Was that kind of a similar story here this quarter? And any view on the near term there as well. I appreciate all the comments in your prepared remarks on the real estate side, but just kind of interested in that line near term. Allison Dukes : Sure. Well, some puts and takes in that line item. Real estate transaction fees were actually a little bit higher in that line item in the second quarter as compared to first quarter. But the negative, what was offsetting that was a lower front-end fees. You really just saw a decrease in some of the transaction fees that were driven by a decrease in equity sales. So puts and takes always a little bit of a lot of discrete items in that line item. Michael Brown : Okay. Is it fair to assume that next quarter or maybe next couple of quarters would be semi similar to that level? Allison Dukes : I think that's a reasonable expectation. I mean it moves so modestly up and down. It's hard to predict that as that's kind of discrete level. But you can probably look at the average over the last couple of quarters, and that would be reasonable. Michael Brown : Okay. That's fair. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Daniel Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open. Daniel Fannon : Thanks for squeezing me in. So I wanted to take a little bit longer view on the fee rate. Obviously, the mix shift trend has been happening for some time. Allison, you mentioned the current dynamics. But as you look out over the multiple year period, how do you see that trend stabilizing, accelerating or kind of continuing? And then as you announced on the cost side, are you adjusting the expense base fast enough to deal with that trend? Because clearly, there's been some lag effect of expenses in terms of this mix shift. So excluding beta kind of as you think about that fee rate and then ultimately, the expense base, how we should think about the appropriate use of scale and margin in that context. Allison Dukes : Thanks, Dan. I do think over time, you start to see the decline in the fee rates start to abate. I don't know where that is exactly, but you can look at where the demand is for some of our higher growth capabilities. And those fee rates, if you look at \u2013 let's take the ETF portfolio and our passive fee rate, that has declined, and that is all available in our disclosures. And that declined to just under 16 basis points in the second quarter, which was down about a basis point. But again, that's because of what I just pointed to in the growth in some of our capabilities that are in high demand that are around a 15 basis point fee rate. If you look at some of the areas of our ETF capabilities that we're trending off in the last couple of quarters, that would be around commodity and currency ETFs that are going to be on the higher side. And once we see in more of a return to a risk on mentality, we would expect that to come back. So I think, look, our passive fee rate, I think it probably is in that 16-ish basis points over a long-term horizon. China has obviously had some pressure given the fee cuts we just talked about, but that is on the much higher side, much higher than the firm average, and we expect to see continued strong growth in China as the economy recovers there. Our private market capabilities would be on the higher side, too. You kind of take all of that, you think about the barbelling and one would think that, yes, the fee rate starts to even out roughly, maybe diminishes a bit more as we continue to see some of this mix shift, and we continue to see the growth of our passive capabilities. But over time, over a longer-term time horizon, it should start to abate and even out a bit. Scale, getting to scale and our passive capabilities has been something we've talked about a lot, something we continue to be very focused on and getting to the second part of your question, aligning our expenses around that. It takes some time to reposition an expense base that was built to support who the company was seven, eight, 10 years ago to where we think it will be seven, eight, 10 years from now. And it's really part of the methodical work we are undertaking now as we continue to simplify the organization and continue to look at how we can reposition our overall organizational structure as well as our technology and operational structure to support where the business is going and continue to really scale there and focus on the marginal profitability improvements, we think we can garner as we get to scale in some of those asset classes. Andrew Schlossberg : And I think as Allison was alluding to on the revenue yield, client demands and broadening of markets, which we talked about in our comments are two of the things that have a major impact on the revenue yield, and Allison pointed some of those. In terms of the scale and the expense space, the scale of the company, we're certainly going to benefit from our side. I think as Allison was alluding to, we're going to continue to look at the different component parts of our business and what's required from an expense-base standpoint, in an ETF franchise versus a private markets franchise are going to be \u2013 are obviously different. So we're going to continue to look business by business, not just our global scale. Allison Dukes : And in that, I think the concluding comments as I would say, we feel very confident we can improve operating margin from here. And that remains our area of focus. The challenge and the really fast remixing of our asset base over the last 12 to 18 months, has been a pretty tough challenge to contend with. At the same time, we've been making deliberate changes along the way, and we think we're really well positioned to capture really start to improve operating leverage over time, and make sure that the expense structure of the business is repositioned to really support what we think the revenue environment will be for the next few years. Daniel Fannon : Thank you. Operator : I'll turn it back over to you. Andrew Schlossberg : All right. Well, we'll just wrap it up by saying thank you, and we look forward to speaking with everybody next quarter. Have a great rest of the day. Allison Dukes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference. You may all disconnect at this time.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is also being recorded. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Greg Ketron, Invesco's Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Greg Ketron : Okay. Thanks operator and to all of you joining us today. In addition to today's press release, we've provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address. The press release and presentation are available on our website, invesco.com. This information can be found by going to the Investor Relations section of the website. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slide 2 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix or the appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. Finally, Invesco is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third-parties. The only authorized webcast are located on our website. Andrew Schlossberg, President and CEO; and Allison Dukes, Chief Financial Officer will present our results this morning and then we will open the call up for questions. I'll now turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Schlossberg : Thanks Greg and good morning to everyone. I'm pleased to be speaking with you today. But before I begin my commentary on the quarter, I did want to take a moment to acknowledge the humanitarian crisis in the Middle East. We are deeply saddened by the loss of life and devastation and the impact it's had on civilians across the region. We're focused on the safety and the well-being of our colleagues and their families and our thoughts are with everyone who has been impacted by the heartbreaking recent events. But now turning to the topic of the third quarter earnings, I'll start today's presentation on Slide 3. Volatility and uncertainty continue to define global financial markets with interest rates rising and investors awaiting more clarity from central bankers, there's an extraordinary amount of cash that's been moved to the sidelines where investors can earn acceptable returns, while they await more certainty. The slowing and narrowing investor activity has been a near-term challenge for our industry, but it also sets the course for an eventual reallocation and money moving back into higher risk-based assets. Our results, which are highlighted on Slide 3, in many ways, reflect these dynamics. However, our unique positioning with deep client relationships, a strong geographic mix and a broad suite of investment solutions helped us deliver positive net long-term inflows in the third quarter. One of the primary contributors to our relative net flow strength is our robust ETF and SMA platforms. Our ETF business delivered record flows in the third quarter, which were concentrated in our leading factor-based capabilities. It was one of the strongest ETF quarters we have experienced as we continue to gain market share. We captured nearly three times our industry share of net asset lows to our market share of AUM, and importantly, over three times of our industry share on a revenue flow basis as well. Additionally, we continue to enhance the commercialization of our SMA platform and are seeing strong momentum in flows, particularly within fixed income, where we have posted 12 consecutive quarters of positive net flows despite the challenging market environment. Within these vehicles, we are well-positioned to meet the increasing interest around personalization and tax optimization that we're seeing by wealth management clients in both the US and around the world. While areas of growth like ETFs, SMAs, and fixed income have been strong for us this year, we continue to see flow pressure in active equities. While headwinds have persisted in this asset class industry-wide, we are beginning to see marked improvement in Invesco, in particular in the global, international, and emerging market equity segments. In aggregate, our net outflows in these strategies are significantly lower than what we experienced in 2022 and have stabilized at around $1 billion in outflows each of the last two quarters. We continue to put considerable effort into further improving investment quality, product differentiation, and client engagement in these capabilities to ensure we are well-situated ahead of the eventual renewed demand in these important and higher fee-yielding asset classes. We're going to spend some time on the call today highlighting how we're positioning the firm against shifting investor demand, its impact on our asset mix, net revenue and our net revenue yield, and how we're organizing to meet the evolving client demand in both the near and the longer term. As we've outlined previously, we are undertaking a multi-quarter plan to simplify and streamline the organization to position the firm around rapidly evolving client demands. Our aim is to operate with more agility, improve our consistency of investment quality, create a more seamless client experience, and more efficiently leverage our size and our global scale to enable better outcomes for our clients and drive even greater profitability. We have already made meaningful progress in these areas and we will continue to execute pace in the coming quarters. Some of the key highlights on the evolved investment platform that we have achieved to-date include the following; we've established a unified globally integrated fixed income platform, we're creating a single, highly focused multi-asset group from three distinct teams. We're bringing together leadership across our fundamental active equity teams and we're further strengthening our private market platform that spans both real estate and private credit capabilities. Notably, all of these simplification efforts will enable us to more fully take advantage of the benefits of our State Street Alpha platform, as a single global investment operation engine across asset classes. On the product and distribution side of our business, we've also made considerable progress in repositioning growth and efficiency. We've combined our ETF, SMA, and model portfolios efforts into a single strategy and group. Going forward, we believe that these capabilities will be the leading vehicles of choice for our clients. Our established infrastructure, brand, and innovation will enable us to continue to lead and bring both active and passive capabilities to investors in an even more personalized and efficient way. We're also continuing to prune our product line and we've reduced it by over 150 products in the past year. Further, by globalizing many aspects of our marketing and digital delivery, we're finding opportunities to leverage our scale, simplify our applications, unify our data, and use technology to strengthen these capabilities while lowering costs. There are efficiencies to be gained from all of these simplification efforts, which we are beginning to realize and we will continue to do so over time. However, these efforts are much more or more about -- much more than just expense savings. We view these as drivers of revenue acceleration, which will allow us to improve our investment quality, reallocate our expenses and capital base much more effectively, and deliver sustainable profit growth and margin expansion and time. Moving ahead to Slide 4. As investors gain greater clarity on inflation and Central Bank interest rate policy, we expect clients to move out of cash and extend their duration profiles of their fixed income allocations into a wider range of strategies. Fixed income is a clear area of strength for Invesco and we're focused on ensuring we are well positioned to capture what we believe will be an outsized share of this reallocation. As you can see on this slide, our $500 billion plus fixed income platform has strong investment performance, requisite scale, diversity across asset classes and client geography, it spans public and private investments, and it has a robust offering of both active and passive products. The globally integrated institutional quality platform has been a consistently strong grower for Invesco, having posted long-term net flows over the previous 18 quarters and it's very strong top-tier investment returns across a wide range of fixed income capabilities. A few highlights to note on our favorable position that are on the page include our global liquidity capabilities, which have grown AUM by over 150% over the past five years, and we're now squarely in the top 10 of institutional money fund managers in the top five amongst nonbank-owned providers. Our stable value capability is well-placed in DC platforms and ranks as a top manager in the US institutional marketplace. Our municipal capabilities rank in the top five largest among mutual fund managers in the US and number two amongst high-yield muni fund managers. Within our investment-grade capabilities, our relative performance has been improving since the recent mini banking crisis and our long-term performance strength has helped us nearly double our AUM in the past five years. Furthermore, our global and emerging markets fixed income capabilities of stellar performance and are very well placed for growth in the UK, European, and Asian institutional and retail markets. And finally, we believe that significant opportunity exists for even greater expansion of our fixed income ETFs and bank loan capabilities which are two notable strengths of Invesco. So, against the backdrop where clients are seeking to work with fewer asset managers to meet the breadth of investment requirements, fixed income is clearly an area of our business that is poised to continue to gain market share and drive even greater profitability as the eventual rotation beyond cash unfolds. Finally, and before I turn the call over to Allison, I want to take a moment to highlight on Slide 5, another important piece of the Invesco investment thesis, our strategic relationship with MassMutual. Our engagement with MassMutual has many facets that create a meaningful, mutually beneficial strategic relationship. First, MassMutual is one of our largest investors as both a common equity and preferred shareholder. So, we're mutually aligned to delivering profitable growth and long-term success against the backdrop of an evolving industry. MassMutual is also a significant investor over the past years and supporting many of our newly launched private market and other key strategies with a total of $3.5 billion of commitments. Notably, this is three to four times the multiple of seating of our own products on our own balance sheet. MassMutual has significantly increased their commitments since the inception of our relationship, and this is meaningfully bolstering our growth trajectory in our private markets business, both institutionally and in our wealth management channels where early access to capital is paramount to setting the course for growth. Finally, we work closely with MassMutual on behalf of their clients and we are pleased to be a third-party manager of $9 billion of assets through their insurance and broker-dealer channels, where we ranked the largest sub-advised and defined contribution investment-only manager on the MassMutual platform. To summarize, this is a powerful and important relationship for Invesco with significant potential ahead. We continue to explore avenues with MassMutual to make this relationship even more meaningful in the future. With that, let me turn the call over to Allison for a closer look at our results, and I look forward to your questions. Allison Dukes : Thank you, Andrew and good morning everyone. I'll begin on Slide 6 with investment performance. Overall, our investment performance was solid in the third quarter with 67% and 65% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers are beating benchmark on both a three-year and a five-year basis, respectively. This is in line with those time frames in the second quarter. We did see investment permits improved considerably on a one-year basis, going from 67% in the second quarter to 70% in the third quarter, reflective of the improved investment performance we are seeing across several categories, including global and international equities and alternatives. As Andrew noted, we have excellent performance in fixed income across nearly all capabilities and time horizons, an important fact given our strong conviction and our ability to attract flows as investors deploy money into these strategies. Turning to Slide 7, AUM was $1.49 trillion at the end of the third quarter, $51 billion lower than last quarter. The quarter began with what appeared to be a continuation of a recovery in markets, albeit uneven that we saw in the second quarter. However, that quickly shifted to a risk of posture again as the quarter progressed and uncertainty grew, marking another volatile quarter for markets worldwide. Market declines, coupled with foreign exchange movements, drove the decline in AUM. Despite the market volatility, we did generate $2.6 billion in net long-term flows, and we expect we will outperform peers in what has been a very difficult environment for organic asset growth. Client demand for passive capabilities remain strong as we garnered $13.5 billion of net long-term inflows during the quarter. ETF inflows were $11.8 billion, marking one of our best quarters for ETFs. Our SMB 500 Equal Weight Index funds led the quarter with $3.6 billion of net long-term input. This ETF is also our leading flow driver year-to-date, with our newer QQQM, drawing the second highest flows in our ETF suite year-to-date. The QQQM was launched three years ago and has attracted $14 billion of AUM since inception, now making it our fourth largest ETF. We've demonstrated the ability to sustain growth in ETFs throughout the full market cycle with organic growth in 12 of the past 13 quarters. We also saw solid growth in our index strategies with $2.3 billion in net long-term flows for the quarter. Offsetting some of the growth in passive was $10.9 billion of net outflows in active strategies. Contributing to the outflows was a single sizable redemption in our global targeted return strategy. This strategy has been in significant outflows for several years and now has less than $1 billion remaining in the fund. In September, we announced plans to close the fund and focus on other capabilities within our multi-asset franchise where we are seeing stronger client demand. Our global active equities, which includes the developing market funds were also drivers of net outflows in this quarter. The level of outflows from this investment class has moderated after significantly elevated redemptions in the second half of 2022. Looking at flows by channel, the retail channel generated $4.3 billion of net long-term inflows, while the institutional channel had $1.7 billion of net long-term outflows. This was driven by the global target of returns redemption. Outside of this redemption, we would have had $800 million in institutional inflows for the quarter. Moving to Slide 8 and closed by geography. Asia-Pacific delivered net long-term inflows of $2.8 billion due to growth in Japan, which offset outflows in Greater China during the quarter. In Japan, we experienced another quarter of strong growth with our Henley Global Equity and income funds, guarding $1.8 billion of net inflows from Japanese clients making it a top-selling retail fund for the industry in Japan on both a quarterly and a year-to-date basis. We are well-positioned in Japanese -- as Japanese markets are experiencing some of the most constructive conditions for risk on assets in many years, including favorable new regulations. After resuming organic growth in the second quarter, our business in Greater China experienced net long-term outflows of $1.9 billion for the quarter. The outflows in our China JV were $1.7 billion. Outflows were concentrated in fixed income, where continued weak market sentiment and interest rate tightening has led to diminished growth across the industry this year. However, as China's economy recovers, Invesco is extremely well-positioned to capture additional share in the world's fastest-growing market. Turning to flows by asset class. Equities generated $7.4 billion in net long-term inflows, mainly driven by the strong growth in EPS. The $2.4 billion in outflows in alternatives was largely driven by the previously mentioned single client global targeted returns redemption. Excluding this redemption, alternatives were in flight inflows of $100 million. We have a good track record in our private markets platform within alternatives and are well-positioned to capture long-term flows in this asset class as client demand shifts to these strategies. We have over $6 billion of dry powder to capitalize on opportunities emerging from the market dislocation of the last several quarters, but greater market clarity will be required for this opportunity to meaningfully materialize. Fixed income net long-term flows turned modestly negative with $1.3 billion of net outflows with growth in investment grade, SMAs and global debt, offset by the outflows experienced in China. As Andrew outlined, we like our position in this space and believe we are well-positioned to capture flows as investors put more money to work in fixed income products. We have the track record to support our conviction with 18 straight quarters of net inflows prior to this quarter. Moving to Slide 9. We've provided additional insight into our portfolio and the trends driving our revenue profile. Secular shifts in client demand across the asset management industry, coupled with more recent market dynamics, have significantly altered our asset mix since the acquisition of Oppenheimer Funds. As you'll note, ETF and index AUM, and this excludes the QQQ, have grown from $171 million or 14% of our overall $1.2 trillion in AUM in 2019 to $318 million or 21% of our nearly $1.5 trillion of AUM in the third quarter. We've also seen very strong growth in Asia-Pacific, driven primarily by our success in China. During the same timeframe, we've seen weaker demand for fundamental equities, driven in part by the risk off sentiment that was sparked in early 2022, coupled with the pressure we experienced in developing markets and global equity as well as the closure of our GTR capabilities. Our fundamental equity portfolio in 2019 was $348 billion or 29% of our AUM. At the end of the third quarter, that portfolio was $242 million or $0.16 of our AUM. The result of revenue headwinds created by these dynamics has weighed on our results over the last two years. While we have experienced excellent organic growth and lower fee capabilities like ETFs and liquidity, it was not enough to offset the revenue loss from higher fee, fundamental equity outflows, and market depreciation. Our overall net revenue yield has declined significantly during this timeframe, but that decrease has been driven by the shift in our asset mix, not degradation in the yields of our investment strategies. Net revenue yields by investment strategy have been relatively stable within the ranges provided on the slides. The other point I want to emphasize is that this multiyear secular shift in client preferences have been increasingly captured in our results. Our portfolio is better diversified today than four years ago, and our concentration risk and higher fee fundamental equity has been reduced. These dynamics though challenging to manage through as they occur, should portend well for future revenue trends and marginal profitability improvement, independent of market improvement. Further, we now have a more diversified business mix, which better positions the firm to navigate various market cycles events and shifting client demand. Turning to Slide 10, net revenues of $1.1 billion in the third quarter was $12 million lower than the third quarter of 2022 and $7 million or 1% higher than the second quarter. The decline from the third quarter of last year was due largely shift in our asset mix that was just discussed. Total adjusted operating expenses in the third quarter were $789 million, $48 million higher than the third quarter of 2022 and unchanged from the prior quarter. Included in our third quarter operating expenses were $39 million of compensation expenses related to the organizational changes we are making to position the firm for greater scale and profitability as we grow our revenue base. In the second quarter, we had $27 million of compensation expenses related mainly to executive retirements. The full benefits from our simplification efforts will be seen over time as we generate revenue growth and margin recovery. To this point, we have identified $50 million of annual run rate expense savings that will be realized by the beginning of 2024. The restructuring costs associated with these efforts were $39 million in the third quarter as we accelerated several of the reorganization activities that we were undertaking into the quarter. Next quarter, fourth quarter, we expect an incremental $15 million to $20 million of expense associated with these efforts, bringing the total expense associated with the efforts to $55 million to $60 million. As we've discussed, we managed variable compensation to a full year outcome in line with company performance and competitive industry practices. Historically, our compensation to net revenue ratio has been in the 38% to 42% range, trending towards the upper end of that range and periods of revenue decline. At current AUM levels, we would expect the ratio to be slightly above the high end of the range for 2023 when excluding the cost pertaining to executive retirements and other organizational changes. Marketing expenses of $27 million were $6 million lower than the prior quarter and $3 million lower than the third quarter of last year as we continue to tightly manage discretionary spend given the ongoing challenging revenue environment. Property, office, and technology expenses were relatively unchanged as compared to last quarter and the third quarter of last year. Another area in which we are diligently managing expenses as G&A. G&A expenses of $108 million in the quarter were down $6 million from the prior quarter. Compared to the third quarter last year, G&A expenses increased $2 million. However, the third quarter of this year includes $8 million in spending on our Alpha platform, which prior to the second quarter of this year was included in transaction integration and restructuring expenses. We expect quarterly average spending on our Alpha platform to remain near this level for the next few quarters. Moving to Slide 11, adjusted operating income was $309 million in the third quarter which included the costs related to organizational changes. Adjusted operating margin was 28.2% for the third quarter. But excluding the costs related to the organizational changes, third quarter operating margin would have been 350 basis points higher. Earnings per share was $0.35 in the third quarter. Excluding the expenses related to the org changes, third quarter earnings per share would have been $0.07 higher. The effective tax rate was 23.6% in the third quarter. We estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 25% for the fourth quarter of 2023. The actual effective rate can vary due to the impact of nonrecurring items on pre-tax income and discrete tax items. I'll finish up on Slide 12. Stated priority, where I'm pleased to say that we've made significant progress in building balance sheet strength. This quarter, our cash balance exceeded $1.2 billion. We've lowered our net debt significantly, and it now stands at less than $250 million. I'm pleased with the improvement we've made on the balance sheet as we continue to work to bring net debt excluding the preferred shares down to zero by the second half of next year. Our leverage ratio, as defined under our credit facility agreement was 0.7 times at the end of the third quarter. We have an opportunity to further address outstanding debt with the maturity of the $600 million in senior notes at the end of this January. We ended the third quarter with zero drawn on the credit facility. To conclude, the resiliency of our firm's net flow performance in a difficult environment for organic growth is evident again this quarter, and I'm pleased with the progress we're making to simplify the organization and build a stronger balance sheet while continuing to invest in key capability areas. We're committed to driving profitable growth and a high level of financial performance. We have the right strategic positioning to do so. And with that, I'll ask the operator to go ahead and open it up to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. So, I appreciate all the commentary you made around fixed income. I'm still, I guess, a little surprised for everybody that flows haven't been stronger. Can you talk about what signed post you think clients are looking for? Is it literally just the end of rate hikes and economic outlook? And are you seeing that in dialogue with in solutions, through RFPs, things like that? And then maybe just the same comment on with -- in your words, an extraordinary amount of casing on the sideline money market or money markets were in outflow? Thanks a lot. Andrew Schlossberg : Hey Glenn, thanks, it's Andrew. I'll start and Allison will chip in as well. The cash on the sidelines a bit, but whether it's from wealth managers or from institutions, it's something like 25% to 35% portfolios are allocated to that from best we can tell from lots of conversations with clients. And I think it's exactly what you described, waiting for clarity from central banks, waiting for a reason to move off the sidelines and get paid to do so. Conversations have been very active whether it's through our solutions efforts or just through direct conversations. And it's -- I think it's really those things and that's straightforward and simple. On the money market side, Allison, why don't you pick up? Allison Dukes : Good morning Glenn. What I would say about our money market portfolio is about 85% of our portfolio is positioned with an institutional client base. So, think about that is being managed by corporate treasurers and those funds are going to stay and save for assets. So, I think what we saw in this quarter was a repositioning in the treasuries just given the opportunity that those presented and just the yield that the treasurers are seeking. That will also, in many respects, prevent those funds from being deployed into more risk on strategies like equity. So, the composition of our money market client base, I think, is important as you think about it being 85% institutionally owned. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate. One just quick follow-up is as you noted, the fee rate on fixed income is obviously lower than overall. But I would imagine there's some pretty high incremental margins. If flows do happen in the way you think into fixed income as people start extending duration, how should we think about that interplay between fee rate and margins kind of like the same conversation we've had for years? Thanks. Allison Dukes : No, your assumption is correct and that you've got a relatively fixed cost base underpinning that fixed income portfolio. So, you should think about flows into fixed income as being accretive to the overall firm operating margin. So -- and I think that's look, that's a lot of what we want to draw out in providing some of this additional color is where we are seeking to grow through scale and where that will be accretive to margins, overall fixed income is certainly an area where that is true. Andrew Schlossberg : And Glenn, we -- some of the things we talked about last quarter and this quarter, we further brought together elements -- disparate elements of our fixed income platform, and we wanted to call up a scale in that platform for just the reasons Allison described. Glenn Schorr : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Your line is open. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks. Good morning everyone. So, maybe just starting where you left off, with 25% of portfolios sitting in cash and waiting for rates to stop going higher, which bond verticals are you the most positive on in 2024? And also, do you think active fixed income can garner significant share? Or do you expect most of the flows to come from passive, which you'd also benefit through the ETF platform? Andrew Schlossberg : Yes, hi, it's Andrew. Just maybe I'll pick up on the second part first. We think it will come in both active and passive. And as you said, the diverse range that we have in both, in some ways, we're a bit indifferent, but the conversations are happening on both sides of the equation. In terms of areas that are particularly of focus and things that we're having conversations about it, we're well positioned, the municipal portfolio, whether that's investment grade or high yield, the performance is stellar. The funds are highly rated, they're well known, and that's probably the first protocol we would point to. On the investment-grade side, European corporate bonds had been of interest and have been an area where we're positioned well. And then really just anything across as people move a little further on the curve, even elements of our short-term fixed income portfolio. So, it's pretty wide ranging, but I'd sort of point out those areas, in particular, especially because we're just well -- we're well placed there to take share. Craig Siegenthaler : Thank you. And just for my follow-up on Investor of Great Wall in China. Flows are negative in 3Q. I just wanted your perspective on if you thought they would snap back on a near-term basis. Or if you think we'd go through a longer term time period here where you'd see net outflows from China? Allison Dukes : Good morning Craig, I'll start. I think the most important component of the flows in IGW was really that it was driven by fixed income. And I think we're just seeing with the interest rate tightening that's happening inside of China, a diminished appetite for fixed income overall. We actually saw inflows in equities over the quarter. So, we do think it's hard to gauge exactly the timing as to when economic sentiment will recover there. I think we're confident the government is doing quite a bit to try to stimulate some stabilization there and improvement in the sentiment overall. Hard to say exactly which quarter that will be and when things will snap back, we do -- we are very confident -- very well-positioned when that does occur. Craig Siegenthaler : Thank you, Allison. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Daniel Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open. Daniel Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. A question on expenses. First, a clarification. I believe Allison, you mentioned that the savings from some of the charges won't be in until next year. So, curious as to why you're not seeing some of the savings here in 4Q? And then there's a lot of changes or kind of streamlining, I think, that was talked about. Could you maybe summarize like what you see is the most impactful in some of these changes that you raised? Allison Dukes : Sure, good morning Dan. So, on the expenses, let me clarify that, we expect that, that $50 million will be fully realized by the first half of 2024. And so that -- I expect we will actually start to see some of those savings materialize here in the fourth quarter. I'm expecting somewhere around like $10 million improvement in compensation expense in the fourth quarter. So, that run rate is out to almost probably $40 million. So, I actually think we'll start to see the majority of those savings materialize in the fourth quarter and then continue into next year. That, of course, is all things being equal and dependent of AUM and where markets go in variable compensation. A part of the increase in the severance and reorganizational expenses in the third quarter is because we did pull forward some of those savings, so we would start to realize the benefits of them in the fourth quarter. And so again, I know there were some expectations because we provided an expectation that severance is expended to be closer to $20 million in the third quarter. It was $39 million as we seek to pull forward some of those savings. Where do we expect to see them? Honestly, it's quite broad-based as we are looking at just making thoughtful streamlining decisions across our entire organization. It's everywhere from areas of operations to streamlining some of our investment teams. As Andrew noted in his remarks, to just pocket the simplification where we can globalize some of our teams and seek to do things one way across the globe instead of multiple ways. I couldn't point to any one particular area. I will tell you the majority of the savings you will see are in compensation expense, and that is, of course, excluding any first quarter seasonality that you see in payroll and taxes and the like. Daniel Fannon : Thank you. That's helpful. And then just on the institutional outlook, the overall pipeline, I think the numbers you didn't disclose. You talked about the slide is 35% still solutions, which has been in the range it's been. So, maybe just some context around the institutional activities you see it in building into fourth quarter and obviously into next year. Allison Dukes : Sure. The institutional pipeline, the one not funded pipeline, so the same as we typically provide some color to, it was about $20 billion in the third quarter so a little bit lower than the prior quarter, although the fee rate was a little bit better, the composition pretty consistent. So, it still looks pretty good. I would say, if I look at our inflows, excluding the GTR, very sizable redemption that we pointed to. If I look at our gross inflows in the quarter, it was about $17.5 billion in gross inflows from the institutional channel and that was about 43% of that was from our pipeline. So, our pipeline continues to be healthy, strong. It does not really reflect the full breadth of the activity in the institutional channel. But it's certainly a good health measure and it's kind of consistent in that $20 billion to $30 billion range. Daniel Fannon : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ken Worthington : Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the question. To follow-up on the pipeline question, what was the backlog for alternatives? If solutions increased to 35%, I guess, what sort of shrunk relative to -- in the pipeline? And where does alternative stand? And -- well, to start there. Thank you. Allison Dukes : Sure. Good morning. What shrunk would have been equity. Alternatives actually held pretty consistent to the prior quarter. And I think we mentioned we've got about $6 billion in dry powder and that's been pretty consistent. So, it's actually been one of the challenges is it's been difficult to deploy just because the transaction activity, particularly in private real estate is relatively low, just given some of the financing dynamics that are going on. But what we saw was a little bit of diminishment in the pipeline for equities overall. Ken Worthington : Okay, great. And then in private markets, so on the $6 billion of dry powder, where -- what represents the bulk of that dry powder? Is it real estate? Is it credit? Is it sort of split between the two? And are there any big funds in private markets that you expect to come to market in the next 12 months or so? Allison Dukes : The bulk of the $6 billion would be more real estate-oriented than it would be private credit. We've got several things that are -- we are working on, I would say, in terms of what we're trying to bring to market in both the real estate space and the private credit space as we look to capture some of the opportunities there out there right now, particularly from an opportunistic standpoint and a stress standpoint. Andrew Schlossberg : Yes. And Ken, in particular, real estate debt for both institutions, but mostly in the wealth management channels is probably the area where we're seeing the greatest amount of demand and we're in market with strategies there. And then as Allison said, on the private credit side, just traditional direct lending, both in Europe and the US. Ken Worthington : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start on fee rate. So, the actual investment advisory fee was a lot of pressure, but distribution offset kind of allowed the net revenue yield to be only down modestly. So, was there any noise in that net distribution line? Or is that the right way to think about that going forward? Allison Dukes : I'll take that. Good morning Brennan. The net distribution line, it tends to -- in that third-party line, it runs about 41% to 42% of management fees on an annual basis. I think last year it was about 41.5%. Year-to-date, it's about 42%. Third quarter was a touch lower, though. So, I mean, there's just some noise and it fluctuates quarter-to-quarter. But I would say in line, it's pretty in line with history right now. Brennan Hawken : So, are you saying that we should look at it more on a year-to-date basis than this quarter specific? Allison Dukes : I would. Absolutely. I would think about it in that 41% to 42% range and this quarter kind of brings up 42%, starts to bring it down a bit. I would look at it in the range. That's how we think about it. It's hard to manage to it quarter-to-quarter. Brennan Hawken : Excellent. That's great. And not that I want to give Greg more work, but it definitely would be great to see like fee rate or like revenue by asset class along with the flow disclosure that might help to given -- particularly given the dynamics at play for your business, just a recommendation. On -- for my follow-up, you said that there was a big loss of a single account with GTR. Was the fee rate given that, that was a single large investor, was that fee rate sort of below the average for your alts business for the firm broadly just given the size? Allison Dukes : Yes. Thanks Brennan. Okay. First, I'm going to point you to Page 9 because Greg did do the extra work, and we've got some of the fee rates disclosed from an AUM standpoint there to try to provide exactly that and give a little bit more color. And then on GTR, no, that fee rate, that capability was priced significantly above the firm average. And so that has been, as you think about some of the challenges and the remixing and some of what we are trying to draw out on Slide 9. GTR would have been one of the challenges we've been experiencing along with the pressure from developing markets and global equities. Those would have all had fee rates quite north of the firm average, consistent with what you would see in that fundamental equities fee rate range on Slide 9. Brennan Hawken : Yes. Okay, great. And thanks for pointing out that on page -- on Slide 9, of course, I just more meant in a way that we could actually embed within the financial models, right? So, we could have it in greater detail. Does Slide 9 tie to the AUM disclosures you guys have in your pressor? Allison Dukes : Not exactly. And I think that's part of the challenge, and we hear you on that one, and I know that is a desire you have expressed, and we will continue to work through our data in a way that we can make it as digestible as possible. Although I do think this gives you quite a bit of color as to what's been going on over the last four years and a lot of the challenge in the results that we've experienced being increasingly captured. Brennan Hawken : Sure. Of course. Sorry to be a pain in the butt. Thank you. Allison Dukes : Not at all Brennan. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Michael Cyprys : Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just one on regulation, Basel III end game rules for the banks are slated to potentially raise capital requirements. Just curious how you see that trickling down to the asset management industry and your business whether it's availability and cost to warehousing, you spoke derivatives, accessing leverage? Just what areas you think might be impacted from the new capital rules? And then can you speak to the opportunity set just in terms of where you guys might be a beneficiary where you might be able to press to innovate, to create new products to be able to take some share from the banking system? Allison Dukes : Good morning. I'll take that one. I'd say, honestly, the Basel III capital requirements have little to no impact on us at all. There's very little that we do that has have any relationship to the areas that are impacted by Basel III. So, I would say, in terms of where might we have some opportunities, we could take advantage of. Certainly, we're all seeing the opportunity to continue to think about capturing some private credit share as we continue to see that be a challenge for the banking system and a lot of that getting pushed out of the banking system. We've certainly already seen the impact of that over the last five years, and I expect that those trends will continue. I think it also creates opportunity on the real estate debt financing side, and I think consistent with Andrew's prior comments and where we see some opportunities in our positioning our capabilities there to take advantage of that as well. Andrew Schlossberg : I'd just add bank loans where we've been an innovator as well as different things on the liquidity side of the business. But I'd echo Allison's comment it's just not Basel has not been a focus of ours. Michael Cyprys : Sure. I get it doesn't apply to you, but just curious how you see that impacting the banks, which then may reprice or pull back capacity, which is to the question I was getting at. But maybe we'll move on. Just a question here on efficiencies. That's an area of focus for you guys in streamlining the organization. I was just hoping you might be able to speak to some of the potential from generative AI, how you guys are experimenting with that today? How do you see the opportunity set from that? How might be able to quantify the benefit there over time? Andrew Schlossberg : Yes, it's a great question. Early days, of course, data and organizing our data and making it strategic asset is one of our priorities and how we apply artificial intelligence and generative artificial intelligence to it is high on the order. We're early days in experimenting with traditional applications that we think will and could lower costs and drive efficiency going forward. But also speed to market and friction that exists inside the client experience. So, things like marketing material and content legal and regulatory procedures and filings, onboarding of accounts, things like that, that are pretty operationally intensive at the moment. We haven't started to experiment yet, but how we'd apply that on the investment side. But on the sales side, we're applying it internally with finding ways to get ourselves to products and get ourselves to attributes that we can express to clients rapidly. So, we're going to continue to invest in the area, explore it and seek to make it a part of our efficiency going forward. But it's a little too early to quantify. Michael Cyprys : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Good morning folks. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just back to Slide 9, maybe on the fundamental equities franchise. Obviously, given industry pressures, that's -- that shrunk as a proportion of your overall asset base, but it is the highest revenue yielding area. So, can you talk about maybe what types of investments you're making in the overall fundamental equities franchise that might help the organic growth prospects of that? And then also maybe just to what extent are you viewing active ETFs as a potential vehicle enhancement for that platform? Andrew Schlossberg : Great. Thanks for the question. It's -- let me start with how we're seeking to improve fundamental equities, both from an investment standpoint and from a client standpoint. On the investment side, clearly, our investment leadership, we put new investment leadership in place. That leadership is focused on not just improving performance over time, but risk and tools and analytics and controls around it. Performance will be the biggest driver in addition to where market demand is and getting strong investment quality across the piece is a high priority. And you're seeing some of those investment performance returns sort of play through into the results. And I think that's what's mitigating some of the redemptions in particular, on the international emerging and global equity side of things. From a distribution standpoint, given our history in both the US and in the UK and Europe, where a lot of those assets are placed on retail platforms, we're very well placed. We have strong distribution in place. We have high education there as well. So, it's really about just being in front of clients more actively where when demand comes and when we have quality. The one thing I'd really want to point out as you kind of decompose that fundamental equities is really around the places in international, global, and emerging markets, which are the relatively high field and component parts. They are the component parts that are less susceptible to passive and there are places where we think we can differentiate on product, et cetera. And those are the areas where I was pointing out in my earlier comments as well, where we're seeing the most improvement in terms of net flows. In fact, for the quarter, those categories globally were just $1 billion of net outflows compared to many multiples of that in 2022. So, I think that's our first port of call in terms of where we could see growth in time. And then I think it's a little more challenging on the domestic equity side, but the same comments I made would apply. Allison, I don't know if you want to add anything there. On the shift from mutual funds to ETFs, we're well placed in the ETF platform. We've brought active strategies to market over many years. We're going to continue to look for ways to take active strategies from the mutual fund vehicle to other vehicles in time and not just ETFs, I'd say SMAs are going to be another place, custom SMAs, both on the fundamental and index side, but on the fundamental side, in particular. So, we're going to look for ways to bring that forward. I think the development of active ETFs is going to take some time. But as it develops, we'll definitely be a frontrunner there. Brian Bedell : That's great color. Thanks for that. And then maybe just on the expense side, Allison, just a clarification, the $10 million in the fourth quarter improvement in the compensation line. Does that exclude or include the dynamic of the charges between the two quarters, 3Q and 4Q? Allison Dukes : That would be run rate improvement. So, that is independent of the $39 million of this quarter and the $15 million to $20 million that we anticipate in severance reorganizational costs in the fourth quarter, that would be true underlying run rate improvement. And we'll -- give you more transparency to that as we realize those savings. Brian Bedell : Yes. No, that makes sense. And just I don't know if you're able to comment on other 4Q expenses in EMEA marketing is typically seasonally high but anything else on the property line and the G&A line, other than the -- you made the State Street output commentary, obviously, but anything else on those two lines for 4Q? Allison Dukes : Yes, I would say we do often see a little bit of seasonality in both marketing and G&A in the fourth quarter as there are just professional services fees and the like that's usually true up there in the fourth quarter. So, there might be a touch of seasonality marketing those two line items higher. We are thoughtfully and very aggressively managing our discretionary expenses though. Brian Bedell : Okay, great. Thanks very much. Andrew Schlossberg : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Alex Blostein : Great. Thank you for taking the question as well. Good morning. Lots of noise and expenses, obviously, for you guys this year. So, maybe you can kind of help us level set and as you go through all these changes provide some color on how you're thinking about margins for 2024? Obviously, the revenue backdrop could be volatile as we know, but assuming more stable markets. It looks like you guys are doing sort of low 30s percent kind of clean operating margin. Assuming there's no additional charges in 2024, is there room to build off of that into 2024 versus 2023? So any color you provide on that would be helpful. Allison Dukes : Sure. Good morning Alex. Our expenses this year a little bit noisy for two reasons. One, a lot of the executive retirement, the reorganization efforts and the severance associated with that and then the fact that we no longer have TIR after the first quarter. So, I will say when you back that out, it's actually quite consistent. They've been quite flat. And Alpha has been running in our expense base to the tune of $7 million or $8 million a quarter since the second quarter when it moved out of TIR and fully into our expenses. So, there's sort of that -- it's a fully loaded expense base and we are trying to call out where there are some one-timers associated with that. We will continue our simplification efforts well into next year. We aren't going to let up and continuing to find efficiencies. I don't know that they will be to the tune of the materiality we've seen in these last couple of quarters as we've sought to bring a lot of that forward. But we will continue with those efforts, and we'll call it out when it is material. As I think about next year and what could help us improve operating margin above that 30%-ish range, it absolutely becomes -- it's largely a revenue story, and we are very, very focused on revenue and just the impact, again, that we have experienced with the remixing of our asset base and the market depreciation that has impacted us quite significantly starting late last year, again, in developing markets and global equities, especially as Andrew noted earlier. I think independent of where revenue goes, we are highly focused on really managing that expense base next year. We will provide more guidance as we get into January. Alpha is a huge focus for us next year and Alpha is going to be fully loaded in our expense base. We'll be giving more color to that as the quarters unfold. But that will impact our ability to really drive our expense base down in 2024 because we'll be working on fully going live and running parallel on several systems at the same time. So, again, we'll create transparency, but all of this is with an eye towards simplifying and streamlining our end-to-end delivery so that we can create positive operating leverage coming out of 2024 and anticipating further growth in our AUM. I just want to underscore, I mean, a lot of the flows that we're seeing, we're very pleased with what we saw in the third quarter. We recognized it was quite a bit better than what the rest of the industry is seeing. And I think it really speaks to the diversification of our platform and how aligned it is with client demand. It's giving us the opportunity to make really thoughtful decisions as we continue to simplify our organization and really invest in the capabilities and the technology that's going to be necessary to create that positive operating leverage going forward. Andrew Schlossberg : Also, we're going to continue to have the expense discipline that Allison has been talking about in addition to these streamlining efforts playing through over time and helping us grow our revenue base but also be much more efficient with our expenses and be able to reallocate additionally to these growth areas in time as well. So, you should expect to see both of those sides of the expense equation in the coming quarter. Alex Blostein : Got it. All right. That's helpful. Thank you. And just a quick clarification question for you guys on the net revenue yield. So, I appreciate the comments around diversification of the business improving and that should provide some stability to the net revenue yield. Just a quick reminder on China, I think there are some decreases in pricing that either already occurred or yet to occur. So, just remind us maybe the magnitude of that and whether it's already fully in the run rate and what you expect that to hit? Thanks. Allison Dukes : Sure. So, in China, that we do expect with some of the changes that happened there and the impact to fee rates that it will have an impact of about $10 million on our revenue overall, given the AUM that's impacted there. The impact to operating income will be quite a bit less than that, just given there will be some comp expense takeout that's associated with that reduction in the fee rate. And that's a 100% so keep in mind how we reflect 100% and then back out the 51%, excuse me, that we don't own below the line. So, the one thing I would say to that is while that is an impact to revenue upfront, we actually think this portends very well for our business in China as regulation seeks to just further strengthen the capital markets there. We know as the 12th largest asset manager, we are well positioned to be a net winner, and we think we will benefit from some of these fee rate changes and the impact to some of the smaller players. Alex Blostein : Got you. great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Patrick Davitt : Hey, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. So, it sounds like you're changing your tone a bit on the path to future fee rate declines. But at the same time, it sounds like you expect much more bonds, fund flows and ETF demand from here, which are among the lowest fee buckets. So, what changed to kind of change your tone on the potential for fee cuts if the lowest fee buckets end up being the biggest inflow contributors? Allison Dukes : Sure. Thanks Patrick. A couple of things. I don't I would say we're changing our tone. I mean, I do expect you'll continue to see some modest downward pressure in our fee rate as we just continue to see some of this mix shift. We're not calling it into mix shift and we know we all are quite aware of the secular trends that are out there. The demand for passive and the weaker demand for active and we're certainly benefiting from one side of that trend. But increasingly, those -- the impact of that is captured in our results. And so if you look at our net revenue yield, ex performance fees and ex QQQ, it's $32.9 million basis points this quarter. So, it was actually four times basis points higher than last quarter. That's in some respects due to one additional day in the quarter. But I will say we have that seasonality occurs every year. And this is one of the first third quarters in a long time where you saw it be flat or positive. Typically, the pressure is downward. I still think we'll have some downward pressure, but it's going to start to moderate and $32.9 million is a lot closer to an average passive fee rate of 18-ish basis points than 40 was. And so at some point, you start to see where we get closer to that average and that remixing starts to have less of an impact on fee rate. I would also say, keep in mind, while we're focusing on fundamental equity and passive and the difference in that net revenue yield, important to look at APAC managed, again, largely China and Japan under there with a 40 to 50 basis point fee range and the growth we're seeing over -- through the cycle in those two areas, very accretive to the overall fee rate and also the growth that we expect to continue to see in private markets and multi-asset accretive. So, while the biggest drivers and the biggest change in terms of outflows and inflows have been passive and outflows in fundamental equity, there are other aspects of our portfolio that are very accretive. And our objective is to take that $1.5 trillion in average AUM that's been relatively flat over the last couple of years, given the market depreciation and grow that. And as we grow that and these pieces of the pie grow, you start to see the impact of the last couple of years really better realized in our average fee rate and you start to see some stabilization in the decline. Andrew Schlossberg : Yes, Patrick, I'd just add to what Allison said, the APAC multi-asset private markets that you see on Page 9, volume would increase that in time. relative to where we are. And then on the fundamental equity side, we've -- we sort of underperformed on our market share capture and our redemptions. And so as you see redemptions start to mitigate and get into positive flows eventually, that's going to be through market share gains. And so I think on both sides of that and I think Allison covered it well. Patrick Davitt : Great, that's helpful. And then one quick follow-up on margins. I think many years ago, you used to say the ETF business was a drag on margin as it hasn't scaled yet. So, similar to Glenn's point on bonds, I'm not getting to a point where we start to see a lot more incremental margin from the CTF growth, given how big some of the funds are getting. So, do you think we're at a point where we could see kind of a step-up on change in the margin contribution from the ETF growth you're seeing? Allison Dukes : Yes, I would say going back to when I joined the firm a few years ago, we were saying the ETF business was neutral to the firm margin. It's been quite some time since it would have been dilutive. We are certainly in a position now where it is accretive to the firm's margin overall and we're very focused on continuing to grow that business because it is accretive to the firm's margin. And I think as you think about what could -- one of the two biggest things that could really improve margin for this firm overall, it is rapidly growing the size of that business, stemming the redemptions and fundamental equities and again, growing that pie overall from $1.5 trillion in AUM, so something quite a bit larger than that. Scale is what is going to add contribution from a margin perspective. Patrick Davitt : Thanks a lot. Operator : We do have time for one final question. And our last question comes from Finian O'Shea with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Finian O'Shea: Hi, good morning. Thank you. A question on the MassMutual partnership commentary in the beginning. Are you working toward a broader, say, private markets, organic product build-out with hopeful seating through master -- or is this more a focus on executing what's in the ground already for those areas of partnership? Thank you. Andrew Schlossberg : Yes, thanks for the question. Much of the private market seeding for the strategies we talked about earlier has happened already and so the comments we made around the $3.5 billion are largely inclusive of all of that. As we move forward and bring additional private market strategies, MassMutual will hopefully will continue to be that kind of partner, but much of its happened already, which leads us to executing on the ground, as you said with growing third-party assets from institutions and wealth managers, which is what we've been doing the last several years and getting ourselves situated for that demand to continue to come. So, that's that. What was the other piece on the MassMutual -- do you have another piece of MassMutual? Finian O'Shea: That was pretty much it. Thank you. Andrew Schlossberg : Okay. All right. Okay. Well, thanks, everybody, for joining the call today and we continue to believe that we have great opportunities at Invesco as we discuss today and that we have momentum from which to build. We're very well-positioned as investors gain better visibility on rates and market direction and put their money back to work. Hopefully, you've seen that we have the breadth of products, scale, performance, and competitive strength to meet the spectrum of client needs and we are simplifying and streamlining the organization to better position for greater scale, performance and improve profitability. So, thank you for your interest in Invesco and we look forward to speaking again soon and next quarter. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. You may all disconnect at this time.",

Andrew Schlossberg, President and CEO; and Allison Dukes, Chief Financial Officer, will present our results this morning, and then we'll open up the call for questions. I'll now turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Schlossberg : Thanks, Greg, and hello, everyone, and I'm pleased to be speaking with you today. In a reversal from the third quarter, overall market sentiment in the fourth quarter turned more constructive as investors began to gain confidence, putting money back to work in the last several weeks of the calendar year. Equities and fixed income were both beneficiaries of a growing belief that central banks would cut rates sooner in 2024. The S&P was the best-performing major equity index and while outside the US, there was solid market growth in Europe, while China continued to lag. Fixed income markets performed well, led by government bonds as expectations for tightening interest rates earlier in 2024 prevailed. The market volatility and shifting macro trends exhibited this past quarter, strengthened our conviction in the areas we focused on throughout 2023, and continuing to reposition Invesco to perform through various market cycles and in front of the rapid evolution underway in our industry. As discussed on previous calls, we continue to streamline and simplify the company for the benefits of our clients, colleagues and shareholders. The focus of these efforts is to further emphasize long-term investment quality, strengthen our diverse product offering and build on our value proposition that uniquely meets a broad range of client needs around the world. We are also tightening our financial discipline, which will further enable us to allocate resources to drive innovation and acceleration for the benefits of clients. We're going to continue to leverage our scale to more effectively invest in profitable growth and further strengthen a culture that attracts and retains the top talent in our industry. While our work in each of these areas continues, we are making good progress, and I'm appreciative of the client focus and dedication of my Invesco colleagues around the world. Our results, which are highlighted on slide 3 of the presentation, summarize many of these external and internal factors at play. During the quarter, we continued to benefit from growing client demand and assets beginning to move off the sidelines. In the fourth quarter, we delivered $6.7 billion in net long-term inflows, which is a testament to our advantageous position with deep client relationships, strong geographic mix and a broad suite of in-demand solutions. While organic flow growth and improving sentiment drove asset levels higher, most of the gains occurred later in the quarter, limiting the revenue impact in the fourth quarter but increasing AUM nearly 7% from September 30 levels. Several factors contributed to our strong organic flow growth in the fourth quarter. Most notably, demand for our ETFs and our SMAs continue to drive market share gains in these important product platforms. During the quarter, we achieved $14 billion in positive flows in our ETF factor and index capabilities globally and hit a record high of $634 billion in AUM. We also produced our 13th consecutive quarter of positive flow growth in SMAs as we continue to see strong demand for custom tax optimized solutions in the US wealth management channel, in particular. The second set of quarterly organic growth drivers were the return to positive flows in two of our most critical growth areas, our China business as well as the broader Asia Pacific region and private market alternatives. While overall sentiment in China remained relatively weak, our well-established position in the country drove positive organic growth in the fourth quarter. The majority of the flow growth came from the launch of seven new products, which were augmented by equity product sales in existing capabilities. Strong demand for these new products could signal a more constructive 2024 in China. Long term, we remain optimistic about this market and our unique leadership position within it. We continue to believe that the Chinese asset management industry will grow and mature in the coming years with the development of the local retirement and capital market systems in the world's second largest economy. In private markets, we generated net long-term inflows led by a stabilization and modest inflow into direct real estate and inflows to credit strategies, notably bank loans, which includes CLOs. We have over $6 billion in dry powder to capitalize on opportunities emerging from the market dislocation of the last several quarters, but we will need greater market clarity before we begin to see significant growth. Shifting to fixed income, which is a key area of strength for Invesco. We continue to see steady ongoing growth, having reported positive inflows in 19 of the past 20 quarters. Leading contributors in the fourth quarter included investment grade, custom SMAs, as well as municipal bond strategies. As investors gain greater clarity on inflation and Central Bank interest rate policy, we expect clients to move out of cash and extend the duration profiles of their fixed income allocations into a wider range of strategies. As previously highlighted, fixed income is one of our absolute strengths in Invesco, and we remain focused on ensuring we're well-positioned to capture an outsized share of this ongoing reallocation. Finally, pressure on active equity flows continued in the fourth quarter for both the industry and for Invesco. We continue to emphasize investment quality, product differentiation and client engagement to ensure we remain a leading provider in this space with a focus on our in-demand capabilities where we can gain market share. Despite the continued headwinds, we have seen some moderation in certain areas of active equity flows particularly in global, international and emerging market segments. Our net outflows into these important strategies moderated during 2023 to $1 billion to $2 billion a quarter, significantly lower than what we experienced in 2022. These early signs of reversal have been led by our Global Equity and income strategy, which achieved top retail selling status in Japan and delivered an incremental, $1.4 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter. While we are cautiously optimistic about market conditions for 2024, we remain prepared to meet client and shareholder expectations across a range of scenarios. We have the breadth of capabilities, the discipline to drive performance as well as the organizational structure and focus to ensure we are well positioned to meet evolving client demands. As market sentiment improves, this should translate to even greater scale, performance, and improve profitability. With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Allison for a closer look at our results and I look forward to your questions. Allison Dukes : Thank you, Andrew and good morning everyone. I'll begin on Slide 4. Overall investment performance was solid in the fourth quarter with 64% and 71% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers were beating benchmark on both a three-year and a five-year basis, respectively. Investment performance improved considerably on a five-year basis, going from 65% in the third quarter to 71% in the fourth quarter reflective of improved performance that we're seeing across several categories, including in US, global, and international equity. We continue to have excellent performance in fixed income across nearly all capabilities and time horizons. An important fact given our strong conviction in our ability to attract flows as investors deploy money into these strategies. Turning to Slide 5. AUM was nearly $1.6 trillion at the end of the fourth quarter, $100 billion higher than last quarter end. The fourth quarter began with weak markets in October and then recovered as the quarter progressed ending the year with equity and fixed income markets higher versus the third quarter. Higher markets, coupled with net long-term inflows and favorable foreign exchange movements drove the increase in assets under management during the fourth quarter. We generated $6.7 billion in net long-term inflows, which was an organic growth rate of 2.4%, but we expect to once again outperform peers in what has been a challenging environment for organic asset growth. Looking at flows by investment approach, client demand for passive capabilities remain strong as we garner nearly $14 billion [ph] of net long-term inflows during the quarter. ETF inflows were $12.4 billion, an annualized organic growth rate of 17%, marking this as one of our best quarters for ETF. The S&P 500 Equal Weight Index bond once again led the quarter with $4.6 billion of net long-term inflows. This ETF was also our leading flow driver for the year with nearly $13 billion of inflows. Our Q2 QM ETF through the second highest inflows in our ETF suite with over $2 billion for the quarter. The Q2 QM was launched a little over three years ago and now stands at over $18 billion of AUM, making it our third largest ETF outside the QQQ. We demonstrate the ability to sustain growth in ETFs throughout the full market cycle with organic growth in 13 of the past 14 quarters. Offsetting some of the growth in passive was $7.2 million of net outflows in active strategies. What's encouraging is that the level of outflows in the fourth quarter was the second lowest since the market sell-off began in early 2022. The lower level of net outflows was driven by growth in active fixed income products, led by our custom fixed income SMA, which totaled $2.1 billion in inflows. Regarding active equity strategies, we experienced another quarter of strong growth in Japan with our Henley Global Equity and income fund garnering $1.4 billion of net inflows from Japanese clients. This fund continues to be the top-selling retail fund for the industry in Japan on both a quarterly and a year-to-date basis. Active global equity products experienced net outflows of $1.6 billion, of which $1.2 billion came from the developing markets fund. The level of outflows from this investment class has declined after significantly elevated redemptions in the second half of 2022. Looking at flows by channel. The retail channel generated $4.6 billion of net long-term inflows, while our institutional channel had net inflows of $2.1 billion. Driving the growth in the retail channel or the ETF products I noted previously, as well as the custom fixed income estimate. Growth in the institutional channel resumed after net long-term outflows in the third quarter that were driven by the global targeted returns redemptions. Moving to Slide 6 inflows by geography. Asia Pacific delivered net long-term inflows of $5.8 billion, representing organic growth of 12%, driven by growth in Japan and a resumption of growth in our China joint venture. Japan's net long-term inflows were $3 billion in the fourth quarter, representing an organic growth rate of 21%, driven by the Henley Global Equity and income fund as well as fixed income products. We believe Japanese markets are seeing the most constructive conditions for risk on assets in many years, and we're well positioned to capture that growth. Our China joint venture generated $1.7 billion in net long-term inflows driven by ETFs and fixed income strategies. Turning to flows by asset class. Equities generated $8.3 billion and net long-term inflows, mainly driven by the strong growth in ETFs. Fixed income flows were impacted by our planned bullet share ETF maturities that occur each December, which totaled $2.8 billion. This is an annual occurrence, and these outflows are typically offset by new BulletShare products launched in the first quarter, where we are already seeing strong inflows in January. Excluding these maturities, fixed income and net long-term inflows were $2.9 billion. In Alternatives, we generated $1 billion of net long-term inflows in bank loans, including CLOs and $400 million in net long-term inflows into direct real estate. These inflows were offset by outflows and other products that we classify as Alternative products, such as global asset allocation and commodity ETFs. We have a strong track record in our private markets platform with Alternatives and are well positioned to capture long-term flows in this asset class as client demand shifts to these strategies. Moving to Slide 7. Secular shifts in client demand across the asset management industry, coupled with more recent market dynamics have significantly changed our asset mix since the acquisition of Oppenheimer Fund. Going back to 2019 after the acquisition, ETF and index AUM, excluding the Q2 have grown from $171 billion or 14% of our overall $1.2 trillion in average AUM in 2019 to $362 billion or 22% of our average AUM of $1.5 trillion in the fourth quarter. In Q2Q, a product we earn no management fees from, but does provide a substantial marketing benefit has tripled in size over this time, going from $74 million to $230 billion [ph] or from 6% to 14% of total average AUM. We've also seen very strong growth in global liquidity going from $82 billion or 7% of average AUM to $170 billion or 12% of average AUM in the fourth quarter. These product areas carry lower net revenue yields compared to our overall net revenue yield. During the same time frame, we've seen weaker demand for fundamental equities and multi-asset products, which carry higher net revenue. This has been driven in part by the risk off sentiment that was sparked in early 2022, coupled with the pressure that we experienced in developing markets and global equities as well as the closure of our GTR capabilities. Our fundamental equity portfolio in 2019 was $348 billion or 29% of our average AUM. By the fourth quarter, that portfolio had declined to $261 million or 16% of our average AUM. Multi-asset also declined from 7% to 3% of the average AUM over this time frame. Looking at the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter of 2023, we continue to experience similar dynamics with ETF going from 21% to 22% and the QQQ going from 13% to 14% of average AUM, while fundamental equities declined from 17% to 16% and multi-asset from 4% to 3% of average AUM in the quarter. The result of revenue headwinds created by these dynamics has weighed on our results over the last four-plus years. While we've experienced excellent organic growth and lower fee capabilities like ETFs and global liquidity was not enough to offset the revenue loss from higher fee fundamental equity and multi-asset outflows. Our overall net revenue yield has declined meaningfully during this time frame, but that decrease has been driven by the shift in our asset mix not degradation in the yields in our investment strategy. Net revenue yields by investment strategy have been relatively stable within the ranges provided on the slide. The other point that I want to emphasize is that this multiyear secular shift in client preferences has been increasingly captured in our results. Our portfolio is better diversified today than four years ago, and our concentration risk and higher fee fundamental equities and multi-asset product has been reduced. These dynamics, though challenging to manage through as they occur should portend well for future revenue growth and marginal profitability improvement, independent of market gains. Further, we now have a more diversified business mix, which better positions the firm to navigate various market cycles, events and shifting client demand. Turning to slide 8. Net revenue of $1.05 billion in the fourth quarter was $62 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2022 and $52 million lower than the third quarter of 2023. The decline from last year was due largely to a $35 million decline in performance fees and the shift in our asset mix that was just discussed. The decline in performance fees was mainly driven by lower fees generated from real estate related and other private market activities. The decline from the prior quarter was primarily due to incremental asset mix shift and lower average assets under management, partially offset by higher performance fees in the quarter. Total adjusted operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $771 million, relatively unchanged from the fourth quarter of last year. Included in fourth quarter 2023 are $22 million related to organizational change expenses and $12 million of Alpha platform related implementation expenses. Adjusting for these items, fourth quarter expenses were $32 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2022. Total adjusted operating expenses were $18 million lower than the third quarter, more specifically, looking at employee compensation that has been impacted by the organizational change expenses. Compensation was $26 million lower in the fourth quarter, which includes $11 million in expense savings related to the organizational changes that I'll provide more detail on shortly. Marketing expenses of $28 million were $6 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2022 as we continue to tightly manage discretionary spend given the ongoing challenging revenue environment. Property office and technology expenses were flat to last year and $4 million higher than last quarter. G&A was $19 million higher than last quarter as we typically see higher G&A in the fourth quarter. We also had $12 million in spending related to our Alpha platform implementation, higher than the $8 million incurred in the third quarter due to incremental implementation costs in the fourth quarter. Going forward, we expect onetime implementation cost to be approximately $10 million per quarter in 2024 with some fluctuation quarter-to-quarter. We will continue to update our progress on the implementation and related costs as we move forward. Now, moving to slide 9. We realized $11 million in expense savings in the fourth quarter related to the organizational changes. On an annualized basis, we have achieved $44 million or nearly 90% of the $50 million in expense savings we expect to realize in 2024. We expect to realize the remaining $6 million in the first quarter. We're not expecting any further significant restructuring costs associated with these efforts. The full benefits from our simplification efforts will be seen over time as we generate revenue growth and margin recovery. As we've discussed, we managed variable compensation to a full year outcome in line with company performance and competitive industry practices. Historically, our compensation to net revenue ratio has been in the 38% to 42% range, trending towards the upper end of the range and periods of revenue decline. At current AUM levels, we would expect the ratio to be at or slightly above the higher end of this range for 2024. Seasonally, we see approximately $25 million in higher compensation expenses related to payroll tax and other benefit reset in the first quarter. As a result, we would expect the ratio will exceed 42% during the first half of 2024. Moving to slide 10. Adjusted operating income was $275 million in the fourth quarter, which included the costs related to organizational changes. Adjusted operating margin was 26.3% for the fourth quarter. Excluding the costs related to organizational changes, fourth quarter operating margin would have been 210 basis points higher. Earnings per share was $0.47 in the fourth quarter. Excluding the costs related to organizational changes, fourth quarter earnings per share would have been $0.04 higher. Effective tax rate decreased to 9.9% in the fourth quarter from 23.6% last quarter. The decrease was primarily due to a discrete tax benefit related to the resolution of certain tax matters, favorable tax treatment related to a gain on sale of certain Hong Kong pension sponsorship rights, and the favorable impact of a change in mix of income across tax jurisdictions. We estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 25% for the first quarter of 2024. The actual effective rate can vary due to the impact of non-recurring items on pre-tax income and discrete tax items. I'll conclude on slide 11. As stated priority for us is building balance sheet strength. This quarter, our cash balance was $1.5 billion, and we ended the year with nothing drawn on our credit facility. We have lowered our net debt significantly, and it now stands near zero. We have a $600 million senior note maturing on January 30, and we are in a position to redeem the notes at maturity. We estimate we'll have approximately $500 million in excess cash and will draw approximately $100 million on our credit facility to fully redeem the notes. The first quarter is a seasonally high cash usage quarter so we do expect to have a balance on the credit facility at quarter end, which will pay down as we move through the second and third quarters and reach our goal of zero net debt. We also hope to begin a more regular stock buyback program as we move towards this goal. To conclude, the resiliency of our firm's net flow performance and a difficult market for organic growth is evident again this quarter, and we're pleased with the progress we're making to simplify the organization and build a stronger balance sheet, while continuing to invest in key capability areas. We're committed to driving profitable growth and a high level of financial performance, and we have the right strategic positioning to do so. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thank you. I'm sure you said something very intriguing towards the beginning. You said you expect clients to move out of cash into longer duration fixed income at some point. And I think a lot of us have been waiting on that. You saw some fixed income flows, but a lot more money market outflows the last couple of quarters. I'm curious where the money market outflows going in general? And how do we determine the cash sitting on the sidelines is actually waiting to move out versus it's just treasuries and money markets that used to sit in cash, meaning is it just another cash alternative or is it actually weighting? I hope that makes sense. Andrew Schlossberg : Yes, it does. Let me start and Allison can pick up. It's a little of both. So, some of the money market flows out of Invesco and our business is largely corporate treasurers they're buying T-bills directly. So I wouldn't look at that as a great indicator from Invesco. As we're out talking to clients and we're looking at of where flows are going. Early signs have been clearly into ETFs, which might be telling you a little bit about conviction and maybe the lack of there full conviction. And then on the fixed income side, active and otherwise, starting to move into municipal bonds, in particular, some investment-grade strategies. Europe is picking up a little bit, but I'd say it's pretty early days on assets moving off the sidelines. Allison Dukes : And maybe just to put a finer point on our money market products, in particular, our liquidity products. Our client base there is about 85% institutional. So, when we see fluctuations in some of those balances, it is to Andrew's point, really corporate treasurers taking advantage of the increase in T-bill rates and moving out of money markets in the T-bill. It is only about 15% retail, which is where -- and of course, on the institutional side, they're just limited in where they're going to go. So, they're going to stay and cash yielding kind of products there. The retail side is a smaller component of our client base there. Glenn Schorr : Makes sense. So, in that revenue yield slide, you showed us the come down and you talked about not degradation of product pricing, but just mix shift. With the markets up so much, average assets ending assets way above average assets, how much of that revenue yield pickup could we see coming back the other way in the first quarter? I'm not sure you've gone through that math yet, but obviously, markets are up a bunch. Allison Dukes : Yes. No, they are, for sure. And I mean, the exit rate for net revenue yield will be -- it was modestly higher coming into the first quarter. I mean the delay, frankly, in the market pickup in the fourth quarter didn't do much for revenue, as you could see, but it does portend well for just the average AUM mix coming into the quarter, and it does give us a net revenue yield coming into the quarter that's modestly higher than the exit call it, two of the basis point there. So, very modestly higher. I think within those asset categories that we showed on that page, it's really the mix within there as well as the mix between those categories. So, one of the elements of our revenue performance in the quarter was even in our net revenue yield within our passive capabilities. And you saw our net revenue yield in passive declined about a basis point inside of the quarter as well, which really speaks to where client demand was in the quarter, largely for some of our lower fee products there, like the Q2 QM and the S&P 500 Equal Weight product that I noted earlier. So we do continue to see strong client demand. It's hard to predict where the client demand will be in the first quarter, and that has a huge impact on our revenue. All things being equal though, the market run has been helpful. Andrew Schlossberg : And the other thing I'd add, and you're seeing it as well. I'm sure the broadening out of the market, and as Allison mentioned earlier, the greater diversification in our overall portfolio of client assets puts us in a position under any kind of market environment where we think we're relatively well positioned. Glenn Schorr : All right. Thanks. Thanks for all of that. Appreciate it. Allison Dukes : Thanks, Glenn. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Daniel Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open. Daniel Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on Slide 7 and talk a bit more about the Alternatives in private markets dynamics in the quarter and more prospectively, how you were thinking about the potential growth in that business, considering the broader alts bucket has been seeing outflows for you, but yes, I think there's some underlying trends. I think you've talked about seeing some inflows. But curious to get a little bit more of an update. Allison Dukes : So let me start with just maybe an update on the flows, so I think we noted modest inflows on the direct real estate side, so about $400 million. And again, that's really divestitures net of acquisitions. And so we continue to see some modest improvement, which is nice to see just given some of the challenges in the real estate market. On the private credit side, we talk about $1.2 inflows. Again, our business there is only about $42 billion. So a relatively nice pickup inflows there. That was primarily driven by bank loans and CLOs. And some modest inflows in there are distressed credit capabilities as well. That's all on the private side, and that was largely offset by outflows on the public alternative side. And that's driven by commodity ETFs, listed real estate and global asset allocation that I noted on the call. So you've got a bit of a mix in our alternative strategies, again, with good gains on the private side being offset by some outflows in the public alternative strategies. Andrew Schlossberg : And as we look forward, we continue to view private markets and alternatives as one of our best opportunities. As Allison said, on the credit side, about $45 billion in assets. And on the private real estate side, another $70 billion in assets and seeing some moderation of flows and some positive gains, as Allison mentioned, we're first to see in this environment. I think if we take the long-term view, what we've been very focused on over the last several years is diversifying from a largely institutional base into a wealth management base and the issuance of our non-traded REIT credit real estate credit strategies and other sort of distressed and direct lending strategies, both into institutional, but probably more impactfully into retail, we continue to see as a great long-term opportunity for us. Daniel Fannon : Understood. And then just switching to expenses. I understand some of your comments. But maybe Allison, if you could talk to, is the State Street project? Is the goal to ultimately reduce expenses or just flat \u2013 get flatter growth going forward? So I just want to understand the components post the $10 million a quarter you mentioned for this year. And then underneath that, how we should think about the general growth rate of kind of G&A and other expense items for the year in terms of inflation or other factors? Allison Dukes : Let me start with Alpha. And if you think back around the implementation costs for the last few quarters, they have been growing. So we -- it was $7 million in the second quarter, $8 million in the third quarter, $12 million in this most recent quarter. And then our guide was to roughly $10 million a quarter per quarter throughout 2024, there will be fluctuations. It is not precise. We are deep into implementation. And so there is going to be some variability and some uncertainty quarter-to-quarter, but I think the $10 million expectation is reasonable with what we know today. The expectation is we are building to a peak, and then there are expenses that will be coming out the other side. So \u2013 and that is 2025 and beyond. So we're not ready to give exact guidance on that yet. But it isn't just a flattening out. It is building to a peak, and then there are some expenses that start to come back down. As implementation cost fade and there are some \u2013 the ability to continue to rationalize and streamline some of our systems, which will lead to some expense rationalization on the other side. And as a reminder, that is as much about -- the whole effort is as much about really eliminating the duplication of systems and some of the heavily customized processes that we have today and really moving towards a single operating model to streamline our operations and accelerate some of what we can deliver from a client experience perspective. I think you mentioned some of the other expense line items, maybe let me touch on some of those. Note that the G&A was seasonally high in the fourth quarter, and I would expect that to be a bit lower in the first quarter. From a compensation expense perspective, as we noted, there's always seasonality in the first quarter. We typically expect to see compensation expense about $25 million higher in the first quarter for taxes, FICA and the like, but we also expect to fully realize our $50 million in expense savings. So there's another $6 million that we expect will be realized in the first quarter. All of that is, of course, assuming flat markets at 12/31, et cetera, et cetera. But hopefully, that gives you some color that relates to the primary driver of alpha seasonality of G&A coming back down, seasonality and compensation expense going up modestly, but that's offset by the realization of our expense savings. Daniel Fannon : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ken Worthington : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on margins on slide 10. Excluding the unusual items, margins in 4Q 2023 were the lowest level on the page. Can you give us some color as to how business mix is impacting margins? To what extent is margin pressure being impacted by growth of lower fee, lower margin businesses and slower negative growth in higher margin, higher fee businesses. And I know it used to be some of the non-US businesses were the highest margin. At this point, can you kind of call out what are your highest margin and lowest margin businesses? Allison Dukes : Sure. Let me take a stab at that. So yes, you are correct. The fourth quarter adding back severance expenses would be our lowest quarter. And so what is impacting that? Certainly, it's business mix. Before I go to business mix, I will also note, just from an underlying expense base standpoint, keep in mind, for all the years prior to the last three quarters on this chart, we had TIR as a line item. And there was a significant amount of our expense base that within TIR. So our expense base has been fully loaded for the last three quarters inclusive of all the alpha implementation costs. So that is part of the pressure on margins, although it is not the whole story. The business mix story and the degradation in revenue is absolutely part of the story as well. Business mix is a big driver of it as you continue to see the shift in our business mix, as we highlighted on page 7, from fundamental equities into some of our lower fee capabilities, including ETFs and index even global liquidity to some extent as well. And within that, as I noted, even within those passive capabilities, you see some business mix pressure just in the most recent couple of quarters with demand for products like the S&P 500 Equal Weight and QQQM as opposed to commodity ETFs, bank loans and some of the other higher fee capabilities that would be within that asset category. So it is business mix among the categories and within the categories. In terms of margins, margins sort of by region are relatively consistent. I think it's worth noting in China, we've often pointed to our margins there, which you can look at and see really as you add back the joint venture there are higher than the firm average. They are modestly lower now with the implementation of the regulatory mandated fee cuts in China, which we have noted -- that -- the margins there are still stronger than the firm average and still very attractive, very positive in our positioning there and our growth rate there. We're very optimistic there. But modestly lower than it would have been previously. And the fourth quarter was our first full quarter of the realization of those fee cuts, which has an overall impact of about $10 million per quarter in revenue. Ken Worthington : Great. Okay. Thank you very much. Allison Dukes : Thank you. Ken. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Bill Katz with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Bill Katz : Okay. Thank you very much for taking the question this morning. Maybe to mix up a little bit. I was wondering if you could just sort of expand a little bit on where you stand with your relationship with Mass Mutual and the opportunity to potentially accelerate growth either into the alternative segment or perhaps even on building out some retail democratization products? Andrew Schlossberg : Hey, Bill, thanks for the question. Maybe just to refresh everyone's memory Mass Mutual in addition to owning our comment and being a preferred shareholder, has about $12 billion invested with us across broker-dealer, annuity, sub-advised general account capabilities. One of the most important parts of that has been the $3 billion they have invested into the seating and co-investment of many of our private market strategies, in particular, the ones we've been bringing to wealth management over the last several years. And so it's a very, very important partner in that regard. And that's a multiple of three times, what we carry on our own balance sheet around those sorts of strategies. So opportunities to continue to develop the relationship there are something we're focused on, although a lot of that growth has come already. I think the second area is just taking our relationship further where it makes sense on their insurance platform, with things like our alternative strategies, models, SMAs and ETFs and then select fixed income and equity products. And we're well placed there, but we're continuing to look for opportunities and ways to grow effectively. So it's an important partnership on many levels. Bill Katz : Maybe just a follow-up on capital. So it sounds like you're in a much better spot just in terms of reengaging on buyback. Allison, are you expecting to be able to buy back stock in concert with carrying the line of credit? Or do you need to get on the other side of that before you'd restart buyback? And then more broadly, what kind of payout rates should we be thinking about now that your earnings are more diversified and the earnings power is higher? Allison Dukes : All good questions. And I'd say short answer is, yes, we'd like on the other side of -- we're very committed to getting our net debt down to zero. And that has been a stated goal of ours and something we've been working closely in concert with our Board on achieving a stronger balance sheet. And so as we approach that, we look forward to having conversations with the Board and evaluating the opportunity to reengage more regular share buybacks. I think our payout ratio would stay kind of modestly in that 40% to 60% range as it has been in the past. I think that's a reasonable range for us to operate in as we think about both modestly increasing the common dividend each year as well as buying back stock. But we are a couple of quarters away from where we want to be there, just given the seasonality of cash needs that are before us over the next few months. We are within sight for the first time in a long time, and we're really pleased about the progress we're making with the balance sheet, just the growth in cash and where the debt is heading. So, it does feel like for the first time in a long time, we're kind of getting back into a position where we can be a lot more opportunistic than we've been able to be in the last few years. Bill Katz : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And next question comes from Mike Brown with KBW. Your line is open. Mike Brown : Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe just a quick follow-up on that last question on capital allocation and -- as you get further along on your goals on the balance sheet, do you expect M&A to kind of come back into the equation not necessarily large M&A, but perhaps maybe more on the bolt-on side as you think about adding capabilities and perhaps altering the strategic asset mix as you start to look out to, say, 2025? Andrew Schlossberg : Hey, it's Andrew. At the moment, the focus is very much on the organic side, the priorities around the balance sheet and the uses of cash, as Allison described stay true. As we have described in the past, the place where we see opportunity for us to add on in time for the right situation, opportunity would likely be in that private market space as extensions to the things that we already believe we do well today and could continue to grow both organically and inorganically. And that would be in the real asset space and in the private credit areas. But for now, very focused on the work we have to do organically. Mike Brown : Okay, great. That's good to hear. And then maybe if I just change gears to the developing markets fund. You had flagged performance has improved there. That product is still outflowing, but assuming that performance can continue to improve. I guess my question is what causes client interest to really come back to this fund, just given that seems like investor sentiment and interest in EM strategies is just kind of remains tepid. Is this going to be more about a kind of lower redemption story and kind of narrowing on the redemptions? Or can that eventually translate to more of a growth story? Andrew Schlossberg : Yes. Look, I think you outlined the question well. It's probably a bit of both. I mean the first thing is continue to strengthen the investment performance there. And we're unknown, as you know, a known emerging markets manager well known in the space, well placed in the wealth management channels. So, the things we can control our investment quality. What we have started to see a bit is the redemption picture improved, and that's sort of early sign. I think you're not really going to see a material uptick in gross sales until you see more demand come back in the marketplace from investors. And it's -- we've been waiting for that moment, and we haven't seen it difficult to predict, but it's an important category as is more broadly what we're doing in international equities and global equities, where those categories as well have been under some pressure. Our performance has improved materially, redemption rates declining, but same comment on the gross sales side. Mike Brown : Okay. Thank you, Andrew. Operator : Thank you our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Allison, I appreciate the color on 1Q expense. But when we're thinking about full year 2024, is the right base by which to grow off of that 3.06 billion that's adjusted for some of the charges. And how should we think about -- are you able to keep that flat? Or is that going to be having some positive pressure here through 2024? Allison Dukes : Good morning. Brennan, good question. Yes. If you look at the expense base and 2023 adjusted for the severance and retirement expenses that we incurred in 2023, which we aren't anticipating at this point, more of at 2024. When I look at our 2024 expectations relative to where the markets are, where we ended the year in AUM, the usual caveat of all things being equal, I would say we expect the expense base to be flat to 23% to just relatively very, very modestly, perhaps higher. But I'm going to call it just flat plus and that, importantly, in 2023 -- excuse me, in 2024 is inclusive of a full year of all four quarters, no TIR. So it is a four quarter no TIR year as compared to a three-quarter year last year, inclusive of some of the inflationary pressures, merit increases and the like. So we did a lot of work on our expense base last year. We've got a lot going on as it relates to output implementation costs in the $10 million per quarter guide we put out there. All those things taken into account, we're expecting relatively flat this year. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks for that color. I appreciate it. Allison Dukes : And I'll note with that, with some of where we are in the market, some of what we've seen in terms of the appreciation and average AUM exiting the fourth quarter and coming into this year. We are optimistic that we start to see modest improvement in operating margin from here. Brennan Hawken : Thanks for taking my questions. Allison Dukes : Thanks, Brennan. Operator : And our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brian Bedell : Hi. Great. Thanks. Good morning folks. Thanks for taking my questions. Switch the conversation to the QQQ franchise. I guess as you -- obviously, there's the earning products, but do you think about monetizing that whole franchise. Can you talk about how you think you might be able to monetize that asset base? I think obviously, QQQM is, I think, $20 billion in AUM and QQQs more than 10x that. First of all, the 15 bps on QQQM is that also the asset management revenue yield? Or is that just the extent ratio -- and then how do you think about potentially -- are there opportunities to effectively try to cannibalize the QQQ in favor of developing a more sort of fee-bearing QQQ franchise at the Invesco level? Allison Dukes : Great questions. And precisely, the topic we spend a lot of time talking about thinking about and really working on as a team. That the QQQ is a tremendous asset for us and the brand awareness that that creates can't be underestimated. The opportunity that creates for us in terms of the marketing budget that comes from that. All of our sort of ad campaigns, the brand work we do is really fueled by the QQQ. And so it's it is a tremendous asset to us. And it is certainly unique in nature and that's the value it creates. So we have to be very thoughtful about how do we optimize the value that is created from that capability. The QQQM, as you note, is approaching $20 billion and has been a cannibalization strategy and a very successful one, given it's only about three years old, and it has grown that quickly and assuming there is continued demand in the underlying or interest in the underlying exposure there, we expect the growth in that capability to continue. In terms of the actual net revenue yield from the published fee rate, it would be about half net of all of the costs there. So it is -- it would be one of the lower-yielding capabilities, again, part of what we were pointing to in terms of the business mix that is driving some of the pressure on net revenue yield overall. So it's a two-sided coin but one that is certainly well positioned to capture client demand. Andrew Schlossberg : The relationship with the NASDAQ on the Q goes back celebrating, I think its 25th year coming up soon. And very much what Allison was describing, how we've been growing that relationship. In addition to it being the QQQM being an alternative -- it's also -- we're creating a situation where the Q \u2013 the traditional Q is really for traders and the QQQM can be more for buy-and-hold investors. And I think it's indicative of what's happening in the ETF industry in general is it's a preferred vehicle now for people that have short-term interest and long-term interest. And so I think part of our strategy is just indicative of that. You should expect to see more of that from us, whether it's passive or active. Brian Bedell : Great. That's great color. And then maybe just a follow-on. I think Allison, you mentioned it, of course, you are investing in the business as well, sort of reinvesting some of those cost saves. Maybe if you can just talk about the top two or three areas from an investment management perspective in terms of product that you are investing in to Catalyst growth? You just talked about the QQQ franchise, maybe you can leave that one out. And I think on private markets, you mentioned that's an investment area, however, that can also be an area where M&A can play a role. So maybe if there -- if you can talk about any other say, a couple of areas that you're most excited about in terms of investment dollars that you're putting in and growth that could result from that? Allison Dukes : Sure. I'd probably point you back to our key capability areas and those being the areas where we've really focused the most on continuing to grow and invest. So certainly, within our ETFs, SMAs factor and indexer capabilities, we continue to look at how do we build those capabilities out to really capture the client demand that's there. Private markets both for the retail channel and the institutional channel. The institutional product capability really being our legacy capabilities and our strength where we've got a tremendous amount of history and success and continuing to build those out, invest in those capabilities and position those for client demand, but increasingly so on the retail side. And I think as we've talked about before, it's not just seeding and launching the product that's really building out the distribution capabilities there, and working closely with our clients as we expect that shift to be a multi-year shift in transformation in the education that's involved there and investing significantly in the education that's involved on that side. I'd also point to China and continuing to invest in our capabilities there. That is a -- it is self-funded and largely speaking, as we've discussed before, it is a very attractive business, highly profitable, cash flow positive but we are able to continue to invest in those capabilities. Your question was primarily around our product and client-facing capabilities, but I would also note a lot of what we invest in the benefit of clients, is it just the products, but the systems, the client experience and really streamlining the overall client experience behind the themes there. A lot of our investment goes into our platform, our technology and our capabilities in order to continue to deliver a better client experience. Andrew Schlossberg : And to a forward room on our shelf for that, I mean, we've been routinely pruning and closing parts of the product line that we haven't seen demand in and closed several hundred strategies over the last few years. The only other thing I'll point to beyond what Alison covered would be it's probably less investment capabilities that you'll see extensions on and more how it gets delivered to the market. So the trend towards vehicles like ETFs and SMA and bringing things beyond passive capabilities or fixed income capabilities is something we're going to continue to seek to lead in. Brian Bedell : Okay. That\u2019s great color. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Your line is open. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. My first question is on the 40% to 60% payout target after you reach your goal of zero net debt later this year. So why not a higher payout target because it sounds like M&A isn't a big part of the intermediate-term strategy? Allison Dukes : Reasonable question. I would say, as Andrew said, we do continue to think about the opportunities we have from a bolt-on perspective with certain capabilities from an M&A perspective. And given our balance sheet, is returning to a better position, but we want to be in a position to continue to build cash as we think about some of those opportunities and making sure we're in position should we find the right bolt-on capabilities to be able to execute. So it's a balance of making sure we have the ability to execute on several of those priorities, and it's not going to be all in returning cash to capital to shareholders. Craig Siegenthaler : Makes sense, Allison. And just as my follow-up, with the $3 billion in alt seed capital for MassMutual, can you remind us, which products the $3 billion has been invested in and then to date, how successful has that been? Like one way to quantify that is how much third-party AUM have you been able to attract around that $3 billion of initial seed capital from MassMutual? Andrew Schlossberg : Let me start and then Allison can pick up. Probably the two most important strategies were the non-traded REIT or in REIT strategy where MassMutual was \u2013 or early seating partner. I don't have the exact percent that they have, but I would say it's still relatively large, although we've been generating a decent amount of volume over time from one of the big wealth platforms in the US. And then the second one was our real estate debt strategy that we just brought to the wealth management market. That was the other sort of strategically important strategy. But I'll turn it to Alison maybe for more specifics on the numbers you asked about. Allison Dukes : Yeah. I would say -- it's largely their general account and where they would want to make sure they've got exposure as well across various capabilities. So I mean, they are invested in everything from Enrique, which we've been public on that strategy to things like municipals and CLOs and some of our private credit capabilities it's really kind of the breadth of those types of capabilities where you would see them really both invested. Andrew Schlossberg : And aside from the capital, which is clearly important, I think the signaling and showing up at these wealth management platforms in particular, not with new investment capabilities, but there are new packages that we're putting things together in. And I think that's really critical in terms of credibility that we show up at these platforms with. Craig Siegenthaler : Andrew, thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys. This is Luke on for Alex. I appreciate some of the color on expenses and revenues in 2024, and I appreciate that it's not easy to forecast going out so far. But do you have any high-level goalposts for margins over the longer period into 2025, especially as some of the State Street Alpha costs coming down? Thanks. Allison Dukes : I would say, high-level goalposts and this is going to -- longer term, and it's going to take us some time to get there. But getting back into the mid-30s is absolutely our high-level kind of goalpost. I hope everybody here is loud and clear. We are in no way satisfied with where our margins are today and getting them back on a quarterly basis, north of 30% and starting to climb back into the low 30s and mid-30s from there, absolutely the goal over the next handful of years. Our focus coming into 2024 is absolutely around expense discipline. We've done a lot of work on our expense base. We've got a lot of headwinds and things we have to make our way through at the implementation being the most notable and sizable of that -- but despite that, our expectation is to really try to hold our expense base relatively flat. And as you know, and thank you for giving us a little bit of grace on that one, that it is hard to predict it quarter-to-quarter, especially with the impact of revenue in market. So it's really about being very disciplined on everything we can control and where we can continue to take expenses out in places where it's not necessary and evaluate opportunities to eliminate those expenses or reinvest them in areas that will help facilitate and fuel further growth. Unidentified Analyst : Awesome. Thanks for the color. Just for my follow-up. You guys highlighted the plans to continue to shift from institutional to wealth and some of the strategies that you're looking to build on. Do you have any upcoming product launches in the wealth space that you guys are either working on or are free to talk about at this point? Thanks. Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah. Look, I think the -- I'll just speak generally about them because getting specific is difficult. The real estate debt strategy, we were seeing a lot of demand and interest for that, and you should expect to more of that in the market, and we should be talking more about that going forward. And then private credit strategies, whether they're distressed or direct lending, how we can position and factor those into the wealth channels and just to be clear, this isn't just in the US. It's in Europe and Asia Pacific as well. Greg Ketron : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Okay. And our last question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Michael Cyprys : Hey good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just a follow-up question on expenses. I was hoping you could maybe elaborate on some of the steps you guys are taking to drive greater operational efficiency in the business, additional steps you might look to take over the next couple of years? And how is the variable nature of the expense base evolve? And how should we think about the sort of sensitivity of expenses if markets are up, say, in 2024? I know you guided to around flattish expenses adjusted for things, but that was assuming flat markets if markets are up 10%, how do we think about the impact on expenses? Allison Dukes : Thanks Mike. I would say, what the relationship our expense base being about a third variable is still a reasonable relationship and expectation to think about as you think about the potential growth in revenue. So, I would start with that, certainly, as we've seen some of the real revenue pressure. It has made it difficult because there is some element of our expense base that's fixed. But I think as we anticipate starting to climb out from a revenue perspective, I think the one-third relationship is still a reasonable expectation. In terms of what we will do and how we will continue to think about streamlining, I mean, look, it's a continuation of so much of what we've done and a lot of what I just said, which is -- we are going to continue to evaluate our expense base everywhere. We're looking at our margins at a granular level on where we can really unlock some costs and evaluate some of what's been done in the past and perhaps where it doesn't need to be done that way in the future. We have been on a multiyear effort as it relates to facilities and rationalization of office space. And I would say -- I'd call out some usual suspects that you would expect us to be focused on elements like that, that's going to continue. That takes many years to really make it dent in, and we will continue to do things like that. But it's broader than that and really thinking about how we streamline our business, how do we really think about operating more holistically and a lot of the work that started almost a year ago now. I mean maybe with that, Andrew, if you want to kind of close on some of our thoughts there. Andrew Schlossberg : Yes. And Mike thanks for the question. Look, the simplification efforts in 2023, we believe were some of the most impactful things that we did that will bear fruit as we go forward here. I think bringing together elements of the investment platform and investment areas, the distribution areas, marketing and product, and then allowing our enterprise and operational areas to match off against a much more simplified platform was the goal. I think the areas and investments where we started to bring some things together -- it also gives us an opportunity to think about the margins in those businesses and the way that we make money and how to run those strategies and disciplines, not from the investment side, but from the platform side at scale where scale is needed at quality enhancement or quality enhancements needed, et cetera. So, the simplified organization helps us in those ways. Michael Cyprys : Great. Thanks so much. Andrew Schlossberg : So, maybe just to wrap up here in closing. As we enter 2024, hopefully, as you can tell, we feel well-positioned to help clients navigate the impact of the evolving market dynamics and subsequent changes to their portfolio that we expect. I had the pleasure of meeting with many of our clients around the globe this past year and hearing directly from them as assured me that we really are well positioned across a range of outcomes. And when and as the market sentiment improves, we believe this should translate to even greater scale, performance and improve profitability. And finally, I'd like to thank my colleagues around the world, the executive leadership team, our Board of Directors for their efforts in 2023, they're focused on our clients and our shareholders and their support for a smooth transition during the year. And given the work that we've done to strengthen our ability to anticipate, understand and meet evolving client needs, we're -- I'm truly excited for the future of Invesco. So I want to thank everyone for joining the call today. Please continue to reach out to our Investor Relations team for any additional questions, and we appreciate all of your interest in Invesco and look forward to speaking again soon. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, and that concludes today's conference. You may all disconnect at this time.",

All participants will be on a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will last one hour. To allow more participants to ask questions, one question and a follow-up can be submitted per participant. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Greg Ketron, Invesco\u2019s Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Greg Ketron : All right. Thanks, Operator, and to everyone joining us on the call today. In addition to our press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address. The press release and presentation are available on our website, invesco.com. This information can be found by going to the Investor Relations section of the website. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slide 2 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures, as well as the appendix for the appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. Finally, Invesco is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized webcasts are located on our website. Andrew Schlossberg, President and CEO; and Allison Dukes, Chief Financial Officer, will present our results this morning and then we\u2019ll open up the call for questions. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Schlossberg : Thank you, Greg, and good morning to everyone. I\u2019m pleased to be speaking with you today. Economic conditions remained relatively resilient in the first quarter and even though these diminished expectations for Central Bank cuts this year, equity markets continued to rise. The S&P 500 gained 10% during the quarter, again making it the best-performing major equity index. As the quarter progressed, market breadth began to improve, though gains in large-cap growth and tech stocks continued to significantly lead the U.S. equity market rally. More modest growth was recorded in developed markets outside of the U.S. In China, markets continued to lag, but economic indicators and sentiment are showing some signs of a bottoming. Fixed income markets were generally weak this quarter, with prices dropping as Fed expectations changed. During the quarter, we continued to see increase in client demand overall. We delivered $6.3 billion in net long-term inflows for an organic growth rate of 2.2%. Organic flow growth and signs of improving sentiment drove markets and assets levels higher again this quarter at Invesco, we ended the period with nearly $1.7 trillion in assets under management. Our resulting net revenue and adjusted operating income growth dropped 1% and 7%, respectively, from Q4 levels, which reflects where we saw growth against our diversified asset mix profile. We remain optimistic that with increasing market clarity, a broadening of market participation will continue to take hold and investor appetite for more duration, risk on and global oriented assets will increase. We are well positioned to benefit across our business in this type of environment. Now moving on to page three of the presentation and against this market backdrop, we highlight results in each of our investment capabilities. You\u2019ll note that these categories align with those presented in conjunction with our net revenue yield and portfolio migration disclosures, which we\u2019ve been highlighting the last several quarters, and Allison will expand on later in her comments. We are aligning disclosures in the way we speak about our business to present a more holistic and consistent view that encompasses all of our investment capabilities. And though each of these areas of our business is in a different part of its life cycle with different trajectories, these are the capabilities where we have invested resources and had conviction about the market and our position within it. The objective of our enhanced disclosure is to foster a better understanding of various components of our investment capabilities and their performance and potential in order to drive a clearer view of Invesco as a whole, our advantages in the market and our plans to drive profitable growth. Now turning to a deeper look into Q1 across each of these capabilities. An ongoing key driver of our strong organic flow growth is our ETF and Index platform. During the quarter, we continue to gain market share, recording $11.2 billion in net long-term flows, representing a 12% annual organic growth rate. This was one of our best flow quarters to-date, as we hit a record high of nearly $400 billion in long-term AUM. Growth this quarter was led by our equity innovation suite, notably our fund QQQM. This innovative product leverages our QQQ popularity, but with this fund we earn a direct fee on this product instead of significant marketing benefits. In a relatively short time, it has become our third largest ETF in our product suite outside the QQQ. Additionally, we continue to expand and leverage our active investment teams into our ETF and Index franchise. Our U.S. listed ETF strategies incorporating our active teams now exceed $25 billion in AUM across over 25 products and multiple asset classes. The advantages of ETFs in both passive and active formats remain a focus for Invesco and our clients. Shifting to fixed income, we continue to believe that as investors gain greater clarity on inflation and Central Bank interest rate policy, they\u2019ll move out of cash and extend their duration profiles of their fixed income allocations into a wider range of strategies. Though this anticipated shift may be more protracted given the mixed economic signals of late, we\u2019re beginning to see green shoots and we\u2019re well positioned across the risk and duration fixed income asset classes to capture flows. We did see continued momentum into fundamental fixed income with $1.1 billion of net long-term flows in the first quarter or nearly a 2% annual organic growth rate. Leading drivers included investment-grade strategies delivered through our institutional channels, as well as municipal bond strategies delivered through our mutual fund and SMA platforms. Beyond our fundamental fixed income capabilities, an additional $2.1 billion of assets flowed into our fixed income related ETF and Index strategies. Important to our fixed income demand story is our rapidly expanding retail SMA offering, which is one of the fastest growing in the industry with an annual organic growth rate of 24% and nearly $23 billion in AUM. We\u2019re starting to see extension of duration with our top-selling SMA this quarter being the intermediate tax-exempt strategy and we\u2019re seeing growing interest in our intermediate taxable investment-grade strategies as well. We are well positioned to continue to grow our retail SMA platform to support the client demand for this vehicle delivery structure, especially within the U.S. wealth intermediary market. We have a long-dated and established track record on our SMA platform that represents not only fixed income, but also traditional active equity and custom equity index SMAs. We see a lot of opportunity in this space and we look forward to continuing to share our progress with you. Moving on to Private Markets, we maintain momentum into the first quarter, with net long-term flows of $1 billion, driven by inflows in our credit strategies, notably bank loans. We also saw modest positive flows into Direct Real Estate, primarily driven by NCREF, which is our non-exchange traded REIT focused on the private real estate debt markets, which has had good momentum in the wealth advisory space since its launch last year. Additionally, it\u2019s important to note that our Real Estate team has $6 billion of dry powder to capitalize on opportunities emerging from the market dislocation of the last several quarters, but greater market clarity is going to be required before we can begin to see significant return of demand and growth. Moving on to our Asia-Pacific Managed Assets, despite overall client sentiment in China remaining relatively weak, we did generate modest positive net long-term flows in our China JV, driven by equities, particularly in our fast-growing ETF lineup. This was augmented by the launch of four new products and we continue to believe that some early signs of recovery in China could bode well for a more constructive market as 2024 progresses. We maintain our conviction in this market and our leading position within it as the asset management industry matures with the development of local retirement and capital market systems in the world\u2019s second largest economy. Beyond China, we also saw net inflows in our India business. We recently announced a joint venture with a leading Indian company for our funds business in that market. This partnership with the Hinduja Group will enable us to continue to expand our distribution to serve more domestic investors in the Indian market. In our Multi-Asset and Other related capabilities, we also generated net inflows led by our quantitative equity strategies, which were offset by outflows of remaining assets in our GTR capability in the U.K., which we decided to close last year. Finally, the relative pressure on fundamental equity flows continued. However, as I pointed out previously, we\u2019ve seen some moderation in certain areas of active equity flows, particularly in the global, international and emerging market segments. Our net outflows in these strategies have moderated during the past several quarters to $1 billion to $2 billion per quarter, markedly lower than the 2022 quarterly peak outflows of $6 billion. One notable standout in our fundamental equity flows was in our global equity and income strategy, which is among the top-selling active retail funds in the growing Japanese market. This fund delivered an incremental $1.2 billion of net flows in the first quarter and its AUM has nearly tripled in the past year. Overall, our asset flows in the first quarter continue to demonstrate the breadth of capabilities that we offer to serve our clients\u2019 diverse needs and perform through various market cycles. We believe that this positions us well in front of the rapid evolution underway in our industry. Our team remains focused on the value drivers that we believe create a competitive advantage to deliver sustained, strong asset flows, notably investment quality, product breadth and differentiation, and exceptional client engagement. So, moving on to Slide 4, investment performance, which is always a top priority of our firm and is displayed on this slide. We\u2019re showing overall results relative to benchmarks and peers, as well as our performance and key capabilities where information is readily comparable and more meaningful to driving company outcomes. Overall, investment performance was solid in the first quarter. On a one-year, three-year, and five-year basis, 66%, 64% and 75%, respectively, of our AUM is beating its benchmark and around 70% of our AUM is in the top half of peers across all periods. We also have a significant number of funds that are now in the top quartile of performance, with 46% hitting that mark on a five-year basis, which is a considerable improvement over the last several quarters. We continue to have excellent fixed income performance across nearly all capabilities and time horizons, supporting our strong conviction and our ability to attract flows as investors deploy money into these strategies. 92% of our fundamental fixed income capabilities are beating their benchmark, with 68% in the top quartile on a five-year basis. Fundamental equities, three-year and five-year performance has improved meaningfully over the past year, with 56% in the top half of peers on a three-year basis and 52% over five years. We\u2019ve seen strengthening results across many of our domestic and global equity strategies as well. So hopefully you find this more streamlined approach to discussing our results, our investment capabilities and investment performance more straightforward and useful as you think about Invesco and its potential. As we continue to simplify and focus our business, we are also tightening our financial discipline, which will enable the allocation of resources to drive innovation and growth in our investment capabilities. With that, I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Allison to discuss our financial results for the quarter and I look forward to your questions. Allison Dukes : Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m going to begin on Slide 5. Total assets under management at the end of the first quarter were nearly $1.7 trillion or $77 billion higher than last quarter end. Higher markets coupled with net long-term inflows drove the increase in AUM during the first quarter. Of the $68 billion increase driven by higher markets, $46 billion was driven by ETFs, including $20 billion by the QQQ. Fundamental equity AUM was $19 billion higher due to markets. As Andrew noted, we generated $6.3 billion in net long-term inflows for organic growth of 2.2%. Long-term net inflows were largely driven by ETFs, excluding the QQQ. ETF inflows were $11.2 billion in the first quarter, partially offsetting this was $5.6 billion in fundamental equity net outflows during the quarter. Net revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin all improved from the fourth quarter, and I\u2019ll cover the drivers of that improvement shortly. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.33 for the first quarter. We continued to simplify and streamline the organization to better position Invesco for greater scale and improved profitability in the future. We did incur $5 million of organizational change-related expenses in the quarter, we also achieved an incremental $4 million of net savings, more than we had expected previously. These efforts will result in $60 million of annual net savings this year, exceeding our goal of $50 million for 2024. Overall operating expenses remained well-managed. We further strengthened the balance sheet by redeeming the $600 million senior note that matured on January 30th. As expected, we used $500 million in cash and we drew approximately $100 million on our credit facility to fully redeem the note. We ended the quarter with net debt of $362 million, as we had other seasonal-related cash usage during the quarter and we\u2019re still on track to approach net debt of zero in the second half of this year. Moving to Slide 6, secular shifts and quiet demand across the asset-managed industry, coupled with more recent market dynamics, have had a significant impact on our asset mix since the acquisition of Oppenheimer Funds. Going back to 2019 after the acquisition, ETF and Index AUM, excluding the QQQ, have grown from $171 billion, 14% of our overall $1.2 trillion in average AUM in 2019 to $398 billion or 23% of our average AUM of $1.6 trillion in the first quarter. The QQQ, a product we are no management fees from, but does provide a substantial marketing benefit, has more than tripled in size over this time, growing from $74 billion to $259 billion or 6% to 15% of total average AUM. We\u2019ve also seen very strong growth in global liquidity, growing from $77 billion or 7% of average AUM to $165 billion or 10% of average AUM in the first quarter. These product areas carry lower net revenue yields compared to our overall net revenue yield. During the same timeframe, we\u2019ve seen weaker demand for fundamental equities and Multi-Asset products, which carry higher net revenue. This has been driven in part by the risk-off sentiment that was sparked in early 2022, coupled with the pressure we experienced in developing markets and global equities, as well as the closure of our GTR capabilities. Our fundamental equity portfolio in 2019 was $348 billion or 29% of our average AUM. By the first quarter, that portfolio had declined to $274 billion or 16% of our average AUM. Multi-Asset also declined from 9% to 4% of average AUM over this timeframe. Looking at the first quarter of 2024, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, we continue to experience similar dynamics with ETFs growing from 22% to 23% and the QQQ growing from 14% to 15% of average AUM, while fundamental equities and Multi-Asset remained flat at 16% and 4%, respectively. The resultant revenue headwinds created by these dynamics has weighed on our results over the last several years. While we\u2019ve experienced excellent organic growth and lower fee capabilities like ETFs and global liquidity, it\u2019s not enough to offset the revenue loss from higher fee fundamental equity and Multi-Asset uplift. Our overall net revenue yield has declined meaningfully during this timeframe, but that decrease has been driven by the shift in our asset mix, not degradation in the yield in our investment strategies. Net revenue yields by investment strategy have been relatively stable within the ranges provided on the slide. The other point that I want to emphasize is that this multiyear secular shift in client preferences has been increasingly captured in our results. Our portfolio is better diversified today than four years ago, and our concentration risk and higher fee fundamental equities and Multi-Asset products has been reduced. These dynamics, though challenging to manage through as they occur, should portend well for future revenue growth and marginal profitability improvement. Further, we now have a more diversified business mix, which better positions the firm to navigate various market cycles, events and shifting client demand. Now turning to Slide 7, net revenue of $1.05 billion in the first quarter was $23 million lower than the first quarter of 2023 and $7 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2023. The decline from last year was largely due to a $22 million decline in investment management fees driven by the shift in our asset mix just discussed. Service and Distribution fees increased $43 million due to higher fund-related fees and higher AUM to which the fees apply, but this is largely offset by third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses that are passed through from Service and Distribution fees. The revenue increase from the prior quarter was primarily due to a $34 million increase in investment management fees due to higher average AUM, partially offset by the incremental asset mix shift, and lower seasonal performance fees. Service and Distribution fees increased $32 million due to higher fund-related fees, but were offset by third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses. Before I cover operating expenses, I did want to note that the first -- for the first quarter, certain operating expenses were reclassified to more accurately portray the nature of the expenses. These expenses were previously classified as either marketing or property, office and technology, and they\u2019ve now been reclassified as G&A expenses. We\u2019ve included in the appendix a two-year look back on the reclassifications to show the impact by expense category. The reclassification had no impact on our reported operating revenues, total operating expenses, operating income or net income. For comparability, the variances I will be discussing include the reclass expense categories for the first quarter of 2024 and the first quarter and fourth quarters of last year. Total adjusted operating expenses in the first quarter were $770, excuse me, were $757 million, an increase of $8 million from the first quarter of last year. Included in the first quarter of this year\u2019s operating expenses are $5 million related to organizational change expenses and $7 million of Alpha platform-related implementation expenses, which in the first quarter of last year would have been recorded in transaction, integration and restructuring expenses, and not included in our operating expenses. Adjusting for these items, first quarter expenses were $4 million lower than the first quarter of last year. Total adjusted operating expenses were $14 million lower than fourth quarter, largely driven by lower G&A expenses. Employee compensation was $6 million higher in the first quarter due largely to the seasonal impact of higher payroll tax and other benefit resets in the first quarter, which totaled approximately $20 million. This is partially offset by lower costs related to organizational changes that I\u2019ll touch on shortly. G&A expense was $21 million lower than last quarter as we typically see higher G&A in the fourth quarter. Lower professional services fees in the first quarter were the primary driver of the decline in G&A expense. We also had $7 million in spending related to our Alpha platform implementation, lower than the $12 million incurred last quarter. Going forward, we continue to expect one-time implementation costs of Alpha to be approximately $10 million per quarter in 2024, with some fluctuation quarter to quarter. We\u2019ll continue to update our progress on the implementation and related costs as we move forward. The effective tax rate was 24.6% in the first quarter. We estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 25% for the second quarter of 2024. The actual effective tax rate can vary due to the impact of non-recurring items on free tax income and discrete tax items. Moving to Slide 8, we achieved an incremental $4 million in net expense savings in the first quarter related to the organizational changes. On an annualized basis, we have achieved $60 million in net savings, exceeding our $50 million target for 2024. And while we did realize $5 million of organizational change-related expenses in the first quarter, we\u2019re not currently expecting any further significant restructuring costs associated with these efforts. The full benefits from our simplification efforts will be seen over time as we generate revenue growth and margin recovery. As we\u2019ve discussed, we manage variable compensation to a full-year outcome in line with company performance and competitive industry practices. Historically, our compensation to net revenue ratio has been in the 38% to 42% range, trending towards the upper end of the range in periods of lower revenue. At current AUM levels, we would expect the ratio to be slightly above the higher end of this range for 2024. I\u2019ll finish on Slide 9. We continue to make progress on building balance sheet strength in the first quarter. We redeemed the $600 million senior note that matured on January 30th using the $500 million in cash and drawing $100 million on our credit facility to accomplish this. We ended the quarter with $900 million in cash and $368 million drawn on the facility as the first quarter is a seasonally high cash usage quarter. We ended the quarter with net debt of $362 million, compared to nearly $600 million a year ago, all in line with our expectations. These actions resulted in an improvement in our leverage ratios and we\u2019re now down to a leverage ratio excluding the preferred of 0.54 times. A significant improvement over the past several years. We expect to pay down the credit facility as we move through the second and third quarters, approaching our goal of zero net debt in the second half of this year. We also hope to begin a more regular stock buyback program as we move towards this goal. We\u2019re pleased to note that our board approved an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.205 per share effective this quarter. This reflects the strength of our balance sheet, cash position and stable cash flows. To conclude, the resiliency of our firm\u2019s net flows performance is evident again this quarter and we continue to make progress on simplifying the organization and building a stronger balance sheet while also investing in areas of growth. We are committed to driving profitable growth and a high level of financial performance and we have the right strategic positioning to do so. And with that, I\u2019d like to open it up to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Okay. And our first question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. I guess, Allison, first to start, maybe a modeling question. The Service and Distribution revenues versus the third-party expense, the deltas are directionally, understand they went higher because of higher asset levels, but the ratio was more negative this quarter. Similarly, last quarter also directionally went in an opposite way. So, just trying to understand what are the other kind of more detailed facts behind that and how we should think about that perspectively. Allison Dukes : Sure. There\u2019s definitely a bit of an anomaly in those line items this quarter. We\u2019ve got an elevated $21 million of fund related expenses, which really shows up as a fee and that was related to a fund proxy expense. The fund Board determined that a shareholder meeting was necessary to elect new trustees. That\u2019s a pretty infrequent occurrence. In fact, the last time that occurred was in 2017. But as a result, there\u2019s a $21 million fund related expense that shows up in that third-party contra revenue. It\u2019s offset -- the majority of it is offset. There\u2019s $18 million that was paid for by the funds and that would be recorded as Service and Distribution revenue. So I think when you look at the quarter-over-quarter change with year-over-year and the sequential quarter, you obviously see that large anomaly, not something we would expect to occur given the last time was in 2017. When you look about -- think about the relationship and you\u2019re right, the relationship, just the ratio is running relatively high. If I look at third-party contra revenue, that usually runs about 41% to 42% of management fees. But it\u2019d be on the higher end in some of the lower revenue years, just due to there\u2019s fixed cost inside of that line item. I would expect it to be above the higher end this year, maybe somewhere around 43%. Again, just as we\u2019re coming into the year, starting at a lower revenue trajectory. As you look back at 2020 as kind of a reference, it would be in a similar range back then. So I think that\u2019s one way to think about it, Dan. Dan Fannon : Okay. Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And then just going back to the disclosures and the fee rates and kind of the mix and understanding, this has been a long kind of trend since the Oppenheimer deal. But if I look, fundamental equities assets are up 9% year-over-year. That still represents your highest fee bucket. I know it\u2019s flat quarter-over-quarter, but I guess what gives you confidence that that\u2019s not still a headwind as if beta is removed and you still have the outflow trends that have been going on and why we wouldn\u2019t still see continued fee rate degradation? Allison Dukes : So, your -- the question of what gives us confidence that fundamental equity is a continued headwind? I mean, I would say, it could still be a continued headwind. I think what gives us confidence as we look at the trajectory overall from here is that we continue to manage that exposure down or if the market effectively continues to manage it down, as well as client demand continues to be more for our passive capabilities than active. That is obviously an industry-wide trend. We don\u2019t expect a change in that trend. So to be clear, we\u2019re not expecting fundamental equities to necessarily turn into a strong tailwind, but we do think the magnitude of the headwind will continue to diminish as it becomes a less significant component of our overall AUM mix and we continue to grow the other categories and we are seeing strong organic growth rates as we\u2019ve noted in many of the other categories. So one thing we can -- well, the several things we continue to focus on, and I know Andrew touched on this, we can continue to go into it, is investment performance. Very focused on the investment quality behind fundamental equities and making sure we continue to make good progress there and we are demonstrating progress there. There are underlying -- as we decompose our fundamental equities, there are underlying trends there that create headwinds, not the least of which is our exposure into both developing markets and global equities, which given some of the geopolitical challenges that are out there, continues to be an asset class that is not strongly in favor and that will continue to be a headwind so long as we have some of the geopolitical challenges underlying the trends for client preference there. Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah. Delivering in fundamental equities is one of the firm\u2019s top priorities and Allison outlined where those are. Global, international, emerging market equities in particular, their demand spans the world and we\u2019re well positioned to take advantage of that as demand comes back and so we\u2019ll manage the things we can control, which Allison outlined around investment quality and quality of the teams. Dan Fannon : Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ken Worthington : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. High level, MSCI World and S&P were at all-time highs at the end of March. Invesco\u2019s stock price has lagged this year and is down since the beginning of 2023. You touched on a series of points over the discussion this morning, but pulling it all together, as you review the stock price performance over the last 12 months to 15 months, maybe first, what is your assessment? And then, Allison, you highlighted that mixed issues have negatively impacted earnings and those have moderated. Can you help us better evaluate that mixed moderation is approaching the level that can better allow earnings to grow and better allow the stock price to perform better? Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah. I mean, look, clearly as a starting point, we\u2019re not pleased with where the share price is. We\u2019re working hard to improve that in the areas that we can control. Several of the things that where market demand has been, we\u2019ve been strong. So whether that\u2019s passives, ETFs, indexing, places like fixed income and growth in areas like Japan and out in Asia-Pacific. Some of the headwinds that we\u2019ve had with a large portion of our assets in places where some demand has not picked back up in terms of asset flow demand, that is, places in global and international emerging equities. Areas like China continue to be places where we feel well positioned, but market demand, i.e. client flows, needs to come back. So those are some of the things that we\u2019re focused on from a growth standpoint and from an expense standpoint, continuing to be disciplined with the expense base and using opportunities to rotate our expense base to areas we anticipate will grow going forward, which we continue to highlight. So those are the things that we\u2019re going to continue to do to drive the profitability of the company and hopefully the share price higher. Allison Dukes : And I\u2019ll just touch, Ken, on the mix moderation. I think, look, there is just at some point a mathematical sort of tipping point that happens there as you think about our AUM mix and where the effective sort of net revenue yield is today based on the composition we have. As it gets closer and closer to what our passive net revenue yield is, there\u2019s a bit of a terminal value there. We in no way expect our fundamental equities to go entirely to disappear. There continues to be strong demand there. In fact, our growth sales were quite strong. But you look at the underlying headwinds and pressures, again, particularly given some of our exposure and our tilt towards global and developing markets, it creates a lot of headwinds. But there is a terminal value there as we start to see the mix continue to diversify as ETF and Index become an even greater percentage of our overall portfolio. The organic growth there is creating positive net revenue growth. Fundamental fixed income, we\u2019re seeing positive net revenue growth. We continue to see good net revenue growth and global liquidity and a lot of this just continues to be offset, not entirely, but moderately offset by fundamental equities. Those headwinds will diminish at some point, just given client demand and asset allocation. Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah. I mean, the only other thing I do want to add is, markets have been, as we all know, have been narrow, even inside the indexes, as has client demand, as has the amount of cash that remains sitting on the sideline. So there are some positive things that we think as clarity comes into the markets at a greater rate, we\u2019ll start to see demand broaden out. Ken Worthington : Great. Excellent. And just, Allison, as a follow-up, that tipping point comment, how close are we to that tipping point? How far in the future do you think that is or maybe we\u2019re already there? Allison Dukes : It\u2019s hard to say because it is so client demand driven. And again, like, if I just look at our net revenue yield of 26.1 basis points and you think about our passive ETF and Index kind of net revenue yield of 15 basis points to 20 basis points, we\u2019re a whole lot closer to that at 26.1 basis points than we were at 40 basis points. So there is that and I don\u2019t know that tipping means growth because I do think we believe there\u2019s stabilization and stabilization will then allow that annualized net new revenue growth to really take hold and we can start to see it in true organic revenue growth that would match the organic flows. Hard to say exactly. But I do believe we\u2019re getting closer and closer. We are -- as challenging as this quarter was, we are optimistic as we look at the rest of the year and we\u2019re optimistic because of a variety of trends. We look at markets haven\u2019t hurt. April\u2019s obviously not been terrific, but markets are modestly helpful. Our organic growth continues to be very strong. We see pockets of growth across, frankly, almost all asset classes. We\u2019re very encouraged by what we see in terms of the organic growth trends, both in the first quarter and continues throughout the year and we know our expenses are well managed against it. So we actually feel reasonably confident that we\u2019re starting to reach a pivot point. I just can\u2019t be certain what client demand and markets hold. Ken Worthington : Thank you both. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I\u2019d like to start with the shift to -- the shift in expenses. The shift of some expenses into G&A and a method of signaling that these expenses could maybe eventually be cut or slim down as the operating model is adjusted and streamlined? Allison Dukes : Well, no, the shift was not a, if I understood your question correctly, it was not a way of saying, I mean, truly the shift was just reclassifying expenses where they better belonged. Things like travel and entertainment didn\u2019t belong in marketing, it belonged to G&A. So, it was really trying to get expenses where they need to be. So, we better reflect the true nature of those expenses and not necessarily a signal in any way. Brennan Hawken : All right. Another question on disclosure. Hopefully this one turns out to be a little more fruitful. So, it seems like you guys are shifting the AUM disclosures here to align with Slide 6 where you provide the yields. But just a couple of questions. This is net revenue yield, right? So it excludes performance fees, but it is net of anything going on with distribution. I just want to make sure I\u2019m looking at that correctly when we think about how to use it as a modeling tool and going forward, if this is going to be the way in which we should model, are we going to get a more granular disclosure of these yields so we\u2019ll be able to really fine tune models tightly and maybe some historical time series showing what the fee rates were historically so we can really fine tune? Allison Dukes : So, a couple of things. One, yes, the 26.1 basis points consistent with the disclosures we\u2019ve had that are in both the press release and here in terms of the net revenue yield. Yes, we\u2019ve been, you and several others were very encouraging of us continuing to evolve our disclosures to this kind of format and so we hope you find it more helpful going forward. We think it\u2019s more helpful as well. In terms of the disclosures, the fee rates we provided in this range here will be the way in which we continue to provide that. We will adjust those ranges should the ranges actually no longer prove to be accurate, but they are the right ranges and we do see each one of these categories really operating within that range. Again, very dependent on client demand. As within any of these categories, we do have strategies that really do kind of hit the barbell of the different ranges that are there and so it\u2019s very dependent on client demand. So we did provide history by these categories in the presentation. So you can go back and see some of the flows by category and then we\u2019ve got the fee ranges there, but we will update the ranges going forward as the ranges change. Brennan Hawken : Okay. And is -- are the monthly AUM disclosures going to align with this too? Sorry. Allison Dukes : Yes. They are. Brennan Hawken : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, all. Thanks for taking the question. This is Luke [ph] on behalf of Alex. Just another question while we\u2019re on the topic of updated disclosure. Can you just run through the major components in the Private Markets business, maybe how big each bucket is and how you\u2019re thinking about the growth outlook for this part of the business? Thanks. Allison Dukes : Sure. The major buckets would be -- maybe starting with Real Estate would be on -- it would be Direct Real Estate. So that\u2019s around $69 billion listed Real Estate, which would be around $15 billion. So those would be the two components of Real Estate. And then Private Credit, which is primarily bank loans at about $39 billion and then our distressed and direct lending funds, which total just about $2 billion, maybe a little north of $2 billion between them. Andrew Schlossberg : And maybe I\u2019ll -- look in terms of growth, what we mentioned this quarter in the credit side, our bank loans and floating rate strategies continue to be in demand and we\u2019re one of the market leaders in that space across all vehicle types and we don\u2019t see that abating. And then on the Real Estate side, the greatest opportunity for us in terms of growth right now is taking what\u2019s largely been an institutional recognized franchise and bringing it into the wealth space as we\u2019ve been talking about. And we have a few strategies in market right now that I mentioned earlier, our Real Estate equity strategy and then also more recently, our Real Estate debt strategy. Both of those products have been in the market for a few years now. The debt one more recently and they\u2019re well picked up by wealth platforms and continue to be picked up by wealth platforms. So as demand continues in that space, we think we can be a pretty active participant. Unidentified Analyst : Gotcha. That\u2019s helpful. Appreciate the color. Just one more, maybe circling back on like the fee rate dynamics. You guys highlighted expense savings slightly better than prior expectations. But with the continued degradation of the fee rate, can you just frame how you\u2019re thinking about the pace and trajectory of margin expansion over the next 12 months to 18 months? Thanks. Allison Dukes : Sure. And then I would just remind that the degradation of the fee rate doesn\u2019t necessarily mean degradation of revenue and so that\u2019s one of the things we\u2019re trying to unpack as we continue to refine the disclosures on Page 6 and where the organic growth is coming from. We can have great, strong growth in ETFs and no real growth in some of our higher fee categories and still see fee rate degradation, but see strong revenue growth. So that\u2019s the most important thing to remember and where we\u2019re trying to, again, provide those disclosures. So where do we expect things to go from here? I mean, I think as we continue to manage expenses and we are very actively, thoughtfully and aggressively managing our expenses and we will, while I said, we don\u2019t expect any significant organizational change costs from here. That doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t continue to find opportunities to create further organizational changes. What I want to be clear on is we weren\u2019t necessarily guiding to, you should expect X more in organizational expenses, because we\u2019re not in the midst of a major program, but we are in the midst every day of looking at for decisions we can make to continue to refine and streamline the organization and we\u2019ll take advantage of those opportunities as we have been for the last year, since first realigning the business a year ago. We have continued to really step through a series of changes and we will continue to step through changes as we see opportunities to streamline the business. We really believe we\u2019ve got the opportunity to continue to create positive operating leverage. I have no reason to believe we couldn\u2019t do it starting this quarter. I will just be clear, client demand and markets have continued to be headwinds. Markets, not so much last quarter, but client demand was a headwind. We could see markets be a headwind this year, depending on what continues to happen from a geopolitical perspective and some of the impact that has on our developing markets exposure in particular. But that said, we absolutely have the opportunity to create positive operating leverage from here. Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah. We continue to also invest behind these growth capabilities that we\u2019ve been mentioning the last several quarters and we\u2019ve been able to do that at a -- from a net standpoint, as you see in the results and we\u2019re really seeking to create an organization that\u2019s more flexible, an organization that\u2019s more streamlined and focused that allows us to rotate that expense base where we need to in different market conditions, but with the long-term in mind. Operator : Okay. Thank you. And our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thank you. Maybe one on in the spirit of driving growth in high demand solutions, can you peel back the onion a little bit on your -- what you\u2019re doing, what successes you\u2019ve had on both the SMA platform and active ETFs? I know the two things in one there, sorry. Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah. I mean, let me talk about both. On the SMA platform, as I mentioned, it\u2019s now grown to about $23 billion, which is which is multiples higher than just a few years ago. The immediate success that we\u2019ve been having is in the fixed income space, where there\u2019s been decent demand and a lot less supply of offering and we\u2019re seeing that kind of across the piece and fixed income. More recently, we\u2019ve been introducing custom indexes and elements of the active strategies, which have had a slower pick up where there\u2019s more supply in the market. But we think off the backdrop of what we\u2019ve built, there\u2019s opportunity there. And then in time, we think the SMA platform like the ETF is going to continue to be a preferred vehicle, which will allow us to bring other strategies -- fundamental strategies or other fundamental and quantitatively developed strategies together into that SMA platform. So we\u2019re -- we think we\u2019re in early stages of growth in SMAs and I think going to the way the technology and operational platforms set up now in a more modern way, it scales a lot better than SMA businesses did a decade or two ago. On active ETFs, we\u2019ve been in that space, we\u2019ve been one of the pioneers in active ETFs starting as far back as 10 years to 15 years ago. We have -- as I mentioned in my remarks, we have about $25 billion of AUM that has an active team connected to it, which doesn\u2019t mean just active funds. So about half of that is in active ETFs in the classically defined sense and the other half is passive oriented strategies, but supported by or working with one of our investment, active investment teams, things like Multi-Asset or Bank Loans are examples of that. And we continue to think that the ETF chassis and which we\u2019re large and scaled in is going to continue to bring in not just traditional active strategies, but also alternative active strategies, meaning ones that combine fundamental and quantitative approaches. And we think we\u2019re set up well to be a leader there, given the quality of our active, the depth of our ETF range and the recognition I think we have on the wealth platforms, which will drive this growth. So, it -- both areas are vehicles that we\u2019re excited about and I think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity to bring our capability to. Glenn Schorr : Okay. I appreciate that. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Katz with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Bill Katz : Thanks. Maybe a big picture question first? There\u2019s a couple of articles just about sort of streamlining your India platform seem to be a little bit different when I heard just now in terms of the JV, just sort of wondering if you could talk a little bit about just the opportunity to continue to streamline globally or to reinvest into faster growth areas and how that might ultimately feed back to earnings? Andrew Schlossberg : Great. Let me -- I\u2019ll start and then, Allison, can pick up. Two different components of our Indian business that are -- our Indian profile that are worth mentioning. We use India as a very large enterprise back office, middle office center, and that\u2019s been phenomenal for us in a place where we\u2019re going to continue to invest behind and continue to -- it will be one of the places that helps us streamline the cost base over time. Separate to that, we have an Indian Fund business and what we announced in the last few weeks was that we were forming a joint venture with a large Indian business called Hinduja Group. And Hinduja Group is bought 60% of our interest, so we\u2019ll have a minority interest and Hinduja is well recognized company in India and also financial services company in India, which we think in a combined way can help us grow and accelerate the pace of development that we have there and we can we\u2019re better suited as a minority interest in that regard. And those are the sorts of things I think you could think about as we continue to go market-by-market, looking for ways to both grow and to think about where we deploy our resources, capital and operating expense. Bill Katz : Okay. My next question, I\u2019m going to cheat a little bit. Allison, you just go back to the distribution discussion, I was taking notes, but I want to make sure I understand it and maybe apply it to the 26.1-basis-point average fee rate for the quarter and what would be the exit rate if you normalize for the sort of the unique fund cost? And then you mentioned that you\u2019re going to be sort of back to sort of net zero by the second half of this year, but you might be able to sort of rethink capital return along the way. At what point should we anticipate buyback, particularly where the stock is trading now? Thank you. Allison Dukes : Sure. I don\u2019t know that the net of that, third-party distribution is that meaningful. So, if I go back and just kind of recap what I said there, you\u2019ve got about $18 million related to that proxy event that was recorded as revenue and $21 million that\u2019s recorded than a third-party contra revenue. So, effectively $3 million that was borne by Invesco there. Not terribly meaningful as you think about net revenue yield. So, I don\u2019t -- so I\u2019m not trying to dodge your question, but I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s terribly meaningful to net revenue yield. I know it is a bit confusing, though, and I would continue to guide to the thinking about that, something around 43% of third-party contra revenue as a percentage of management fees is the right way to think about that relationship in a low revenue environment, and as revenue improves, you should expect that to kind of come back down into that 41% to 42% range and that proxy event being a bit of an anomaly. As it relates to our return of capital, and I\u2019m sorry, I might have missed that question was when buybacks might resume. Buybacks, again, I think, as we approach our target of zero net debt, which we expect to be middle back half of this year and we are being very thoughtful in our cash management overall, very pleased with what we\u2019ve been able to do so far and very much in line with our expectations. We expect we\u2019ll reach it middle to back half of this year and we do hope to be resuming more regular share buybacks. I think I\u2019ve noted in the past our total payout ratio would be in the 40% to 60% range. I might expect it and just sort of these lower earnings environments to be on the higher end of that range. Hopefully I covered that question there, Bill. Bill Katz : Thanks so much. Yes. You did. Thank you. Allison Dukes : Great. Thanks. Andrew Schlossberg : Thanks, Bill. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Maybe just come back to the active ETF question. To the extent you\u2019re cloning these from fundamental strategies, or I guess the question is, what is your appetite to create active ETFs that are either clones of the fundamental strategies or similar types of strategies? And can you capture a fee rate on those ETFs, a management fee rate or net revenue yield on those ETFs that are similar to the fundamental strategies, and I guess, as you\u2019re growing them, are they included in the ETF bucket or the -- or would they be in the fundamental buckets? Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah. Let me start and Allison can pick up on that last part in particular. It\u2019s very much driven by client demand. And what I mean by that is, where there is interest in fundamental strategies that are the same or similar to ones that we offer today, we\u2019ll offer them and we\u2019ll bring them forward. We haven\u2019t seen that so much to-date. They\u2019ve either been a new strategy or a variant of, but we\u2019ll continue to bring the best capabilities we have into the active ETF wrapper where it completely makes sense. You\u2019re going to see some of that, I think, in the industry come through conversions. You\u2019re going to see some of that come as cloned or as newly originated funds. But I think, ultimately, you\u2019re really going to see the ETF as a preferred wrapper for many investors to have lots of different ways of deploying active into it. As I was saying before, some fundamental, some quantitative, some that are going to be a variety of both. So I think there\u2019s going to be a decent amount of product development and I think each firm is going to have a different strategy on it. We\u2019ve got some of the unique attributes that I mentioned and you\u2019ll probably see all the above from us. In terms of the fee rates and where they\u2019re included, I\u2019ll leave it to Allison. Allison Dukes : So, as we -- as those grow and as we start to embark on that, they would show up in the ETFs and Index investment capability category. And when and as and if it changes the fee rate, we would adjust that range as well in the disclosures. But we\u2019ve got a way to go and just creating critical mass there that would actually create a change in that range. Brian Bedell : Okay. Okay. That\u2019s a good color. And then just on the classic ETF franchise, just maybe if you can talk about how you view the scalability of that and clearly you\u2019re always making investments across your product lines. But if we continue to see outsized growth in that franchise, should we expect that to be positively contributing to your margins over time? Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah. I\u2019ll let -- well, Allison, you start and I\u2019ll pick up. Allison Dukes : Well, I mean, I say in the bottom part of your question, yes. And it is positively contributing to our margin today. It\u2019s just offset by some of the outflows on the fundamental equity side. So to be very clear, our overall traditional ETF franchise is margin accretive as it stands today and we are starting to see the benefits of scale, although I think we\u2019re just scratching the surface of it and continuing to grow that is a true focus for us. Andrew Schlossberg : Really across all parts. I mean, we often talk about product when we -- in origination, new product or scaling existing products. But there\u2019s the whole ecosystem behind it, which as we get larger, allows us to continue to have operating leverage. Technology plays a big part. Operations plays a big part. Capital markets plays a big part. And I think these are some of the advantages we have of having been in the ETF business for multiple decades on having the size and scale we have. So, it does scale well and incremental margin should improve over time. Brian Bedell : Great. Great. Thank you for the call. Greg Ketron : Hey, Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Okay. And our final question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Your line is open. Craig Siegenthaler : Thank you, guys. I hope everyone\u2019s doing well. My first one\u2019s on Asia. So you had positive flows from the China JV and in India, but your overall APAC business had net outflow. So I was curious, what were the largest sources of redemptions by geography and product in APAC this past quarter? Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah. I know it could be a little bit confusing, so I\u2019ll let Allison pick up. I think in the region, did we have positive flows in the region? Let me distinguish. The managed assets that you see on Page 3, the negative is driven by a Japanese equity capability that we have that had some net flows -- net outflows in the first quarter. So that was the only driver of negative impact on what we call Asia-Pacific Managed Assets on Page 3. But maybe from a regional perspective, Allison, why don\u2019t you pick up? Allison Dukes : From a sourced perspective, we were in inflows. In fact, it was pretty strong, about $3.3 billion of inflows, so a 6.6% organic growth rate. Largely driven by Japan, continued to see a lot of success in Japan with our Henley Global Equity and Income Fund. We\u2019ve noted some success in that for the last several quarters that garnered over a $1 billion of inflows in the first quarter. Continued success in India, just under a $1 billion of inflows in India. Positive flows in the China JV as we noted as well. So, overall, strong growth in the region from a sourced perspective. Andrew Schlossberg : And Craig, you can see some of that on Page 13 in the appendix. We show it on a sourced flow perspective. Craig Siegenthaler : Got it. Thank you for that. And just my follow-up, you had $1 billion of Private Market net flows and I can see there were $2.8 billion of long-term outflows. Does your definition of outflow include both redemptions and realizations? Because as you know, some of your competitors exclude realizations from the net flow definition. Allison Dukes : Yes. Ours includes redemptions and realizations. And so when you look at our flows in Private Markets, largely driven by bank loans, which I think Andrew noted, it\u2019s a little over a $1 billion in bank loans. We did see inflows on the Real Estate side as well in Direct Real Estate and that would be net of realization. Some of the outflows were actually on the listed side and some of the listed Real Estate. Craig Siegenthaler : Thank you very much. Allison Dukes : Thank you, Craig. Andrew Schlossberg : Thank you. All right. Well, thanks to everybody for joining. And in closing, I really want to reiterate that we\u2019re well positioned to help clients navigate the impact of evolving market dynamics and subsequent change to their portfolios. And we very much believe that as market sentiment improves, this should translate into even greater scale performance and improved profitability. Given the work we\u2019ve done to strengthen our ability to anticipate, understand and meet evolving client needs, I\u2019m very excited for the future of Invesco. I want to thank everybody for joining the call today and please reach out to our Investor Relations team for any additional questions and we continue to appreciate your interest in Invesco and look forward to speaking again very soon. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today\u2019s conference. You may all disconnect at this time.",

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. Now I'd turn today's call over to Mr. Greg Ketron, Invesco's Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Greg Ketron : Thanks, operator, and to all of you joining us on Invesco's quarterly earnings call. In addition to today's press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address. The press release and presentation are available on our website at Invesco.com. This information can be found by going to the Investor Relations section of the website. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slide 2 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix for the appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. Finally, Invesco is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third-parties. The only authorized webcast are located on our website. Andrew Schlossberg, President and CEO; and Allison Dukes, Chief Financial Officer, will present our results this morning, and then we'll open up the call for questions. I'll now turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Schlossberg : Thanks, Greg, and good morning to everyone. I'm pleased to be speaking with you today. During the second quarter, we had several bright spots of performance and growing business momentum against the continued complex market, economic and geopolitical backdrop. Leveraging our vast client network, our broad product suite and improving investment results, we continue to drive higher demand for our capabilities. For the period, we garnered $16.7 billion of net long-term flows, which is a 6% annualized organic growth rate, marking our best quarter in over two years. Importantly, we were in net positive long-term inflows in each of our three regions across active and passive strategies and in both our institutional and retail channels. We ended the quarter with over $1.7 trillion in AUM, which was up 12% from the prior year, reaching a record high for Invesco. We generated positive operating leverage with revenues up over 3% from the first quarter, and we expanded our operating margin by over 270 basis points to 30.9%. This resulted in adjusted operating income growth in the second quarter that was in double-digits on both the sequential quarter and year-over-year basis. As mentioned, the market environment remained choppy in the quarter, and while we saw some broadening and increasing demand for risk assets, general uncertainty and continued higher interest rates have impacted client investment behavior and our business results. Notably, after an up and down April and May, most major equity indices rallied towards the end of the second quarter. U.S. markets continue to lead the way with the NASDAQ gaining 8%, followed by the S&P 500 increasing 4%. However, the theme of narrow market returns continued with the S&P 500 equal weighted index by contrast declining by 3% in the quarter. Equity returns outside the U.S. were mixed with the MSCI emerging markets up 4%, Asia up 2%, and Europe down 1%. Improvement in China's equity markets, which were up 6% in the quarter were a welcome bright spot. On the fixed income side of the market, the Bloomberg global ag index declined by 1% in the quarter, while most either major bond indices were relatively flat. All of that said, we have plenty of reasons to be optimistic that with increasing market and interest rate clarity, a broadening of participation will continue to take hold and investor appetite for more duration risk on and global oriented assets will increase. So moving on to Slide 3 of the presentation, we continue to believe that our advantageous market position and clarity of strategic focus provides us with the tools to deliver enhanced operating performance and returns for our shareholders. Specifically, we have built a strong global footprint with scale businesses in the U.S. and other key developed markets and a significant and unique Asia Pacific profile, which includes hard to replicate and a leading 20-year-old joint venture in China and 30 years of longevity in the growing Japanese market. We have also developed a diverse yet focused range of active investment strategies. This includes both public and private market strengths and a multi-asset profile that empowers Invesco to meet a range of client demands, provides us diversification to perform in various market cycles and allows us to adjust as secular changes continue to develop. One of those secular trends is the continued client appetite for ETFs. Here, again, we are extremely well positioned with a scaled and growing suite of capabilities. Our focus is on innovation and providing access to passive factor and active strategies. Our ETF franchise continues to gain market share globally, while accelerating its profitability and its overall contribution to the firm. Finally, a hallmark of Invesco is our leading distribution platform. It's an area of particular strength in the U.S. wealth management market, which is the world's largest asset channel and an area with significant growth potential, particularly given the democratization of certain asset classes like private markets. Our strategic focuses, which you can see in the middle of Slide 3 are predicated on prioritizing the intersection of market size and secular change with Invesco's unique position to drive growth in the highest opportunity regions, channels, and asset classes. As you expect, our top priority is investment performance, which is key to winning market share regardless of overall client demand of highest order is continuing to enhance the quality of our active equity strategies and thereby driving greater retention and net flows into this important segment. We have tightened elements of risk management and the relationship between investments, products and distribution has never been stronger. Our investment teams have started to put up much better performance numbers, which I'll highlight momentarily. An additional area of focus is on a profitable organic growth. A significant driver of this is through our focus on high demand, scalable investment capabilities and delivery vehicles. In this regard, we are continuing to work to improve the operating leverage and profitability of our fixed income and multi-asset capabilities on the asset side of things and ETFs and SMAs on the vehicle side. Furthermore, we have a focus on private markets. We have a very strong institutional footprint, which has been historically focused on real estate and private and alternative credit. We are now taking steps to bring those capabilities into the faster growing wealth management space, while continuing to tap into ongoing demand in institutional markets globally. More tactically, we're focused on taking next generation technology and deploying it through our platform at the enterprise distribution and investment levels. And finally, we are improving the financial flexibility of the firm. Strengthening the balance sheet and generating operating leverage as we continue to deliver better returns for our shareholders. These are the outcomes that we're seeking to achieve through the key performance indicators that are outlined on the right-hand side of Slide 3. They are also the themes at the forefront of today's discussion on second quarter results. So flipping forward to Slide 4. Against the backdrop of the aforementioned market conditions and Invesco's strategic priorities and strengths that I just outlined, you can see on this slide the key flow drivers across our investment capabilities. Our strong organic flow growth in the second quarter continued to be led by our global ETF franchise. During the period, we continued to gain market share in this segment, recording $12.8 billion in net long-term inflows, which represented a 13% annual organic growth rate. This was our highest growth ETF quarter in over two years, and we ended the period with a record high of $415 billion in long-term ETF AUM. Growth this quarter was led by our equity innovation suite, our factor-based equities and our fixed income bullet shares franchise. The QQQM is our fastest-growing ETF and is now the third largest fund on our platform. This innovative product leverages our QQQ popularity, but we earn a direct fee instead of the marketing benefits we received on the QQQ trust, which equates to around $200 million annually. We also saw strong growth from EMEA this quarter with over $5 billion of net inflows, and we recently broke through the $100 billion mark of ETF AUM in that region. Additionally, we continue to innovate to meet client needs, Invesco is one of the few global asset managers capable of servicing clients to one customizable frost regional ETFs for exacting exposures such as the recently launched sustainable energy ETF, which garnered $1.6 billion in assets at its launch in June. The continued advantage of ETFs are evident in both passive and active formats and across all channels creating even more opportunity for expansion in this space. Shifting to fixed income. We continue to believe that as investors gain greater clarity on inflation and Central Bank interest rate policy, they're going to move out of cash and extend their duration profiles of their fixed income allocations into a wider range of strategies. Though this anticipated shift may be more protracted than originally expected, we continue to see some green shoots. During the second quarter, client demand accelerated, and we garnered $1.6 billion in net long-term inflows into our active fundamental fixed income strategies, which is in addition to the $2 billion of fixed income ETF flows achieved. Active inflows were driven in part by municipal bond strategies delivered through our mutual funds and our SMA platforms. We ranked in the top five overall in munis and number two for high-yield munis, we're also well positioned in SMAs with over 50 strategies placed to more than 80 broker dealers in RA platforms. Our retail SMA offering has rapidly expanded to over $25 billion and has had an annual organic growth rate of 28%, making it one of the fastest growing in the industry. We're also positioned with fixed income strategies in our institutional channels globally. In this quarter, we had solid net inflows driven by investment grade strategies sourced in the Asian regions. We remain well positioned across the risk and duration fixed income asset classes and have plenty of reasons to be optimistic about our ability to capture flows as we continue to generate investment performance. Moving on to private markets. Here, we also maintained momentum in the second quarter, reporting net long-term inflows of $2.6 billion driven by the strength in our credit strategies, notably bank loans and CLOs. We also saw modest positive flows into direct lending as well as continued inflows into INCREF which is our non-exchange traded REIT focused on private real estate debt. This fund has maintained good momentum in the U.S. wealth management advisory space since its launch last year. It's important to note that our global real estate team has over $5 billion of dry powder to capitalize on opportunities emerging from the market dislocation of the last several quarters. Picking up on Asia Pacific managed assets, we generated exceptionally strong net long-term inflows of $6.7 billion in assets managed in this region. This was led by our China JV, where our net long-term inflows of $8.5 billion in the second quarter surpassed the full-year of 2022 and 2023 flows combined. These flows were driven by our strong performing fixed income and balanced strategies where demand return from investors seeking higher returning fixed income products given the low rate environment in China. We anticipate that this dynamic will continue to play out on the coming quarters given the evolving economic environment in the market. We also launched four new equity products this quarter in China, which added $200 million of flow during the period. Additionally, as part of a collaboration between our China JV and global ETF team, we launched in June, Europe's first ETF link to the ChiNext 50 Index, which is a fund with unique access to long-term growth potential in China. The ETF market in China has seen rapid growth recently, and we are uniquely positioned to gain share and be an early mover and innovator in this space. Picking up on multi-asset related capabilities. As noted, we saw modest net outflows attributable to lower fee quantitative strategies. And finally, the relative pressure on active fundamental equity flows did continue. However, as I have pointed out previously, we have seen moderation namely in the global, international, and emerging market segments. Net outflows in these strategies have slowed during the past several quarters to $1 billion to $2 billion in aggregate which is markedly lower than the 2022 quarterly peak outflows where we sold $6 billion. A continued bright spot in our active fundamental equity capabilities has been our global equity and income strategy, which is among the top selling active retail funds in the growing Japanese market. This fund delivered an incremental $1.2 billion of net inflows in the second quarter and its rapid rise in AUM has placed it in our top 10 active equity funds at Invesco. Overall, we're confident that the high quality active equity management will continue to be an area of significant portfolio allocations, and it's a reason that we are so acutely focused on investment quality and performance in this area. So moving on to Slide 5. This chart provides an alternative aggregation of our AUM and our flows to provide you with additional context on our results. From a geographic perspective, you can see that we delivered solid net long-term inflows across all three regions with particular strength in Asia Pacific, where we had over $10 billion sourced from clients in these markets. Strong growth in China was augmented by continued momentum in Japan, where we have seen institutional demand for fixed income, most notably investment grade as well as the continued retail demand for the aforementioned global equity and income strategy. It's important to note that this view of the Asia-Pacific region is a more holistic measure of the scale of our business than the previous slide. The AUM and flow numbers not only include the products that we manage in the region, but also the breadth of Invesco's other products managed globally that are sold into the Asia-Pacific market. An additional key takeaway from Slide 5 is depicted in the chart at the bottom center of the page. Here, you can see the significant improvement in return to positive net flows in our overall active investment strategies. This cuts across all asset classes, public and private markets. Furthermore, you'll note the graph on the bottom right of the page, the positive flows and strong improvement seen in our institutional channel. This is driven by demand pickup across both public and private credit. So moving forward to Slide 6 for an update on investment results. As I have reiterated several times this morning, investment performance is a top priority of our firm. This slide shows our overall results relative to benchmark and peers as well as our performance in key capabilities where information is readably comparable and more meaningful to driving results. Investment performance was solid in the second quarter, on a one, three and five year basis, overall performance improved incrementally from last quarter with 70%, 65% and 76%, respectively, of our AUM beating its benchmark. Additionally, on a one-year basis, we have improved, and we now have nearly 70% of our AUM in the top half of peers and 45% in the top quartile of peers. At the asset class level, we continue to have excellent fixed income performance across nearly all capabilities and time horizons, supporting our strong conviction and our ability to attract flows as investors deploy money into these strategies. Specifically, 92% of our fundamental fixed income capabilities are beating their benchmark with 83% of our AUM in the top half of peers on a five-year basis. We're acutely focused on improving fundamental equity performance and have been making progress here as well. Half of our funds are now performing above benchmark on a one-year basis, with 52% beating peers on a one and five-year basis. So hopefully, the overall additional context and the more detailed disclosures that we have shared today and last quarter have further clarified our results, outline the significant opportunities that we have before us and provided more clarity on our approach to capitalize on them over time. So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Allison to discuss our financial results for the quarter, and I look forward to your questions. Allison Dukes : All right. Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to begin on Slide 7 with our second quarter financial results. Total assets under management at the end of the second quarter were over $1.7 trillion, $53 billion or 3.2% higher than last quarter end and a record high for Invesco. Higher markets account for $27 billion of the increase, while net long-term inflows drove a $16.7 billion increase in AUM during the quarter. Of the $27 billion increase due to higher markets, $24 billion was driven by ETFs, including $21 billion by the QQQ. As Andrew noted, net long-term inflows were strong at $16.7 billion, which represented an organic growth rate of nearly 6%. We had long-term net inflows across most of our investment capabilities. ETF inflows, excluding the QQQ were $12.8 billion in the second quarter. APAC managed generated $6.7 billion in net inflows. Private markets drove $2.6 billion in net inflows and fundamental fixed income had $1.6 billion in net inflows. Partially offsetting this was $6.3 billion in fundamental equity net outflows during the quarter. Average assets under management grew $56 billion or 3.5% quarter-over-quarter to $1.67 trillion. Net revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin improved from the first quarter, and I'll cover the drivers of those improvements shortly. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.43 for the second quarter versus the prior quarter EPS of $0.33. We further strengthened the balance sheet during the second quarter by paying down the credit facility from $368 million drawn at the end of the first quarter to zero drawn at the end of the second quarter. We ended the quarter with net debt of nearly zero, and we're on track to remain at net debt of zero or better in the second half of this year. As a result, we do expect to resume share buybacks in the third quarter. Moving to Slide 8. As we've discussed in prior calls, secular shifts in client demand have altered our asset mix and net revenue yields as our broad set of capabilities has allowed us to capture evolving client product preferences. And this has been increasingly captured in our results. Our portfolio is better diversified today than four years ago, and our concentration risk and higher fee fundamental equities and multi-asset products has been reduced. These dynamics should portend well for future revenue growth and marginal profitability improvement. The firm is better positioned to navigate various market cycles, events and shifting client demand. One other element to note on this slide are the current net revenue yield trends. The ranges by capability are representative of where the net revenue yields have ranged over the past five quarters, and we note the net revenue yield drivers and where in the range, the yields have trended more recently. This should provide you better visibility on where current net revenue yields are running by capability. Turning to Slide 9. Net revenue of $1.1 billion in the second quarter was $33 million higher than the first quarter, a 3% increase and nearly unchanged from the second quarter of last year. The increase from last quarter was largely in line with a 3.5% increase in average AUM quarter-over-quarter. Investment management fees were $27 million higher than last quarter, driven by higher average AUM and partially offset by the aforementioned AUM mix shift. Performance fees were $16 million higher than the first quarter due to seasonality as we typically see an increase in performance fees in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter. The increase in performance fees was primarily driven by private real estate and our China JV business. Total adjusted operating expenses in the second quarter were $750 million, a decrease of $7 million or 1% from the first quarter. Compensation expense was $1 million lower than the prior quarter, the benefit from lower seasonal-related compensation expenses in the second quarter was offset by higher compensation related to higher revenues in the second quarter, including higher performance fee related comp. G&A was $7 million lower than the prior quarter as costs associated with our Alpha platform implementation increased from $7 million in the first quarter to $12 million in the second quarter, which was more than offset by lower professional related fees in the second quarter. Going forward, we continue to expect Alpha-related onetime implementation cost to be approximately $10 million per quarter for the remainder of 2024 with some fluctuation quarter-to-quarter. We'll continue to update our progress on the implementation and related costs as we progress through the implementation. On a year-over-year basis, total adjusted operating expenses were $12 million lower, adjusting for $27 million related to executive retirements and organizational change related expenses in the second quarter of last year largely driven by lower G&A expenses. Quarter-over-quarter positive operating leverage was 400 basis points, driving a $39 million or 13% increase in operating income and a 270 basis point improvement in our operating margin to 30.9%. The effective tax rate was 22.1% in the second quarter. We estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 25% for the third quarter of 2024. The actual effective tax rate can vary due to the impact of nonrecurring items on pretax income and discrete tax items. Now I'll finish on Slide 10. We continue to make progress on building balance sheet strength in the second quarter. At the end of the first quarter, we had $368 million drawn on our credit facility as we redeem the $600 million in senior notes that matured on January 30, and the first quarter is a seasonally high cash usage quarter. We ended the first quarter with net debt of $362 million. During the second quarter, we paid down the credit facility to zero and improved our net debt position to nearly zero. Both results were ahead of our expectations. These actions resulted in an improvement in our leverage ratios, and we're now down to a leverage ratio excluding the preferred stock of 0.28x, a significant improvement over the past several years. Given these results, we expect to maintain or improve our net debt position going forward. We're also in a position to begin a more regular stock buyback program in the third quarter. Initially, we expect to buy back around $25 million per quarter depending on market conditions. We expect our total payout ratio to move into the 50% to 60% range, which we will continually evaluate. To conclude, the resiliency and strength of our firm's net flow performance is evident again this quarter, and we continue to make progress on simplifying the organization and building a stronger balance sheet while also continuing to invest in areas of growth. We remain committed to driving profitable growth, a high level of financial performance and enhancing return of capital to shareholders. And with that, we'll open up the call to Q&A, if the operator would like to open it up. Operator : Sure. [Operator Instructions] Okay. And our first question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thank you. Just a couple of qualify. The fee rate range came down on ETFs and multi-assets. I just want to make sure that first bullet says, basically, that's a result of ongoing mix shift and not some actual fee adjustments, correct? Allison Dukes : That is correct, Glenn. We continue to see within both of those capability categories, just continued mix across the product spectrum there, no real fee adjustments. Glenn Schorr : Okay, cool. And then maybe just a little bit more color. You made two forward-leaning comments that were interesting. One was related to the green shoots for fixed income, I don't know if that was related to RFPs picking up? And the other one was on the APAC flows in China specifically, and you said you think this dynamic continues to play out. So I wonder if you could expand on those two comments. Thank you. Andrew Schlossberg : Yes. Maybe I'll start, Glenn, thanks for the questions. On the fixed income side, it's partially RFP volume. It's partially flow volume, it's partially demand that we're hearing towards longer-duration assets moving away from some of the short-term fixed income. And that's happening on both the retail and the institutional side of things. I don't know if you want to add anything on fixed income, I'll come back to that? Allison Dukes : No. Andrew Schlossberg : And then on Asia and China, in particular, yes, we're seeing very, very strong demand. Right now, it's been principally in the fixed income and fixed income plus, which is essentially balanced. A little less on the equity side. but the flows have been quite strong, and we think some of the developments in China on the economic side and some of the market reform are pretending well for client activity in China. Glenn Schorr : Thanks, Andrew. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to drill into the distribution and servicing fee dynamic. It seems as though this has been a trend towards maybe on a net basis, a bigger and bigger headwind from net distribution. Is this similar to what we're seeing on the fee rate side, where it has to do with mix shift and away from products that have some distribution revenue components and maybe such as ETFs, less of that benefit and therefore, somewhat sustainable? Allison Dukes : Good question. Good morning, Brennan. I would say maybe somewhat, but the way I would think about it and just keep in mind, last quarter, we had a real anomaly as it related to the proxy costs that you saw coming through both service and distribution fee revenue and then offset on the third-party side. And so I feel like you almost have to throw out last quarter a little bit. But as you look at the relationship across a series of quarters, I think it's important to focus on the relationship between service and distribution fees and third-party distribution contra revenue because there's such a pass-through between those two elements. And then looking at that as a percentage of management fees, it runs relatively consistent in that 13% to 14% range, which I think we're finding to be a better relationship than just third-party as a percentage of management fees. But I do think there is some element of that mix shift in there to focus on as you think about that relationship going forward. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks for that, Allison. And how should we be thinking about the lower professional related fees in G&A? I believe you said that's what drove G&A to be a bit lower here this quarter. Is that sustainable? Could you maybe give us a little color in thinking about that as a potential tailwind going forward? Allison Dukes : I don't think I would think of it as a tailwind so much as those types of expenses are going to vary quarter-to-quarter as you have everything from legal, consulting, outsource costs, implementation costs of various projects we've been trying to provide transparency into the alpha implementation, but that is, of course, not the only thing we're ever working on as we think about just our overall platform and system. So I wouldn't think of it as a tailwind, but you should expect a little bit of variability in that line item quarter-to-quarter. Travels in there, entertainment, client entertainment, all of it. Brennan Hawken : So just basically lumpy. Thanks for taking my question. Allison Dukes : Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Katz with TD Cowen. Your line is open. William Katz : Thank you very much. I was wondering if you could unpack in your comments around sort of diving a little bit more into retail democratization beyond maybe INREIT. What else are you working on? And are there any incremental distribution relationships that may be on the horizon? Andrew Schlossberg : Yes. Thanks, Bill. It's Andrew. I'll start. The most recent has been in real estate debt. And so that real estate credit fund was launched about a year ago. It's been added to two major wealth management platforms over that period of time, which is quite fast along with the several dozen of other related platforms for RIAs and the like. So between the real estate equity and the real estate debt funds, those are the two principal things we're focused on. We also have some alternative credit strategies in the market. But the progress on real estate debt and the demand from clients, not just here in the U.S. and in the wealth channels, but around the world has been quite strong. William Katz : Okay. Just as a follow-up, coming back to capital return. Thank you for the updated guidance. So as you think about strategically from here, is it now more of a capital return story as you normalize and grow earnings? Or is there an eye on potentially increasing M&A to maybe bulk up incremental growth, particularly in the alternative side. Just trying to understand how we should think about the durability of that capital return? Allison Dukes : Sure. I'd say our comments there are really consistent with our past comments. It's not one or the other, but we remain -- we want to be well positioned so that we can be opportunistic for both. And given some of the balance sheet challenges of prior years, it's been hard to be opportunistic. Now we're in a position where we want to really stay focused on returning capital to shareholders and remaining open to where we may have the opportunity to fill in some capabilities consistent with past conversations around that. So getting the balance sheet back to a good, healthy place gives us the opportunity to return more capital to shareholders consistent with earnings improvement, and we're going to stay focused on earnings improvement. We're going to look for opportunities to reinvest in ourselves to drive that organic growth. I think we've demonstrated, we certainly have the ability to do that with the breadth of our organic growth over the last five years. But we remain open-minded and thoughtful as we see any opportunities to fill in gaps that exist on the platform today. You want to build cash and return capital to shareholders both end. William Katz : Excellent. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Your line is open. Craig Siegenthaler : Thanks. Good morning everyone. We wanted to come back to the 6% organic growth rate in the quarter. Given the sizable ETF inflows versus net redemptions in fundamental equities, how did organic revenue growth trend relative to 6%? Allison Dukes : How is the organic revenue growth trending relative to the 6%? I just want to make sure I'm understanding your question. Craig Siegenthaler : Yes, Allison. So on an organic revenue basis and it's tough for us to do it, because we just have by kind of major asset class. We don't have the underlying funds. But I wanted your perspective on kind of how the organic revenue growth was trending relative to the 6% AUM organic growth? Allison Dukes : I see. So what I would try to do, I'd point you back to the disclosures on Slide 8 where we've tried to really narrow and give you more and more detail and as much precision as we can to help guide exactly that. We narrowed the net revenue yield ranges that you'll see there. And in the commentary on the far right, tried to give you even further direction around where we're trending in that. So there's a fair amount of precision relative to AUM. I think in any given quarter, obviously, our focus is to drive that organic revenue growth. And that's what we've been highly focused on. It has been -- how it's been challenging in recent years, given the pressure on fundamental equities and the trade on the ETF side, as you note. I would say it's trending better, it trends almost neutral at this point in a lot of different ways. But I think you can start to track it, and you should be able to start to track it much more closely with these new disclosures. Andrew Schlossberg : Yes, I would only add that some of the headwinds that we've been facing over the last couple of years, a couple of them are starting to abate a bit. In particular, the flows out in Asia and in particular, China and flows into alternative credit like bank loan are net positive towards what you were asking and Allison was describing. Craig Siegenthaler : Thank you. Just for my follow-up, it's on the State Street Alpha implementation. So when will Alpha integration expenses start to go down? I think you have that $10 million target, but I wanted to understand when they would start to go down. And when do you think they'll be totally going? Allison Dukes : So I think the best way to answer that question as it relates to implementation is just project timing overall. And we will continue to be in implementation mode through '25 and really through '26. We expect to transition our AUM onto the Alpha platform in a series of waves and those ways are going to begin in the fourth quarter of this year, and then they'll run through 2025. So that implementation is really we're in this testing phase. We're in the learning phase. We're really working through planning for these various ways. And I think implementation will run through at least '25, and then we will be working on decommissioning testing and running parallel through '26 on the other side of that. Craig Siegenthaler : Thank you, Allison. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Patrick Davitt : Hey, good morning everyone. I want to move back to the fee rate trajectory, obviously, a little bit better in the quarter, but I imagine the April drawdown was probably a bit of a drag on it. So could you speak to the monthly cadence through June? And maybe how you feel about the 3Q run rate given how you exited 2Q? Thank you. Allison Dukes : Yes. I think I focused less on the intra-quarter monthly and maybe more a little bit on the exit rate probably to get at your question because within the month, within the weeks, within the days, it could vary so much as markets fluctuate so much. And I think, hopefully, also you've seen in the additional disclosures in the back, just further detail around the various market indices that really impact us. Given our global footprint, we have such a diversified set of exposures that you can't really manage which market is moving in what direction on any given day. So I would point to the exit rate, which the exit rate for the second quarter was around 25.2 basis points. So a touch lower than the average net revenue yield for the quarter. Of course, even in the first few weeks of July, we continue to see puts and takes in all of that. So it's very difficult to predict exactly where it would end up. I continue to come back to, we're focused on driving revenue. We're focused on driving organic revenue. And net revenue yield is simply a function. It's math of where the flows are coming from. The organic flow rate of 6% is something we're quite proud of, and I think a testament to the breadth of our platform and how aligned it is with client demand. Andrew Schlossberg : I think what we've all seen in the markets over the last very short period of time in the last week or two, some broadening out, which I think is something we've all been looking forward to for a long time. And one of the reasons why we continue to try to outline the diversity of our range of assets and investment capabilities, and if that prolongs, that should be a net positive for us. Patrick Davitt : Excellent. Thanks. And then a broader question. It's obviously nice to see the big recovery in China flows, but the political rhetoric is obviously getting pretty heated with China, and it seems both parties, it will be a pretty popular punching bag. So I know it's tough to gain these things out for sure, but what assurances do you have? Or could you give that the JV would be safe on a broader trade war between the U.S. and China? Thanks. Andrew Schlossberg : Yes. It's a complex one, obviously, to answer. One thing I'll remind you about on our China JV is that it's a domestic-to-domestic business. So all of the assets we manage are for individual investors in that market and all of the assets are managed in that market. And so it's a really focused business and our partner there is -- the relationship is very strong and very resilient. I don't know if you'd add anything, Allison? Allison Dukes : Yes. I think I'd just underscore that by saying that the flows and the performance of the JV are entirely dependent on the performance of the Chinese domestic economy. So to the extent the trade war is challenging for the domestic economy there that would put pressure on overall AUM through those both flows and market performance there. But that, likewise, probably would put some pressure on our investments in the United States as well. So think about it less as a political football and more highly dependent on the strength of the Chinese economy. Patrick Davitt : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Alexander Blostein : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. I was hoping we could dig into the strategy around Invesco's ETF business a little more broadly. So you guys continue to see really good growth there, and that's been consistent and it's nice to see you broaden out a little bit. But to your point earlier, the fee rate continues to sort of shift lower here. So as you look further out, can you maybe walk us through areas where you're seeing sort of the best opportunity for Invesco to broaden your ETF for gaining growth and even more? And perhaps talk a little bit about some of the existing and new initiatives that could maybe stabilize and improve the fee rate as you look further out. Andrew Schlossberg : Yes. Thanks for the question. And yes, the growth has broaden down. I think we have something like 10 ETFs just in the U.S. that have had more than a $1 billion of inflows in the past six months year-to-date. So the business is starting to broaden out. Some of the key growth strategies that we have, obviously, as the market starts to adopt active ETFs, especially here in the U.S. market. That's a key area of focus. We were one of the early movers in active ETFs. We have a little over $10 billion in that space, but more importantly, we have around $30 billion of assets that are affiliated with our investment teams playing some role in that investment strategy. And we think that's going to continue to grow as the vehicle remains popular, but more than passive gets put into those vehicles either through fundamental or quantitative techniques or both. The other element of growth for us is beyond the United States. And we talked a little bit about our expansion and our growth in Europe, which is now over $100 billion in AUM. And you can see the demand starting to grow throughout Asia, China, Japan, in particular. So geographically, we feel like there's earlier days in some of those markets outside of the U.S. And then our lineup, which has been historically heavy on equities, one of the areas of greatest growth has been in the fixed income space. And we continue to think that passive fixed income alongside fundamental is going to be a pretty significant area of growth going forward. And then as alternative strategies, in particular commodities continue to, or find favor back in the market and things like alternative credit and bank loans continue to grow in demand. We're very well placed in those spaces. So the growth has been good. I think the growth can continue to be as strong and just more diverse as we go ahead. Alexander Blostein : Great. Thanks for that. Andrew Schlossberg : The last thing I'll just say on net flows, but on profitability, the ETF business continues to scale well and the profit margin expansion from that business and its contribution continues to go from strength-to-strength. So we have a very scaled platform that does deliver accretive profitability. Alexander Blostein : Great. Thanks Andrew that's helpful. Allison, one for you just to round out the G&A discussion. A couple of puts and takes as you highlighted earlier in the quarter. But zooming out kind of what are the expectations for maybe G&A for the full-year and as Alpha continues to kind of linger through 2025, any sort of early thoughts on G&A outlook for 2025 as well? Thanks. Allison Dukes : Sure. I think I'd go back to our guidance for the year, which was we've said all things being equal back on December 31 with AUM at December 31, but overall expenses would be in the $3 billion range. Obviously, we've done quite a bit better in terms of AUM since that guidance, and you can see that impact overall on comp expense, in particular, given the Alpha guidance of around $10 million plus or minus in terms of implementation costs each quarter, all else being relatively consistent and equal and not a lot of puts and takes other than back to Brennan's question, I mean, things are a bit lumpy quarter-to-quarter, and I just can't predict the lumpiness. I'd come back to comp to revenue. And I know I'm answering more than just G&A, but we manage expenses in totality. Comp to revenue is trending above 42% for the year. I think it will be closer to 43% for the year. And the rest, I would say, relatively consistent, absent some lumpiness, but I can't predict quarter-to-quarter. So not entirely precise, but about as precise as I can get, and I wish I knew with real precision as well, but I think that gives you a reasonable expectation for the year. Alexander Blostein : Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. Allison Dukes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open. Daniel Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. Andrew, I wanted to follow-up on one of your comments from, I guess, was Slide 3 where you talked about profitable organic growth. I mean, that seems like something you would always be focused on. So curious if there's anything more behind that in terms of what's maybe you're looking to exit certain RFPs or businesses? Or is it just more prospectively like what business you're looking to take on versus maybe what you might have done before? Andrew Schlossberg : Yes. I think that a couple of the areas that I called out and I'd emphasize further, and thanks for the question, picking up on what I just said about ETFs, the ETF vehicle and the SMA vehicle as we're growing in size, they scale well. And so our focus on profitability there is continuing to utilize technology more, continuing to drive the expense base or at least hold the expense base flat as we continue to grow and see flows and revenues generated from those vehicle choices. And then in fixed income, and in multi-asset. About a year ago, we brought together multiple investment teams in those two respective areas. And we believe as those capabilities continue to be in demand from clients, similar to the vehicles that I just described, they scale well. And we feel like we have a pretty complete product range and a pretty complete set of investment capabilities that we can just hopefully layer on assets and revenues to expand profitability. So that's what we mean by that specific area. Daniel Fannon : Okay. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, I was hoping to get an update on the MassMutual relationship in terms of what them helping you see them build your alternative franchise and then also tapping into your product set into their broader distribution force, if there's been any update there? Andrew Schlossberg : Yes. I mean it continues to be a really strong relationship that we value tremendously. As we've mentioned in the past, and it continues to be a significant focus for both us and them is growing out the private market set of capabilities. And currently, through their general account and otherwise, they have 3x to 4x the amount of capital invested in our strategies that we hold on our balance sheet. And that's been a really important part of the seating and co-investing of some of the strategies that I talked about before that are starting to grow the wealth management platforms, in particular in real assets. In terms of -- we continue to progress and grow through the traditional insurance channels and offer our products and capabilities, we're one of the leading providers on MassMutual's platform, and that just continues to be an ongoing focus of ours. And that's across the complete set of investment capabilities, but in particular, things like our model portfolios and ETFs where we see there's growing demand and significant opportunity for Invesco. Allison Dukes : Yes. I would just -- I mean they continue to be great partners investing across a variety of capabilities from our real estate to our CLO capabilities, in particular and just strong partners as we evaluate future product launches. And as Andrew noted, they've really amplified our ability to leverage our own balance sheet to get products to market faster. Daniel Fannon : Okay, thank you. Andrew Schlossberg : And to utilize the capital for other sources and needs as well. Operator : Okay. We have time for one more question. Our last question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Kenneth Worthington : Great. Thank you for taking the questions, squeezing me in. You saw a nice recovery in institutional flows. Can you size the institutional pipeline? I think you used to give one not funded and tell us a little bit about the major buckets like factor and solutions that haven't come up in conversation thus far. Allison Dukes : Sure. I said the institutional pipeline is pretty consistent with last quarter. It stays around this kind of $14 billion, $15 billion range. I think what we continue to find is the pipeline is an okay but not excellent measure of what we can expect, just given the breadth of our flows that come in outside of the pipeline. So you saw the strength in flows over the last quarter or so and the pipeline has been relatively consistent over the last few quarters seems to be about 30% of our flows that come from the pipeline. Fee rate continues to be on the high side there as well. As we've said for a long time, it ranges in the 25 to 35 basis point range, and we continue to see it really on the relatively high side. So I think no real change, one way or the other. It continues also to be well diversified across regions, and we see, I think really the strength of our institutional flows coming from a variety of regions as well. Andrew Schlossberg : Ken, the only thing I'd add is, as we've said on previous calls, I think things have slowed down by about -- this is for the industry, by about a quarter or two on fundings. I think some of the progress we're seeing is that maybe that pace is picking up a little bit. The strengths, in particular, on public and private credit. And as Allison said, it's really cross-regional, but I'd say Asia and Europe, in particular, seem to have picked up at a greater pace. Allison Dukes : Current sales really picked up in the quarter relative to the prior five quarters. Redemptions are a little bit better, but it's really the strength is really driven by these gross sales. Kenneth Worthington : Awesome, thank you very much for the color. Andrew Schlossberg : Thanks, Ken. Greg Ketron : Yes, operator, we do have time for another question. Operator : Okay. And our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Michael Cyprys : Great, thanks so much for squeezing me in. Just a question on Japan. I was hoping you could elaborate on your footprint and business in Japan today. Hoping you could talk a little bit about how that business has grown. And then looking out, maybe you could talk about your outlook and how you see the opportunity evolving in that marketplace just given the shift in the market out of deflation and some of the recent regulatory changes to expand the NISA tax-exempt accounts, where -- what sort of products and strategies do you expect to see growth evolving in that marketplace and also the opportunity for ETFs as well? Thank you. Andrew Schlossberg : Yes, it's a great question, thanks for that. Let me start. Our profile is, as I mentioned, is -- we've been there for a long time. It's about 30 years old. We have around $60 billion of assets managed for Japanese investors. It's a mix of insurance, institutional and retail wealth platforms, the greatest area of growth in the last little while has been in retail where we've actually -- we were talking before about this global equity income strategy. So it's been a good long-term business for us that's really accelerated in the last year or so. With, and for some of the reasons that you described, we remain really optimistic about the reforms and changes that are happening there, not just NISA, but the overall markets, inflation starting to come into play, more excitement that we've seen up close and personnel from investors getting re-educated and re-interested into the equity markets. ETF is going to be an area of increased demand. And we're starting to further build out our position there in ETFs. But it's traditionally been a fixed income market for us and an equity market as well. Private markets are also starting to pick up. So it's really across the piece. And we have a really, really developed position and brand and reputation there. Michael Cyprys : Great. Thank you so much. Greg Ketron : Operator, we do have time for one more question. Operator : Okay. And the next question and our last question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brian Bedell : Great, thanks. Thanks very much for squeezing me in. Just coming back, maybe, Andrew, to a comment you made earlier in the presentation about the focus on performance and the fundamental equities. Clearly, that's the most accretive area from a net revenue yield perspective. Can you talk about how you're leveraging the improved performance in the sales process across the franchise for fundamental equities and any conviction around getting back to sort of flow neutral, maybe aside from the developing market fund? And then on the active ETF side, I realize that's still very small, but if there's any potential to grow that relative to mutual funds, might that actually improve the ETF fee rate of the 14 to 16 basis points, if you have any traction there? Andrew Schlossberg : Yes. Let me start with the back end of the question, and then I'll go to the front. Yes, we definitely see demand picking up in the active ETF space. Right now, it's been largely into active fixed income and we launched some new strategies that were options-oriented strategies on equities, but that's driving off of more passive benchmarks. I think in time, fundamental active strategies, or some combination of fundamental and quantitative active strategies are going to find their way into the active ETF space. And we're very much in the development stage of that right now. And so I think that's something to watch over the next couple of years. In the more short run on improving our net flow rate, it is going to get driven in the first instance by improved investment performance and we are starting to see that, in particular, in the domestic equity categories, U.S. as well as other developed markets around the world. But it's also going to need to come with some more demand from clients. And that we really haven't fully seen yet redeveloped in the U.S. wealth market. Every day, we're focused on it. Our sales team is working closely with our product design teams and our investment teams both on the retention side where there's performance improvement that we need to be in front of clients with, but also growing the gross sales rate in the marketplace. So I think, look, I think the performance is improving and that's a significant step in the right direction that we expect going forward. Allison Dukes : I would just add to that. I mean we're focused on outperforming the industry as best we can there. Industry expectations given the secular challenges and the shifts we continue to see from active to passive and the industry expectations are not for strong inflows when it comes to fundamental equity. That said, we're looking to outperform in every aspect. And so as Andrew noted, we're highly focused on investment performance and where we can narrow those outflows and turn it into something neutral. And of course, we would ideally love to be in inflows but we're going to focus on taking every inch we can there and really the building blocks to return that to a more stable position. In the meantime, I think we've been able to demonstrate the incredible strength across every other capability that we have, and that's really what's delivering that profitable growth and we're optimistic. I mean our expectation is we can continue to create the operating margin improvement from here, and we remain focused on every element of that. Andrew Schlossberg : And as I said before, I think the broadening out of the markets, potentially into value markets, small mid-cap non-U.S. I mean we have very strong investment performance in those areas. So with some pockets of demand returning, we're cautiously optimistic. Brian Bedell : That's great color. Thank you very much. Andrew Schlossberg : Okay. So in closing, I really want to mention that, hopefully, it came through that we're well positioned to help clients navigate the impact of evolving market dynamics and subsequent changes that are happening in their portfolios. As market sentiment improves, this should really translate to even greater scale, performance and improve profitability. And given the work we've done to strengthen our ability to anticipate, understand and meet the evolving client needs, I could say I'm very excited for the future of Invesco. I want to thank everybody for joining the call today, and please continue to reach out to our Investor Relations team for any additional questions. We appreciate your interest in Invesco and look forward to speaking with everybody again soon. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. You may all disconnect at this time.",

Andrew Schlossberg, President and CEO; and Allison Dukes, Chief Financial Officer, will present our results this morning, and then, we'll open up the call for questions. I'll now turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Schlossberg : Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be speaking with you today. We continued our positive momentum this quarter, executing across several strategically important areas of our business and finishing this quarter with record long-term AUM, continued robust net long-term inflows, improved operating leverage, a stronger balance sheet and higher return of capital to shareholders. We achieved this despite continued volatility globally. U.S. markets ended the quarter with strong equity returns even though we saw high intra-quarter market fluctuation as ongoing geopolitical concerns, coupled with mixed signals drove cautious investor sentiment. Long-awaited Federal Reserve cuts commenced by the end of the quarter, a new stimulus to China was announced and Japanese policymakers struck a less hawkish tone. All factors that helped us assuage concerns and a drive a rally into quarter end as investors began to rotate money off the sidelines and into some risk assets. As a result, we began to see some broadening of investor demand in both the equity and fixed income markets. Conversely, the Chinese markets remain challenging for most of the period and fixed income appetite waned mid-quarter due to a rebound in bond yields, which drove industry redemptions. However, the recent stimulus drove a strong equity rally late in September with only a few trading days to have a material impact on our quarterly returns. Turning to Page 3. As we discussed last quarter, we maintained that our advantageous market position and clearly defined strategic focus gives us conviction in our ability to deliver enhanced operating performance and returns for our shareholders across various market conditions. I'll review specific areas of third quarter performance momentarily, but I first wanted to highlight a few of the areas of meaningful and measurable progress in relation to our strategic priorities and the key performance drivers noted on the right-hand side of this page. First, this quarter, we leveraged our global client network, our extensive product suite and improving investment performance to draw strong net long-term inflows of $16.5 billion or 5.2% annualized organic growth rate. Importantly, we achieved positive long-term organic flow growth from each of our three regions, led by Asia Pacific at 9%, EMEA at 5% and Americas at 4%. At the asset class of vehicle delivery levels, we continue to see strong flows and market share gains and scalable capabilities, including fundamental fixed income, SMAs and ETFs. In each of these areas, we continue to see opportunities to increase operating leverage and profitability. Additionally, within private markets, we're building momentum in wealth management channels, an extension of our historically strong institutional heritage. Second, we ended the period with a record setting $1.8 trillion of total AUM, an increase of 5% over last quarter and a 21% increase from the prior year. Third, we again generated positive operating leverage in the quarter. We grew adjusted operating income by 4% and drove over 70 basis points of operating margin improvement from last quarter. We're improving the -- fourth, we're improving the financial flexibility of the firm, strengthening the balance sheet, enhancing capital returns to shareholders. Specifically, we met our zero net debt goal and executed $25 million of share buybacks during the quarter. As you can see, we are acutely focused on our strategic priorities and driving profitable growth. We have good reason to be optimistic given our performance of what was a choppy operating environment globally this quarter. As market breadth continues to gain its footing, we are exceedingly well positioned to benefit. We have the strategic and operational clarity required and exceptional talent across the company to continue to execute quarter-by-quarter. Moving on to Slide 4. Let me expand a bit more on the third quarter asset flows results across our investment capabilities. Our growth continues to be led by our ETF platform, which had organic long-term inflows of $17.7 billion, or 16% on an annualized basis. This was among the highest ETF growth quarters in our history. Flows in the U.S. market continued to be led by factor based equity strategies, our equity NASDAQ Innovation Suite and fixed income BulletShares. We also saw strong growth from the EMEA region with nearly $5 billion of net inflows. We continue to innovate in the quarter, launching five new products in the U.S. and one in EMEA with a focus on extending our active ETF lineup. We feel very well positioned to continue to gain market share and use our scale to drive profitability across both passive and active ETF strategies. Shifting to fundamental fixed income. We garnered nearly $6 billion in net long-term inflows in the quarter or an 8% annualized organic growth rate, marking our best quarterly results in the past three years and 3 times our flow volume from last quarter. With the Fed now moving more aggressively, tailwinds have declined -- decline technically have been strong, and we have seen investors adding duration to lock in yields. Institutional flows were the main driver for us this quarter, comprising 70% of our volume. We recorded sizable new investment grade mandates globally with particularly high demand in the Asia Pacific region. U.S. wealth management flows were also strong, led by our municipal bond strategies. This was in large part driven across our SMA platform, which continues to expand rapidly with AUM reaching nearly $27 billion or a 45% increase over the past year. With our continued strong investment performance across the fixed income risk and duration spectrum, we remain very optimistic about our ability to continue to capture fixed income flows and money increasingly rotating into these asset class -- asset classes. Shifting to private markets, which in aggregate had flat slow growth in the quarter, leading the category though is our real estate capabilities, which recorded positive net inflows of $1.2 billion in the quarter. Growth was led by INCREF, which is our real estate debt strategy, targeting the wealth management channel. This fund was launched last year and has steadily gained momentum in the wealth space and it has now distributed through several key platforms, including adding one of the largest U.S. wealth managers late in the third quarter. These developments complement our significant real estate presence in institutional markets. I'll also note that we have over $5 billion of dry powder to capitalize on emerging opportunities. Within alternative credit, we've recorded net outflows driven by bank loans, particularly in our ETF. Moving on to Asia Pacific. On a managed basis in the region, we recorded modest outflows of $800 million. Conversely, and as I mentioned earlier, flows sourced from Asia Pacific clients were quite strong at $5 billion in the quarter. This highlights how we're leveraging our broad product suite globally to meet demand across this important region. Specifically, we had very strong inflows in Japan for the quarter, driven by continued success in our global equity and income strategy, which generated $1.2 billion in net flows and is among the top selling active retail funds in the growing Japanese asset management market. Institutional activity was also strong in Japan with inflows in our investment grade fixed income products. This was offset by some outflows in locally managed Japanese equity strategies. In China, market volatility reigned for the third quarter, particularly in fixed income, where we reported some outflows after a strong second quarter. During the period, we were pleased to launch four equity ETFs through our China JV. ETFs are a fast growing part of our China business and build on our strength in the U.S. and EMEA, and we anticipate this vehicle type will continue to see strong demand. At a macro level in China, we're encouraged by the government's recent focus on economic stimulus. We have seen some positive effects of this over the past few weeks and we believe that continued development should ultimately be very helpful for our business, particularly for equities, even if there is some volatility in the near term. Our business profile and our prospects in the Asia Pacific region remained very strong, led by our well established China JV, our long presence in Japan, and our recently announced JV in India. Turning to our multi-asset related capabilities. We saw modest net inflows in the quarter, driven by quantitative strategies. Finally, the relative pressure on fundamental equity flows continued in the third quarter. However, as I pointed out previously, we have seen some moderation over time in the important global, international and emerging market segments. Net outflows in these strategies have slowed during the past several quarters to approximately $1 billion to $2 billion per quarter, remaining marginally lower than 2022's quarterly peak outflows of $6 billion. Specifically, outflows in our emerging markets equity strategy has been particularly -- or partially offset by continued strong inflows of our aforementioned global equity and income strategy, as well as small cap equities across multiple markets. While asset flows in our fundamental equity capabilities remain below our long-term expectations, AUM has benefited from market gains and stands 15% higher than this time last year. Our investment leadership team to continues to focus on driving high quality alpha, upgrading our talent bench, and strengthening our risk management tools. Regardless of client demand, our focus remains on gaining market share in the fundamental equity categories in which we compete. Moving on to Slide 5. We provide an alternative aggregation to our AUM and flows to provide additional context for our performance. I've covered most of the key highlights around the broad strength and results of our diversified profile by geography, investment approach and channel. But one additional item that I will point out is at the bottom right section of the slide, where you can see the continued positive net inflows coming into our institutional channel. We're beginning to see higher levels of money in motion, particularly in fixed income and greater overall client expansion across the firm. Moving on to Slide 6. This slide summarizes our overall investment performance relative to benchmarks and peers, as well as our performance and key capabilities where information is readily comparable and more meaningful to driving results. Achieving first quartile investment performance is a top priority, and we're making progress on this front. On a one and three year basis, we've increased the percentage of our AUM in the top quartile of peers with over 50% of our funds now hitting that mark for one year and 43% over three years. Further, 71% of our AUM is beating its respective benchmark on a five year basis with 42% in the top quartile. We continue to have excellent fixed income performance across nearly all capabilities and time horizons. This supports the conviction we have in our ability to track flows as investors deploy money into these strategies. Of note, 64% of our fundamental fixed income capabilities are in the top quartile of peers on a one year basis, with 70% beating their respective benchmarks. Over five years, 81% of our funds are in the top half of peers with three quarter beating their benchmarks. We are especially focused on improving fundamental equity performance, and we continue to make incremental progress this quarter. We've improved the percentage of our AUM into top quartile peers across each time period shown here with 28% in the top quartile for one and five years and 24% over three years. Additionally, on a five year basis, we now have 61% of our AUM in the top half of peers. With that, I'm going to leave it here and turn the call over to Allison to discuss our financial results for the quarter, and I look forward to your questions. Allison Dukes : Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to begin on Slide 7. The third quarter financial results. Total assets under management at the end of the third quarter was $1.8 trillion or $80 billion and 5% higher than last quarter end and a record high for Invesco. We also had record high long-term assets under management of $1.3 trillion, an increase of 6% over last quarter. Higher markets accounted for $50 billion of the increase, while net long-term inflows drove a $16.5 billion increase in assets under management during the quarter. Of the $50 billion increase due to higher markets, $29 billion were driven by our ETF and index capabilities, including $5 billion by the QQQ. Fundamental equity AUM increased $13 billion and fundamental fixed income AUM increased $6 billion as well due to higher markets. As Andrew noted, net long-term inflows were strong once again at $16.5 billion, which represented organic growth of over 5%. ETF and index capabilities, excluding the QQQ led the way on long-term net inflows totaling $18 billion in the third quarter. Fundamental fixed income capabilities generated $6 billion in net inflows. Partially offsetting this was $6.3 billion in fundamental equity net outflows during the quarter. Average AUM increased $73 billion, a growth rate of over 4% quarter-over-quarter to $1.7 trillion at quarter end. Net revenue, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin all improved from the second quarter, and I'll cover the drivers of that shortly. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.44 for the third quarter versus prior quarter EPS of $0.43. We further strengthened the balance sheet during the third quarter. We ended the quarter in a net cash position with cash and cash equivalents exceeding debt better than our goal of zero net debt. We also resumed share buybacks in the third quarter, repurchasing $25 million during the quarter, and we expect to continue buying back shares on a regular basis going forward. Moving to Slide 8. As we noted in prior calls, secular shifts and client demand have altered our asset mix and net revenue yields as our broad set of capabilities has allowed us to capture evolving client product preferences, which has been increasingly reflected in our results. Our portfolio is better diversified today than five years ago, and our concentration risk and higher fee fundamental equity and multi-asset products has been reduced. The firm is increasingly better positioned to navigate various market cycles, events and shifting client demand. As we noted last quarter, we have included current net revenue yields -- current net revenue yield trends on the slide. The ranges by capability are representative of where the net revenue yield has ranged over the past five quarters, and we note the net revenue yield drivers and where in the range the yields have trended more recently. We're seeking to provide you better visibility on current net revenue yield by capabilities. To provide context for the net revenue yield trend during the third quarter, our overall net revenue yield was 25.3 basis points. The exit net revenue yield was 25 basis points, 0.3 basis points lower due to continued mix shift during the quarter. Turning to Slide 9. Net revenue of $1.1 billion in the third quarter was $18 million higher than the second quarter, a 2% increase and slightly higher than the third quarter of last year. Investment management fees were $33 million higher than last quarter and $40 million higher than the third quarter of last year. The increases were driven by higher average AUM, partially offset by the AUM mix shift previously noted. Performance fees were $14 million lower than the second quarter due to seasonality as we typically see a decrease in performance fees in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. Total adjusted operating expenses in the third quarter were $756 million, a slight increase of $6 million or less than 1% from the second quarter. This was also a slight increase over the prior year when taking into account the $39 million related to the organizational change expenses that occurred last year. Compensation was $6 million lower than the prior quarter, mainly due to higher performance fee related compensation last quarter. As we reported in our GAAP operating results, we took a one-time non-cash acceleration of $148 million in expense, resulting from changes to the retirement criteria related to vesting of currently outstanding long-term awards. This is a one-time acceleration of compensation expense for outstanding long-term awards for employees that meet newly defined eligibility criteria for retirement. The change will reduce the recent volatility we have experienced in compensation expense due to retirements. Over the prior six quarters, retirement expense related to the acceleration of long-term awards was nearly $60 million and it vary meaningfully quarter-to-quarter. The changes to the criteria for retirement brings us more in line with the market for these types of plans and better aligns us with how most companies account for the expenses associated with the acceleration of long-term awards at retirement. G&A was $11 million higher than the prior quarter. Costs associated with our Alpha platform implementation increased from $12 million in the second quarter to $15 million in the third quarter, and professional related fees were higher versus the prior quarter. As the implementation of Alpha continues to ramp up, we expect Alpha related one-time implementation cost to be closer to $15 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. We will continue to update our progress and related costs as we move forward with the implementation. Quarter-over-quarter, positive operating leverage was 100 basis points, driving a $13 million or 4% increase in operating income and a 70 basis point improvement in our operating margin to 31.6%. Our effective tax rate was 21.8% in the third quarter. We estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate will be near the lower end of our historic range of 23% to 25% for the fourth quarter of 2024. The actual effective rate can vary due to the impact of non-recurring items on pre-tax income and discrete tax items. I'll wrap up on Slide 10. As I noted earlier, we continue to make progress on building balance sheet strength in the third quarter. We ended the quarter in a net cash position with cash and cash equivalents exceeding debt by $155 million better than our goal of zero net debt. We ended the quarter with no draw on our credit facility. Our leverage ratios continue to improve, and we're now down to a leverage ratio excluding the preferred stock of 0.26 times, a significant improvement over the past several years. We resumed share buybacks in the third quarter, buying back $25 million or 1.5 million shares during the quarter. We expect to continue a more regular share buyback program going forward, repurchasing around $25 million in the fourth quarter, depending on market conditions. We further anticipate a total payout ratio, including common dividends and share buybacks, will move closer to 60%, which we expect will continue in 2025 as we continually evaluate our capital return levels. To conclude, the resiliency and strength of our firm's net flow performance is evident again this quarter, and we continue to make progress on simplifying the organization, building a stronger balance sheet, while continuing to invest in areas of growth. We remain committed to driving profitable growth, high level of financial performance and enhancing return of capital to shareholders. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Andrew, you spoke to the stimulus in China not really impacting the third quarter, but that you've seen some positive effects over the past few weeks. Could you maybe provide a bit more specificity to that. What have you seen and how should we be thinking about the potential impact of this stimulus on IGW? Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah. Hey, Brennan. Thanks. Look, it's early days in China, and we know how much volatility exists in that marketplace. The stimulus, I think, obviously, we saw what happened in markets, and that's good for our business, that's good for investor sentiment. I think what we've seen mostly is a mix shift going on. So I think what had predominantly been earlier this year and the end of last year, a focus on fixed income is starting to shift a bit more towards the equity side of things or the fixed income plus, we call it, which is a balanced portfolio. I think it's also important to remember that the mix of our business at IGW and in the Chinese market is more skewed towards fixed income and balance. So our IGW business is about 30% equities, 30% fixed income, 20% balance, and 20% money market. So we expect to see -- I think demand improved, but it's early days to speculate too much. Brennan Hawken : Got it. Thanks for that. That's helpful. And then, Allison, you have effectively delevered the balance sheet really well and it's certainly encouraging to see the buyback restart. But I'm curious, if you considered rather than buying back common approach MassMutual to see whether or not you could do a buyback program for the preferreds. When you talk to investors, the preferreds are one of the big issues and executing on that type of buyback could effectively continue the delevering efforts that you guys have done so well in the past few years. Allison Dukes : Thanks, Brennan. Yes. We have ongoing conversations with MassMutual about the preferred. It is a non-call instrument, as you know, and they own 100% of it. So it is certainly with negotiated conversation and one that given the duration of that piece of paper and the liabilities that they were against it, it's not a straightforward exercise to think about any opportunity that might exist to repurchase any element of that. Certainly top of mind for us and something we've been talking about for years now, but not straightforward, not simple and one that I think they certainly understand as well as they are, as you know, our largest common shareholder and take quite a bit of attention into how that preferred impacts from both sides of the equation as well. In the meantime, our strategy has been, and as you noted, to successfully delever around that preferred instrument everywhere we can. And I think, we\u2019ve done a nice job doing that. We\u2019ve got a little bit further to go, the next maturity isn\u2019t until 2026. In the meantime, we\u2019re really focused on continuing to build capital and liquidity and returning capital to our common shareholders. Brennan Hawken : Got it. Thanks. Well, good luck, with those continued discussions. Hope they go well. Allison Dukes : Thanks, Brennan. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open. Daniel Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. Allison, I wanted to follow up on the change in some of the accounting associated with the awards you obviously took a charge this quarter. Curious about the benefit as we think about things going forward, if there's anything to the adjusted results. And also, are you anticipating any change in the pace of retirements or is this to incent some behavior internally as well? Allison Dukes : Sure. Thank you for the question. So a couple of things. One, we really have not had clear criteria around retirement in the past and so that is the motivation for this change. And the benefits are really, there are multiple benefits. One is, it does put us more in line with how most companies handle retirements, recognizing everybody is going to retire eventually and creating clear criteria around it in terms of both age and years of service is very helpful. It provides clarity and transparency for our employees. It also gives us an opportunity from an accounting perspective to really better plan for those events, and this acceleration is the acceleration of all of those employees that meet those eligibility requirements today and accelerating the awards that have already been issued. They will all be paid eventually, but it allows us to go ahead and accelerate the expense associated with that. The benefit is, which as I noted before, we -- just in the past few quarters, we've had about $60 million of retirement and without eligibility requirements, you can't recognize the acceleration of those awards until the day in which they tell you they're retiring and then you kind of take the full hit. So it creates volatility and uncertainty in our compensation expense and therefore in our earnings. And so this really will reduce that volatility. You saw quite a bit of it last year as we announced some of those executive retirements and a lot of the repositioning. Had we had this criteria, you wouldn't have seen that kind of volatility in our earnings profile in 2023 because those that were already retirement eligible, those awards would have already been amortized over a shorter time frame. Daniel Fannon : Okay. Understood. And then, Andrew, just following up on fixed income. Obviously, a good quarter for you in terms of flows. Can you talk about the dialogue and where you see opportunity, particularly both I guess, the U.S. and globally? And maybe in the context also you guys used to give us a backlog of unfunded wins? Just curious how that sits today and the makeup of that in terms of the contribution of asset classes? Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah. Thanks for the question. Let me start and then Allison can chip in on the pipeline a little bit. From a fixed income perspective, as I noted, 70% of the volume we saw this quarter inflows came from institutions. And maybe the first thing I'll say is, I think we're starting to see more money kind of move into motion, partially with greater clarity around interest rates. But I think also with backlogs of mandate and reallocations that had kind of been put on hold and quarters delayed as we talked about previously. So in the institutional marketplace, I just think it's -- we're just sort of seeing a greater velocity in particular, in fixed income. And then, in the retail space, the wealth space, we continue to see positive flows largely for us in the municipal space. In the U.S., it's been quite strong, and that's both mostly active, but some passive. And then people using separately managed accounts in wealth management, again, particularly in the U.S., that's starting to increase more rapidly in fixed income, in particular, where we have a really -- we have a competitive edge and a strength, and we were relatively early in that space. So volume is definitely picking up across the board for fixed income, and you saw it in our flows this quarter. With regard to the pipeline, Allison. Allison Dukes : Yeah. The pipeline continues to be -- it's pretty consistent quarter-to-quarter for the last few quarters. I'd say, it hovers right around $15 billion. Sometimes -- some quarters a little higher, some quarters a little bit lower. But we've just seen sort of consistency there. And hence, the reason we really didn't find it all that valuable either because when you look at our flows in any given quarter, about a third of our institutional flows come from the pipeline, but about two-thirds come from outside the pipeline. So it's an interesting barometer, but it doesn't -- it isn't that great a forward indicator. But it is around $15 billion. It's pretty balanced across our regions. And as Andrew noted, we are starting to see a greater and greater interest on the fixed income side. Andrew Schlossberg : I mean, we have about $350 billion of long-term fixed income. It\u2019s a scaled platform, profitability will continue to improve. And in particular, as people sort of go further out this \u2013 the duration curve, which is what we\u2019re seeing. Daniel Fannon : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Katz with TD Cowen. Your line is open. William Katz : Thank you very much for taking the questions, this morning. So maybe a big picture question now that your balance sheet is more healed, there's been a significant amount of M&A around you, whether it be some of the traditional managers trying to bulk up in the alts or the all managers trying to bulk up further into the alt space, all with a sort of focus on driving opportunity to fix income replacement or retail democratization. I was wondering, if you could talk a little bit about how you're positioned to participate in those trends, either de novo or perhaps inorganically? Thank you. Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah. Hey, Bill. Thanks. Look, the number one thing for us, as you mentioned, in terms of opportunity and growth is in the private market space. And you can see, as I mentioned, what's happening there in wealth management. For us, there's a ton of organic opportunity for us to continue to pursue, especially, if we take our real asset capabilities and our alternative credit capabilities to that wealth management market and we're beginning to see sort of that pace pick up. With our real estate debt strategy, in particular, the interest has been quite high in the U.S. wealth management arena. We were added to another one of the largest platforms just at the end -- or the latter part of the third quarter. So I guess, what I'm saying is, we continue to see lots of organic opportunity to take private markets into wealth management, where we have distribution strength. We have product origination capability. We've invested in already the specialized skills and tools you need to pull that through and create less friction in the marketplace. And we'll continue to look inorganically if there's places where we can bulk on to that set of strategies, but we really do feel like we have a tremendous amount of opportunity right here in Invesco. William Katz : Okay. Thank you. Just as a follow-up. As you think about the go-forward mix of the business, it sounds like at the edges, some of the higher fee products could have some incremental demand into the new quarter. But broadly speaking, it continues to be passive in fixed income and SMA. So as you think about the interplay between the fee rate and operating leverage, I was wondering, can you continue to drive positive operating leverage if there's really no change to the underlying drivers to growth? Allison Dukes : Yes, we can. Yeah. I would say, a couple of things. And hopefully, Slide 8 does help you in seeing some of this. I mean, we are certainly seeing good strong growth across a number of our investment capabilities. And we are seeing, underlying, I would say, green shoots and positive dynamics just about everywhere. We're really focused on driving that positive operating leverage by driving growth, incremental progress in every single one of these investment capabilities. These are really the areas where we have deliberately chosen to compete. We are focused on strengthening our capabilities inside of each one, strengthening our investment performance, really driving broad distribution across both our retail and institutional clients and it's incremental progress in each one that drive that positive operating leverage. I think notably, we're working very hard. I think we've demonstrated that strength around expense management and really demonstrating expense discipline and controlling our expenses, so that we can generate that positive operating leverage with all incremental growth on the top line. So, certainly, net revenue yield is just a mathematical sort of output of how we grow across these investment capabilities. Our key focus is on revenue growth, and I think we demonstrated that again this quarter. Andrew Schlossberg : And Bill, just to further emphasize what Allison was saying, I mean, we\u2019re going to be \u2013 we\u2019re focused on each of these areas on profitability quarter-on-quarter and continuing to show operating leverage. I think there\u2019s some other areas of growth across Asia Pacific, and we\u2019ve talked about that market beyond just China as really giving us some good positive growth in a place where we can continue to see revenues expand over time. William Katz : Thank you, both. Allison Dukes : Thank you, Bill. Andrew Schlossberg : Thanks, Bill. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thank you. So as you said some, like, $170 billion in gross sales. So there's obviously huge brand and powerful distribution. And so a follow-on to maybe Bill's question is, if you don't have everything now that clients want, you can build organically, it takes a long time. You could buy stuff. You commented on that. Is there a room in the repertoire? And I'm curious, how you think about the general concept of partnerships to lever your brand, lever your distribution, and strike while the iron's hot and client preferences are changing for something that you might not have on the shelf? Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah. Let me start. I mean partnerships have been part of our history and even our risk -- recent history with what we did in India with our joint venture. We're going to continue to look for ways to create partnerships. And we'll continue to look for them geographically. We'll continue to look for them from a distribution standpoint and as well as investment capabilities. And so while there's nothing specific more to point out this quarter, just look to what we did in India, looked to what we did in China, looking at how we grew our ETF business over time, just to indicate how much we see partnership being an avenue to our future growth. Glenn Schorr : Maybe I'll stay on theme and ask a follow-up on MassMutual. I feel like you commented plenty on the press issue, but there is a great opportunity to grow within their channel, further penetrate their retail network and do more with them. Can you talk about some of the things you're thinking about working on with them as obviously a big distribution partner and not just a big owner? Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah. One of the -- there's several. We're starting at about a little over $13 billion, $14 billion of assets that we manage on behalf of MassMutual, either general account or the affiliated distribution. And what I'd say, one of the bigger opportunities is model portfolios into their broker dealer network, which we think is a huge growth area. It's a place where they've been successful. We have a strong models business and certainly lots of capabilities underneath to populate them alongside other players. The other is, just as we continue to build out sub-advised into their insurance products and capabilities, and that could exist across equities and fixed income. So those are just a few of the things that we\u2019re working on regularly with the MassMutual. And I agree with you that, that should continue and can be a powerful partnership. Glenn Schorr : Thanks, Andrew. Andrew Schlossberg : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Your line is open. Craig Siegenthaler : Hey. Good morning, everyone. I had a question on Alpha. It looked like integration expenses rose $3 million sequentially in the quarter, so when should expenses peak and when will you start to see a net quarter-over-quarter improvement in profits on Alpha, especially because Alpha will save Invesco money over time? Allison Dukes : Yeah. Thanks, Craig. I think as we noted last quarter, we expect to be transitioning our AUM onto the Alpha platform in a series of ways. We expect that first wave to be in the fourth quarter of this year and really run through 2025. And as we continue to test and learn with these waves even perhaps early into 2026. We are incurring implementation costs as we go. We expect to -- we will be paying State Street fees on the AUM as we transition that AUM on. And so, to your question, yes, it did. The implementation costs were up a little bit in the third quarter. We expect it to be relatively consistent here in the fourth quarter as the implementation continues to ramp up, as we get into next year, and we're paying State Street fees on the AUM that we're transitioning it over and we're still paying on some of the other platforms where we will be running parallel for some time. We expect overall costs to start to peak next year and we'll be giving you more guidance around all of that as we get into 2025. And then in 2026, we expect to start to see the benefit of ramping some of those other systems off and really starting to extract the benefits of going to a single platform. It's been a long time coming, and we're deep into testing and we're learning quite a bit, but we'll continue to give you guidance as we evolve into this one going into 2025. Craig Siegenthaler : Thank you, Allison. And for my follow-up on the ETF business, BulletShares flows were particularly strong in the quarter. So I was hoping you could talk about the key drivers and if you expect this to continue over the next few quarters, given that interest rates are somewhat declining now, which may benefit longer duration strategies. Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah. I mean, so BulletShares are -- thanks for pointing it out. I mean BulletShares are a great franchise and we have a very built out diverse range. And it's our leading fixed income franchise inside our ETF capabilities or one of them. And so the same trends I mentioned before about investor demand happening in the wealth space and institutional, frankly, apply to the BulletShares. And so we -- it's not just been this past quarter, but the previous quarter, we saw good BulletShares growth and I think I'd expect that to continue. There are maturities that happen every year in December, that then get repopulated into the first quarter. So I continue to watch that, we feel great about the BulletShares range. Craig Siegenthaler : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Alexander Blostein : Hey, everybody. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I was hoping to double-click into the private real estate flows you highlighted in the prepared remarks and a couple of times in the Q&A. So it sounds like the contribution was relatively healthy from maybe one of the platforms that got added towards the end of the quarter. Was that the bulk of the growth and does that come from almost kind of like one-time-ish sort of benefit since you just got added or the growth and the strength there has been a little bit more broad-based? And I guess on the institutional side, could you update us on what the queue and redemptions look like? It sounds like that's starting to ease a little bit for the industry. So I'm just curious, if you're seeing the same. Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah. Thanks for the question. And let me clarify a little bit on the real estate credit side. The platform that we got added to the large U.S. wealth platform that happened at the end of the quarter, doesn't come with flows, it just comes with opportunity. And so none of the flows in the quarter really were materially related to that, so that's maybe call it on the come. The demand for our real estate debt strategy is where a significant part of the real estate flows for this quarter came from though. That strategy has been out in the market for the better part of a year. It is already on one other large U.S. wealth platform and several others that relate to the independent and RIA channel. So we started to see that volume pick up, and hopefully, that flywheel continues as we get into next year. Allison, you want to talk about the redemptions? Allison Dukes : Sure. I mean, and I would just add, maybe, Alex, to double down on that. While that product was a strong driver of the real estate flows, it wasn't the only driver of our real estate. And so we also saw really strong growth in our real estate SMAs. And I think just improvement overall in demand for this asset class, which is really encouraging. As it relates to the redemption queue, yes, I mean, the pressures have certainly started to moderate there a little bit with just the overall improvement in the broader markets that has an impact on the denominator effect. Still maybe a little bit higher than they are through sort of a normal cycle as we start to see slow improvement. But certainly, I would say, some cautious views on that as people are really trying to get their arms around the path of interest rates and what that means for transaction activity overall, but certainly seeing the pressure abate there and overall, more encouraging signs in the private real estate business. Andrew Schlossberg : And just to remind everybody, it's -- of our real estate assets, the $70 billion or so that's direct, only about half of it are in funds. So the rest are in separate accounts and closed-end vehicles on a global basis. Alexander Blostein : Great. That's helpful. And Allison, just a quick question for you, the service and distribution fee looks like came down sequentially despite higher markets and higher AUM levels, which tends to correlate. It's something that, I think, started to become a little more disconnected recently. And I guess, at the same time, distribution expense increased sequentially. So kind of the net effect of that on profitability continues to become a bigger drag. I know they're not perfect. There's a few things that go in there, but maybe just expand on kind of what drove the decline on the revenue side and kind of further creep up on the expense side? Allison Dukes : Sure. I mean, just a couple of things. One, there is a relationship between service and distribution fees and the third-party distribution contra revenue line item, because there's an element of pass-through between those categories. And so you really do have to look at them together and you can net them against management fees. When you do that, you look over kind of historical time period of the last few quarters, several years. Over several years, it's really run historically in that 13% to 14% range as a percentage of management fees. But in more recent quarters, it's trending towards the higher end of that range and that's really due to the product mix shift towards the higher ETF flows in the more recent quarters. And ETFs don't generate as much service and distribution fee revenue as mutual funds do and there are third-party expenses such as licensing fees. So it tends to make that ratio skewed slightly higher. Yeah. I think that mix shift and is something obviously we're increasingly seeing as we're seeing not just in our own mix, but just across the industry, that demand for ETF outstripping the demand for the mutual fund wrapper. If you expect that to continue, then I'd say it's reasonable to expect that relationship to be closer to 14% than it has been historically 13%. So I know that was kind of a detailed answer there, but I think it's the way to really look at it, the way we're wrapping our heads around it year-to-year kind of quarter-to-quarter right now. Alexander Blostein : I know. That makes perfect sense. All right. Thank you very much. Allison Dukes : Thank you. Andrew Schlossberg : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ben Budish with Barclays. Your line is open. Benjamin Budish : Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to first ask about the competitive dynamics in the fixed income business. You called -- in the prepared remarks, you called out a number of factors, new investment grade mandates, U.S. wealth management flows. But just curious, I guess, I suppose you don't always know where the flows are coming from, if they're coming from somewhere else, but is there an opportunity from -- for share gains in that sort of space? Is there -- was there anything you saw in the quarter? Do you see that as an opportunity for the fourth quarter or is this more sort of money in motion, rates coming down, more of a kind of organic pickup? Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah. It's a great question. It's also hard to parse it completely. I think the trends are -- what we're largely seeing is money that's in motion for the reasons that we mentioned before. Fixed income is the competitive space. And so you're largely also having to compete and take assets from competitors even as money is in motion could be growing, but also its takeover mandate. There's nothing in particular that I can -- that we can point to from this quarter in that regard. I'd also say that a lot of the assets that are flowing into fixed income aren't just coming here in the United States. They're coming out of Asia. They're coming out of Europe as well. So it's really been a global phenomenon for us across global investment grade, corporates, even elements of EM. And then as I said before, municipals included in the United States. Benjamin Budish : Got it. Very helpful. Maybe one more kind of follow-up on the private wealth side. Just you mentioned that you launched on a very large distributor. Just curious, how would you describe your current distribution capabilities relative to kind of broader in Invesco as it applies to just the private markets products? Thank you. Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah. So we have a generalist specialist model in how we take private markets, both in the institutional and in the wealth space. Over the last several years, we've been strengthening that mix. And so, we've been adding specialists to the team to sit alongside our generalists in private markets, in particular in the U.S. wealth space. And we think that's working pretty well, given the pickup that we're seeing. We've made those investments already. I don't expect to see us doing a whole lot more there in terms of investing behind those areas of distribution. Now it's just a matter of taking the products that we have on platform and growing the volume and continue to find a few new products that we can bring to that wealth space. I'd say, we\u2019ve also and we\u2019ll continue to invest in beyond just distribution. It\u2019s all the things that are required to minimize the friction that\u2019s in place in bringing mandates on, servicing those mandates, and the specialized things that are required in private markets. So it\u2019s more in the product and distribution to win in private markets in the wealth space. We feel like we\u2019ve made most, if not all, those investments. Benjamin Budish : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Michael Cyprys : Thank you. Good morning. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the India JV that you set up. If you could maybe just elaborate a bit on the opportunity set that you see, how you see that marketplace opening up and talk about some of the steps that you're looking to take in your approach there and any sort of lessons back -- lessons learned looking back at the Religare relationship that you've had over the years and how that may inform your approach here? Thank you. Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah. Thanks. So we're still working through regulatory approvals and that joint venture and the disposition of our portion of it. We're planning to have completed in the first quarter. But as it relates to opportunities and lessons learned, first, I think it's important that you pick a good partner, and we feel like we have a good partner in India that's going to -- that has captive distribution, that's bank oriented, and that can really help us expand the clients we serve and help us to continue to grow in India. We believe very much in the Indian market. Really for us, it was less about India and more about really wanting to make sure we're focusing our attention in other -- in all the areas that are critical to us that we've talked about and concentrating and consolidating our efforts. So we're pleased to be able to participate in the Indian market as a minority investor in this JV and as a provider of investment capabilities behind that, that our JV partner and the company can take forward to the marketplace. And look, on the lessons learned, I'd just say, back to the earlier question, partnership is a great way for us to expand in certain markets around the world, and it will continue to be a place that we look to for distribution and product going forward as well. And so each partnership, you learn something, but I think our appreciation of them is only growing. Michael Cyprys : Great. Thanks. And then just a follow-up question on the expense outlook. It was something you could maybe elaborate on how you see that taking shape here into the fourth quarter or next year? How you see expenses trending? And if you can maybe help quantify how much the State Street Alpha fees on AUM might be? How meaningful might that be next year? And as you think about scope for continued positive operating leverage as you look out from here, how much uplift in market beta do you need to drive that positive operating leverage? Thank you. Allison Dukes : Okay. Lots there. Let me actually take your last one first. We can drive positive operating leverage without market beta, so long as we continue to drive good, strong organic growth, and maintain that expense discipline that I think we have been able to demonstrate over these last couple of years. Positive market beta is obviously tremendously helpful, but we're really focused on delivering operating leverage and operating income and margin improvement with or without market gains. And that's really fundamental to how we're planning for the company. And as we've said several times before, our focus is on getting ourselves back to a mid-30s operating margin. We've demonstrated two quarters of operating margin growth. We're pleased with that, but we're nowhere near where we want to be or intend to be. And so our focus is on really building the business so that we can outperform or at least deliver positive operating leverage with or without market improvement. It's not easy, but that's the focus. Second, in terms of -- kind of going backwards on your question, as it relates to Alpha and the State Street fees, I can tell you it's immaterial for the fourth quarter, just given this is really based on the AUM that we move and we move it in waves, and it's certainly dependent on the level and the quantum of AUM in each wave. So as we're continuing to scope out this wave, it has a pretty material impact on the fees that we'll be paying next year in terms of this fourth quarter immaterial, less than $5 million. So it really -- it's TBD a bit next year as we continue to work through the waves and the quantum in each wave. So we'll give you more guidance as we continue to have certainty around that. As it relates to expenses, in the fourth quarter, we always have some seasonality in the fourth quarter in terms of both marketing and G&A, and compensation, usually is a little bit higher in the fourth quarter, dependent on performance fees. So those are the three areas that I would look to and expect a little bit of seasonally higher expenses. I would say overall, our expense base is trending pretty consistently for the year to the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year. We said we expected our total expenses to be around $3 billion for 2024 without any market improvement. We've certainly seen some revenue and market improvement since the beginning of the year. And so we would expect our expense base to be a bit higher than that. But on a year-to-date basis, you could see how that's trending. And then I would expect some seasonally higher increases, modestly higher in the fourth quarter. Michael Cyprys : Great. Thank you. Allison Dukes : There was a lot of that question, hope I covered it all. Michael Cyprys : You did. Thanks. Andrew Schlossberg : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. Maybe just a couple. Maybe just one going back to the Great Wall JV. Andrew, you talked about this earlier in the presentation. But is there an opportunity for the fee rate to improve if you look at the contrasting elements of the fee cuts and obviously, the shift out of fixed income, but you're -- I think, correct me if I'm wrong, but you're thinking that we may see a positive mix shift into equities, in the Great Wall coming in 4Q. Maybe if you could just discuss that dynamic and whether we could see a rebound in that fee rate in -- as early as 4Q versus 3Q. Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah. Thanks for the question. And as mentioned earlier, the dynamics that have occurred in the last several weeks certainly have changed a lot in China and will have an impact. Both have had an impact on the market and certainly have an impact on our business. Equities, as I mentioned before, is an important part of the business, it's 30% though, just keep that in mind. But we certainly exited the month feeling a lot better than we did or exited the quarter a lot better than we did intra-quarter, and you continue to see what's happened in the marketplace since then. With flows coming out of fixed income and more going into equity over time, both passive and active from a fee rate perspective, that's a generally a good thing for our business. But again, lots of volatility in China. But we exited, as you can see, the quarter at some of the highest asset rates that we've seen in some time. Brian Bedell : Got it. Thanks. And then just on the global liquidity, if you could just comment on that, I think we had the outflows here in 3Q. Maybe just if you can talk about any seasonality factors in 4Q? And then do you expect liquidity flows to benefit from the rate cutting cycle or are there other dynamics that might pressure it -- the flows? Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah. Thanks. On the cash liquidity business, just a reminder, most of our assets and liquidity business are institutionally oriented, about 85% of them. And so these institutions do have other tools that they can use outside of money market and our cash tools when interest rate pictures are changing. I think that probably was the most material part of the impact in the third quarter and things were skewing a lot more towards the banks that have dominated that space going forward. Our liquidity business is $170 billion. It's a profitable part of our company. It's a place that we're continuing to expect a lot out of and we have the scale. So I think time will tell here in the fourth quarter, what occurs. But do keep in mind, it's different than a lot of other asset managers given the institutional skew that we have. Brian Bedell : Okay. Fair enough. Okay. Great. Thank you. Gregory Ketron : Hey, Cedric. We have time for one more question. Operator : Sure. Thanks. Our last question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Patrick Davitt : Thanks a lot. I have a quick follow-up on that last question. Obviously, a narrative a lot of people have been trying to push for a while now is this idea that cash on the sidelines will fuel the bond allocations. But we're seeing both money funds and bond funds broadly with big inflows over the last few months. You have a sense of where in the allocation stack, I guess, these strong bond flows are coming from for you, where it's rotating from within your clients' allocations because it certainly doesn't appear to be money funds at this point? Thank you. Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah. I mean, I'm not sure it's from our client allocation as much it's from their own allocations. We're definitely seeing people go further out in duration. We're seeing that in our SMA business, which went really short to more intermediate. We're seeing that in -- just in the core fixed income space, both in institutional and retail. So we're definitely seeing both money come off the sidelines and money go up the duration curve as well. In terms of where it's coming from in our business, as I said, it's not coming from our money fund business, that's a totally different dynamic. We think that it's coming from the sidelines or from competitors. Patrick Davitt : Great. Thank you. Andrew Schlossberg : Thank you. Operator : Okay. And back to you, Mr. Schlossberg. Andrew Schlossberg : Okay. Well, thanks, operator. In closing, we are well-positioned to help clients navigate the impact of evolving market dynamics and subsequent changes to their portfolios. As market sentiment improved and client convictions strengthen, this should translate to even greater scale performance and improve profitability for Invesco as we've discussed today. Given all the work that we have done to strengthen our ability to anticipate, understand and meet evolving client needs, I'm very excited for the future of Invesco. I really want to thank all my Invesco colleagues for their continued hard work, I'm proud of our collaboration with one another and our focus on our clients. Thanks, everybody, for joining the call today. Please reach out to our Investor Relations team for any additional questions, and we appreciate your interest in Invesco and look forward to speaking with all of you again soon. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference. You may all disconnect at this time.",

Andrew Schlossberg, President and CEO; and Allison Dukes, Chief Financial Officer, will present our results this morning, and then, we'll open up the call for questions. I'll now turn the call over to Andrew. Andrew Schlossberg : Thanks a lot, Greg, and good morning to everyone. I'm pleased to be speaking with you today. During the fourth quarter and throughout 2024, we continued to make meaningful progress in executing our strategic priorities and leveraging our competitive advantages to improve on several key performance drivers. Amid a backdrop of volatile markets across the world, mixed economic signals and geopolitical risks, our focus remains steadfast. This enabled us to deliver for clients and shareholders and meaningfully improve our operating results. I want to thank my colleagues around the world for their focus and teamwork throughout the year. But before we get into the specifics of the fourth quarter, we thought it would be helpful to look at the whole of 2024 and the progress made against the eight key financial measures that are noted on Slide 4 of our presentation. The combination of strong long-term net inflows of $65 billion or a 5% organic growth rate, higher revenues and disciplined expense management, while reinvesting into the business, drove an increase in operating income to $1.4 billion. We generated positive operating leverage of over 100 basis points and improved our operating margins to over 31% for the year and 34% for the fourth quarter marking good sequential momentum throughout 2024. While client demand and net flows remained more narrowly focused, in the aggregate, we continued to gain market share and revenue growth in key high demand strategic capabilities including our global ETF, fixed income and SMA product ranges, all of which are highly scalable. We saw momentum build throughout the year for private and alternative credit strategies, but for institutional and wealth management clients. Geographically, our net long-term flows remains positive, across all three of our regions with a notable pickup through the second half of the year in both our Asia-Pacific and EMEA markets. Specifically, in Asia-Pacific, we generated 10% organic growth marking its best year since 2021. Throughout 2024, we remained highly focused on retaining and selectively growing our fundamental equity investment strategies against the backdrop of outflows in the industry and for Invesco. This remains a key focus for the firm. As we stressed throughout 2024, strengthening our balance sheet continues to be a priority. Through disciplined execution, we made strong progress and improved the financial flexibility of the firm. During the year, we reduced our debt, we improved our operating, leverage and ended the year with a net cash position of nearly $100 million. Additionally, after commencing a more consistent share buyback program in the second half of the year, we returned 54% of earnings to common shareholders through buybacks and dividends in 2024, which was an increase from the previous year. Our success in 2024 gives us conviction in our focused strategic priorities, our execution mindset, and our ability to continue to deliver enhanced and consistent operating performance and returns for our shareholders. Turning now to Slide 5 and focusing on the fourth quarter, growth continues to be led by our highly innovative ETF and Index platforms, which has near or historic organic long-term flows of $30 billion, which is a 25% annualized organic growth rate. Importantly, we continue to see our flow through ETFs broadened by asset classes and factors across our clients in all three regions. Growth in the US market continues to be led by our S&P 500 Equal Weight strategy, our Equity Momentum strategies, which accounted for nearly $5 billion of the net flows and our Innovation Suite which is headlined by QQQM which garnered $3 million of net inflows. This bond, which was launched just over four years ago had one of its best quarters on record and has grown to nearly E40 billion in assets today. We also saw strong ETF growth from the EMEA region with nearly $11 billion of net inflows on a sort basis with our locally listed S&P 500 topping the list. We also continued to innovate at scale. In the fourth quarter, we launched a new ETF that we customized in partnership with a Finnish pension insurer to meet its claimants focused investment objectives. This ETF began trading with nearly $2.5 billion in assets and put a new milestone as the largest ETF launched on record. Our ETF platform finished the quarter with record AUM and revenues. Revenue growth remains strong up 7% from the third quarter and 31% from the fourth quarter last year. We remained very well positioned to continue to gain market share and use this scaled platform for profitable growth. Shifting to Fundamental Fixed Income. After a strong third quarter, we saw modest net long-term outflows in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by stable value, which continues to be out of favor in the current rate environment as money market yields are paying a premium to stable value. Excluding this specific US defined contribution product, our fundamental fixed income strategies continued to see solid flow growth of $1.5 billion in the quarter. Within the Fundamental Fixed Income category, flow growth was led by our Municipal Bond strategies and driven by our fast-growing SMA platform which reached $28 billion in AUM or 33% organic growth rate. Additionally, revenue generated from Fundamental Fixed Income strategies grew by 9% in the fourth quarter as compared with the same quarter in \u201823. It's important to note that our large and diverse fixed income product line, which totaled over $600 billion at year end spans our geographic footprint and encompasses more than just our fundamental fixed income capability that\u2019s expressed on this slide. Looking at this more holistic view of our fixed income product set, which also includes, fixed income ETFs, our China JV, private credit strategies and global liquidity we generated 8% AUM growth and net long-term inflows of nearly $27 billion in 2024. Our fixed income capabilities had strong performance and are well-positioned to meet client needs across the credit and duration spectrum, geographic preferences, active and passive exposures and public and private markets. We have plenty of reasons to be optimistic about our ability to capture flows as money increasingly rotates into these asset classes. Shifting now to private markets, which in aggregate drove long-term net inflows of nearly $1 billion in the quarter. Within the category, our private credit capabilities reported net inflows of $3.5 billion or 31% annualized organic growth rate. Growth was driven by bank loans and CLOs across several fund structures, increased including our industry-leading senior loan ETFs. In direct real estate, we also continue to see flows into INCREF, which is our real estate debt strategy targeting the wealth management channel. Launched only in 2023, this fund has doubled in size over the past two quarters and now stands at nearly $2.5 billion in AUM. Also note that our real estate team is well-positioned at the institutional markets with over $5 billion of dry powder to capitalize on emerging opportunities. Moving on to Asia-Pacific. On a managed basis, in Asia, we saw a rebound this quarter with net long-term inflows of $3.5 billion, led by positive flows from India and $2.5 billion of net inflows into our China JV. Our China growth was driven by equity, particularly ETFs, which are becoming fast-growing part of our China business and where we see strong demand continuing. These flows were augmented by net inflows with the fixed income with six new products launched in our China JV this quarter, including three ETF products. At a macro level in China, we are encouraged by the government's recent focus on economic stimulus. But overall market sentiment remains relatively weak and volatility remains high. Looking more broadly at Asia-Pacific as a region, on a client source basis, net inflows were even stronger at $7.5 billion for the quarter, which is a 13% annualized organic growth rate. This broader flow strength in the region highlights our success in leveraging, our global product suite and our investment capabilities to meet demand across this important growth region. We had good inflows in Southeast Asia, driven by ETFs, along with continued strong inflows in Japan through our global equity and income strategy, which had $1.5 billion in net inflows and continues to be one of top selling active retail equity funds in the growing Japanese market. Turning to our multi-asset related capabilities, we saw net long-term outflows of $1.5 billion, driven by global asset allocation particularly in our balanced risk allocation strategy. Finally, the relative pressure on fundamental equity flows has continued. However, as I've pointed out previously, we\u2019ve seen some moderation over time in the global, international and emerging market segments. Net outflows in these strategies have been in the $2 billion per quarter range. Outflows in our emerging market strategies have been partially offset by the continued strength of global equity and income that I noted earlier, as well as net inflows in small cap equities. While asset flows in our fundamental equity capabilities remained below our long-term expectations, market growth has aided revenue, resulting in a 10% increase in net revenues this quarter, compared with the fourth quarter of 2023. Our team continues to focus on driving high quality alpha, upgrading our talent bench and continuing to strengthen our risk management tools. Regardless of client demand, our focus remains on improving investment performance, and gaining market share in key fundamental equity categories, in which we compete. Now moving on to Slide 6, we provide an alternative aggregation of our AUM and flows to provide additional context for our business results. I've covered most of these key highlights underlying these charts, but I'll point out that the diversity of our assets and our flows across geography, channel and investment style provide us the balanced and to weather any market condition and our ability to meet a range of client needs, which is an important part of our ongoing positive organic flow growth story. Moving on to Slide 7, which shows our overall investment performance relative to benchmarks and peers as well as our performance in key capabilities where information is readily comparable and more meaningful to drive results. Investment performance is key for winning and maintaining market share, despite overall market demand. Achieving first quartile investment performance remains a top priority and we are making progress on this front. Overall, nearly half of our funds are performing in the top quartile of peers across the 1, 3, and 5 year time horizons. Further, two-thirds of our AUM is beating its respective benchmark over all measurement periods. We continue to have strong fixed income performance, with approximately 40% of our funds in the top quartile on a 3 and 5 year basis. We are acutely focused on improving fundamental equity performance and we are making progress here too. We have continued to improve the percentage of AUM in the top quartile of peers across each timeline shown, with a third or more now hitting that target. With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Allison to discuss our financial results for the quarter and I look forward to your questions. Allison Dukes : Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll begin, on Slide 8 with our fourth quarter financial results. We continue to see strong growth in assets under management during the fourth quarter with total AUM at the end of the quarter at $1.85 trillion, $50 billion or 3% higher than last quarter end and $261 billion or 16% higher than the end of 2023. Average long-term assets under management were over $1.3 trillion, an increase of 4% over the last quarter and 20% over the fourth quarter of last year. The increase in AUM was mainly driven by net long-term inflows, net inflows and for our QQQ ETF and net inflows in the money market funds. Unlike recent quarters, markets does not have a significant impact on AUM in the fourth quarter. Net long-term inflows drove a $26 billion increase in assets under management during the quarter, representing an organic growth rate of nearly 8%. As Andrew noted, net inflows and our ETF and index capabilities were nearly $30 billion. QQQ net inflows were $10 billion and money market fund inflows were strong at $25 billion. Net revenue, adjusted operating income, and adjusted operating margin, all improved from the third quarter and showed substantial improvement from the fourth quarter of last year. I'll cover the drivers of that shortly. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.52 for the fourth quarter versus prior quarter EPS of $0.44. We continue to strengthen the balance sheet, ending the quarter in a net cash position with cash and cash equivalents exceeding debt by nearly a $100 million, better than our goal of zero net debt. We also continued share buyback repurchasing $25 million during the quarter and we intend to continue buying back on a regular basis going forward. Moving to Slide9, as we stated in prior calls, secular shifts in client demand have altered our asset mix and net revenue yields as our broad set of capabilities has allowed us to capture evolving client product preferences. Client demand has led to continued diversification of our portfolio, a trend we've seen for a number of years now. As a result, concentration risk and higher fee fundamental equities and multi-asset products has been reduced. The firm is increasingly better positioned to navigate various market cycles, events and shifting client demands. Consistent with prior quarters, current net revenue yield trends are included on this slide. The ranges by capability are representative of where the net revenue yield has ranged over the past five quarters that we note the net revenue yield drivers and where in the range the yields have trended more recently. To provide context for the net revenue yield trend during the fourth quarter, our overall net revenue yield was 24.6 basis points. The exit net revenue yield was 24.1 basis points, a half a basis point lower due to continued mix shift during the quarter. Turning to Slide 10, net revenue of $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter was $111 million higher than the fourth quarter of last year and 11% increase and $53 million was 5% higher than the third quarter. Investment management fees were $123 million higher than last year and $29 million higher than the third quarter. The increases were driven by higher average AUM, partially offset by the AUM mix shift previously noted. Performance fees were $14 million higher than last year, and $32 million higher than the third quarter reflecting typical seasonality. Operating expenses continues to be well-managed. Total adjusted operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $767 million, a slight decrease of $4 million or less than 1% from the fourth quarter of last year. There was a slight increase of $11 million or less than 2% in adjusted operating expenses over the third quarter. Compensation was $14 million higher than the fourth quarter of last year, which included $22 million of organizational change-related expense. Higher compensation expense was driven mainly by higher revenue in 2024. Compensation expense was $15 million higher than the prior quarter and mainly driven by higher revenue, including compensation associated with seasonally higher performance fees. G&A was lower on both the year-over-year and sequential quarter basis. G&A was $28 million lower than the fourth quarter of last year, due mainly to lower professional-related fees and an insurance reimbursement of $13 million in the fourth quarter of this year. G&A was $11 million lower, compared to the third quarter, mainly due to the insurance reimbursements, partially offset by slightly higher professional-related fees. Alpha platform implementation cost of $14 million were in line with our expectations in the fourth quarter and consistent with the $15 million incurred in the third quarter. We did move a small first wave of AUM on the alpha platform in the fourth quarter. Fees paid on the assets transition in the first wave or nominal expense wise in the fourth quarter. As the implementation continues, we expect alpha-related, one-time, implementation cost to be in the $10 million to $15 million range per quarter in 2025. Depending on the timing of when future waves are executed, which we currently expect will continue through 2026 the implementation cost will begin to fade as we approach full implementation of alpha. Fees paid to State Street as we transition assets to alpha will increase as future waves are executed. Under this scenario, the combination of implementation costs and total platform fees paid to third-parties could be late this year or during the first half of 2026. Looking at 2025, we expect costs related to alpha, which includes both the implementation cost and fees paid to platform providers to be $20 million to $25 million higher than 2024. We\u2019ll continue to update our progress and related costs as we move forward with the implementation. Regarding operating expenses for 2025, we will continue our disciplined expense management. We expect a slight uptick in expenses driven by the higher revenue levels that we are currently generating. If you assume flat markets from year end \u201824, we would expect total operating expense to increase by approximately 1% over 2024. That includes the higher alpha related costs in 2025 that I noted. After the fourth quarter, our quarter-over-quarter positive operating leverage was 330 basis points driving a $41 million or 12% increase in operating income and a 210 basis point improvement in our operating margins to 33.7%. The effective tax rate was 22.2% in the fourth quarter. We estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate will be near 25%, the high end of our historic range for the first quarter of 2025, excluding any discrete tax items. The actual effective rate can vary due to the impact of non-recurring items on pre-tax income and discrete tax items. I\u2019ll wrap up on Slide 11. As I noted earlier, we continued to make progress on building balance sheet strength during the fourth quarter. We ended the quarter and a net cash position with cash and cash equivalents exceeding debt by nearly $100 million, better than our goal of zero net debt. We ended the quarter with no draws on our credit facility. Our leverage ratio - leverage ratios continue to improve and we're now down to a leverage ratio excluding the preferred stock of 0.25 times, a significant improvement over the past several years. We continued share buyback in the fourth quarter repurchasing $25 million or 1.4 million shares during the quarter. We intend to continue a regular share buyback program going forward and we expect our total payout ratio, including common dividends and share buybacks to move closer to 60% in 2025 as we continually evaluate our capital return levels. This includes the resiliency and strength of our firm's net flows performance as evident again this quarter and we continue to make progress on simplifying the organization and building a stronger balance sheet, while continuing to invest in areas of growth. We remain committed to driving profitable growth, high-level financial performance and enhancing the return of capital to shareholders. With that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open. Daniel Fannon : Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on the outlook for expenses in 2025. The $20 million to $25 million increase of the alpha versus \u201824 can you just remind us what \u201824 it was? And then also just given some of the seasonality of kind of [Audio distortion] collection building of 1Q and what might be the updated comp in others versus the overall 1% of UK? Allison Dukes : Dan, you got totally jumbled for us there on the end. The one thing we heard was alpha and looking for what it was in 2024. Daniel Fannon : Yes and then maybe some sequential - the sequential expense builds for the first quarter, given the seasonality of things like payroll. Allison Dukes : Okay. So, let me let me address alpha in 2024 first. Alpha was probably just under $50 million for 2024. And so, in comparing that to 2025, as I noted, we would expect it to be in total $20 million to $25 million higher than 2024, that's inclusive of all costs related to alpha and then the expense guidance for the full year, as I noted, would be about a 1% increase over 2024 assuming spot markets from the end of from 12/31. That includes all of the alpha cost. In terms of the sequential quarter build, I would just say as I noted, the implementation cost for the quarter are going to be and that's again in that $10 million to $15 million range. In terms of other expense line items I would say there's always the typical seasonality in the first quarter as it relates to payroll taxes, which tend to run in the $15 million kind of context $15 million to $20 million context. Of course, you got seasonality in the fourth quarter with compensation related to performance fees. Keep in mind marketing tends to be seasonally higher in the fourth quarter. And I just don't expect a lot else to be very different. So, I point to those seasonal items and then point you back to the full year guidance of 1%. Daniel Fannon : Great. Thank you and hopefully I can make it clear here for the second one, but wanted to follow-up on capital management and just given the improved liquidity position, how your M&A and/or inorganic thought processes evolve given the stable and/or improving equity income fund? Allison Dukes : Okay. Yep. Got it. On the capital management, I would say our priorities continues to be the same which is we remain focused primarily and investing in our own inorganic growth which I think we're demonstrating that we've got a fair amount of firepower there and investing in those capabilities is in fact demonstrating the organic growth that we're looking for. So that is first and foremost. Our focus is just given the diversified platform we have, how that relates to our inorganic focus, I would say it's very consistent with a lot of the conversations we've had in the past, Our capabilities are fairly well built out across both the capability set, but also our regional diversification the one area where we probably don't have the full set of capabilities would be on the private credit side. We continue to be very thoughtful there. It is, we have some depth of private credit capabilities, but probably not the full suite we would like to have. It's also a very crowded and expensive space, as you know right now. And so, we remain focused on growing both organically while keeping our eyes open inorganically. Daniel Fannon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you.. And our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Alex Blostein : Good morning. Ask another one on expenses for you just to make sure I have that clear. So, the alpha implementation will run $10 million to $15 million per quarter. It will peak at some of time at the end of \u201925 maybe early \u201926 at which point you will also start to have sort of the expenses that you\u2019ll start paying State Street to ramp as well. So, maybe help us understand kind of what are the runrate expenses you expect to pay State Street once all the assets have migrated over? So which I guess will be at some point of time in 2026 and then, ultimately, are there any legacy cost do you expect to fall off once alpha is sort of fully implemented? Or is that kind of baked into your $10 million to $15 million guidance? Allison Dukes : No, so let me kind of walk that through that again. So, I'll try to keep this together and I can't tell you - I can't answer the question of what are the fees we would be paying to State Street, of course that's contractual. And so, the way to think about it is this, implementation cost will continue to be $10 million to $15 million per quarter. That's consistent with what we've been running for the last number of quarters. If I look at the total cost development this year, which is both the implementation cost, which think of those as one-time the construction cost, if you will, combined with fees paid to platform providers, which there are existing and new fees that will be coming on that probably we will be keeping as we are running parallel paths on a number of platforms. The combined cost of all of that for 2025 will be $20 million to $25 million higher than the cost in \u201824. So thinking about that baked into our expense runrate for \u201825 relative to \u201924. That is a piece of the overall expense guidance, which is inclusive of everything that we provided, which is an increase of 1% over last year. The cost that will start to come out that will be not to tell we are fully transitioned with all ways. So as we noted the way they're going to continue through 2026, then we can begin to decommission systems. So the benefits we might see are too far out to guide to at this point. Does that helps, Alex? Alex Blostein : I got you. Yeah, I was just kind of trying to get like one of those cost fade out like what is the net expense benefit we should expect, which sounds like some of that $10 million to $15 million will start to leave, but the ultimate benefit of that really won\u2019t shop until \u201927 if that \u2013 if I hear you correctly. Allison Dukes : Correct. And you are correct. Once we are fully implemented, you will not have the implementation cost of the $10 million to $15 million a quarter. That\u2019s really construction cost, if you want to think about it that way. Alex Blostein : Yeah, gotcha. Okay. Thank you. And then my follow-up question, I didn't want to ask you guys around China. It sounds like things have been picking up there. Andrew, you and I had a conversation about this later last quarter just in terms of the momentum you guys have seen in the ground that's showing up in flows. So talk to us maybe a bit about the pipeline that you are seeing in the products there and your expectations for flows over the next couple of quarters? Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah, so, maybe I'll start, then Al take a pick up as well. We did - as we said, we saw, $2.5 billion or so of flows this quarter. Importantly, the launches we did and the focus in the market was on equity ETF, which we\u2019re seeing more demand for equity markets through ETFs right now in China and we're relatively early in building that out and the markets relatively early as well. We're also seeing flows into what's called fixed income plots which is more like a balanced strategy. Its demand has been picking up there, as well. To remind everybody, our business there is pretty diverse and balanced. So we're about 30%, equities, 30%, fixed income, 20% is fixed income plus and 20% or so in money markets. The stimulus that's been put in place and what we expect to be future stimulus throughout the balance of this year is starting to raise confidence modestly. But I think the markets and the retail investors going to need to see more. But to be getting organic growth despite all of that, we feel we feel is a pretty good accomplishment. Alex Blostein : Great, thank you both. Andrew Schlossberg : Thank you. Alex Blostein : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. A couple just sort of clarification items on the expenses. Sorry to dwell here. But the 1% increase that\u2019s versus the $3 billion and $30 million adjusted reported base, just want to confirm that. And then the $10 million to $15 million that we should expect in 2025 those construction costs and then that's not expected to go into \u201926. I just wanted to confirm that. And Allison, I believe you noted a $22 million charge related to organizational change, could you maybe give some color around what that is and what impacts we could expect from that? Allison Dukes : $22 million organizational change was 2023. So that was in my year-over-year comment. So that's rear view mirror. No organizational change expenses noted in fourth quarter of 2024. The expense guidance of 1% over 2024, yes, that is relative to the fully reported $3 billion, $30 million operating expense base for 2024, and that's assuming flat markets to 12/31. And then, the implementation cost of $10 million to $15 million a quarter, that guide is through 2025. I'm not prepared to speak to 2026 yet, but if we are still in the - moving AUM over there will be some implementation costs depending on where we are on the waves and the continued build of alpha. If it is possible it could be higher, it could be lower than $10 million to $15 million as we continue to move assets and waves. So but implementation costs will be a part of our expense base, so long as we are moving assets over to alpha until that transition is fully complete. Brennan Hawken : Great. Thank you. Allison Dukes : Does that helps Brennan? Brennan Hawken : It does. Thanks for clarifying on the organizational change. I didn\u2019t hear that correctly. One of the things you guys talked \u2013 and let me shift gears on alpha and not talk about the actual expense talking indirectly, you\u2019ve spoken in the past that you expect that this migration is going to enhance your operational effectiveness across the organization. So - and it sounds like you're beginning to migrate cohorts over. It might be too early. But like, what has been the experience so far? What are your expectations for some of that operational \u2013 increased operational effectiveness? And how should we expect that to manifest itself as you continue to progress through this rather substantial change in the organization? Andrew Schlossberg : Hey, Brennan, it's Andrew. Thanks for the question. Look, I'll say the the assets that we brought on board in the fourth quarter were relatively small. So it's too early to give a full answer, but the experience has been good from those equity investors that the team that\u2019s come across or the platform that's come across. In terms of the wider simplification efforts and the advantages we'll get over time, yeah, it sort of tying it back to the corporate strategy and the execution we've been on, which is to bring the investment platform closer and closer to together. And so, as we scale through that platform, as we have teams managing assets across market, as we shift into different product lines, a simple singular platform that helps with decommission all sorts of home grown systems and legacy third-party systems, just makes that process makes as much quicker at executing that process and makes our investment portfolio managers and teams much more efficient at the way that they're able to execute. So I think, we're ready to get this further moved on to the platform so we continue to have it enhanced and drive the strategy and drive the operating leverage frankly that we\u2019ve been seeing in the business. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Looking forward to hearing more as you continue progress. Thanks for taking my questions. Andrew Schlossberg : Thank you. Allison Dukes : Thanks, Brennan. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Bill Katz with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Bill Katz : Thank you very much. I'm going to spend more time in Africa and I apologize, but the guidance you given is very constructive versus what is with the street is telling today. I think the bigger question that I have I think investors have is, what does this look like in the end statement? I think Alex was trying to get you there. So, A. what percentage of your assets would you anticipate being migrated over in 2025? And then as we get into some kind of \u201cnormalized world\u201d where everything is migrated over and implementation cost phase out, how do we think about or how do we model to the onboarding costs on a go forward basis? That\u2019s my first question. Thank you. Allison Dukes : So, I mean, I\u2019d start with, we're not going to provide the detail of what percentage in \u201825 versus \u201826 as we continue to work with our partners on really thinking through how to build out these waves in a way that creates the least amount of disruption and really helps drive the efficiency of the business. And that's really just the preparedness there. So, I'll probably hold on how the waves are constructed and what percentage we anticipate moving in \u201825 just out, but we will update you quarter-to-quarter as we are moving that on. As I noted, we expect to continue moving assets over throughout \u201825 and into \u201826. And so, that instate on the other side, we will give you more guidance as we can continue to work through what that looks like. We do anticipate and it is the vast majority, it's not almost all of our assets, but ultimately move on to the platform. So it has a number of system implications behind it as we look to streamline from a number of systems to a single operating system there. And that instate, does have benefits. It has benefits in terms of elimination of software cost as well as, benefits from an organizational perspective. And so, their implications related to teams, as well. So there are benefits on the other side. They just as we are really focused on 2025 at the moment, they're a little further out, but then we're prepared to get the full guidance to given the business continues to evolve in every other aspect. Andrew Schlossberg : Hey Bill, the only thing I'd add is, just to add extra clarity, all - pretty much all of our public market assets will be ultimately on the alpha platform This wave construct that we're using, it's helpful because as we learn from each wave we apply to the next wave and get those incremental benefits hopefully in speed, but also in working through the complexity of it. Bill Katz : Okay, thank you. And then, maybe I'm just sticking with you for a question. I think some of the themes out in terms of the opportunity set going forward are more on the alternative side. So I was wondering if you could maybe click a layer deeper and speak to your strategy to grow private markets. You gave a little bit of a detailing retail democratization and maybe what you can grow three beyond INCREF, maybe even leveraging on the insurance side and then interrelated to that, there's not a lot of deals to be had, how should we be thinking about the payout rate? 60% seems relatively low given that you\u2019ve enhanced the balance sheet and you have pretty good diversification and scale? Thank you. Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah, let me start. So on the private markets and alternative build outs, as we noted, we do think there's a lot of organic opportunity here. And it\u2019s not just in taking our private real estate and alternative credit strategies and private credit strategies to the wealth management market. You will also see opportunities to enhance the institutional markets around the world. But wealth management should have the greatest growth rate and we pointed out a few places where we're starting to see that take hold. The real estate debt strategy that we launched INCREF is a flagship for us both because there's increasing demand in that space and there's less supply. And so we would see that fund doubling size the last few quarters and now be at around $2.5 billion. You'll also start to see us build out around the alternative credit space into those wealth management channels, as well. I think one of the things that we're finding as we build out in the wealth space, is that people want diversification, as well. And so, we're going to continue to look for strategies that might be multi-asset in nature. And then on the inorganic side, in addition to what Allison shared before about our capital priorities and she can expand in a moment. Just think about our inorganic strategy as focusing on partnerships, as well. And so, there's lots of conversations out there ways that we can find partners to work with. We've been successful with joint ventures and partnerships like we've had out in Asia. And so, those conversations are continuing to be ones that we'll look at that could enhance the product line, could enhance our distribution channels or access to capital from alternative sources. Allison Dukes : And as it relates to the payout ratio, there's a couple of things that I\u2019d point to as we just think about what's the appropriate payout ratio is. First, as I noted, our focus remains really investing in our own capabilities. And so, as we think about launching new capabilities, particularly in the private market space or along the partnership route as Andrew noted, those require cash and we invest our own capital in order to get these things off the ground. And so, we want to preserve our cash, flush capital for those organic growth opportunities that we have. The second aspect on my mind is we do have a debt maturity coming up a year from now next January, another $500 million note. I don't know yet whether or not we will pay that off or refinance it. It kind of depends on the set of opportunities we have before us from an organic growth perspective and just where the markets are in the rate environment. But we want to preserve flexibility to completely pay that down if that's the best opportunity we have. And so, as we think about the payout ratio for this year, if those are a couple of things in our mind. Andrew Schlossberg : I mean, the choices and flexibility that that we\u2019ve built that out that Alison was just pointing out was our goal at \u201824, to be back in the market buying back stock, which we did. But having that flexibility gives us a lot more choices here to deploy against our strategy. Bill Katz : Thank you very much. Allison Dukes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open. Glenn Schorr : Hello, thank you. Okay, so hello. So the fourth quarter, we had the insurance reimbursement, but besides that, the margin was still up, up markets, big inflows, down fee rate, controlled expenses. So, my question is, I'm hoping for better than flat assets this year. But what's your thoughts around the margin knowing what we know - what you just said about the 1% expense growth, knowing that you still inflowing nicely, but the fee rate does have some compression? How are you thinking about the margin in \u201825? Thanks. Allison Dukes : We're hoping for better than flat market too. And obviously, we build our plan with flat markets, because we think it's prudent. But this is certainly a business where we're all counting on and dependent upon growth in markets. And I think we're in a pretty diversified set of markets and in any given year, we see we've got the markets looking for us and some are working against us. But net-net we are hoping for also a positive year. Independent of that, I'm bullish on our margin and I'm bullish for a couple of reasons. The number one thing we're managing here, I mean, we noted expenses, I would say 1% expense growth year-over-year inclusive of all of these costs associated with alpha. I feel really good about and it's really a testament to some pretty disciplined expense management going on to make sure we may groom for this really important strategic focus we have and continuing to execute against alpha. But on the top-line what we're managing too is flows and flows across all of our investment capabilities and really thinking about that organic revenue growth. And I think if we can continue executing well against our focus there, we're going to see operating margin expansion in 2025. In particular, I mean, we are giving you more and more color and we hope it's helpful to really get to that organic fee rate trajectory. And I think you can see over the last couple of quarters where we had a very strong organic fee rate growth and investment capabilities like fixed income and ETFs and private markets were really at about a breakeven place for \u201824 in APAC managed and we're very optimistic that we can do a lot better than that in 2025. The biggest opportunity we have no question is narrowing the outflows in fundamental equities. That's been the headwind as it relates to that organic fee rate growth. And so, our focus and our investment performance and fundamental equities and really defending our book of business there and really focused on the pockets of growth and the sales there, that's the number one thing we can do to expand revenue independent of any market changes. And that's going to really get us to that operating margin expansion trajectory that we think we're on. Glenn Schorr : That's a perfect lead into the follow-up I had was, and may be A, how do you defend fundamental equities besides just everybody put up great performance. But my question is, is on, what do you - how are you thinking about the active ETF line up? Your ETF business has been growing. How do you think about what to transition to have an active tag along it product if you will? And that - can that be part of the solution? Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah, I mean, driving success for fundamental equities in particular, the number one is delivering investment quality. So that's going to be the number one port of focus and that includes all the things that you'd expect from us on talent and risk et cetera. Continuing to differentiate the product line and how we \u201cwrap\u201d Equity to go to market is going to be an important way that we both grow and defend. Also the way that we deliver through our sales and client service efforts. So it is it is continuing to be blocking and tackling. As it relates to active ETFs, just the starting point for us just for everyone has a baseline. We have about $10 billion in active ETFs, but we have another $20 billion or so of ETFs that are more passively oriented but involve our more fundamental or quantitative investments in. And I think both of those areas are places where you're going to see us continue to grow as the ETF vehicle will continue to be a vehicle of choice and we have the ETF platform. We know how to operationalize that. How to grow it at scale and we have excellent acts in investment capabilities. So, we've been launching some of those through the course of last year. We'll continue to look for opportunities this year. But number one thing is having good high quality investment results because that's going to really drive the success, whether it's packaged in a mutual fund or an ETF. But regardless, we should be able to win with the scale that we have. Glenn Schorr : All right. Thanks, Andrew. Thanks, Al. Andrew Schlossberg : Thank you. Allison Dukes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ben Budish with Barclays. Your line is open. Ben Budish : All right. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Just a high level question around fee rates. It looks like the ranges for most of your categories were either kind of lowered at the midpoint or narrowed. If you could kind of comment on what's been going on there? Is it sort of ongoing mix shifts within each category? Is it sort of competitive forces? And then, I am particularly curious in China there is some headlines last quarter around some ongoing pressures to kind of lower ETF fee rates. So any color on what\u2019s going on there would be helpful. Thank you.. Allison Dukes : Sure. I'll take that. I would say it is primarily ongoing mix shift within the various categories that you're seeing there. If you think about the ETFs in particular and that's one where you've seen that fee rate that range narrow a bit and trend towards the low end, we continue to see really strong demand for capabilities like the QQQM and the S&P 500 equal weight. Those are going to be in the kind of low - or sorry, mid to high-single-digit and really start to impact that fee rate down relative to perhaps the commodity strategies, which we just haven't seen a stronger demand for. So you've got mix shifts going on within those capabilities. At the same time, on APAC managed, I'd say that that rate came down over the last five quarters or six quarters because of the regulatorily mandated cuts that went into effect in 2023. Those were fully washed through in 2024 at the ETF pressure. I think our set of capabilities are well within the regulatory mandate. So we don't see that pressure really impacting our set - our product line up there. So within that, I don't - I wouldn't say any of those trends are sort of permanent in nature. IT really is a function of the demand and yeah, the impacts we are seeing really strong demand for things like detail which will be on the higher side. And so, it-s pretty demand-driven and not any sort of secular pressure. Ben Budish : Understood. And maybe a follow-up sticking on the ETF side. Andrew, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about \u2013 I think you mentioned $2.5 billion for a Finnish pension insurer. That sounded fairly interesting. Curious what the pipeline is like for those sorts of opportunities. You are sort of custom indexing within liquid ETFs. How do you see that opportunity set evolving? Thank you. Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah, I mean, something like the one we had last quarter is going to be more episodic. I wouldn't say that that there is a huge pipeline behind it. But there were two of them I think last year that were similar. So the custom indexes, that's something that we see continued demand for and it might not be just for an institution, it could be for a wealth platform, or it could be us customizing an index with one of the index providers to come up with a specific need that that we see in the marketplace. So I see custom indexing demand growing for over time. These big chunky institutional type capabilities more episodic. Ben Budish : Got it. Thank you very much. Andrew Schlossberg : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Patrick Davitt : Hey, good morning everyone. This signs the ETF adoption in Europe is really picking up steam with some even starting to call the long anticipated \u201ccatch-up\u201d with the US has really started. Firstly, do the trends you are seeing suggest that catch-up is in progress? And secondly, given your legacy book of much higher fee access the fund in Europe, do you see that shift is a net positive or negative for Invesco? Thank you. Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah, you're right to point out the growth in EMEA and some of the demand pick-up there. We do think it's in early stage secular trend that that we've been waiting for to come in Europe as we've been in that market for some time, both with our ETF ranging and with our broader institutional wealth management teams on ground. And so, we do expect that to continue to pick up. We're I think over $125 billion or so in ETF assets out in that region. With regard to where demand will come from, the private banks are quite strong in that market and it\u2019s been a largely an Institutional market. We see that it could continue to pick up on the more retail side. I'd say our line up ranges is equity heavy, but we have a strong fixed income line that we\u2019ve built and incubated over many years and I think we\u2019ll see both sides of that equation. And clearly bringing active portfolios into EMEA in ETF wrappers is something we expect to happen just like it's occurring in the US. So, we are cautiously optimistic about, EMEA ETF growth. Allison Dukes : And I would just say as it relates to the fee rate, I mean that would be a driver of some of the mix you're seeing in terms of the fee rate and the range is being on the low end or kind of trending to the lower side on the ETF fee rate. It can be ETF and they are slightly lower fee rates in Europe relative to the US line up. But again, importantly I go back to our focus is on organic fee rates, organic revenue generation, and the growth we're seeing there and the demand there is extremely positive towards overall organic revenue growth. And so it's a net positive in our view. Andrew Schlossberg : And just ETFs in general, running an efficient platform one that uses technology, one that uses our operational powers and uses our size and scale, whether we're bringing products in the US or Europe or out in Asia, we have the platform that that we can create operating leverage from. Patrick Davitt : Got it. And then as a quick follow-up. It seems like what you'd start to have that you've been working with Mass Mutual on options for the preferred. Any updates on that front as I imagine that they're now higher for longer mentality could conceivably make the paper less attractive to them? Allison Dukes : No updates. It is a topic of ongoing conversation on both sides. It's not just the rate for them. It is again that one is - that was the financing mechanism for the acquisition of Oppenheimer which, they have a tax basis in. So, there are tax capital, and rating considerations on their side, not simply sort of rates relative to market rates. So, it is a topic of ongoing conversation as we look at - are there perhaps ways to make it may be more flexible in the future, but no updates. Patrick Davitt : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ken Worthington : Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I'd love to dig into the institutional business a bit more broadly. Where is Invesco having success in building the pipeline and winning new business? I know you called out alternatives, but other areas as well. And how does the business that you're winning compared to the business you're losing? Thank you. Allison Dukes : Maybe I'll just start at the highest level of kind of how is the business doing? I'd say, it is pipeline, which I always caution is not the best indication because the pipeline is only as good as what we enter into a sales management system. But we do, obviously look at it as an indicator. It continues to expand actually and improving coming into 2025 in terms of both absolute size and the quality of the capabilities that we're really looking at being probable in 2025. It really spans all three regions and all investment capabilities and if you see the bar belling impact I mean there are, it's continued growth and kind of ETF and indexing capabilities, but also continued growth on the private market side and the real estate pipeline remains strong there with a fair amount of committed capital, that is yet to be deployed. So, the fee rates there was good too. They continue to be on the high end of our range, which is usually that mid-20s to mid-30s range, and we continue to see the pipeline be on the high end of that range. So, I'd say, overall, attractive characteristics and maybe Andrew can add a little more color in terms of what we're seeing from just kind of a client and regional perspective. Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah, to add to what Allison was saying, fixed income the other area, where institutional demand and flows have been pretty good. And the strength of our fixed income platform that I described we think will be the place in addition to the alternative and private market side where we should, we're focused on picking up momentum in fixed income. The other place I'd say is selecting the equities institutions are reallocating their portfolios and we're seeing some increased demand for Asian equities, global equities and in that space, as well but it's very, very competitive. Ken Worthington : Great. Thank you. And then, the other side of the equation, the business you're losing. What does that look like? Allison Dukes : I wanted to say, it's if I look at what the outputs were in the fourth quarter, a lot of it we noted, there were some outflows and our balanced risk strategy with DIA and that's just a strategy that's been out of favor. We also saw outflows in stable value in the quarter and that's really because of just the rates and the arbitrage there in terms of where money market rates were relative to stable value. So those are maybe what I would point to from a trend perspective and I think that last point being temporary or cyclical in nature. Ken Worthington : Okay. Great. Thanks very much. Andrew Schlossberg : Further leading it\u2019s if not, one of the leading stable value providers. So when that market comes back in demand we should do just find. Ken Worthington : Okay. Great. Thanks so much. Andrew Schlossberg : Cedric, we have time for one more question. Operator : Okay. And our last question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brian Bedell : Hello. Great. Thanks so much for squeezing me in there. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But maybe two \u2013 one just back on the operating margin outlook. Maybe Allison, just your view on the comps revenue ratio that\u2019s within your 1% guide under flat markets. And then let's say if equity markets are up 10% on a linear basis throughout the year. How would that impact your comps revenue ratio? Allison Dukes : Yeah, I would say our comps to revenue expectations are really we think about it independent of where the markets are we really look at it relative to revenue. Historically, we have been closer to the 40% to 42% kind of context you saw us. In this past year it was just over 43%. I don't know that in 2025 it is very revenue dependent. We had really strong revenue. Could we get back down to 42% possibly, without that we may be looking at something closer to 43%. Our longer term objective is to bring that back to that 38% to 42% range that we have historically operated. And I will point out when we think about total compensation and in the past years ago, we didn't always have things like severance expense, organizational change expense in there because we don't have TIR, it is a fully loaded P&L and that has driven it a bit higher to that 42% to 43% context. And I think that's still a reasonable expectation for \u201825. Brian Bedell : Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then, just lastly, just come back to the active ETFs and thank you for your comments on a prior question. Maybe more specifically, for active equity ETFs, if you can talk about your view on cloning active like current active mutual fund strategies, obviously the ones that you think are successful and would have demand for either a clone or something that was very similar to those strategies who is in the ETFs. And I guess is the only to spec either on fee pressure, from a cannibalization perspective or are you seeing maybe potential push back from the distribution channels that prefer that may prefer the mutual funds in terms of sales practice? Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah. I mean, there's many paths to where active can further end up in ETFs and you mentioned a few of them. Some of them are could be conversions. Some of them could be people doing cloning. The other is potential ETF share class on a mutual fund which there's regulatory discussions going on in the marketplace. So I think all of those avenues will continue to be ones that we look at to move forward. I can't speak for every distribution of wealth platform, but my experience \u2013 our experience is the one high quality product. And they want it in multiple vehicles and wrappers. Being able to clone things and moving it over sounds nice and elegant but it\u2019s not always the simplest way to do it. And it\u2019s an avenue we will look at it, but it's not the core path I think we\u2019ll be on.. Brian Bedell : Got it. Good. Great. Thank you very much. Andrew Schlossberg : Yeah, thank you. Allison Dukes : Thanks. Operator : Okay. Mr Schlossberg, back to you. Andrew Schlossberg : Yes, thank you, operator. And in closing, I just want to say we're very well positioned to help clients navigate the impact of evolving market dynamics and subsequent changes to their portfolio. As market sentiment improves, the client convictions continue to strengthen, this should translate to even greater scale, performance and improved profitability for Invesco as we discussed today. Given all the work we have done to strengthen our ability to anticipate, understand and meet evolving client needs, I am very excited for the future of Invesco. Again, I want to thank all of my colleagues at Invesco for their continued hard work in \u201824 and as we turn into 2025, I'm proud of our collaboration and our focus on our clients. I want to thank everyone for joining our call today. Please continue to reach out to our investor relations team for any additional questions and we appreciate your ongoing interest in Invesco and look forward to speaking with all of you again soon, Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. You may all disconnect at this time.",
