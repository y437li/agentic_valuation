Kabili - Macquarie Research Mark Larry Henneman - Mairs and Power, Inc. Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Bemis Company hosted First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Erin Winters. Please go ahead. Erin Winters : Thank you. Welcome to our first quarter 2014 conference call. Today is April 24, 2014. After today's call, a replay will be available on our website, bemis.com, under the Investor Relations section. Joining me for this call today are Bemis Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Henry Theisen; our Chief Operating Officer, Bill Austen; our Vice President and Controller and interim Principal Financial Officer, Jerry Krempa; and our Vice President and Treasurer, Melanie Miller. Today, Henry will begin with comments on business performance and outlook for the remainder of 2014, and then Jerry will cover the financial statements. After our comments, we will answer any questions you have. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to direct you to our website, bemis.com, under the Investor Relations tab, where you will find our press release, along with our supplemental schedules. We'll be referring to these schedules at points throughout today's discussion. On today's call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures as we talk about Bemis' performance. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures that we consider most comparable can be found in the press release and the supplemental schedules. I'd like to remind everyone that statements regarding future performance of the company made in this teleconference are forward-looking and are therefore subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from historical, expected or projected results due to a variety of factors. Please refer to Bemis Company's regular SEC filings, including the most recently filed Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, to review these risk factors. Now I'll turn the call over to Henry Theisen. Henry J. Theisen: Thank you, Erin, and thank you for joining us today. Today, we reported adjusted earnings of $0.58 per share for the first quarter of 2014, an increase of 9.4% over the prior first quarter and in line with our most recent guidance. During the first quarter, we benefited from strong pricing discipline, a stabilizing European economy and our growing business in China. We prudently controlled costs, refocused resources on our core business and repurchased 1.1 million shares of stock. Unit volumes were lower than expected, driven by inflationary pressures in Brazil, along with the slowdown at our customers who were challenged by recent weather events in North America. While these weather events also created some headwinds at our own plants, our business teams did a great job of managing operations to minimize the impact. As we enter our seasonally strong second quarter, we are seeing the normal increase in orders from our customers. During this first quarter, we executed plans that support our goals of margin improvement and value-added volume growth. For example, in Brazil, we expanded our capacity to produce high-barrier films to meet the demand for protein packaging. In Europe, we brought up additional multilayer capacity to support the growing need for roll stock in high-barrier shrink applications for fresh meat and cheese. In North America, we are starting up new capacity on a barrier sheet line that will support increasing demand for shelf-stable and refrigerated liquid applications, such as coffee creamers, pudding cups, yogurt cups and single-serve coffee formats. In addition, our robust 2014 capital expenditure plan will further support the expanding market for standup pouch formats, reflecting the continuing product launches that require superior sealability and barrier properties. We accelerated innovation by introducing new products to our customers that will deliver measurable volumes to support our growth objectives during the remaining of 2014. For example, in Brazil, we scaled up a unique flexible standup pouch for vegetables that replaced the metal can and provides freshness without refrigeration or preservatives. In the United States, our packaging solution is supporting the launch of single-serve protein snack packs for a variety of brands. In Asia, we qualified our proprietary films for our new extrusion facility in Foshan, China for use in stringent medical packaging applications produced for our Asia-based customers. This quarter, we completed the sale of Paper Packaging Division. The sale of this division narrows our focus to our higher-margin markets and the growth opportunities in high-barrier flexible packaging, medical and pharmaceutical packaging and packaging for developing markets in Asia Pacific. In addition, we announced the closure of our Pressure Sensitive plant in Stow, Ohio. We expect this plant closure to improve market competitiveness and to better position our Pressure Sensitive Materials business for long-term growth. We appreciate the dedication and talents of the employees involved in this initiative. With the closure of this facility, we substantially eliminate the use of solvent in our Pressure Sensitive Materials operations, which will also contribute to our environmental sustainability commitment to reduce solvent usage by 20% by the year 2020. In our Pressure Sensitive Materials segment, we are also pleased by the strengthening economic environment in Europe that stimulated the increase in value-added graphics products sold during the first quarter of 2014. With respect to raw materials, suppliers implemented a polyethylene cost increase during the first quarter. Specialty resins were relatively stable during this quarter. We are confirming our guidance for the full year of 2014 in the range of $2.40 to $2.55. As mentioned at the beginning of the year, where we are within this range will depend upon the impact of the Brazilian currency, raw material pricing, the momentum of positive volume trends and our continued successful commercialization of new business awards. Second quarter EPS guidance is in the range of $0.61 to $0.66. As we enter our seasonally strong second quarter, we are confident in our positive volume outlook, given our current customer order levels. Our business teams are commercializing new opportunities, and we are confident in the margin growth and return on invested capital improvement that we will deliver. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jerry for his comments. Jerry S. Krempa: Thank you, Henry, and good morning, everyone. Before we get into color on the income statement, I would like to highlight a couple of unique items related to the first quarter of 2014 that are reflected on our reconciliation of non-GAAP earnings per share that was included in our earnings release and are also shown on Page 3 of the supplemental schedules that Erin previously mentioned. There are 2 items that reconcile our GAAP earnings of $0.48 per share to our non-GAAP earnings of $0.58 per share. First, as Henry mentioned, we announced the closure of our Pressure Sensitive Materials plant in Stow, Ohio. Operations at this facility are scheduled to cease during May. In the first quarter of 2014, we recorded a pretax charge of approximately $25 million, or $0.16 per share related to this closure. This charge primarily affected cost of products sold on the income statement and was excluded from the calculation of adjusted diluted earnings per share. The charge includes an estimated settlement of a multiemployer pension plan liability, employee severance and benefit costs and fixed asset-related expenses. We expect the charges in 2014 to total approximately $30 million. The second unique item this quarter was a sale of our Paper Packaging Division on March 31. Net proceeds from the transaction totaled $79.8 million. A $9.4 million pretax gain on the sale was recorded as part of other nonoperating income and was excluded from the calculation of adjusted diluted earnings per share as noted on Page 3 of the supplemental schedules. Proceeds from the sale will be directed towards our capital allocation priorities this year. Next, I will walk through the sales and operating profit performance of each of our reportable segments. As I discuss sales, focus on Page 4 of the supplemental schedules, which provides detail on the year-over-year changes in net sales by segment. Beginning with our U.S. Packaging operations at the top of the page, which represents about 60% of total Bemis annual sales, we saw a 1% decrease in first quarter net sales as compared to the first quarter of last year. The primary driver of this decrease was the divestiture of the Clysar business last year. The 1.6% organic growth in the first quarter of 2014 represents the net favorable impact of increased price mix, partially offset by lower overall unit volumes. While volumes for processed meat, cheese and dairy packaging were up modestly compared to last year, we saw single-digit declines in volumes for fresh meat, dry foods and confectionery and snack applications. These lower volumes generally reflect the impact of weather events in North America, as Henry mentioned earlier. One volume exception was an over-wrap for bottled water, where we saw double-digit increases in the first quarter as a result of the weather. U.S. Packaging operating profit for the first quarter of 2014 was 12.4% of net sales, which compares to an adjusted operating profit of 12.8% of net sales in the first quarter of 2013. While we incurred some weather-related costs associated with energy and transportation in the quarter, the key impact to operating profit stems from lower unit volumes and the resulting fixed cost absorption challenge. Let me move on to a discussion of our Global Packaging operations, which represents about 30% of total Bemis annual sales. Looking at the middle of Page 4 of the supplemental schedules, this segment reported a net sales decrease of 3.2% when compared to the first quarter of 2013. Currency movement negatively impacted sales by 8.4%, primarily related to the weakness in the Brazilian real. The acquisition of our extrusion platform in Foshan, China increased net sales by 4.6%. The remaining organic growth of less than 1% reflects higher price mix, partially offset by lower unit volumes. Our business teams have diligently increased selling prices in Brazil in light of the inflationary environment in that region, which has put some downward pressure on volume. Operating profit for the Global Packaging segment was 6.8% of net sales for the first quarter of 2014. The currency effect negatively impacted operating profit by $2.8 million, primarily driven by weakness in the Brazilian real. Without this negative currency impact, first quarter 2014 operating profit would have been 7.5% of net sales, an increase from the prior year's adjusted operating profit of 6.9% of net sales. This reflects the benefit of higher selling prices and better mix, with higher unit sales of value-added products. In our Pressure Sensitive Materials segment, which represents about 10% of total Bemis annual sales, net sales for 2014 increased 1.6% as compared to the first quarter of 2013. This includes a benefit from currency translation of 1.4%. Organic sales therefore increased nominally, as noted on Page 4 of the supplemental schedules. The benefit of improved price mix from increased sales of value-added graphic and technical products was substantially offset by lower volumes of lower-margin label products. As previously mentioned, operating profit for the Pressure Sensitive Materials segment includes the $25 million charge related to the announced plant closure. Without this charge, operating profit for the Pressure Sensitive Materials segment would have been 7.4% of net sales in the first quarter of 2014, as compared to 5.5% of net sales last year. This healthy increase was driven by the higher sales of value-added graphics and technical products in addition to improved global production efficiencies. Now I will shift my commentary to consolidated Bemis results. Excluding the impact of plant closure costs, first quarter gross margins at 19.3% of net sales were in line with the first quarter of 2013, reflecting the incremental benefit of facility consolidation savings, offset by lower unit volumes and the related fixed cost absorption. Selling, general and administrative expense was 9.9% of net sales for the first quarter, in line with our expectations of 10% for the year. Our increased investment in research and development demonstrates our effort to accelerate the pace of innovation to deliver growth in our target areas of high-barrier packaging, medical and pharmaceutical packaging and packaging for developing markets in Asia Pacific. The income tax rate for the first quarter was 34.3%. We expect the income tax rate for the balance of 2014 to be approximately 35%. Cash flow from operating activities for this first quarter totaled $12.5 million, slightly higher than the first quarter of 2013 and seasonally in line with expectations. We continue to expect 2014 cash flow from operations to be in excess of $500 million. On the statement of cash flows, note that the change in deferred income tax line reflects a use of cash of $12.5 million related to the realization of deferred tax liabilities, primarily associated with the Paper Packaging transaction. Capital expenditures for the first quarter were about $34 million, in line with expectations this early in the year. We continue to expect our capital expenditures for 2014 to be approximately $175 million. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of Bemis stock, which more than offset the impact of long-term stock incentive programs. Our remaining authorization from the Board of Directors is approximately 1.4 million shares. Quickly touching on our leverage metric, net debt to adjusted EBITDA at the end of the first quarter was 2.1x, consistent with year end 2013 and close to our target rate of 2x. As we have discussed, we intend to invest capital wisely and do not intend to accumulate cash. As previously stated by management, our priorities are to support our dividend program, invest in organic growth, fund strategic acquisitions and balance share purchases with deleveraging. We have $400 million in bonds that will mature in August 2014. We have a number of refinancing options, including commercial paper, bank debt or the issuance of new bonds. We are weighing our options carefully, but we expect to refinance at an interest rate lower than the current fixed bond rate of 5.65%. Thank you for your time today. We will now open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Phil Ng with Jefferies. Alexander Hutter - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : This is Alex Hutter on for Phil. On the CapEx guide, it looks like you took some top end out, and I believe it was $175 million to $200 million. Does that reflect you guys investing in fewer projects or potentially slightly softer volume outlook for the year or is it just kind of an adjustment? William F. Austen: This is Bill Austen, I'll take that one. When we put our guidance together of $175 million to $200 million earlier in the year late last year, a lot of that is done with some engineering estimates. And now that we've gotten into the quarter, we have really refined those engineering estimates. We've also worked with some of our suppliers, and we have worked to improve on some of the costs associated with that CapEx. Now that we're further into the quarter, we have much more visibility. We've narrowed that down to $175 million because we've done a nice job in engineering and in our sourcing arena to bring that number down. Alexander Hutter - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay, great. And then just one follow-up. In PSM, you guys saw some strong margin growth from the reversal of the mixed headwinds you guys have seen. Is that a trend you guys expect will continue? Do you think things have bottomed or is it a kind of a one-quarter event? William F. Austen: Well, I think we're going to continue to see improvement in our Pressure Sensitive business. A lot of this is generated in Europe as the economy has strengthened a little bit or stabilized is maybe a better word. And we're seeing a pickup in graphics, and of course, graphics is one of our higher-margin parts of our business. And so I think that Pressure Sensitive is going to operate about where it did in the first quarter. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird & Co. Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : It's actually Mehul Dalia sitting -- it's actually Mehul sitting in for Ghansham. Can you quantify how much weather impacted you on the cost side during the quarter? Henry J. Theisen: If you take a look at more of our fixed costs, if you're talking about -- because we have some facilities that were down and didn't have power, employees couldn't get to work. We had some higher energy costs, some freight costs that hit us, that's about $0.01. If you want to talk about volumes which really kind of make up the other part of it, we thought we would do slightly better than GDP. And so whatever the difference is between slightly better than GDP and where we ended up, I think it's kind of the volume trend that our customers were talking about and our customers were concerned with their sales. So that's about what it is. Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay, great. And just as a follow-up, just as you said, volumes came a little bit lighter than your GDP plus expectations. Do you think that you can make it up throughout the remainder of the year? Henry J. Theisen: I don't think we'll make up those volumes because if people didn't buy those products, and most of the products we sell are perishable products, so I don't think we're going to make it up. I think we're going to continue going forward doing slightly better than GDP. Operator : And we'll take our next question from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Alaxandar Wang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : It's actually Alax Wang sitting in for George. Can you comment on how high-barrier volumes are doing versus some of your more commodity-like products? Henry J. Theisen: We have a strategy to grow our higher-barrier products, our value-added products, and we've been talking about that for the last few years. We saw -- and actually we saw a slight bit of growth in our meat business, in our dairy business. Our problems or lack of volumes really come in more of those commodity type areas that we've been trying to shrink in the size of our company. Alaxandar Wang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Understood. And then just as a follow-up, can you discuss pricing overall in Flexible, and then maybe if you could comment on high barrier in particular as well? Henry J. Theisen: Overall, I think our markets are very competitive. We have a fragmented competitive base. Pricing and competition are no different today than they were last quarter or 2 years ago. They're still the same consistent environment that we operate in. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Henry, I just had a question for you. On the -- on your commentary, when you reiterate the full year guidance, you said the high end of the guidance, and I might get this wrong, but I think you said it was contingent upon FX, mostly the real volumes, and I think the third thing was productivity or margin improvement. Of those 3, which one is most impactful to whether or not you can get to the high end of the guidance and why? Henry J. Theisen: I think the most impactful thing we have is the successful commercialization of our new business. Volumes are important for us now. We have to grow our volumes. And we've got a lot of good projects in the pipeline that should be commercializing in the second quarter, the third quarter, the fourth quarter. We've also got a lot of good products -- projects within our customer base that I can't talk about because they're still not out in the marketplace. But to me, it's going to be the growth of those new products and how fast and how well we execute the commercialization of those new businesses. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. And if I look at your growth, and I think you mentioned this before, it looks like volumes were maybe down about 1%. GDP, on average, across your geographies is maybe up 1.5% or so, somewhere in that range. What gives you confidence that you can then get to, if you were at minus 1% volume for the first quarter to the 4% total top end growth for Packaging in 2014? Henry J. Theisen: I think in the second, third and fourth quarters, we really should do slightly better than GDP. And I say that because I look at the orders we have. I look at the new products, the commercialization of business that's in line. And then you look at what happened to us in the first quarter, and those volumes are really related to our customers and their problems with the weather. And we can't change what happened in the first quarter, but you can pretty well pinpoint exactly where those -- the lack of volume occurred and why, and that weather pattern should, I hope -- I'm living in Wisconsin, I hope it goes away. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Just 2 questions. One, Henry, with respect to the good order levels you've seen thus far in the second quarter, is that just all seasonality/better weather or there -- is there something more to it than that? Henry J. Theisen: I think it's just really the seasonality. Our second quarter is generally a good sales quarter for us. You see the switch into more the summer-type products in the grilling season and all of those things. So I think the order pattern is consistent with going from first quarter to second quarter. Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Okay. And just a broader question. Obviously, you sold Paper Packaging. You're closing your Pressure Sensitive plant. You closed enormous facilities last year. Should we read anything into your [indiscernible] activity [indiscernible] [Technical Difficulty] Operator : And we'll take our next question from Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo Securities. Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : It's actually Gabe Hajde for Chris. One question around the plant closure in Ohio. Can you talk about any [indiscernible] for a return on that project or [indiscernible]. Henry J. Theisen: [Indiscernible]. Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Can you? Melanie E. R. Miller: This is Melanie. You mean with regard to what we expect going forward in results of operations for Pressure Sensitive would be -- that plant was a --- sorry? Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : [Indiscernible] You do intend to make some x million dollars of savings from the 115 less employees or how should we think about it? Melanie E. R. Miller: No, it's more focused on the reduction in the improvement of the underlying business going forward because it was a -- we'll call it a low margin plant that had lower production than the plant could support going forward. Henry J. Theisen: I think the best -- I was just going to say, we also changed the adhesive technology from solvents to 100% solid, and that was the real driver here so that we could reach our 2020 goal of sustainability with less solvents. We moved that platform of solvent-based adhesive. We moved a lot of it over to 100% solids, UV technology in an entirely different facility. So the Stow facility became somewhat redundant and older. Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : In the press release, I think, Henry, you had mentioned some commercialization of new products and I've heard a couple of times on the call. Can you provide some sort of parameters around what that might look like or quantify it at a high level, how we can kind of see it flow through for the year or the next 24 months? I mean, is that a... Henry J. Theisen: I don't think I can really quantify that for you in a dollar figure. These are some new products that are launched by our customers. For example, the single-serve protein snack, it's going to kind of depend upon how well that does in the marketplace. A lot of these things are not really like taken from somebody else. There are new products and new things are coming out, and I hope very much that they are very popular and a lot of people buy them. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Al Kabili with Macquarie. Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research : Henry, I was wondering if you could just help us with how you're thinking about the outlook on the Global Packaging side from a volume perspective for the rest of the year, as I think you mentioned sort of the price increases you've had to do on the inflationary front has pushed down volumes in Brazil, and how do you see that playing out the remainder of the year? Henry J. Theisen: I think that there's a lot of inflation going on in Brazil, and it's going to affect what people want to buy, their purchasing power, how they're going to do it. I don't know how Brazil is going to do with its inflationary presence, but I would suspect that Brazil will continue through the rest of the year, much like it is in the first quarter. Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research : Okay. And then a second question, just wanted to clarify on the guidance, are you factoring in any expected resin decline during May, June in that outlook? And in addition, from an order pattern perspective, I think you said it was sort of the normal seasonal order pattern that you've seen sort of pick up in 2Q thus far, and I just wanted to clarify, is that adjusting for the weather impact because given that weather sort of pushed down 1Q volumes, you'd probably have a little bit of a bigger-than-normal sort of pickup in 2Q that I just wanted to clarify there as well. William F. Austen: Yes, this is Bill Austen. On the resin front, as Henry said in his comments, we saw -- we took an increase in the first quarter as the resin guys passed through. But we have our model going forward for the rest of the year, we have flat resin pricing built into our plan going forward for the rest of the year. Now on the volume side, as you talked about weather-related issues in the first quarter, you're not going to get that volume back. I mean, that inventory is in the pipeline, so people aren't going to eat more just because there was bad weather, so that inventory is going to work its way through the pipeline. And we're just seeing our normal seasonal second quarter pickup in orders rate that we see every year. But no, we will not see an increase in orders and/or volumes because of the bad weather in Q1. Operator : And our next question comes from Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division : I think when you were going through the segments earlier in U.S. Packaging, you had talked about the volume in the first quarter. You mentioned fresh meat was somewhat pressured, confectionary, a couple others that I didn't hear. But one thing that I did notice, it didn't sound like cheese and dairy saw that much volume weakness. Can you talk a little bit more about what you saw in cheese and dairy in the first quarter, especially in U.S. Packaging? And if any of the inflationary pressures that your customers are seeing should impact volumes as we go forward? Henry J. Theisen: We saw in the higher value-added processed meats, dairy, cheeses, we saw a slight growth. It was less than what we expected, but we did see a slight growth in those areas. Areas like you talked about, candy, confection, some of the personal health care, things like that, that we have talked about that are more competitive, a lot more competitive, don't involve some of the technology that we have in our company. We have been, in the past, as we closed facilities, taking pricing, walking away from some business, those markets where we aren't given the chance to earn the margins we think we need or deserve for our technology. Those were stagnant to slightly worse. I made a comment on fresh meat. Fresh meat is so small in our company. We are such a distant #2 that -- slightly up, slightly down, it really doesn't move the needle for us. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay, fair enough. And then just on PSM, I want to make sure I heard your commentary right. Somebody was asking about the margins in the second quarter. Were you saying that the margin -- you thought the margin would be similar in the second quarter as it was in 1Q '14? And then... William F. Austen: I think our Pressure Sensitive business will do in the second quarter similar to the first quarter. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Just 2 quick ones. Henry, at what point do you expect total sales to stop declining on a year-on-year basis, assuming stable exchange rates? Henry J. Theisen: If you assume a stable exchange rate, I would expect to see our volumes stabilize here in the second quarter and maybe even have a little bit of a gain. I really thought we were going to start to see our volumes coming back in the first quarter, but I didn't plan on a polar vortex. Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Got it. And you touched on this earlier, but in terms of the pricing environment in North America, I think you said you hadn't seen any meaningful changes there. Obviously, your large public competitor has been vocal about raising prices in recent months. Can you comment at all in that regard? Henry J. Theisen: Like I said, we really are in the process side of the business, and that competitor is really in the fresh meat side of the business where we have a very distant #2. We don't see any change in pricing patterns or anything in the marketplace. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Mark Henneman with Mairs and Power. Mark Larry Henneman - Mairs and Power, Inc.: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the investments that you've been making in your business for the last 3 and 4 years, as you've been more focused on return on invested capital, now that you've got some time. Can you give us some indication that those investments are earning a higher incremental return, now that you've had the chance to see how those investments have worked out? Melanie E. R. Miller: Well, with regard -- Mark, this is Melanie. I think we could divide that -- if we talk about investments alone and separate out the facility consolidation exercise, we really have been focused on expanding our capacity for value-added high-barrier products. And examples of that would be the platform we have now for liquid packaging and other -- and variations on that, that are on high barrier. And then that goes around the globe. William F. Austen: Yes. Mark, this is Bill Austen. If you look over the last few years, as Melanie has just described, we've put in multilayer extrusion capacity into Brazil to upscale our product portfolio in that part of the world to go after the protein packaging, the barrier requirements for meat and cheese. And we've seen a nice gain in that part of the world in Brazil, specifically, around our protein platform. We've seen nice pickups there. We've actually transferred technology from the U.S. to that part of the world. We've put -- we're putting the same kind of capacity into Asia, now that we have an extrusion platform there. If you look at the recent extrusion capacity that we've put into Europe, it is for a new type of barrier film, which is a flat film to get away from shrink bags. So all of those products and all of that entire portfolio has a much better return than does confectionary packaging, if you will. So we're changing the mix through these new assets that we're putting in place around the world, and we're putting in, as Henry said or Melanie has said, to capitalize on this conversion of metal and glass containers to Flexible Packaging for the liquid categories in the U.S., which is a, for us, is a large opportunity as we go forward. And that would be for these kinds of baby foods, fruit slurries, all of those types of products that are moving out of cans and glass to flexibles. That's where our investments have gone over the last few years, and that's where they'll continue to go, as well as investing in our medical and pharma platform, as we continue to see that as a bigger part of our business. Henry J. Theisen: In North America, as we went through the closing of the facilities, we really looked at our product mix, and as we've talked about in the past, took some very courageous decisions around pricing and about what business we would move. And we've been diligently working on using our assets in the more high-value and high-barrier areas rather than the commodity areas. So as we see that product mix shift, we also see a higher return on our invested capital. In addition, we are being very diligent about new CapEx spending, and we're using return on invested capital as a key component in making any decision around capital spending. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Just 2 quick ones. Henry, have you seen any change in the competitive landscape in PSM? And then just if you could give us an update on the CFO search, I'd appreciate it. Henry J. Theisen: No, I don't think we've seen any change in the competitive landscape in the Pressure Sensitive business. As far as the search for a CFO, we are continuing to go through the process. We have very capable financial people here at the Bemis Company. We're not in any rush. We want to make sure that we get the right person. So the search continues, and we're very confident in the people that we have here at the Bemis Company, and we don't feel pressure to have to go out and fill that position with someone that isn't the best candidate. Operator : [Operator Instructions] It appears we have no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Erin Winters for any additional or closing remarks.

Kabili - Macquarie Research Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Bemis Company-hosted Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Erin Winters. Please go ahead, ma'am. Erin Winters : Thank you. Welcome to our second quarter 2014 conference call. Today is July 24, 2014. After today's call, a replay will be available on our website, bemis.com, under the Investor Relations section. Joining me for this call today are Bemis Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Henry Theisen; our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Bill Austen; our Vice President and Controller and interim Principal Financial Officer, Jerry Krempa; and our Vice President and Treasurer, Melanie Miller. Today, Henry will begin with comments on this quarter's business performance and outlook for the remainder of 2014. Bill will then discuss growth and capital expenditures, and finally, Jerry will cover the financial statements. After our comments, we will answer any questions you have. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to direct you to our website, bemis.com, under the Investor Relations tab, where you will find our press release, along with supplemental schedules. We will be referring to these schedules at points throughout today's discussion. On today's call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures as we talk about Bemis' performance. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures that we consider most comparable can be found in the press release and supplemental schedules. I'd like to remind everyone that statements regarding future performance of the company made during this call are forward-looking and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from historical, expected or projected results due to a variety of factors. Please refer to Bemis Company's regular SEC filings, including the most recently filed Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, to review these risk factors. Now I'll turn the call over to Henry Theisen. Henry J. Theisen: Thank you, Erin, and thank you, all, for joining us. I am very pleased with our performance this quarter. We delivered record EPS and strong margin improvement, grew sales in our target end markets and positioned our business for additional value-added volume growth in future periods. We delivered our highest gross margin percent since 2009 during this quarter at 19.8% as compared to 19.4% last year. This margin improvement was driven by continued pricing discipline and improved sales mix. In our U.S. Packaging segment, we improved operating margin to 13.9%, a healthy increase compared to 13% last year. We grew our target dairy and liquid end markets consistent with our strategy to increase sales of high-barrier value-added products. In our liquid packaging business, we continue to see the positive impacts of the conversion away from historical formats, such as glass and metal cans, to our lighter and more sustainable flexible packaging. In our dairy packaging end market, we gained some small yet strategic wins with our customers. Beyond these target end markets, overall unit volumes weren't quite as strong this quarter as compared to last year for a variety of reasons, including high beef and pork prices. Our strategy to sell the right products is paying off. We sold a larger portion of new, innovative products that earn a higher price based on the value they add to our customers. In our Global Packaging segment, this quarter's performance was consistent with last year. While we faced volume headwinds in Brazil, where inflation continues to burden consumers, we are pleased with the strong unit volume growth in our global health care packaging business. We have targeted this end market as an area of growth as it fits with our strategy to sell technology-driven value-added products. Our innovative solutions meet our customers' stringent packaging requirements for safety and sterility. In our Pressure Sensitive Materials segment, we also delivered improved performance this quarter. Our profit levels benefited from the double-digit increases of value-added graphics products, driven by a stabilizing economic environment in Europe. Our business teams have managed costs well over the last few years in light of economic volatility, and this will continue to benefit performance in the future. With respect to the raw materials market, the polyethylene resin cost increase earlier in the year was successfully passed along in accordance with our customer pricing agreements. Turning to guidance. Our third quarter EPS guidance is in the range of $0.65 to $0.70. Second and third quarters are seasonally our strongest periods, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver improved performance during the second half of 2014. We are raising the bottom end of our guidance for the full year 2014. Our previous full year guidance was in the range of $2.40 to $2.55, and we are now further defining that range to $2.45 to $2.55. Looking at the first half of 2014, I am pleased with how our businesses performed. We achieved modest organic sales growth in our U.S. Packaging and Global Packaging segments. We delivered sequentially improving gross margins during each quarter this year. We redeployed the cash from the sale of the Paper Packaging division to repurchase 2 million shares of stock during the first half of 2014. And most importantly, our business teams are commercializing new opportunities and expanding capacity to support our target end markets. We are confident in the margin growth and return on invested capital improvement this will deliver in 2014 and beyond. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill for some additional commentary on our growth plan and capital expenditures. William F. Austen: Thank you, Henry, and good morning, everyone. Like Henry, I am pleased with the execution of our growth strategy in the first half of 2014. Our business teams continue to focus on serving customers, increasing market share and improving sales mix, where our technologies provide a sustainable advantage. Today, I'll provide some color on the execution of our growth agenda and our confidence in our performance during the remainder of the year and into 2015. We have a strong pipeline of new business awards to support growth during the second half of 2014, and we are also investing in research and development projects that will create additional long-term opportunities. Before sharing details about our new business pipeline, I'll revisit the background of our 2014 growth expectations. As we stated in January, we anticipate that, directionally, our 2014 sales volume will be slightly better than GDP. Market share gains and new product innovations will provide the incremental unit volumes. While volume is important, our main focus remains in selling value-added products to our customers. As Henry mentioned, during the second quarter, we strategically increased unit sales to liquid, dairy and health care packaging end markets. We are pleased with this targeted growth and with the work we have done to lay the foundation for continued success in the coming periods. We have an innovative team of research and development engineers around the world, developing breakthrough technologies, prioritizing and focusing research effort and accelerating new products to market. We have introduced new products to our customers that will deliver steady volumes and margin improvement during the second half of 2014 and beyond. From a geographic perspective, these innovations are applicable to customers around the globe. In the U.S. during the second quarter, we were awarded several pieces of new business that will ramp up during the remainder of 2014 and beyond. For example, we are now selling our roll stock solution for high-barrier shrink applications for markets such as fresh meat and cheese. Our solution replaces the use of shrink bags and supplies our customers with substantial savings in their converting process. Next, our innovative barrier sheet, along with its easy-open lid, is expanding into new liquid categories. This chlorine-free packaging solution delivers cost savings and sustainability to our customers by allowing for recyclability in their packaging process. Also in the U.S., we continue to convert our customers' packaging from historical, coded boxes to our flexible formats. Examples of recent conversions are frozen breakfast foods that are now offered in convenient stand-up pouches rather than wax-coated boxes, and our frozen -- and frozen vegetable pur\u00e9es now offered in flexible bag rather than a box. In Asia Pacific, we have added capacity to support the growth of our protective films into new electronics applications. Our extrusion platform in Asia is also poised to grow with the expanding needs of our protein and medical device customers within that region. Our performance is strengthening with order backlogs at higher levels as we enter the third quarter. In Latin America, we continued to extend our existing technologies to the Brazilian marketplace as it transitions to advancing -- to advanced packaging applications. For example, our proprietary barrier films are now being used to package frozen vegetables in Brazil. Another example is our Peel-Reseal films that just launched in the Brazilian marketplace to provide convenience and reclosable features in luncheon meat applications. In Europe, we are focused on niche packaging markets. As the economy continues to stabilize in this region of the world, we expect performance to continue to improve as well. Turning to the topic of capital spend. We continued to execute our capital expenditure plan for 2014 to support our long-term growth strategy. We are investing in state-of-the-art capacity for top line growth and to further strengthen our competitive position. As previously guided, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $175 million. This year's increased capital spending reflects investments to meet the growing liquid market needs, to enhance our health care packaging capabilities and to expand our sealant and protective film extrusion platform. As we move beyond 2014, we expect capital expenditures to be around D&A to support increasing global demand for flexible packaging. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jerry for his comments on the financial results. Jerry S. Krempa: Thank you, Bill, and hello, everyone. This morning, Bemis Company reported record second quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.65, which was near the top end of our most recent guidance. There are no adjustments to GAAP earnings this quarter. These earnings reflect a 6.6% increase compared with the 2013 second quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.61. The prior year amount is shown on Page 3 of the supplemental schedules, which are available on our website and will be referenced throughout my comments. This quarter, we delivered gross margin as a percentage of net sales of 19.8% compared with 19.4% last year. This is our highest gross margin percentage since 2009. I will now discuss the sales and operating profit performance of each of our reportable segments. As I discuss sales, refer to Page 4 of the supplemental schedules, which provides detail on the year-over-year changes in net sales by reportable segment. Our U.S. Packaging operations, which represent about 60% of total Bemis annual sales, saw a decrease in second quarter net sales compared with the second quarter of last year. The primary driver of this decrease was the divestitures of our Paper Packaging division in 2014 and our Clysar division in 2013. Aside from the divestitures, overall organic sales in U.S. Packaging were down slightly. Volumes in our target end markets of dairy and liquid grew at strong single-digit percentages compared with last year. Our meat category showed a modest decline in volume, while we saw, on average, mid single-digit declines in dry foods, confectionery and snack and beverages. U.S. Packaging operating profit for the second quarter of 2014 was 13.9% of net sales compared with 13% of net sales in the second quarter of 2013, approximately 1/2 of this improvement related to the favorable impact of higher unit sales to our targeted dairy and liquid end markets, the remaining improvement related to the favorable mix impact from the Paper Packaging and Clysar divestitures. Next, I will discuss our Global Packaging operations, which represent about 30% of total Bemis annual sales. Looking at the middle of Page 4 of the supplemental schedules, this segment reported a net sales decrease of less than 1% when compared with the second quarter of 2013. Currency movement negatively impacted sales by 5.8%, primarily related to the weakness in the Brazilian real. The acquisition of our extrusion platform in Foshan, China increased net sales by 5.2%. Remaining organic sales were approximately flat. We saw mid single-digit increases in volumes of global health care packaging, as well as increases in meat and cheese packaging in Europe. These increases were offset by overall lower volumes in the sluggish Brazilian economy. Second quarter operating profit for the Global Packaging segment was 7.2% of net sales, which was consistent with last year. The currency effect negatively impacted operating profit by $1.7 million, primarily driven by weakness in the Brazilian real. The benefit of higher selling prices and better mix in target end markets was offset by the negative impact of overall weak demand in Brazil. In our Pressure Sensitive Materials segment, which represents about 10% of our business, net sales for 2014 increased 1.6% compared with the second quarter of 2013. This includes a 2% benefit from currency translation. Organic sales, therefore, decreased slightly as noted on Page 4 of the supplemental schedules. The double-digit increase in volumes of value-added graphic products was substantially offset by lower volumes of technical and label products. Operating profit for the Pressure Sensitive Materials segment was 6.8% of net sales in the second quarter of 2014 compared with 4.2% of net sales last year. This increase was driven by the impact of higher sales of graphic products, in addition to improved global production efficiencies and cost controls. Now I will shift to consolidated Bemis results. Selling, general and administrative expense was 9.6% of net sales for the second quarter. We expect these expenses to be just under 10% for the year, which is down slightly from the prior year. Research and development expense was 1% of net sales for the second quarter, up slightly from the prior year. Our increased investment in research and development demonstrates our effort to accelerate the pace of innovation and deliver growth in our target markets. We expect this to continue through 2014 and beyond. The income tax rate for the second quarter was 34.4%. We expect the income tax rate for the balance of the year to be approximately 34.5%. Cash flow from operating activities for the second quarter totaled $57.9 million. This reflects the cash payments associated with the closure of the Pressure Sensitive Materials plant in Stow, Ohio and generally higher working capital levels in the second quarter. We expect 2014 cash flow from operations to be $450 million. This revised expectation considers the cash expenses related to the Stow closure, as well as tax payments related to the gain on the sale of the Paper Packaging division. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were about $34 million. Spending levels will ramp up during the second half of 2014 as we install equipment that was ordered earlier in the year. In May, our Board of Directors increased the authorization for share repurchases by 8 million shares, supplementing our current buyback authorization. We repurchased approximately 1 million shares of Bemis stock during the second quarter of 2014. As of June 30, our remaining authorization from the Board of Directors was approximately 8.4 million shares. Quickly touching on our leverage metric. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA at the end of the second quarter was 2.2x, slightly above our target rate of 2x. We have $400 million in bonds with a fixed interest rate of 5.65% that will mature on August 1 of this year. We plan to refinance these bonds with a $200 million bank term loan that will mature in the year 2022 and another $200 million of commercial paper. In the current interest rate environment, replacing the fixed rate bonds with this variable rate debt will lower the interest rate on this $400 million of debt from 5.65% to approximately 1%. Thank you for your time today. We will now open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question, we'll hear from Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division : I just wanted to dig a little bit deeper on the margin improvement year-over-year. How much of the improvement -- of the 40-basis-point improvement in gross margins year-over-year was related to the sale of the Paper Packaging business versus some of the margin -- some of the mix issues that you were talking about maybe in the business that you kept? Jerry S. Krempa: At the gross margin level, approximately 1/2 -- this is Jerry, I'm sorry. Approximately 1/2 of the improvement is related to the divestitures of the Paper Packaging division and Clysar. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. And when I look at the old guidance versus the new guidance, did the old guidance assume the change in the interest rate for the $400 million refinancing or not? Jerry S. Krempa: Yes, it did. I think we spoke about that last quarter about our intention to refinance, and this was one of the options we were looking at, at the time. Operator : And next, we'll move to Philip Ng with Jefferies. Alexander Hutter - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : This is actually Alex Hutter on for Phil. You mentioned the roll stock opportunity to replace shrink bags in U.S. Packaging. Can you just give a bit more color on that opportunity? How the margins stack up? How significant an opportunity it is for you now? How big you think it could become? And where you think your market share could go in that market, given your current capacity? Henry J. Theisen: Let me turn that over to Bill, he's closer to it than I am. William F. Austen: Alex, it's a great question. We are a smaller player in the shrink bag business, and we've developed a great technology in flat film that can be used in the meat processing plants to replace shrink bags with flat film, so the bags get made in-line. It's a wonderful technology. We have deployed this technology in other parts of the world, yet on a small base. But in the U.S., we expect to deploy this over the course of the next several months and years because it's the last place that the meat processor can take cost out of their operation by taking out their labor of stuffing bags with pieces of meat. The meat just runs down a line and gets packaged in a flat film, and then the bag gets made right in-line. So it's a great opportunity for the meat processors to take cost out of their operation. And that's the target that we're going after, is to help our customers reduce their costs in their plant operations with our -- with this great technology that we've developed. Alexander Hutter - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Great. And then just for the follow-up, volumes in U.S. Packaging overall seem to be tracking a little bit softer than that kind of 2% to 3% volume growth target you mentioned earlier in the year. You're up against easier comps in the second half, but kind of how dependent is your full year guidance on hitting that volume target? Henry J. Theisen: Well, first of, what we said is that we would do slightly better than GDP, not 3% or 4%, but slightly better than GDP. Our guidance is really based on the innovations that we have and we've talked about them, as we've ramped up our CapEx spending this year and we've looked at our product flow. And as Bill mentioned, many of these things have been awarded to us. We're ramping them up. Overall, there is sluggishness in the economy, but new packaging, new formats, new products, conversion of rigid to flexible, these are the things that are driving our increase in our guidance and our confidence in delivering this year. Operator : And next, we'll move to Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird & Co. Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : It's actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. Just wanted to get a feel for your updated thoughts on capital allocation priorities. Should we expect to see more share buybacks going forward? Henry J. Theisen: Well, I don't know if you should expect to see more share-backs or not. My goal or what I really like to do is to try and grow the company organically. That's the best growth. And I think we're going to be putting more CapEx into those opportunities that are presenting to us and that are -- we can use and turn into sales growth. After that, you look at acquisitions. And finally, if there's not anything there in an acquisition that enhances our technology or moves us into a new market, then you kind of fall back to share repurchases. But as I said, I think our main use of capital is going to be support the ideas that our R&D group has. Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. Great. And can you quantify the top line impact from new product innovations and from the new customer wins that you outlined in your prepared remarks? Henry J. Theisen: I don't think I can really quantify that now because a lot of those things aren't out in the marketplace yet, and I really don't like to speak about how big certain things are until our customers have them out on the shelf. Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. Great. And just one last one. Are there any updates to the pricing environment in U.S. flexibles? Are you seeing any changes in competitive behavior there? Henry J. Theisen: No, no. As we've talked about it, in the areas where we like to operate the most are around sterility and food safety, and there's less competition there. If we talk about the areas like we pointed out, that we have some good -- that's tough competitive markets like snacks and candies and confections, that's a very competitive market. And it continues to be a competitive market, and I expect it will in the future. We do well there. We operate there, but that's not our targeted markets. Operator : And next, we'll move to George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Alaxandar Wang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : It's actually Alax Wang sitting in for George. Can you just talk a little bit about Brazil and your outlook for the region? We've heard sort of mixed things regarding demand trends down there. William F. Austen: Yes. Alax, this is Bill Austen. Our outlook for Brazil is steady as it is now. We have -- we're the leader in our packaging formats in Brazil. Our customers continue to buy from us. While demand is soft from the consumers in Brazil, we continue to run our business at very good capacity utilization rates across the entire Latin America region, not just Brazil, but also in Argentina as well. So our outlook for Brazil is steady as it goes. We are in a good position there. Alaxandar Wang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : And then just as a follow-up, maybe following up on an earlier question, what kind of conditions do you think need to exist so that organic volumes in the U.S. can grow more predictably and regularly? Henry J. Theisen: Well, I don't know if we really know the answer to that question. I just think that the consumer has to start buying. Operator : And we'll move on to Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : In -- Henry, in U.S. Packaging, organic growth was down 0.5% in the quarter, and it was up 0.5% in the first half. Can you tell us what you're expecting along those lines for the balance of the year? Henry J. Theisen: I expect that the decline in organic growth is going to stop. I think that you'll see us having a slight -- a little bit of growth in the second half of the year, and that's really related to new product offerings and the new innovations. Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Okay. And in terms of cash flow, did the operating cash flow guidance change have anything to do with working capital? And if not, what are your expectations for working capital for the year? Jerry S. Krempa: Adam, this is Jerry. No, our working capital is typically high in the middle of the year, in our peak second quarter seasons. We have a higher level going into third quarter, expecting the improvements we see coming. But at year end, we fully expect that our working capital will be down to the same levels it was at the end of 2013 such that there would be no use of cash from working capital. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Next, we'll move to Al Kabili with Macquarie. Daniel Moran - Macquarie Research : This is Danny Moran on for Al. Did you see any de-stocking in the quarter from customers? And if so, do you expect this to normalize in 3Q? Henry J. Theisen: I don't know if we can really say that there was de-stocking in the customers. I wouldn't have any evidence of that. Our order patterns are good. Yes, in certain markets, we had a little bit of a downside; other markets were a little bit better. But I don't have any evidence that there was a de-stocking going on. Daniel Moran - Macquarie Research : Okay. That's helpful. And then just switching to PSM, it looks like it was a pretty strong quarter. Do you expect this level of mix improvement and the strength in Europe to continue in the back half? Henry J. Theisen: Why don't I give it to Bill? He's closer to that than I am. William F. Austen: Dan, we expect to see PSM to stay right at the levels that it's at, and we're -- we feel good about where they are right now and how it's moving forward. And we do expect Europe to continue to improve, both in flexible and in PSM as their economy continues to dig its way out of the hole. Operator : And next, we'll move to Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo. Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : A couple of quick questions. First, around cash flow. You had -- it looks like you've lowered the outlook for -- of cash flow. Can you give us a little color there as to what the contributing factors were? I mean, when we look at -- at least digging through the release, you talked about the sale of the Paper business, and you talked about the closure of the plant. But both of those were -- quite frankly, both of those were announced and completed before the very end of last quarter. So those 30 days, 20 days later, when you gave an outlook, those probably wouldn't have been factored in there. So what was the differential? I think, to an earlier question, maybe you mentioned working capital's going to be flat. Was there an expectation previous that it would have been a reduction? Or what were the elements there? Jerry S. Krempa: Chris, this is Jerry. I think, yes, you're right. At the beginning of the year, we had guided to $500 million of cash flow. And the -- at that time, the forecast did not anticipate the Paper divestiture or the Stow closure. So those items had not been considered. So we have now adjusted the $500 million for those items, and that's where we're coming out at $450 million. Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. You had -- okay. Second question was with respect to resin environment, what you're seeing right now. Any movements in specialty resins that are -- some of the more commodity grades have been relatively stable here. We saw an increase earlier in the year, as you pointed out. But anything unusual happening with some of your specialty grades? Henry J. Theisen: This is Henry. No, no. We factored it into our guidance for the year, pretty much flat raw material costs going forward. Operator : Next, we'll hear from Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : I was just wondering -- I was wondering if you could just talk about 2 things you mentioned and in the release, which, again, is your -- the higher demand for graphic products in your Pressure Sensitive business. Can you talk about, again, what's driving that and kind of who your competitors are in that market? And then I think you also called out health care packaging as a source of growth, and I would just like to get a little bit more color on that as well. William F. Austen: Sure. Debbie, this is Bill Austen. The higher demand for graphic packaging, we're a leader in -- not graphic packaging, in PSM. We're a leader in graphic materials, graphic Pressure Sensitive Materials in Europe. And as that economy continues to rebound, there's a higher demand for graphic materials because that's the first thing that companies cut : advertising, bus wraps, car wraps, signage. And as the economy then begins to improve, companies start to advertise again, so graphic materials get in vogue, if you will. The demand is higher. And it's -- the normal competitors in that arena would be 3M and Avery. Those are the kind of folks that we would compete against in graphic materials. Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. And in the health care packaging, what's really driving -- what products do you have that's really driving the growth there? William F. Austen: Health care packaging, our growth there is being driven really across the globe. It's just the higher demand for health care, medical devices, pharmaceutical packaging in Brazil, which is doing well. Europe, we've got some package technologies that we happen to be the lead in and for drug-coated stents. So it's just the uplift across-the-board in health care and the needs for health care packaging. Operator : And next, we'll move to Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Henry, you mentioned your order backlog. It sounded like you thought they were pretty strong headed into the third quarter. Can you maybe either give us some order of magnitude or product categories, et cetera? What's giving you sort of a greater sense of assurance there around the order backlogs? Henry J. Theisen: It isn't like it's drastically different. It just is a little better than it's been in the first and second half of the year. And again, it's driven by the new products that we offer. So it's not like the world has changed, we're just starting to see some pickup in our new products. We're starting to see some pickup in the conversion of rigid. And it's just a little bit better than it's been in the first and second quarter of this year. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. And then just bigger picture, when we think about flexible plastic packaging, in general, right, we think about a higher growth market as you talked about earlier, some of these conversions from other packaging options, et cetera. Your organic volumes have been relatively flat for the last couple years, but part of that has admittedly been because you shed some low margin business. But can you talk about the market, in general? Why maybe the market isn't growing as fast as it should? Or maybe why your volumes have been a little bit lower than the industry, and whether or not you think over time we can see that accelerate? Henry J. Theisen: I just think, overall, in the first quarter, the second quarter, the GDP, like in the first quarter, was negative. And this is kind of an overall weakness in almost all of our markets. And I think that our -- and we've overcome that with some new products, and our customers, when we talk to our customers, they want to come out with new products. They want to come out with things that are innovative or that separate them on the shelf. So I think we've kind of -- we were operating kind of in a sluggish lower across-the-board. We've taken steps to -- in our pricing discipline and some of those low margin areas that we're not going to seek those opportunities that don't give us a fair return for the value that we bring. And I think we're generating growth in those targeted areas where we are paid for the value that we bring. Operator : And next, we'll take a follow-up from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Just 2 quick ones. Actually, just following up on the question that Scott asked earlier. If flexible packaging is taking share, why are we sort of seeing modest volume organic declines that are kind of consistent with what we're seeing in paperboard, if you can provide a little more color on that? Henry J. Theisen: Well, I think it kind of comes back to the same answer I just gave. It is -- all of our customers are somewhat sluggish. All of our customers have some concerns about volume, and it's kind of spread evenly. And the conversions don't come as fast as some of those other things. And actually, it's our intent, in what we've done over the past, to target those markets where we get recognition for the value that we bring. George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : And then just lastly, are you seeing any logistical issues being created by rail or freight that's causing you to keep extra inventory or delaying shipments to your customers? Henry J. Theisen: No, no, no, that's not what we're seeing. Operator : And we'll take a follow-up from Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : I just -- I wanted to just ask one more question on the cash flow guidance. Maybe it would help if you could just give us what the cash outflow is going to be from the Snow (sic) [Stow] closure. And then just from what you said, I think, on the last conference call, I think there were $9 million in proceeds from the sale of the Paper Packaging business, so just the tax implication -- cash tax implication there. That might help us to bridge. Jerry S. Krempa: Okay. This is Jerry. On the Stow closure, I think we did have an accrual in the quarter -- last quarter for the closure that we talked about, so that will give you an idea of the cash expenditures there. And on the gain on the divestiture of Paper, you got to remember that, that was the booking that was reported from a tax standpoint. We had a higher gain that we reported that we had to pay taxes on. Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : So above the $9 million? Jerry S. Krempa: Correct. Operator : And we'll take a follow-up from Al Kabili with Macquarie. Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research : Just want to follow up on the full year EPS guidance. Are you assuming any share buybacks in the second half? Henry J. Theisen: No, there is no share-back factored into the second half of the year. Operator : And we'll move on to another follow-up with Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : On the cash flow outlook. So aside from those 2 items, presumably you would be north of $500 million. So do you think of $500 million or slightly north of that as a kind of a normalized number, along with the now $190 million of CapEx that you're guiding to post 2014? Jerry S. Krempa: You're saying, excluding the adjustments we just talked about, we'd be north of $500 million? Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Right. You'd still be at $500 million or somewhat north of that number, and you talked about CapEx being equivalent to D&A post 2014, so let's call it $190 million. So roughly $500 million and $190 million kind of on a more normal basis. Does that -- would you agree with that? Jerry S. Krempa: That sounds reasonable. That makes sense. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Erin Winters : Thank you, operator. Thank you, all, for joining us today. This concludes our conference call. Operator : And that will conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation.",

Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Bemis Company Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Erin Winters. Please go ahead, ma'am. Erin M. Winters: Thank you. Welcome to our third quarter 2014 conference call. Today is October 23, 2014. After today's call, a replay will be available on our website, bemis.com, under the Investor Relations section. Joining me for this call today are Bemis company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Austen; our Vice President and Controller and Interim Principal Financial Officer, Jerry Krempa; and our Vice President and Treasurer, Melanie Miller. Today, Jerry will begin with comments on the quarter's financial performance. Bill will then provide color on business performance and outlook. After our comments, we will answer any questions you have. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to direct you to our website, bemis.com, under the Investor Relations tab, where you will find our press release along with our supplemental schedules. We'll be referring to these schedules that points throughout today's discussion. On today's call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures as we talk about Bemis' performance. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures that we consider most comparable can be found in the press release and supplemental schedules. I'd like to remind everyone that statements regarding future performance of the company made during this teleconference are forward-looking and are therefore subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from historical, expected or projected results due to a variety of factors. Please refer to Bemis Company's regular SEC filings, including the most recently filed Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 to review these risk factors. Now I'll turn the call over to Jerry Krempa. Jerry S. Krempa: Thank you, Erin, and hello, everyone. This morning, we reported record total company adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.67, which is near the middle of our most recent guidance. This is an 11.7% increase compared with 2013 third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.60. As previously announced, during the third quarter, we entered into an agreement to sell our global Pressure Sensitive Materials business. The third quarter operating results of this segment as well as a pretax impairment charge of about $45 million are aggregated and reported as discontinued operations in our financial statements. Consequently, my discussion of our financial results will reference only continuing operations, which consists of our U.S. and global Flexible Packaging businesses. We have included supplemental schedules on our website that recasts certain financial information on a continuing operations basis. Specifically, we have provided a recast of both our historical earnings per share amounts and our income statement. Looking to Page 3 of these supplemental schedules, you can see record third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.61, a 10.9% increase compared with last year's recast third quarter results of $0.55 per share. I will now discuss the sales and operating profit performance of each of our Flexible Packaging reportable segments. As I discuss sales figures, please refer to Page 5 of the supplemental schedules, which provides detail on year-over-year changes in net sales. In our U.S. Packaging segment, which represents approximately 2/3 of total Bemis sales from continuing operations, we saw a decrease in third quarter net sales compared with the third quarter of last year. This decrease is attributable to the divestiture of our Paper Packaging Division earlier this year. Excluding the impact of this divestiture, overall organic sales in U.S. Packaging increased 1.1%, driven by favorable price mix. While overall unit volumes were consistent with the prior year, we did see unit volume increases in our targeted higher value dairy and liquid end markets, which grew at strong mid-single-digit percentages compared with last year. We saw low single digit volume increases in our beverage and over-wrap end markets. Our processed meat category increased modestly while our cheese category decreased modestly. With respect to the balance of our product categories, on average, we saw mid-single-digit declines in volumes for dry foods, bakery, confectionery and snack food packaging. U.S. Packaging operating profit for the third quarter of 2014 was 13.3% of net sales compared with 13% of net sales in the third quarter of last year. Our return on sales benefited from the divestiture of paper packaging and from higher unit sales to our targeted dairy and liquid end markets. Our return on sales was adversely impacted by startup costs associated with the commercialization of new business. Next, I will discuss our Global Packaging segment, which represents approximately 1/3 of total Bemis sales from continuing operations. Referring again to the middle of Page 5 of the supplemental schedules, this segment reported a net sales increase of 2.9% when compared with the third quarter of last year. Currency movement negatively impacted sales by 2.5%. If you exclude this negative currency impact, organic sales grew 5.4% over last year. Approximately 4% of this growth came from favorable price mix. In addition, we saw mid-single-digit volume increases of medical device, pharmaceutical and dairy packaging, and modest volume increases in meat and cheese packaging across Latin America, Europe and Asia. These volume increases were partially offset by declines in the dry food, snack food and confectionery packaging categories. Third quarter operating profit for the Global Packaging segment was 8.6% of net sales, up a full percentage point from last year's 7.6%. Currency negatively impacted operating profit by $1 million. These higher returns in Global Packaging are attributable to higher selling prices and better mix in target end markets such as medical device, pharmaceutical, meat and cheese and dairy. These end markets are consistent with our growth strategy. Switching to a discussion of consolidated Bemis results. Selling, general and administrative expenses from continuing operations was 9.5% of net sales for the third quarter, down from 10.1% in the prior third quarter and a reflection of disciplined cost control programs. We continue to expect these expenses to be below prior year levels. Research and development expense was 1% of net sales, consistent with the prior year. As we accelerate the pace of innovation and investments to deliver growth in our target markets, we expect to continue at or slightly above this rate in future years. The income tax rate for continuing operations was 34.9% for the third quarter. We expect the tax rate for the full year 2014 to be approximately 34.5%. Cash flow from operating activities for the third quarter totaled about $121 million. Working capital levels have increased for a number of reasons, including raw material cost inflation in inventory, which ultimately gets to accounts receivable. Higher selling prices related to increased sales of value-added products and higher inventory levels associated with new business commercialization efforts. For these reasons, full year 2014 cash flow from operations is now expected to be in the $375 million to $400 million range. This range is slightly ahead of last year but below our previous full year guidance. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were about $43 million, bringing our year-to-date capital spend to approximately $113 million. We expect cash payments for capacity expansions to be substantially higher during the fourth quarter as compared to the prior quarters this year. Accordingly, we maintain our guidance for full year spend at approximately $175 million. Quickly touching on our leverage metric, net debt to adjusted EBITDA at the end of the third quarter was 2.1x, close to our target rate of 2x. On August 1, $400 million in bonds matured. These bonds had a fixed interest rate of 5.65%. We refinanced these bonds with variable rate debt consisting of a $200 million bank term loan that will mature in 2022 and another $200 million of commercial paper. In the current interest rate environment, replacing the fixed rate bonds with these variable rate debt lowered the interest rate on this $400 million of debt from 5.65% to approximately 1%. Let me now turn the call over to Bill for his commentary. William F. Austen: Thank you, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. Before discussing my thoughts on the most recent quarter, I'd like to step back a bit and share with you my perspective as I begin my new role as CEO of Bemis. I am truly honored to be leading the company at this important and exciting time in its history. We are at a turning point. As you are aware, we have been internally focused for the last few years. Specifically, we integrated our largest acquisition in company history. We closed 9 plants as part of our facility consolidation program and we divested 3 non-core businesses, a tremendous amount of internally focused effort that is over. And now, it is time to focus our resources externally, on accelerating disciplined growth, delivering innovation and continuously improving all we do. We will accomplish this in a variety of ways and the result will be improved performance metrics. Specifically, I am committed to improving return on invested capital, operating margins and earnings per share. In the months ahead, you will hear more details about our external focus and the long-term financial objectives to which we will hold ourselves accountable. We begin this next chapter from a position of strength. The facts are, we made great products that are differentiated from the competition. We have deep and valued customer relationships and we have the scale, capital and dedicated employees to provide our solutions to customers anywhere in the world. Now turning to our most recent third quarter. As Jerry mentioned, we had a strong quarter. We delivered record EPS and operating margin improvement. We grew sales in our target end markets and positioned our business for additional value-added volume growth in future periods. In our U.S. Packaging segment, we improved operating margin to 13.3% as compared to 13% last year. While this improvement speaks of our strategy of trading up by selling a greater portion of value-added products, we could have done better. This quarter, our results we're dampened by waste and inefficiency related to commercialization of new business. Without operational issues, our margins would have been roughly 50 basis points higher. These results are not acceptable and we expect more from ourselves. And we are taking actions to overcome these growing pains. As we move forward, we will continue with our strong pricing discipline, capacity additions and upgrades. We will also execute on operational improvements to deliver increased profit from our growth projects. I am confident in our progress and we will continue with a heightened sense of urgency to achieve our full potential. With respect to volume, the U.S. packaged food industry has been relatively flat and has lagged overall GDP. It is clearly a tough volume environment. We expect our volumes to exceed average food growth levels. For instance, one trend that continues is the conversion from rigid glass and can formats to flexible plastic packaging. We are expanding our capacity to meet these demands. While our customers may see flat volumes in their business, when they convert more of their existing volume to flexible formats, it's growth for Bemis. Another trend we see is that our customers are using packaging to rejuvenate their brands and increase their share of consumers' wallets. These trends will drive increased sales of value-added products that will also improve our performance metrics. Let me share some examples of these successes. We see more customers expanding their brands through our flexible packaging for sauces used in slow cookers, skillet meals and other quick prepare and serve meals. These liquid applications provide modern convenience and appeal, which help our customers grow their business. We see increased sales of films used for lidding labels and thermoform cups that enhance value in dairy applications such as yogurt and pudding. And we see continued interest from our customers for packaging to meet the growing trend of snack-size protein portions for cheeses, jerkys and other on-the-go foods. As we move forward, our pipeline of new products and innovations remain strong. And as I have mentioned before, while overall volume is important, our main emphasis is to sell more value-added products to customers. Looking at our Global Packaging segment. I am very pleased with the solid results this quarter. Compared to last year, we improved operating margin by 100 basis points to 8.6% of sales. This margin improvement was driven by increased unit volumes, our continued pricing discipline and favorable sales mix as we focus globally on introducing higher technology value-added packaging to developing markets. Unit volumes increased across all geographies of our global business from Latin America, to Europe, to Asia Pacific. Specifically, as Jerry mentioned, we saw increased unit volumes in our value-added packaging for dairy, protein, medical device and pharmaceutical applications. For example, in Latin America, where we already have a strong position in dairy and liquid, we are beginning to gain share in meat and cheese categories where our customers are using Bemis packaging to modernize their product lines. In Europe, our high-barrier skinned cook films are now being sold for use in cook-in applications for fresh meat. In Asia Pacific, our new extrusion platform is also poised to grow with the expanding needs of our protein and medical device customers within the region. We continue to introduce our 9-layer, high-barrier films to customers for use in processed meat applications. Turning to the topic of capital. As previously guided, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $175 million this year. This increased investment will fuel growth in 2015 by meeting packaging demands in our target end markets, including liquid, medical device, pharmaceutical and global high-barrier platforms. As we move beyond 2014, we expect capital expenditures to be around D&A to support increasing global demand for flexible packaging. With respect to raw materials, suppliers announced a $0.03 a pound polyethylene increase in September, and we are passing this along in accordance with our customer pricing agreements. Specialty resins have been relatively stable in recent periods. I'd like to comment briefly on the pending sale of our Pressure Sensitive Materials business. Over the last 10 years, our investment in pressure sensitive business did not keep pace with the market. While there's certainly a pressure-sensitive growth strategy, successful implementation would require substantial investment. Because Bemis' strategy is to invest in our higher-margin Flexible Packaging segments, we made the decision to divest the pressure-sensitive business and focus on our core. We plan to use the proceeds of the sale to fund growth of our Flexible Packaging business where margins are higher and our growth prospects are substantially greater. Turning to guidance. We expect fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $0.53 to $0.58. Full year guidance from continuing operations therefore falls in the range of $2.26 to $2.31. Considering the results of discontinued operations, our full year guidance range is consistent with the middle of our previously stated guidance. While fourth quarter tends to be a seasonally lighter quarter for our business, I am confident that we will deliver improved performance as compared to the prior fourth quarter as we deliver on our strategy to sell more value-added products. Overall, I'm pleased but not satisfied with the progress we are making toward our long-term strategy. We are delivering sequentially improving margins. We are growing our target end markets with value-added packaging solutions and we are positioning ourselves for long-term growth. As I mentioned before, we will move ahead with a heightened sense of urgency as we aggressively attack our operational challenges to deliver increased profit from our growth projects. And we will continue executing the capacity additions and upgrades to support the increased demand for our value-added products. I'm excited to begin this next chapter for Bemis and I'm confident in our ability to succeed. Thank you for your time today. We will now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Alaxandar Wang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : It's actually Alax Wang sitting in for George. Quickly on resin trends. I know you touched on it on your prepared remarks but we've seen some upward movement, both in polyethylene and polypropylene. Can you talk about your anticipation for resin maybe going forward? Jerry S. Krempa: Right now, Alax, we see resin as being stable right where it is. We don't -- we haven't built anything in that shows an increase where basically stable resin prices moving forward. Alaxandar Wang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Great. And just as a follow-up, touching on Global Packaging. Are you seeing any change in tone in 4Q versus 3Q other than normal seasonality? What are your expectations for trends in 4Q? Jerry S. Krempa: Alax, I am-- I really like our Global Packaging business. We have put in some capacity over the last couple of years. We've gotten that capacity positioned where we want it. We're making great inroads by introducing new technologies into the Global Packaging arena and we're going to continue to be bullish and push on our Global Packaging business. If you look at the Global Packaging formats, right? It's like a staircase. At the bottom of the staircase is low sophistication, at the top of the staircase is high sophistication in packaging and higher margins. The capacities we've put in, the investments we've made over the last few years help our customers move up that sophistication staircase, and we feel really good about what we're doing in global and where we're headed both in the food side and in the health care side of things. So we see that while I can't say that we're going to see 100 basis points move every 90 days in our margins, we're going to see an upward trend as we go through the next many, many quarters. Thanks. Operator : And we'll now go to Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird and Company Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : It's actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. Can you help us understand why the trend's actual multiple for PSM was so much lower than recent multiples in the packaging industry? William F. Austen: Yes, let me take that one, this is Bill. When I came to Bemis, it was 14 years ago, I actually came into Bemis as the President of our Pressure Sensitive business. And I know that business very well. I know that market very well. And that business, on it's -- when it's on the top of its game in its best day, it's going to be a 6% to 7% return on sales business. And we, Bemis, stopped making investments in that business some time ago. So if you go back 14 years ago to when I started, a lot of new capacity in MACtac came online. A couple of new coders were started up in the year 2000, 1999 to 2000. Since that time, the industry has moved forward. The market has moved forward. Technology has moved forward. Wider Web widths, faster speeds, different adhesive technologies. And we didn't really stay up with those market improvements. So there's going to be, while the business will grow minimally, to really grow that business, it's going to require some new capital injections, some new capital investment. And if you look at Bemis Company as a packaging portfolio, we've got much higher and better returns and higher margins in our Flexible Packaging business that don't -- so the MACtac's pressure sensitive margins really don't compare with our Flexible Packaging in margin and return. Some we're going to take money and put it into Flexible Packaging. We weren't going to continue to invest to make business at 7% returns. So it was just a function of where best to focus the company. We've got the company focused on its core around Flexible Packaging, that's where we have better growth opportunities and we have better rates of return. Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Great. And just another one for you Bill. Where do you think the strategic focus is going to be as we think ahead to the next 5 years or so. Is Europe still a market with strategic significance for the company? And should we expect more capital to be allocated towards Asia? William F. Austen: Yes, it's a very good question. Europe, for us, we're on a -- we're doing quite nicely in Europe. We like the position we have in Europe as a niche player. As a niche supplier in high-barrier, health care and protein packaging. And we will be making some targeted investments in Europe that are focused at healthcare and high-barrier packaging. This example of the skin cook film that I mentioned in my verbiage, that's a product that's skin tight, which is a really great product that helps sell a new format for fresh meats and preprepared foods in Europe. And one of the large U.K. grocery chain has just moved their volume of fresh meat cook-in type meets to our skin cook package, which is a great example of the investments we've made over the last few years coming now into the market with new technologies. And in Asia, we're going to continue to invest in the emerging economies because as I talk about that staircase of low sophistication to high sophistication, as food safety standards continue to move upscale across the entire Asia region, not just China, our products are ideally positioned to help those customers sell their products in the market. So we're going to continue to invest in those regions of the world where we have an advantage and where we can be differentiated. Operator : And we'll now go to Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs. Usha Chundru Guntupalli - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : This is actually Usha Guntupalli on behalf of Alex. Looking at the U.S. Packaging segment, could you provide more color on the margin improvement initiatives, particularly pricing and better operations? What are you doing differently now versus a few years back? William F. Austen: Well, I'll take that question here in that if you look at what we're doing differently is it's really the focus on the higher-margin value-added product portfolio that was not as -- it isn't that we weren't there a few years back, it's just that now we've got some unique technologies, some unique assets focused at these higher-margin, higher technology types of packaging applications and that's where we're putting our focus. And third quarter, some of the improvements that we're going to be making going forward now is we have made some key personnel changes within the U.S. Packaging segment. We're putting some more engineering resources around the commercialization of new products so that we can bring those products to market quicker without hiccups and we're accelerating the installation -- we're accelerating the capital deployment into the U.S. Packaging segment so we can bring some equipment to that region quicker and reduce some of the bottlenecks that we've had. Usha Chundru Guntupalli - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : So are we talking about 100 to 200 basis points improvement over the next few years from this? William F. Austen: Yes. Our target that we've stated, I've stated, for U.S. Packaging is that we want to be between 15% and 18% operating profit within the next 3 or 5 years. Operator : And we'll now go to Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Canada : Very refreshing comments, Bill. I want to just turn back to global. I mean, your margins are still quite a lot lower there. What are going to be the kind of 2 or 3 keys to driving that margin up? And can you get it to the target you just laid out there for the North American business? William F. Austen: Yes. Mark, first off, our target for global is 10%-plus operating profit, and it goes back to that staircase, okay? Just think about that staircase. At the bottom of the staircase, low sophistication packaging, low value, low margin. Top of the staircase, high value, high margin. And we're helping our customers because we're introducing technologies in those parts of the world that come from the developed world, right? They come from Europe. They come from the United States. We're bringing formats to the customers that they've never seen before, that they haven't had the opportunity to market their products in. So we're bringing those formats to those regions of the world and that's going to help us move up that staircase and get the higher margins and that's our focus in the emerging world, along with health care. The health care packaging, if you look at now across Asia, there's more and more healthcare being afforded to the population. So there's a good portion of healthcare pharmaceutical medical device packaging that we're now getting into the Asian marketplace. With our footprint in Kuala Lumpur, with our plant in Suzhou, China, and now our film platform we can actually make films for that region in the region from our film plant in China. So we no longer have to ship films from around the world into that region. So we can better serve those customers with new technologies developed within the region. Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Canada : Okay. Just as a follow-on. That business skews pretty heavily, I think, in terms of sales right now to Latin America. Is that going to change? And right now, are you seeing any impact from the slowdown in Brazil? William F. Austen: A couple of questions there, right? The first one would be, yes, we are heavily skewed in Latin America, right? And it's going to take us a while to build the Asian business to that size. But we are growing the Asian business quite nicely. Now have we seen improvements in Latin America from a volume standpoint? We have target end markets, right, that we'd like to talk about, liquid, dairy, meat, cheese, protein, if you will, as well as health care. We've seen nice gains in meat and cheese in Latin America and we've seen some gains in our pharmaceutical business down in Latin America. So these are target markets that we like to be in and that's where we're pushing and that's where we're seeing volume growth. Operator : And we'll now go to Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : In terms of the cash flow guidance you gave, how much of the $60 million to $65 million operating cash flow guidance reduction was attributable to the divestiture of PSM versus the inflation and high working capital that you talked about? And can you just put into context to what extent you're expecting the inflation and/or working capital and how much that surprised you? William F. Austen: Yes, Adam, I'm going to have Jerry answer that one. Jerry S. Krempa: Hi, Adam. Well, in terms of the range we gave in terms of the reduction, just one thing I want to point out is where we end up in that range will partially depend on the timing of the pressure-sensitive divestiture. As we indicated, we're targeting closing that transaction in the fourth quarter, but depending on exactly when we do will impact where we are in that range. For instance, out of the reduction, about $10 million to $20 million of that reduction relates to pressure-sensitive. Considering the lack of operations we'll have in the fourth quarter, whether it be 1 month or 2 months or whatever. And also, some related closing costs to the transaction. The balance of that reduction is roughly 50-50 split between 2 items. One item being raw material inflation, that becomes part of inventory costs, and eventually works its way to accounts receivable as these cost increases are passed on to our customers. And secondly, it's the inventory quantity increases in the supply chain resulting from the inefficiencies we experienced as we commercialized some of the new business that Bill talked about. We will see these levels shrink over time as the action plan Bill mentioned is implemented and as we install some new equipment that will add capacity and help alleviate some of these bottlenecks. So the balance of it, like I said, is split between those 2 items. Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : So along those lines, to the extent there'll be some of those issues as transitory, what do you consider normalized operating cash flow for the company following the sale of PSM? Jerry S. Krempa: Right. I think, historically, pressure-sensitive contributed about $30 million a year to our cash flow. This year, it was substantially lower because of the Stow closure costs, which included the withdrawal liability from the multi-employer pension plan. So that's the impact pressure-sensitive would typically have on our cash flow. I think, as we get -- come out next quarter, we'll be giving you guidance for the future. Operator : And we'll now go to Al Kabili with Macquarie. Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research : I wanted to follow up on Adam's question on the cash flow. And can you give us a sense for how you're thinking about working capital? It looks like it's going to be a use for the year? How you see that ranging that's factored in your operating cash flow outlook? Jerry S. Krempa: Well, as I think I just indicated, we talked about pressure-sensitive impact for the balance of the year. We talked about raw material inflation that's become part of inventory and it becomes part of AR as we pass those costs through. It's the inventory quantity increases that we've seen in the supply chain because of the commercialization of new business that Bill talked about. That will take a little longer to flow out. We need to implement our action plan, we need to add the capacity that's in process and that will help alleviate some of those bottlenecks. So over time, we expect that to shrink. Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research : Okay. And are we thinking like a use of $20 million, $25 million net of working cap this year? And just can you help us quantify the sort of inefficiencies, what that was as far as cost in this quarter and how long you think it's going to take for that to alleviate? Thanks. Jerry S. Krempa: In terms of the use for the year, Al, I would imagine that's going to be about $50 million for the year. And like I said, the balance I laid out for Adam, we talked about the reduction, $10 million to $20 million is PSM, the balance of it is roughly between the raw material inflation and the inventory ramp-ups. The inventory ramp-ups, I would think that throughout next year, as we get through first and second quarter, we'll see some pretty significant decreases in that. Operator : And we'll now go to Scott Gaffner with Barclays Capital. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division : I just wanted to talk a little bit more about the growth investments that you're making. A couple of things. One, can you talk about how you look at the returns profile on those investments, whether payback period, et cetera? And then, also at the same time, are your customers investing alongside you? Is that a requirement? Or is this investment you're making irrespective of customer contribution? William F. Austen: Yes. First off, let me -- as I've said earlier in my comments, one thing I'm committed to is improving our performance metrics, one of which is ROIC. And what we're now looking at from a capital investment perspective, we have an ROIC hurdle. Now let me explain this, okay? What we're saying to the teams that want to invest in capacity and invest in growth is that their investment in capital has got to have a 5-year average of 15% return on invested capital hurdle. So at that period, they look at it and they say, okay, does it have a 15% average ROIC over the first 5 years of the project? And we have got plenty of opportunities that the guys -- that the teams are coming in with that have got those -- that hurdle in excess of. So again, it's not a one point in time but it's a 5-year average for that investment, needs to have a 15% average ROIC. And if it does, we just gauge them next to all the other projects and go about it that way. Now the second point to your question was our customers investing. Some of them, yes. And some of our investments are geared up and matched with some of our customers' investments that they're making in some new type of packaging technologies. A lot of that takes place in the emerging world because there's new packaging formats coming to the emerging world, so we're linked up with some of our customers in the emerging world as well as the developed markets as well. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. And just following up on that. You said you had plenty of opportunity that the teams are coming in with. I mean, was it just not a desire maybe over the last few years to aggressively go after these projects? And on the CapEx equaling D&A, I assume you mean ex PSM, if you could just clarify that? William F. Austen: Yes that is correct, your comment about ex PSM, yes that is correct. Over the last couple of years, as I talked earlier and I talked to a lot of folks already, we had a very big internal focus over the last few years because we made the purchase of Alcan. We consumed a lot of capacity when we purchased Alcan, and we first coordinated specifications in that Alcan hotdog film. We had a hotdog film. They had cheese packaging, we had cheese packaging. We took our resources and had them go through the portfolio and say, okay, which is the better spec. We determined which were the better specs and then we determined where is the best place to run all these specs. So that was the plant consolidation effort where we moved pieces of equipment around our portfolio around the footprint of plants to determine where best to run things and where best to move equipment. We now have absorbed that capacity that we purchased with Alcan and now we're back on the trail of investing for growth with new capital. Operator : We'll now go to Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo Securities. Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : I first want to say, the excitement and the -- some of the ideas that you're bringing on the table here, particularly looking at returns and margin profile is very, very exciting and refreshing, and we look forward to having all these goals unveiled to us. William F. Austen: Thanks. And coming from you, that's a complement. Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : A couple of questions I wanted to ask. First was when we think about some of the volume trajectory through the quarter. On the surface, looking at the slides, it would appear as though you kind of doubled previous rates as much better. But I think, in earlier comments, you mentioned a good chunk of it was price. Can you give us a sense as to where you are in the price curve? If we look over the last few years, seemingly, you're probably still a bit behind, but it sounds like you're starting to catch up. The pricing actions you're taking, are they more formulaic material-based? Are you out looking for areas to recover higher labor, other miscellaneous, inflation costs? Where are you at kind of in this process? William F. Austen: Yes. First off, we are aggressively driving price. Now we do have, within the United -- within North America, we have a large percentage of our business on contract, so that's formulaic, as you put it, Chris, right, where we have a price adjustment formula and we adjust our price that way. The portion of the business that is not under those types of formulaic contracts, we're out there aggressively managing price to our advantage when we can. Outside the United States, we don't have these large formulaic price adjustment formulas with customers, and we are outdriving price outside in Global Packaging and in our health care area all the time. It's just part of the way the business teams are now metric-ed for their performance. It's on price and pushing price and not being in a lag. Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. So this is something then that takes a little bit of time, maybe a couple of years to work through, but this is -- that's -- the crux is it's in process? William F. Austen: It's in process and I wouldn't say it's going to take a couple of years. This is -- we got to get this done now and there's a sense of urgency around it with the teams. Operator : We'll now go to Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Bill, you talked about using the proceeds of PSM to fund growth. And as you look at growth over the next 2 to 3 years, do you have a bias towards organic internal opportunities versus M&A? And then, on the M&A front, you obviously had the large Alcan acquisition a few years back, and since then, everything has been kind of smaller bolt-on, below $100 million. As you work towards M&A, given that you're pretty much at your target range, is there an opportunity to do something a little bit bigger? Or how do you think about that going forward? William F. Austen: Yes. I'll tell you, here's how we're thinking about it. First off, obviously, the best or close to the best use of cash is to fund organic growth where we have high-margin, differentiated product technologies that we can bring to customers to help them grow, that's what we're going to do, okay? That's number one. We want to grow organically and we think that's the best use of our cash. We're also going to be out looking for acquisitions. There's no question that we are going to get back on the acquisition trail and we're going to be looking for those things that add footprint, add scale, add technology. And that's going to be -- that's not going to be consistent around the world, if you will. It will be different in different regions of the world. So yes, we're funding organic growth, funding acquisitions, paying a dividend, we paid a dividend for -- increased our dividend for 31 years, and I've jokingly told people, I'm not going to be the guy that goes down in history that's changing that, and the fourth one would be opportunistic buys of share buyback. And we have an authorization, I think, of 8.3 million shares from our board. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. That's helpful. And then, just following up in the U.S., you spoke about the weakness in dry food, confectionary, snack food, and we've been seeing this for a number of quarters. I'm just wondering, as you went through the 3 months of the quarter and maybe in October, consumer confidence has picked up, gasoline prices are down, grain prices are down. Are you seeing any indication that there's just a little bit stronger growth for packaged food demand in the U.S. or is it pretty much steady as she goes? William F. Austen: I really like the way you think because one of the -- and it's anecdotal, right? As you talk to some of the major CPG companies, they will tell you that gasoline price directly impacts the sale through convenience stores. And that's where they make their highest margins, is that impulse buy, somebody puts $20 into their tank, goes inside, and it's got $5 left or $4 left and they buy the P3, the Kraft P3 protein pack. They buy the Hormel prewrapped turkey wrap. We like that because those are our packages. That's where we sell and it's that on-the-go grab-and-go type foods that we like. So I don't have any data wrapped around it, but I would hope to see that as gasoline prices come down, we're going to start to see food volumes go up. And that helps us, it helps our customers, and in turn, then that helps us. But as we get into October, we've got nice orders, trends going on in October right now, so I can't say that it's related to lower gasoline prices, as you might suggest, but we could certainly use that low gas price as a tailwind. Operator : We'll now go to Philip Ng with Jefferies and Company. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Bill, encouraged to hear about some of these longer-term margin targets going forward. Is that mostly going to be driven by price or some of these growth investments you're making? And then, I was pleased to hear you're taking a more aggressive stance on price going forward, but with oil falling, at least in the short to medium term, how is that conversation going to go for your customer, because I would imagine it's going to have an impact on resin at some point. William F. Austen: We like the fact that we got a robust pipeline of innovation and new products coming out because that's when you can price the product the highest, right? It's when you launch a new product to meet a customer demand, to help them get the package off the shelf, get it into the consumers' cart better right out of the chute, you get high prices. With a falling demand, if you will, or low oil prices, the Asian demand is softening, so, yes, could there be some weakness in resin pricing or in specialty chemicals going forward? Maybe. But we're really driving this thing from a mix perspective and increasing the mix of higher value-add products and that's where we have higher margins and higher prices. Right now, we haven't had the conversation, obviously, about falling resin prices because they haven't fallen. So we're going to continue to push on price the way we have been, not just in the U.S. but around the world. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay. And just switching gears a little bit into your Global Packaging business, it's nice to see margins tick up pretty nicely in Q3. What's driving that improvement? Is that mostly mix? Mostly price? And this level of improvement, is it sustainable going forward? William F. Austen: Yes. It's really the fact that we're starting to get traction with new product introductions in the emerging world. I mean, a large -- one of the largest or the largest processed meat company in Brazil has taken their entire line of processed meats and cheese to one of our packages that we've had no traction in before because they were just selling it in a 3-side seal nylon poly pouch before. Now it is in a very, very upscale, high-end, high graphics, peelable, resealable package that sells in Europe. They're now taking across their entire line in Latin America. So it's new product introductions. The skin cook film over in Europe is a brand-new technology that comes from our skin film format, which we're just putting in additional capacity so we can meet those customers' demands. So it's really the introduction of new products, higher-end value-added products. Just keep thinking about that staircase. We're helping our customers move up the staircase to higher value-add, higher-margin products. Operator : We'll now go to Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: First question is just a couple of housecleaning things. The 15% average ROIC, is that pretax or after-tax? William F. Austen: After-tax. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay. After. Okay. And I might have missed this and I apologize, but you mentioned some long-term margin goals. And I know you've, in the past, the company has said that the global segment is something more than 10%. Do you have a similar -- do you have a target for the U.S. business? And I think, you said that there was an overall target as well? William F. Austen: For U.S. packaging, it's 15% to 18% operating profit. That's our goal. That's where those guys are headed. That's their target. And what you said, Chip, about global is correct, 10%-plus. Operator : And we'll now go to Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : As we sit here today, I guess, more importantly, I guess, as we go into 2015, I was wondering what your -- what is your rough mix of business between your high-barrier, value-added products versus low barrier and commodity business, and how should we expect that to trend over time? Melanie E. R. Miller: In the U.S., our current mix of high barrier, so we think of high barrier being meat, cheese, dairy, liquid, it's roughly half of our U.S. business. And then, the other, dry foods, candies, snacks, et cetera, all those things would make up the second half. And Bill, I'll let you comment on your thoughts of mix of business as we move forward. William F. Austen: The mix of -- we want to shift. Obviously, we've wanted to shift and we have been shifting and we've been moving from the lower barrier, if you will, and to the middle -- to the high barrier. So we've been moving away from more and more of the bottle over-wraps, snack food packaging, candy confection packaging, up to the left-hand side, if you recall, our investor presentation, the left-hand bars of meat, cheese, dairy, liquid, where there's high barrier, more technology. Customers aren't willing to put those brands at risk so they've got to have high quality, great service and constant differentiation of products. So we'll continue to move in the direction of high barrier. And right now, I don't have a percentage in my mind as to where that's going to be. It will -- the trend will continue to increase toward the high barrier side of the equation. Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. And I guess, as a follow-up, you mentioned a focus on ROIC targets for your new products, product development. And I'm just wondering, what type of incentives or potential changes to accountability that your team now has to achieve those targets? And to be fair, I think, in the past, the industry as a whole has kind of just struggled to get paid for some of these innovation and benefits from long-term projects? William F. Austen: Right. Well, in 2015, not just the officer team at Bemis but the regional teams and people in the regions will be incentive comped on ROIC, ROS, growth and safety. So ROIC becomes a part of the regional teams and so does return on sales. So we're really putting a hard push and a drive on return metrics and improving those return metrics. Operator : We'll now go to with Frederick [indiscernible] with Lumbar Investment Partners [ph]. Unknown Analyst : A couple of follow ups. But really, I wondered if you could talk about what the use of proceeds from the pressure-sensitive divestiture, whether given the underperformance of the shares, whether you expect, given the authorization of insured repurchase, to resume that? And then, thinking about your targets, it's great with ROIC, but can you commit on any M&A that you -- that these deals will be accretive to earnings having just divested a business that was -- it turned out to be heavily dilutive to earnings. Can you commit to making acquisitions if you do even bolt-ons that will be accretive to free cash flow earnings? William F. Austen: Yes. First off, the question around M&A, yes, we are looking at -- when we look at M&A right now as a -- 3 years, it needs to be accretive to ROIC, that's one of the goals we have as we look at that and how we're going to drive synergies and now we're going to drive growth so that we can achieve the accretive ROIC. And the other part of your question was around? Oh, share repurchase, I'm sorry. Unknown Analyst : Share repurchase. William F. Austen: We're authorized from our board for 8.3 million shares. And again, we've got a view of capital allocation as organic growth, inorganic growth, share repurchase, dividend, not necessarily in that order, but that is one of our criteria that we look at with our capital allocation. Unknown Analyst : And just as a follow-on, it seems like one of the most interesting opportunities you have is really on the health care side, pharma and medical device and the packaging there. And can you tell us just where you are in terms of that and how much new business you gained? You sort of hinted, I thought, when you said the commercialization of new business, am I to assume that, that really is coming increasingly from Pharma? And what should the impact? Should that also increase margins? Is that a higher-margin business? And is the trend really that, that's where the lion's share of your new wins should come from? William F. Austen: Yes. We really like what we would call health care, okay, which is medical device and pharma. And we have been making investments in that area for quite some time, and good investments for the reasons you stated. It does have good margins. And it has very nice margins and healthy margins. And if you look at our growth in that segment, we're up mid-single digits from a volume growth perspective. So another reason we like that. Also you have very sticky customers in health care and pharma. As long as you continue to produce high-quality, on-time products with new innovation, you keep those customers for a long time. And it's all about quality, it's all about cleanliness, it's all about having world-class manufacturing, which we do. And just along those lines, we talk about our CapEx investment. We just broke ground a couple of weeks ago on an expansion for growth in our health care business here in Wisconsin, a $25 million investment to double the size of one of our health care facilities. And that's about growth. So that's where we're headed with pharma, it's a great question, because that's where we're going. Operator : We'll now go back to Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Canada : Yes. I wondered if you could just put a little color or perhaps some numbers about how the roll-in from some of these new business wins will occur as we move through 2015? William F. Austen: Yes. It's not like there's a step function there. As customers begin to commercialize and they begin to trial market and then the trial market goes to -- more of a trial market goes to more states, goes to more regions, it ramps up. So you got to really view the incoming business as a ramp, not a step. Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Canada : Okay. But it sounds like, in the quarter, you must have been building some inventory in front of some -- I would assume some pretty significant product rollouts. William F. Austen: Yes. We were. We did bring on some business within the quarter that will ramp up through 2015 and we had to get it through trial, we had to get it through customer, I can't think of the word right now, but it's where they do trial marketing. It's taken off quite well. And now, it's going to ramp up as we go through 2015. In the long run, it's -- in baseball terms, it might be a double or a triple, but when you start out, it's a single. Operator : And we will now go back with George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I jumped on late. I've been listening and we'll do a little bit of catch up afterwards but I've covered Bemis for a long time and I'm looking at my long-term models here and a lot of what you're talking about, focusing on high barrier, focusing on health care, investing in growth, we've heard from the company for a number of years. Return on invested capital is flat to down over a 15-year period and I'm looking at margins are down over that time and the resins had an effect here. So what is, in your view, most different about the new Bemis now with all of this focus relative to the old Bemis? Is it that you finally put teeth into the incentives driving more return on invested capital, would you say that's it, or what else is it? William F. Austen: George, I would say that what you just described as teeth in the incentives, that's going to be a piece of it. But the other part of it is, we've got a vision that's externally focused, okay? It's focused on the markets, it's focused on customers, it's focused on helping those customers succeed in the marketplace versus we've been very internally focused over the last several years. Let's grind out harder, turn the wheel, turn the crank harder. Now we've got to take that and get it focused on the marketplaces, which is what we're doing. Which is why we're growing in our footprint in other parts of the world, which is why customers are asking us to come to other parts of the world and service them the way that we service them in the U.S. It's just getting more customer-centric, if you will, getting more market-centric, where do we have differentiation, where can we drive that differentiation and how do we extrapolate that differentiation from a developed business to an emerging business. And that's helping us grow and that's going to help us grow in the future. George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : What -- my follow-up would be then, what adjustment or what component in your analysis have you left for the world not being static? In other words, your competition also trying to emulate what you're doing and trying to move up the food chain, so to speak, with what they're offering their customers as well. How much do you think your customer -- excuse me, your competition might be able to derail your plans through their own offerings? William F. Austen: Thanks. In a simple world, it would be technology, right? We view ourselves as having somewhat of a technology advantage to already be differentiated and continuing to push on that differentiation. It was about 1.5 years ago, we hired a chief technology officer, came in from Dow Chemical. We have now wrapped ourselves around a much different technology model than we had in the past. We've got a technology center where we start to leverage that technology across regions, across market segments, meat and cheese into health care. Meat and cheese into medium barrier snack food packaging for Asia Pacific because the snack food packaging in Asia Pacific is much different than the snack food packaging in the United States. Snack food packaging in Asia has got to have barrier components, it has to have anti-scalping agents. It has to have components that you wouldn't see in snack food in the U.S. So we're able to extrapolate that into the other parts of the world. It's getting this big technology engine that we have at Bemis focused on the customer and focused on the markets and that's what's going to drive our growth. Operator : We'll now go to Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : One housekeeping one and just a strategic one. Jerry, what are you expecting in terms of decreases in interest expense next year and potential increases in pension expense? Jerry S. Krempa: In terms of decrease in interest expense, I think, I did lay out the change in our bonds, it's the only bonds that we have retiring here in the near term, so we did reduce that interest rate on that $400 million of debt based on current interest rates over 4%, 4.5%. In terms of pension costs, we have not completed our final calculations for the year. We'll have to see where discount rates are at the end of the year as we do our calculations, and next quarter, we'll be able to talk about that. Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : All right. And Bill, you talked about driving price across your business wherever possible and that you're doing so as quickly as possible. Can you just give us some perspective as to how -- what you're doing represents a notable change from what you and the company have been doing over the past several years? William F. Austen: Simply, we built a lot of analytics now into what we're doing in pricing. And it's not so much guesswork. We're really looking at the analytics of pricing and value pricing versus I think it should be this, I think it should be that. It's not a cost buildup, it's a price. And it's a market price analysis as to what's the value of this versus the value of something else. So it's really more wrapped around analytics and value pricing. Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : And Bill, just one last one. You referred to the key personnel changes you made in U.S. Packaging recently. Why the need for those changes? Were they all related to the inefficiencies in ways that you talked about that affected you this quarter? Or is there something else going on as well that led to those changes? William F. Austen: I don't want to get real specific on that but -- because it did impact people. But a combination of both, it's a combination of building a better, efficient business in North America, and it's a function of putting in the right skill set for the size of the business that it is today. Operator : For our last question in the question queue, we'll go to Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Quick question. As I look at your earnings from continuing operations for the year and your prior guidance before you sold the Pressure Sensitive Materials business, it looks like you're kind of starting out about $0.19 to $0.29 below the 8 ball, if I do my math right -- I'm sorry, $0.24 behind the 8 ball, so call it $0.22. And some of that, I assume, will be made up next year from either lower interest or lower shares. But the bulk of that is going to have to be made up in the future. And now, I'm just wondering, would some of that have gone away because without investing in pressure -- PSM, you would have saw results go down? Or do you really have to just go on offense to make up all of that? And how long do you think that will take? Do you think it will take 1 year or 2? William F. Austen: Well, your math is pretty accurate on what Pressure Sensitive was meaning from the sense of earnings per share. But as we take our investments and we put it into flexible packaging, we have much better growth opportunities, more substantial growth opportunities at higher margin rates then we did in Pressure Sensitive Materials. And we can grow the margins. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: No, I understand that, but I didn't know why you couldn't just keep Pressure Sensitive Materials and then keep -- just keep it, and then, maybe add a little bit of modest leverage to do those other things, is it just because it might have been too distracting? William F. Austen: I'm sorry, I didn't quite get the question, I got it now. If you look at that business, and as I said earlier, I'm very familiar with it, those margins in that business are going to be, on the best day, 7%, okay? I mean, we're not just going to be able -- we were not going to be able to want to keep that going and invest in our high-margin Flexible Packaging growth areas. So it was best for us to put it into the hands of somebody that wants to invest in it and wants to grow it versus us where we've got our business focused on flexible packaging, our people focused on flexible packaging, and that's where our best opportunities for growth are. Operator : It appears we do not have any additional questions in our queue. And I'll turn the call back to Erin Winters. Erin M. Winters: Thank you. Thank you, all, for joining us today and that concludes our conference call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.",

Please refer to Bemis Company's regular SEC filings, including the most recently filed Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 to review these factors. Now, I'll turn the call over to Bill Austen. William F. Austen: Thank you, Erin, and good morning everyone. Today we reported earnings from continuing operations of $0.57 per share for the fourth quarter and $2.30 for the full year 2014, near the top end of our most recent guidance. On balance, we made progress toward our performance improvement goals. We divested our noncore paper packaging and Pressure Sensitive Material businesses, we increased earnings per share from continuing operations 10%. We increased sales of our target end markets in the U.S. and around the world, including packaging for dairy and liquid products, as well as medical device and pharmaceutical applications. We increased operating profit margins in our Global Packaging segment by 50 basis points with strong momentum in the second half of the year where margins averaged above 8%, reflecting excellent progress toward our goal of double-digit returns in this segment. We invested $185 million in new capacity to support growth and productivity improvements. And with our leverage in check, we increased our dividend and also repurchased 3.8 million shares. While I am pleased with our progress and the changes we've initiated, there is still much work ahead. During 2015, we will commercialize new business with a keen focus on operational efficiency to reduce waste, maximize throughput and achieve commercial scale at an accelerated pace. We will improve our working capital discipline to generate higher cash flow. And most importantly, as we execute our growth strategy in 2015, we will continue to increase our key performance metrics of return on invested capital, return on sales and earnings per share. We confidently begin 2015 with a positive momentum and strength. We are expanding capacity to support growing demand for liquid and medical device packaging. Our pipeline of innovative products is strong and we are prioritizing the most valuable opportunities. Our focus on our customers is more intense than ever. We succeed when we are critical to our customers' success, and it is a priority for the organization to continue to strengthen and expand our relationships with customers. We have aligned our incentive pay plans to our key performance metrics of return on invested capital and return on sales. We have the people and the resources in place and we have high expectations of ourselves. Turning to guidance. Our 2015 earnings per share guidance is $2.52 to $2.67, which represents another double-digit increase over the prior year. Where we are in the range may depend on : Impact of currency in Latin America; volume growth in our target end markets; and successful commercialization of new business. A bit of color on these factors : First, with regard to currency. We have a successful packaging business in Latin America that contributes just under $1 billion in sales. Our primary currency exposure in Latin America is the Brazilian real, which weakened by approximately 10% in both 2013 and 2014, creating headwind when we translate those profits for reporting purposes. Our 2015 guidance assumes currencies at today's rates. The second item that may impact where we are in the range is sales volume. We have a number of growth initiatives underway that we expect to provide volume increases in 2015. In U.S. Packaging, unit volume in our dairy and liquid end markets increased by mid-single digits in 2014, reflecting strong demand for our Flexible Packaging used in puddings, yogurts, fruit slurries, baby foods and sauces. Our investment to expand capacity for these products enables our customers to continue the conversion from rigid to flexible packaging formats. We will continue our strong pricing discipline in end markets such as confections, snack, pet food and various dried foods where technology and differentiation is less important. Clearly, this strategy has resulted in lower sales volumes in these categories during 2014 and we are selectively improving our competitive position with investments to support these end markets. In Latin America, volume in the first half of 2014 was lower, reflecting softer consumer demand. But volume grew in the second half of the year. We expect our high-barrier product commercializations to provide continued strength and differentiation in this region. In addition, our health care business is strong. We increased sales volume in medical device and pharmaceutical packaging this past year and we expect this to continue. With the increased complexity in the global health care market, our unique packaging is critical to meet the stringent demands of safety and sterility. And finally, the third item that may impact where we are within the range is our successful commercialization of new business. As we ramped up various new business awards in 2014, our margins were dampened by startup waste and inefficiency. As I previously stated, we have taken actions to overcome these growing pains and we will return to normal efficiency levels during 2015. I continue to be confident as we move ahead with a heightened sense of urgency to achieve our full profit potential. Now with regard to the resin environment. First, as I have mentioned before, it is important to remember that our business is designed not to win or lose from movements in resin prices. Over the years, we have worked to shorten the lag time associated with passing along resin price changes to our customers in order to minimize volatility in our earnings. 2014 was a relatively stable year for resin with increases in polyethylene in February and September, followed by decreases in November and December. Regardless of where prices land during 2015, we will continue to pass along changes in resin prices per our customer agreements. Even if resin prices drop, we would only anticipate a slight tailwind in the operating profit during the quarter following the movement. In summary, 2014 was a pivotal year in the execution of our strategy. From our previous internal focus on optimizing our footprint to an external focus on accelerating disciplined growth, delivering innovation and continuously improving all we do. I am optimistic about the prospects for growth in 2015 and I am pleased to welcome Mike Clauer as part of the Bemis leadership team. Mike's industry experience, business perspectives and drive for superior performance will be integral for the successful execution of our strategy. Before turning it over to Mike, just a reminder that we will be holding our first Investor Day on March 10 in New York City. Our global operating team and I look forward to seeing you there. Now I'll turn it over to Mike to discuss the financials. Michael B. Clauer: Thanks, Bill, and good morning. I had the pleasure of working with some of you in my past roles and I'm looking forward to meeting the rest of you in March. As Bill mentioned, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $0.50 -- $0.57 per share for the fourth quarter and $2.30 for the full year in 2014. This is a 16% increase compared to the prior fourth quarter and a 10% increase for the full year. In the fourth quarter, our business is typically slower than our seasonally stronger second and third quarters. During the quarter, we continued to achieve year-over-year growth in our target end markets, both in the U.S. and globally. I will begin by commenting on each reportable segment followed by overall company performance for the fourth quarter and the full year. As I discuss revenue by reportable segment, refer to Page 5 of the supplemental schedules, which provide detail on the year-over-year changes in net sales by reportable segment. First, U.S. Packaging. Our U.S. business represents approximately 2/3 of total Bemis sales from continuing operations. In the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of the March divestiture of our Paper Packaging Division, our U.S. segment delivered organic growth of approximately 2%, which was driven by, primarily by favorable price mix. Next, I'll cover full year net sales and provide more color on unit volume. For the full year 2014, and again excluding divestitures, our U.S. segment delivered organic growth of 1.1%, which was driven primarily by favorable price mix. Overall unit volumes for the full year were down approximately 2% as compared to 2013. Some insights on that breakdown. Unit volumes increased in our target dairy and liquid end markets by mid-single-digit percentages compared to last year. Unit volumes also increased for industrial application, as -- applications, as well as multipack film, which is used as over -- for bottled beverages. Prices -- [Audio Gap] Driven by consumers -- [Audio Gap] By higher cheese prices during 2014. Recently, cheese prices have started to fall, so we would expect demand for cheese to rebound. For the full year, unit volume declined mid-single-digit percentages in our dry foods, bakery and confectionery and snacks. U.S. Packaging operating margin for the fourth quarter of 12.9% compares with adjusted operating margin of 12.5% for the prior fourth quarter. For the full year, operating margin increased 13 point -- increased to 13.1% compared to 12.8% the prior year. Both our fourth quarter and full year returns benefited from the paper package divestiture and higher unit sales to our targeted dairy and liquid end markets. During the third and fourth quarters of 2014, our returns in U.S. Packaging were dampened by startup costs associated with new business commercialization. As Bill mentioned, we are keenly focused on operational efficiencies improvements in 2015, which will ensure we meet our full margin potential on this new business. Now, I'll move to our Global Packaging segment, which represents approximately 1/3 of total Bemis sales from continuing operations. Our global segment delivered another strong full quarter, following the middle of Page 5 in the supplemental schedules, in the fourth quarter, Global Packaging sales decreased 1.5%. Currency in Latin America decreased sales by 9.3%. Excluding currency, Global Packaging delivered strong organic growth of 7.8%, driven by both favorable price mix and unit volume increases. Unit volumes in Global Packaging during the fourth quarter were up approximately 1%, with increases in our target end markets of high-barrier perishable food and also medical devices and pharmaceutical packaging. Moving to full year sales, total Global Packaging net sales for 2014 were down 0.6%. Excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions, our global business delivered organic growth of 4%. For the full year, overall unit volumes were down roughly 1%, more than offset by increased price mix. Unit volumes in the first half of the year were down as a result of overall soft consumer demand, but unit volumes increased during the second half of the year. Specifically, unit volumes were strong in our target end markets servicing health care and high barrier packaging for food, such as meat, across Latin America, Europe and Asia. Global Packaging operating margins for the fourth quarter was a strong -- was strong at 8% of net sales and compares with adjusted operating margin of 6.8% for the prior fourth quarter. For the full year, operating margins increased to 7.6% in 2014 compared to 7.1% in 2013. Currency negatively impacted operating profits by $6.4 million for the year. Increased operating margin for the year was a result of higher selling prices and better mix in target end markets, with volume growth in the second half of the year contributing to higher returns. Now on to consolidated Bemis results. Selling, general and administrative expenses for continuing operations was 9.6% of net sales for the full year, a decrease compared to 10% for the full year of 2013. This improvement is a reflection of disciplined cost controls and we expect this discipline to continue in 2015. R&D expense for the full year was $44 million, a 10% increase, consistent with our strategy to accelerate the pace of innovation and commercialization of new products. The income tax rate from continuing operations for the full year 2014 was 34.3%. We expect the rate for '15 to be approximately 34%. Cash flow from operations for the full year 2014 totaled $248 million. Cash from operations was unfavorably impacted by roughly $50 million due to onetime items in the first half of the year related to plant closures and divestitures. In addition, working capital was a use of cash by approximately $150 million. Roughly half of this use was accounts receivable and the remaining use was related to increases in inventory and decreases in payables. Regardless, this level of cash flow is unacceptably low. One of my priorities for 2015 will include a sharp focus on working capital discipline, especially in managing inventory levels during new product commercializations. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were approximately $70 million, bringing our total year capital spend to $185 million, in line with our expectations set earlier in the year. We anticipate 2015 capital expenditures to be between $185 million and $200 million to support growth and productivity projects in our pipeline. Quickly touching on our leverage metric, net debt to adjusted EBITDA at the end of the fourth quarter was 2.1x, in line with our targeted rate of 2x. During 2015, we intend to generate strong cash flow, invest capital wisely and not accumulate cash. Our priorities continue to be : Support our dividend program, invest in capital projects, fund strategic acquisitions and share repurchases. Looking next at ROIC, return on invested capital, the goal has been to improve this metric year-over-year. Following Page 6 of the supplemental schedules, in 2014, ROIC increased to 9.7% compared to 9.3% in 2013 and 9% in 2012. As outlined on the schedule, we have chosen to adopt and assume a constant tax rate with this calculation to better depict true operational performance. We will continue to target year-over-year improvement in ROIC by making sound capital investments and improving overall earnings performance. Turning to the full year outlook. Before reviewing the details of 2015, I'll comment on our decision to provide annual guidance on a go forward basis versus the prior practice of annual plus quarterly guidance. To be clear, this is -- new practice is being implemented as a matter of preference only. There is no changes in the predictability of our business. Similar to history, you can continue to expect second and third quarters to be our seasonally strong quarters in a given year. As Bill mentioned, we have established an adjusted EBIT -- EPS range for 2015 of $2.52 to $2.67, which represents a double-digit increase compared to 2014 continuing operations. Our guidance assumes foreign currency remains at current levels and would exclude any non-reoccurring items. Let me walk through a few of the items that we have considered in this range. First, as you may recall, last summer, $400 million in bonds were refinanced from a fixed interest rate of 5.65% to a combination of variable rate debt, that in today's environment, equates to approximately 1%. Assuming rates stay low, this will continue to drive a favorable year-over-year pretax savings of approximately $1.5 million per month through July of 2015. Next, pension expense. Our frozen pension plans remain adequately funded and no contributions to the plan are necessary in 2015. With the recent required changes to the mortality tables and decline in the discount rate, partially offset by favorable 2014 asset returns, our pension expense will increase by approximately $5 million in '15. The remaining year-over-year increase in EPS reflects the improvements that will result as we execute our strategy to sell more high-margin products and to invest for growth in enhanced productivity, while maintaining a sharp high end cost. In summary, I am looking forward to a great 2015. I made the decision to join the team at Bemis because this company has a great deal of opportunity and potential. Potential to improve its financial performance, increase its competitive advantage and create shareholder value. We have a lot of work to do. Our strategy is right. We have resources aligned and we have the drive and talent to execute. I see great things for this company and am proud to be part of it. With that, we'll turn the call over for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. [Technical Difficulty] We are experiencing a momentary pause in today's conference. Please remain on the line. [Technical Difficulty] We'll take our next question from Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Bill, my question was really for you and it was around the guidance. And specifically more around your specific methodology and philosophy around the guidance. Specifically, your new management team -- right, I'm not sure -- I know you're part of the company before, but you're switching from annual guidance, I'm sorry, from annual and quarterly, but more specifically, are you thinking more top down? Are you rolling up from the segment forecast? Are you more conservative? More aggressive? Just trying to get a feel for the way you think about the guidance. William F. Austen: Yes, it's a good question, Scott, and it's one that we've kicked around here quite a bit. In March, we're going to lay out our objectives for the next several years. And the global leadership team, the operating team that's going to be at that meeting, has got specific plans for their regions of the world that are going to be projected over the course of a longer term, okay? Not a 90-day plan but more of a -- where are we on the strategy, where are we on the journey, where are we on improving our ROIC trend moving forward. Where are we on our return on sales trend moving forward. So we're taking an approach that says, we're going to continue to meet quarterly. We're going to continue to have these conference calls quarterly. We're going to continue to tell you where we are on our journey on a quarterly basis, but that journey is going to be where are we in our longer-term journey. Where are we on our goals and objectives that we've set out for the company over the longer-term. And that's going to include product vitality. What kind of new products we'll be bringing to the market? When are they going to hit the market? What do our sales trends look like? What do the macroeconomic trends look like in those regions of the world that are going to project us onto that journey. So to do that on a quarterly basis, it's just doesn't -- not something we're going to do. Going to tell you about the year and we're going to give you, not guidance, but we're going to give you information as to where we stand on our annual journey and where we are in our -- hitting our goals and objectives on the longer term. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. Sounds reasonable to me. Just as a follow-up, then. You've had pretty healthy changes in ROIC the last, I guess 3 years, I mean you're up almost 140 basis points by your numbers, 2011 to 2014. Is -- do you have an ROIC target for 2015 you want to share with us today? William F. Austen: No, we're going to stick to the same knitting we've always had, Scott, in that we're going to continue to improve our ROIC, the trend is going to be up as we go forward. And in March, we'll lay out what we think our goals and objectives are going to be for the next several years, so you'll get to see that in March. But we don't have a target that we're going to tell you for 2015. But we've done good work. I mean, if you look at the teams, what they've been doing, we've been focusing on, just as much as to what we're not going to do, which is just as important as what we are going to do. And when we focus on what we're not going to do, we start to drive that ROIC up. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Canada : I wanted to talk briefly about working capital, Mike. Big use of cash in 2014. What might we expect in 2015? Michael B. Clauer: I'm working on plans right now with the organization to make sure that cash, that working capital is not a use of cash in 2015. I'm really not in a position yet, having been here only 2 months, to determine if it's -- could be a source. But clearly, that's going to be one of my goals, is to, #1, cash flow from operations before working capital changes should be flat. There should be no impact to working capital. And I'm going to try to -- determined to find ways to make it a source in 2015. Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Canada : Okay. If I could take the follow on. Can you just discuss with us, in the Brazilian business, how much of that is consumer-oriented business versus like protein business that might be more affected by exports and might actually see a benefit from the decline in the Brazilian real? William F. Austen: Yes. This is Bill. The business that we have in Latin America, specifically Brazil, along your question, our protein business is now becoming more consumer-focused than it had been before. We have a, we had a very nice business in fresh red meat for export, which is specifically at your point, yes, we should see a little bit of help from the export market in Brazil. But as we talked last time on the call, as packaging formats become more and more sophisticated, which they have been somewhat in Brazil, we start to get more into the consumer segment with our high barrier materials and our high barrier products. So we've got a mix now. we've got a mix of export business and we have a mix of consumer business as it relates to protein. Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Canada : Okay, and just in ballpark terms, in Brazil or in Latin America, how much of it should we think about as kind of direct to the consumer packaging and how much is sort of intermediate packaging? William F. Austen: Mostly, what we do in Brazil, in Brazil itself is focused at the consumer. So you're looking at probably, if I had to cut it, 90% is, would be consumer-driven and 10% would be for export. Operator : Next we'll hear from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : First off, just in terms of CapEx. Can you just give us some more color as to where the CapEx dollars are going, maybe by geography and also maybe some of the new product examples. $200 million, that would be a record for the company and the company is smaller, given the divestitures over the last few years. So just curious why that number is so high. William F. Austen: Ghansham, this is Bill. You look at what we have in place, we have a 60-plus plant network in place around the world. And just the fact that there are 60 plants, there's maintenance, and run-the-business kind of capital that's required with 60 plants. We also have an emerging business in Asia Pacific, not just on the food side but in health care and in the electronics arena. And we'll be investing in all 3 of those product, I should say, market segments, in Asia-Pacific as we go forward. And if you look at the plant network in the United States, in beef, U.S. Packaging, you see that we've got productivity gains to be made with some investment that we can put in, and those productivity gains help us expand margins, improve service and quality across the U.S. Packaging network. So we've got good opportunities in U.S. Packaging for both growth in liquid dairy and high barrier, but we also have good opportunities for margin expansion with productivity improvements through capital investment. And in Europe, we continue to have a very nice protein business, a high barrier business in Europe, where we invested last year. And we'll be investing in some more of those same type of assets that we put into Europe for flat film. We'll be investing into that kind of technology in U.S. Packaging. So if you split it out, it's -- there's a good portion of it goes into U.S. Packaging, a portion of it goes into Asia Pacific. We have some of the CapEx budget going into Latin America. But those are basically the 3. Europe, we invested in quite nicely in the last year and now we're going to bring those assets up to speed and fill them in Europe. Operator : Our next question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I guess my first question was, again just on working capital. So I seem to remember a lower working capital guidance for the year than what wound up being the case. And there was, I think, round numbers, around a $50 million use in the fourth quarter. So I am assuming that, that's related to some of the new product and new customer awards you've been given. But if -- could you confirm that, and provide a bit more detail? And if that's not what's going on, could you provide what the drivers are there? And then I had a follow-on. Michael B. Clauer: You are correct. I mean the bulk of the use in Q4 was really driven by, I think we just underestimated the, what the impact of inventory we're building for commercialization around the world. It's not just in North America, it was also in China. And #2, and when I really dug into the details, we just had our sales mix in the Q4 was kind of more towards customers that had longer terms. So that's kind of what happened. George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And the 2-part related follow-on. One, if you underestimated the inventory on commercialization, does that give us any pause in terms of what the customer takeaway or interest in these new products, or a retail pull has been on them thus far? I.e., is there kind of an inventory problem or not at all? And then more broadly, cash from operations, recognizing you're still trying to put pen to paper on what working capital will look like for the year. Is there any way to give us a ballpark for cash from operations? I mean, by my math, could it be $400 million to $450 million in '15? Thanks, guys and I'll turn it over. William F. Austen: George, I'm going to answer a piece of that question and Mike's going to answer the rest. Let me answer the question about the commercialization, is there an inventory issue? No, there is not. I feel really good about 2015 and heading into 2015, we came out of 2014 with projects that had already been through the trialing phases that we're scaling up, and are going to be commercialized as we go into Q1 and Q2 and Q3 of 2015. And this is not just in any one region of the world, but it's in every region of the world. In the U.S, we've got great traction with our Evolution product line now, which is fully commercialized and in the market. We've got in Latin America, the conversion of glass bottle for drinkable yogurt to a unique cup and lid structure that was trialed late last year, hit the market in December and now is at full scale-up in retail in Latin America. In Europe, our VSP films have really set ourselves apart from the competition with the type of film we make and those films have created pull through new customers for other products that we have not sold before in Europe. And in Asia Pacific, we qualified several new film structures for the electronics industry, medical and pharma and food in late 2014 that will ramp up through commercialization in Q1 and Q3 -- Q2 of 2015. So I am -- I feel really good about where we are this year versus last year, coming out of 2013. Feel really good, feel very positive about where those new products and where they are in their commercialization, but also where they are in the marketplace. I'll turn the other part of it over to Mike. Michael B. Clauer: Yes. As far as 2015, the way I think about this at this point, your numbers are in the zip code. If you take EBITDA at the midpoint of our guidance, our range, and then you subtract cash taxes and cash interest, I come up with a number of $410 million, before any changes in working capital. And as I mentioned earlier, I'm committed to make sure that working capital is not a use of cash in 2015. Operator : Our next question comes from Philip Ng with Jefferies. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : It doesn't sound like you're assuming much tailwind from resin in your guidance, so what are the key drivers you're including? And what are you assuming for volumes in your base business versus like the commercialization of new business? William F. Austen: Phil, this is Bill. Your question about volume, what we looked at, what we're looking at for volumes into 2015, and I'm not going to talk about base business or new business. But overall, 2% unit volume growth in U.S. Packaging is what we're looking at, and in global, it's 4%. And that's -- includes the, what I would say is the base business, as well as the commercialization efforts that we've gone through in late 2014 into 2015 that will bring new business, new customers to Bemis Company. That's -- those are the numbers we're looking at. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And just looking at price mix, particularly in U.S. Packaging, it does appear like it accelerated a touch, based on what you provided color for the full year. One, is that correct? And when you think about 2015, parsing out between mix and price, how are you thinking about it? Are you seeing any pushback from your customers on -- with lower raw material prices at this point? William F. Austen: Well, we get push back from our customers even when raw material prices go up. It's not just when they go down. But yes, as I said in my prepared statement, our model is built around trying to decrease the volatility in earnings when raw materials go up and when they go down. So if they go up, they go down, we got about a 90-day window and then it's our pass-through, our contracts with customers would pass through those up-and-down movements to the customer base. So of course, we get push back all the time. There's always conversation about whether raw materials are going up or are they going down, but it's no louder than it normally would be. Operator : Our next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: First question is on the volume front. I think you mentioned that internationally, of the 4% organic growth, about 1% was volume. And I guess 3% would've been price and mix. I want to clarify that. And then as we look at the 7 -- I'm sorry, at the 1.1% in the U.S. for the full year, how would you split that between volume on one hand and price and mix in the other? William F. Austen: In global, you'd see that price mix is up, okay? And unit volume was down, primarily due to a slow first half of consumption driven in Latin America. As we went through 2014 in the second half, we actually gain some volume and gain some share in Latin America to offset the down first half of the year. So price mix is good. We continue to push very hard on price, being a leader in Latin America and that would include Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. And we did see volumes increase in the second half of 2014 based on some share gain and some new products that we delivered to the market. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Right. I'm sorry, I meant it was down 1%. And how about in the U.S, when you look at the overall organic of 1.1%. How is that split between volume on one hand and price mix on the other? William F. Austen: Again, sort of -- somewhat the same, very strong price mix of about 3% and unit volume down about 2%. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Got you. And on the same basis, as we look at 2015, and I appreciate the guidance before of 2% in the U.S. and 4% global, will there be any drag, I guess is the way to look at it, from the divestiture effect or is that all behind us now as we look at 2015? William F. Austen: That's gone. That's behind us. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs. Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I wanted to ask a couple of questions on the resin side. So I know you guys have said a number of times that you really have set up the business in a way where you pass it through pretty quickly regardless which way it's moving. But I'm curious, because my understanding is that 40% of the business is not contractual. If I'm understanding sort of some of the commentary from the past correctly. Can you just talk about the transmission mechanism of lower resin prices to customers that are not on contract? William F. Austen: Yes. About 2/3 of the business, let's say, is contract. The other third is not. So you're close. It's very close, it's ballpark. But on the customers that are noncontract customers, obviously, we try to hang on to those price deltas as long as possible. We are not out there knocking on their doors letting them know that, \"Oh, resin just went down, here's your $0.05.\" We try to hang on to those as long as possible. We create new structures. We create new features, so that we can try to keep those gains in-house. But we are not out there proactively lowering price to noncontract customers. Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. So it's really a function of supply and demand fundamentals for that? William F. Austen: Correct. Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : And can you maybe talk to those? I mean, how does the marketplace feel now for that noncontract business? Is there maybe potential for you to be able to hang on to some of the benefits for longer than in past periods? Is it any different at all in terms of the competitive landscape for the noncontract business? William F. Austen: No, it's the same as it always has been. It's a competitive environment. We do create unique differentiated structures in a lot of those parts of the world that run well on equipment, that maintain certain features and functions that, that customer is desiring. So in some cases, it's hard for them to move it, in other cases it's not. It just -- it is -- there is a competitive dynamic that exists. And we try to differentiate ourselves to maintain that competitive dynamic in our favor. Operator : Next we'll hear from Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo Securities. Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : I wanted to come back to, really, maybe go into a little more detail with regards to the earning lock [ph] going from the $2.30 to [Audio gap] the $2.60 at the midpoint of your guidance range. But one of the areas I wanted to center in on was kind of the raw material component. And if you buy about 2 billion pounds of resin a year, if resin only fell $0.10, and we're looking at some decreases that are bigger than that, that might be $200 million on an annual basis. Even if you held that for a quarter and only for a portion, you could be talking about still something, could be $25 million to $50 million of a benefit for you on the earnings side. And maybe something, $25 million to $30 million on the working capital side. So -- maybe help me understand how that's factored into your guidance or is it? It sounds like it's not, and maybe what I'm missing with my math. Michael B. Clauer: Chris, this is Mike. I've got industry experience and where I came from, I think your statement is probably correct that companies that really pass through quicker are going to get a lot of short-term benefit. The one thing I will say as I've come to Bemis and started really understanding their structure here, they've done a really good job of taking the volatility out of earnings because of resin and when it goes up. The flip side of that is when it's coming down, we're not going to benefit. I mean, I think the actions this company took to take that volatility out is great. I mean, they're beyond -- they really aren't in the business to make money on commodity price movements. They're in the business of differentiating themselves and creating superior products. But to your comment, you would get some benefit in working capital if resin starts coming down, I don't see those type of numbers in the P&L. Operator : Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : I just had a quick follow-up on CapEx. You ran $135 million, $140 million in CapEx for a number of years. And I was just wondering what you consider maintenance CapEx without the PSM business to be. And Bill, as you look at the 60-plus plants in the Bemis system, as you took over as CEO, are there any assets that you feel so [ph] were undercapitalized, or can you give any thoughts there? William F. Austen: Yes. If you look back over the last couple of years, we -- what we spent, actual physical cash spent on capital, it was basically a 50-50 blend between maintenance, environmental health and safety, run-the-business kind of capital and capital for growth. So your $130 million number, about $65 million was spent on maintenance and run the business, and $65 million was spent for growth. As we go forward, that dynamic is going to shift, and we're going to be -- so rather than 50-50, it will be more like 65/35. 65% spent on growth, 35% spent on run the business, environmental health and safety, maintenance kinds of items. So that's the shift that's taking place in 2014. 65%-plus of our capital went toward growth initiatives and growth projects, because we haven't -- we hadn't put the money toward the growth lever on capital, now we're doing that. And that, again, that is growth for volume growth, new products, new assets to run new materials, as well as productivity improvements to enhance margins. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay, okay, that's helpful. And then just shifting to the cost side, can you talk a little bit about the cost inflation you're expecting outside of resin in 2015? And if there are big moving pieces there, like labor, that you expect to go up maybe higher than in previous years? Michael B. Clauer: I'll take that one. This is Mike. When I looked through the, kind of the budget assumptions, sat down with the HR department and the purchasing group and looked at the various cost areas. I would say a good number to use is, 2% to 3%, so call it 2.5% for your non-raw material cost. Operator : Next we'll hear from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Mike, one question on the cash flow. As you mentioned in response to a previous question that you expect Op cash, excluding working capital of about $410 million. Based on the CapEx guidance, you're talking about $220-ish million for the year. Is that, do you consider that a normalized number for the company? And what about the $50 million onetime drag that you referenced earlier, from $20 million [indiscernible] William F. Austen: Well first of all, [indiscernible] I think the $400 million, $410 million is the right number at the 2015 midpoint EBITDA. Clearly, as this company grows, that cash flow will be improving. But no, I -- I mean, when I look at the facts that -- based on this year, if you take cash taxes and cash interest, that's the starting point. Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Okay, okay. So there are no one -- you had the $50 million onetime drag in '14, that obviously won't recur, and that's reflected in that. Michael B. Clauer: No. At this point, there really is no meaningful onetime items that we can see. Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Okay, okay. And just two others. One on -- in terms of the inventory buildup, and do you expect that to result in a meaningful boost to sales growth this year? And just more generally, what are your sales growth expectations this year on a constant currency basis? William F. Austen: What we said earlier was 2% in U.S. Packaging and 4% in global, and that inventory, some of that inventory build that occurred in late 2014 is focused right at that target, being able to hit those targets through trial, scale-up, commercialization of new products. Michael B. Clauer: And to further answer, if there is no new products developed throughout '15, yes, you would expect that inventory to come down. But I -- we've got a lot of meaningful projects in process that quite honestly, could potentially, we could have the same situation as we look at the end of 2015. But I will tell you, the one thing we're going to look at differently is how, we #1, build commercialization, inventory for commercialization. And #2, if we're doing it, it's going to, we're going to clearly have more transparency with you to let you know what we're outlooking as we go out throughout the year. Operator : Next we'll hear from Al Kabili with Macquarie. Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research : I guess the first question, I wanted to just clarify, Bill, on the volume outlook. The 2% in the U.S. is quite a bit greater than what Bemis has been able to deliver in quite a while. And I was wondering what gives you the kind of increased confidence this year? Is it more of a call on just the underlying end markets improving after several sluggish years? Or do you also see the new product pipeline that you've got out there also kind of at a greater level than what you've seen in the past, or a combination of both? And in the context of also some of the leakage from the less differentiated products, the same, sort of what stops that trend from continuing into '15? William F. Austen: It's a good question, Al. And where we -- what we look at is really, where did we come through 2014 as we got toward the end of the year? We had -- we didn't have a lot of trials, we had a lot of startup of new types of structures for new products and some of them are now commercial, they're in the marketplace and they're ramping up. So if you look back over time, maybe we weren't that robust with some of the real live, on the deck plates products that are going to be in the market that customers have accepted. And looking at the end of '14 into '15, there's real tangible products in U.S. Packaging that are entering the market now. And customers, they're feeling a little bit better with the lower gasoline prices that are out there and they're -- customers like the large CPGs in the United States are looking at, okay, how do I re-energize some of my brands? What can I do to get brands into different formats? And for some of these large customers, we're one of their very go-to type packaging companies to help them come up with new designs and new features. So I look at that and say, gosh, we're in a great position versus years gone by, where brands weren't trying to be re-energized or reinvigorated. So some of our large customers are bringing out some new formats for -- so they can drive their brands and get some growth in the market that they haven't had until the past few years, and we're in a good position to help them. And we've gotten products in their hands throughout the second half of 2014 that will become commercialized in 2015. So I feel good about that. The team in U.S. Packaging feels really good about that, both on -- in dairy, liquid, meat, cheese, protein snacking, on-the-go, all these types of smaller formats are entering the market. And we're in a great position to support them. We have products, we have awards and we've got new things entering the market. So going out of '14, I feel very confident about '15's volume. Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research : Okay. That's helpful. And along those lines, going into '15, and maybe this also relates to, maybe the inventory situation at year-end that surprised you. Are you seeing any destocking on the part of customers, in anticipation of lower resin prices, maybe creating some volume headwinds in the near term in destocking? Is that -- was that a factor in some of the inventory situation at the end of the year that you mentioned, with working capital and kind of what you're seeing as early days of 15? William F. Austen: No. We did not see that. At least I did not see that, I don't think any of our business team saw that either. What we're seeing is good orders flow, good orders rates going into the year, which is nice. It's comforting. Operator : Next we'll hear from Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : So my first question is for Bill. Obviously, there's been a lot of leadership changes at Bemis over the last year. And I'm just wondering with the addition of Mike now, do you feel you have the management team in place to kind of put your strategic vision, going forward, on your transformational changes to Bemis? William F. Austen: Absolutely. I feel really good about the leadership team that's in place at Bemis. And not just here in the United States, but all around the world. We've got a great leadership team, everybody's on the same page. We're all aligned. They know what not to do, which is very important, and they're focused on what we should be doing and how we're working closer and closer with customers to be their packaging company of choice, and that's our vision. Our vision is to really get wrapped around customers and be passionate about our customers' success and in turn, we will succeed. And the whole team, the whole global team is on that page. Deborah Jones - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : And my second question is for Mike. It's really I -- my line got cut off, I'm not sure if I could have [ph] these issues, but when you were talking about trends in meat and cheese, specifically the lower cheese prices and the potential impact there, can you just repeat and clarify what you had said earlier? Michael B. Clauer: Yes. What I said earlier was our volumes in 2014 decreased mixed single digits in the cheese category and that was really kind of driven by higher cheese prices. And what we're seeing now as we come into '15 is cheese pricing is declining, coming down, so we would anticipate we'd see kind of a pickup back in our packaging for cheese. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Just 2 follow ups here. First on resin. Can you talk about any unrecovered cost increases you might have had in 2015 (sic) [ 2014 ] around resin increasing and prices not keeping up with resin inflation? William F. Austen: No, Scott, we didn't see that. Michael B. Clauer: I think your comment was in 2014 and as I had mentioned that, the company's done a really good job of minimizing the volatility of price moves. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Right. No, I was just asking, a lot of curiosity on the subject, and so I figured a look back would be more telling of the strategy than a look forward on resin and your ability to pass that through, so that's why I was asking the question. Then Bill, just -- the last question is on compensation. You noted the change to ROIC and ROS, and I just was hoping you could maybe frame that a little bit for us, versus compensation structure before? William F. Austen: You bet. 2015, the global leadership team is, their incentive compensation package is 50% based on return on invested capital, 50% based on return on sales. And in the past, it was a couple of items, one of which was earnings per share and operating profit, safety, those kinds of things. But we're getting the leadership teams around the world focused on return on invested capital, making decisions based on return on invested capital and return on sales. We've marched down this road, this is the road we're on, we changed the compensation plans to align with where we need to go and what we want to push on, and everybody's behind it. Operator : Next we'll take a follow-up question from Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Canada : Yes. I wanted to touch base on 2 things briefly. One is the share repurchase activity in 2014 was much more active than we've seen in recent years from Bemis, and I wonder whether we should take that as a kind of change in direction in terms of use of cash going forward? And then also, I wondered if you could talk about the timeframe to getting the global business to those double-digit margins. William F. Austen: I'll take the first part of that question. I think if you really look at our share repurchases and then considering we had some cash from disposing of 2 businesses during the year, it was really just driven by keeping in line with our 2x leverage. And we will continue the same kind of strategy at 2x levered. And if we have excess cash and we don't have a strategic acquisition to make, we would clearly repurchase shares. Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Canada : OK, and then the global margins? William F. Austen: [indiscernible] Right, the other part of your question was global margins. What we've said in the journey that the global team is on, is that 10%-plus in 3 to 5 years. And they worked very hard this past year and a half to put themselves in the position to do that. And we're really excited about what they've got going on as we go through 2015 and beyond. So 3 to 5 years, 10%-plus, and they're well on their way to do that. Operator : Next we'll hear from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : First question of 2 is around investment. So if we look at your guidance on capital spending, what would be the factors if you could call them out, that would drive CapEx to the higher end of your range? Is it really more product and market growth-driven, or is there any swag factor that you've built in, just for FX? And then you mentioned that you're investing relative to confectionery snack and dry. And it sounded like it was to combat what is a more competitive market there. I just wanted to confirm that, and if so, hear what you're doing there, and then I had a follow-on. William F. Austen: Sure. The -- if you look at our dairy and liquid categories, there's a lot of growth in the conversion of, from rigid formats, glass can to flexibles. There are some unique assets, some unique materials that we use to do that, to drive that and differentiate ourselves. That kind of asset, we're going to be investing in that type of asset, we'll be investing in, so. And they're not like, just off-the-shelf. There's some unique things that we build into that equipment that causes the price to be a little bit higher. If you look -- the other part of that question, George, was around dry food, snack, confection, those things. We've got some aging equipment that we've had and we're going to be reinvesting in some of that aging equipment. It's not just focused on dry snacks and other, and dry snacks and confection and candy. And it can be used for other kinds of operations as well. But it allows us to drive nice gains in productivity and margin enhancements when we do that. So I'm going to go back to our -- to what our hurdle rate is for when we look at investments. And what we've always, what we've been looking at for the past 18 months or so is a 5-year average, 15% return on invested capital. So if the business teams come in with a project that has a 5-year average of 8%, well, they don't bother coming in with those, because the hurdle rate is 15% return on invested capital, 5 years. So if we have that kind of project to invest in, we're going to invest in that to drive our ROIC up. George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. Appreciate the color there. And then my other question is a little bit bigger picture. Covering Bemis over the years, it's never been a company that hasn't been lacking new products. There'd be stick packs, there were ice films, there were 7-layer films. But the marketing of those products, at least from my vantage point, tend to be very one-off. It wasn't done perhaps as comprehensively, maybe not done as much from an end market standpoint as should have been the case. Now that's my opinion, you may disagree with that. And if you do, please lay that out. If you agree somewhat with the premise, what are you doing differently, going forward, to market the suite of products that Bemis has to offer more effectively? What incentives are you putting around that? And what are the risks in trying to do that? William F. Austen: George, it's Bill. I'll take that one. If you look at what we've done with U.S. Packaging, and the way that we're structured now in U.S. Packaging, we're structured around what you just described. Those end market categories. And in the past, we may not have been structured that way. So it was more of a one-off sell to a, to customer X. And customer Y never found out about it because it was just a one-off sale. But if you look at the way we're structured now, around market categories, meat, dairy, liquid, meat, cheese, dairy, liquid, grocery. It gives us, it gives that business team the opportunity to do just what you described. How do I take it across -- how do I take this structure, call it stick pack, across the market category versus just to one end customer? So we're trying to get that leverage, not just in U.S. Packaging but now, with the global leadership team we have in place, we try to take those opportunities for structures like a stick pack, like liquid, like a canned glass conversion into flexibles to the other global team in Europe, in South America and in Asia Pacific, so we've got a much better connected organization that is trying to do what you're describing, George, in leveraging the scale, the technology and the scope of Bemis's advantage and differentiation, to not just one customer but to the category, with which the customers reside. And that's where we're headed. Operator : We'll take a follow-up question from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Mike, one just clarification question on cash flow, sorry to ask another question about cash flow. But the company went into 2014 expecting Op cash of at least $500 million. It's going into this year expecting Op cash of a little over $400 million. Obviously, you divested pressure sensitive, but I don't think that accounted for anything close to $100 million. So can you just help me bridge kind of where the company was going into last year and where it's going into this year, in terms of -- on the Op cash flow side? Michael B. Clauer: Well, I'm asking myself the same question, because I can't bridge it from last year. Pressure sensitive was about $50 million of cash flow. I think there was some assumptions made that there was going to be some working capital that was going to be a use and it just didn't get there. When I look at my simple way, when I -- I've said it before, if I just take EBITDA less cash taxes and cash interest, that's where I get to. Operator : Next we'll hear from Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs. Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Just a quick follow-up for you. Can you talk about what you think you can do in that productivity in 2015? So productivity that would actually impact at the bottom line of the company? You talked about some issues with, just not being as efficient with equipment, given new product launches. And so maybe taking that into account as well, what do you think you can do in productivity in 2015? William F. Austen: Yes, Alex, while I don't have it summed for the entire company, each region has got very specific targets and goals for waste scrap productivity improvements, whether it's speed increases on equipment, whether it's throughput increases on equipment. Every region of the world has got aggressive targets for reductions in waste scrap, improvements in quality and increases in speed and throughputs. So it rolls up into their numbers and I'm -- I just don't have that summed for the company. We have very specific plans in each of the regions, though. Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Understand, Bill. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to our speakers today for any additional or closing comments. Erin M. Winters: Thank you, operator. Thank you all for joining us today. This concludes our conference call. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Scott Hudson - CLSA John Purtell - Macquarie Larry Gandler - Credit Suisse Australia Ltd. Ken MacKenzie : Good morning, and thank you for taking the time to attend Amcor\u2019s Interim Results Conference Call. It\u2019s Ken MacKenzie speaking. And with me I have Ron Delia, the CFO and CEO elect. Ron and I will take you through the results this morning, and then as usual, we\u2019re happy to open it up for questions. Moving to Slide 3, as we do with all our internal meetings at Amcor, I would like to start with our safety performance. At Amcor, we\u2019re committed to a goal of no injuries. In over many years, Amcor has made tremendous in-roads to improving our safety performance, and I\u2019m pleased to say that this has continued. In the last 12 months, our lost time injury frequency rate has declined to 0.4, in our recordable case, frequency rate is 2. These indicators reflect the number of incidents per million hours worked. In addition, at the end of December, over 50% of our sites around the world were incident free, so that\u2019s no injuries. And while our current levels of performance make Amcor a truly world-class company in the area of safety, we must continue to drive improvements in this area, it\u2019s our number one priority and even one injury is one to many. If we move to Slide 4, before proceeding to the results, I just want to give an overview of where Amcor is today, and this will assist in understanding the context of our performance. If you look at the middle pie chart, you can see that it\u2019s a very focused business, two product segments, Flexibles and Rigid Plastics packaging with a global market leader in each of our chosen end market segments; food, beverage, healthcare, and tobacco packaging, and you can see the split on the left-hand side pie chart. The business has a combination of good industry structures, scale positions, and differentiated value propositions. If you look at the right-hand side, you can see we have a global footprint. We\u2019re operating in 43 countries, and we have a unique position in emerging markets at 32% of sales. All of this is supported by our proprietary operating model the Amcor Way and solid financial metrics in cash flow. And the key message from this slide is that Amcor has been transformed, and today is very well positioned as a global leader in its chosen market segments. If we move now to Slide 5, shows the key financial information for the half year. Now a reminder, this is the first period that we\u2019re reporting in U.S. dollars. Earnings per share were up 6.8% and on a constant currency basis, up 10.4%. The dividend is up 9.2% to US$0.19 per share, and it will be paid in Australian dollars as $0.244 and that\u2019s up 24.9% expressed in Australian dollar terms. Returns continued to improve to a first-half record of 19.2%, and on a full calendar year basis, returns were 20.4%, and this is the first year returns for the business have exceeded 20%. Operationally, net margins increased from 10.3% to 10.8%, and the operating cash flow was up 55%, and as Ron will go through in a minute or two, the balance sheet is in very good shape. So the key point from this slide is the result of strong and there has been continued solid improvement across all the key metrics. Moving now to Slide 6, today we\u2019ve also announced US$500 million on market share buyback. The company has strong financial metrics. Leverage measured as net debt to EBITDA is 2.2 times, and interest cover measured as net interest to EBITDA is above 7.5 times. The company continues to generate strong cash flow and following the buyback, the balance sheet will remain strong. Now, the sizing of the buyback at US$500 million, balance is returns to shareholders, maintains flexibility to pursue growth, and also our strong credit metrics. Moving to Slide 7, few more highlights for the year. There continued to be solid organic profit growth of 3% to 3.5% across the business. In emerging markets, organic profit growth was 10%, and this was an excellent outcome reflecting strong growth in Latin America and continued solid growth in Asia. In developed markets, economic conditions continue to be subdued, and there was stable operating performance in these regions. Acquisitions delivered as expected and were a key contributor to growth. With 16 acquisitions over the past four years, it is pleasing that these acquisitions have delivered the 20% return we expected. In over the past six months, there have been new acquisitions and greenfield investments announced that will continue to drive growth. So all up, this resulted in a 10.4% increase in earnings per share on a constant currency basis and together with a 4.7% dividend yield, this means that value creation was an annualized 15.1%. Now, this result was consistent with our model for shareholder value creation, so we move now to Slide 8, and we map it against the different components. The dividend yield was 4.7%, and that is slightly higher than the expected long-term average of 4%. The organic growth was 3.4% and this is marginally below the long-term expected growth rate of 3.5% to 4%, as developed markets remained broadly stable. Acquisitions contributed 3.3%, which is consistent with expectations. So as I mentioned all up, this resulted in a 15.1% value creation and the bridge for the specific components is in the appendix slides. So with that as my introduction, I\u2019ll hand it over to Ron to talk you through the cash flow and the balance sheet for the period. Ron Delia : Thanks, Ken. We\u2019ll look at Slide 9 to talk to the cash flow, and the key message here is that cash flow was very strong, and we remain on track to produce between $200 million to $300 million of free cash flow again this year, which is in line with expectations. More specifically on the Slide here, the operating cash flow of US$103 million for the half was up 55% on the prior year. And when we look at some of the key components in that result, gross capital expenditure for the half was $156 million. When we add total restructuring expenses of about $20 million, the overall spend on CapEx and restructuring was $176 million. Now that compares with our depreciation and amortization charge of $183 million, so essentially in line with what we would consider to be the normal amount of reinvestment back into the business. In net working capital, cash outflow was as expected given the seasonality of the business. We\u2019ve talked about that in prior half-year results. And the working capital performance through the half, which we measured primarily through the average working capital to sales ratio was particularly strong, and that metric improved from 9.5% last year to 9.2% of sales this year. The other line on the cash flow statement here on Page 9 is a combination of items, largest components relate to non-cash PBITDA, which we need to back out and then proceeds from the sale of PP&E. Property sales were higher than last year, and that\u2019s the key variance of the - key driver of the variance on this line item. But again the key point around the cash flow from this slide is that the cash performance was very strong and we continue to expect $200 million to $300 million of free cash flow for the full year. Moving on to Slide 10, we have a snapshot of the balance sheet and the debt profile. Again, as Ken mentioned earlier, in addition to the cash flow strength, the balance sheet of the business is in very good shape. Net debt has remained around US$3 billion and the two main ratios we look at, which are both cash flow oriented in nature, leverage and interest cover have both improved versus the prior period. So that left us with the well positioned and with the capacity to raise our dividend, as well as turn out to $500 million share buyback that ken spoke about earlier. And we will retain a solid balance sheet, and more importantly, we will retain ample capacity to pursue growth and organically or through acquisitions. Now in terms of financing costs, interest costs, our guidance remains the same, it\u2019s a US$180 million to US$190 million for the year. And that takes into account the buyback as well as current exchange rates, so no change to the interest guidance. In terms of the debt profile we are in a really comfortable position. We have a low level of refinancing this year. We have excellent debt maturity, and a good mix of fixed and floating debt, and we\u2019re comfortable with the currency mix as well. So in summary from me the key messages this morning are that the business is very well positioned financially, cash flow was strong for the half, and the balance sheet is in a very good place gives us the flexibility to continue to grow, continue to raise the dividend and in this particular result announce a share buyback. So with that, Ken, I\u2019ll hand it back over to you. Ken MacKenzie : Yes. Thanks, Ron. Moving now to Slide 11, the Flexibles segment had another strong half with PBIT up 4% in constant currency terms and excluding one-off gains. The key drivers of this increase were growth in emerging markets, innovation driven products mix improvements, better operating efficiencies and contributions from acquisitions. The sales margins continued to increase expanding from 11.7% to 11.9%, again excluding off one-off gains. The Flexibles Europe and Americas business had relatively stable volumes and developed markets and continue to bring new innovative products to market. And for those who are interested there are three or four examples in the press release. The Asia Pacific business had a good half-year with higher earnings. Growth across Asia remains strong, despite some customer destocking in China over recent weeks. And acquisitions are delivering strong benefits in line with expectations. The tobacco packaging business performed well with growth in emerging markets, the ongoing trend towards premiumisation and benefits from acquisitions in the Americas and Asian regions. So the outlook for the Flexibles business remains unchanged and it\u2019s for higher earnings. The drivers of this will predominately be growth in emerging markets, benefits from acquisitions and ongoing margin expansion through innovation and operational improvements. Moving now to Slide 13, Rigid Plastics; now the Rigid Plastics business had a strong half with earnings 8.4% higher than the prior period and returns improving to 17.4%. Volumes for the North American business were 2.5% higher than last year. And if we break that down into the sub-segments, custom hot fill volumes increased 5.6%, and carbonated soft drink and water volumes were just modestly higher with the ongoing mix shift from blown containers to preforms. Overall earnings of the North American Beverage business were higher. The Diversified Products business had a strong half with higher earnings and returns. This business is benefitting from improving mix and a great focus on innovation. In Latin America, the business performed very well with volume growth of 7.5% and volumes were higher in all businesses except Argentina, with the business in Brazil performing particularly well. So the outlook for the Rigid Plastics business remains unchanged from the full-year results. Earnings are expected to be higher, benefitting from continued growth across all business units, and the magnitude dependent on general economic conditions in Latin America and weather conditions for the balance of the year in North America. Moving now to Slide 15, so in summary this has been another strong half. From a financial perspective we achieved a solid result with strong cash flow. Returns for calendar year 2014 were above 20%. We\u2019ve announced a strong increase in the dividend and additional return to shareholders through a US$500 million share buyback. There was continued good growth in emerging markets and developed markets remained stable. Margins continued to expand as we focus on innovation, improved product mix and reduce costs. And the acquisition pipeline remains robust. So all up we look forward to another year of higher earnings in 2015. So with that being our introductory comments we\u2019re happy to now take questions. A - Ken MacKenzie : Yes. Mark - sorry, Michael. Michael Ward : Hi again, Michael Ward from CBA. Emerging markets, you seem to have done pretty well, you seem to be enjoying better timing and your customers are enjoying in emerging markets. Can you maybe make some comments around where the difference is between your business and maybe in customers businesses? Ken MacKenzie : Yes. Thanks for the question, Michael. We have had a strong half in emerging markets, overall growth in emerging markets was 15%, and 5% of that was contributed from acquisitions and 10% was organic growth, so a pretty strong result, but to be quite frank in line with sort of the trend that we\u2019ve had over last five years in emerging markets, so very much, very much in line. We had emerging market organic growth across all the business groups and in all the regions. I think the standouts - if we were to go through the results, the standouts would be in the Flexibles segment; Indonesia, India, Philippines, Singapore, so sort of the Southeast - Southeast Asia band would be a standout from a growth perspective and very pleased with the Latin American result. Volumes were up 7.5% across the region. Brazil was a standout, we were up 12%. PET continues to take, and I think this is - this will answer the question around the difference between us and perhaps our customers. Our customers would be reporting overall growth whereas we\u2019re package specific. And so, PET continues to gain market share vis-\u00e0-vis other packaging formats like glass and cans in Latin America, and we\u2019ve also gained market share, so those two would contribute to perhaps our performance versus what you saw in the broader market. But overall very pleased with the results, and I think on top of that, it\u2019s not just the top line, we\u2019ve had very good margin expansion and very good cost control through the region in the half as well. Michael Ward : Can you also maybe comment around resin? It seems like you\u2019ve got a little bit of benefit in the first-half, but can you maybe comment more around the outlook for the second half given what we\u2019ve seen with oil pricing? Ken MacKenzie : Yes. There really was no benefit. As a matter of fact, I think it was a slight headwind in the first half from raw material costs, but there is no - you\u2019re right, there is no doubt that raw material costs are coming down, I mean the price of oil has literally halved in the last six months. So talking about the specifics, raw materials in the first-half - our index, which is looking at our basket of raw materials that we\u2019re using across our business, our index in the first half dropped 8% and most of that would have been in the last couple of months, and it dropped a further 8% in the month of January alone, so 16% in the last quarter let\u2019s say drop in the index for our raw materials. Now nothing has changed in our model, about two-thirds of our businesses is contracted pass-throughs and one-third of the business is non-contracts, so we move prices as and when the raw materials move. For those businesses where it\u2019s two-thirds contracted, there is a lag impact. So when raw material prices are going up, there is a lag impact in us pushing the raw material costs through the customers, it takes three to six months, and on the way down, there is a similar lag and that the benefits aren\u2019t passed on to the customer for three to six months. So all up, we do expect some benefit in H2 and from the drop in raw material prices, but the magnitude at this point - it\u2019s not possible for us to quantify. Michael Ward : Sorry. Well, but as a reminder, can you just give us a rough sense of what raw materials is as a percentage of your overall costs? Ken MacKenzie : About 50% to 60%. Michael Ward : Yeah, thanks. Richard Johnson : Richard Johnson from Citi. Ken, just going back to emerging markets, just two questions if I may, if I press the numbers on my calculator correctly, which I may not have done, it looks like Eastern Europe wasn\u2019t too much of a drag on growth, but perhaps you could talk a little bit about Eastern Europe and what the outlook is for that business. And thinking think about Rigid South America, if you think about the volume number than the overall sales growth, how much of that of the price accretion is resin, if anything, or how much is real price increases? Thank you. Ken MacKenzie : Right. You\u2019re right, Eastern Europe wasn\u2019t a drag. We typically talk about Eastern Europe being in the sort of 4%, 5% growth across the product range. Flexibles would have delivered - the Flexibles product segment would have delivered numbers in that order. In the case of Tobacco Packaging, there were tax increases in Russia and we actually had close to double-digit declines in volumes in Russian Tobacco Packaging. Now offsetting that was the introduction of a number of new innovative products, now we\u2019re very much participating at the high-end of the product range in Russia, and we were able to bring a number of very exciting proprietary technologies to the market. And so, margin expansion offset volume weakness and we actually had improved profitability year-on-year in Russia. So Eastern Europe was a very good outcome there, largely driven by mix improvements, and we did have some soft volumes in some places. In the case of Latin America, sorry, Richard, the question was.. Richard Johnson : Just around the sort of price volume calculation, what do you think of the revenue growth that you have shown? Ron Delia : Yes, Richard, we always caution a little bit around looking at the sales line in this business, right, because of the raw material fluctuations through that. There is an added caveat when it comes to Latin America because of the high inflationary environments we operate in, particularly in Venezuela and Argentina, you\u2019ll see very pronounced increases in revenue to compensate for production costs, which are further down the income statement. So that\u2019s the predominant driver of the top line movement there. It\u2019s very hard to disaggregate. I think the key message is that the volume growth in the region was 7.5%. Richard Johnson : Thanks. Unidentified Analyst : So Ken, just the comment about China and the destocking that you have seen, I\u2019m just wondering how widespread that has been and how long you expect that to continue for? Ken MacKenzie : Right, great question. So China volumes H1 for Amcor were up 6.5%, but if you strip out the acquisitions, volume organically would have been up 2.5%. Now that would compare to we are normally talking about double-digit, low double-digit volume growth in China, so clearly below trend. In the second quarter of the financial year, we did see destocking happening in the market, so there was a destocking event. So the first quarter was trading broadly in line and then in the second quarter, we saw this destocking event. Given that we\u2019re now heading into Chinese New Year, we probably won\u2019t get visibility on what underlying growth is until we get to about April. But our experience whether we would be in a global financial crisis or when we\u2019ve had other economic events is that in our business it\u2019s very defensive. There is a destocking event while the supply chain realigns itself and then we see a returning to underlying growth. So we\u2019ll be in a position to update that come - the August result, but they won\u2019t be until April until we see we have some visibility around all of that. Unidentified Analyst : And, Ken, was that fairly widespread throughout China or was it\u2026 Ken MacKenzie : Yes. Unidentified Analyst : \u2026designated to particular products? Ken MacKenzie : No standouts. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. Michael Courtney : Hi, Ken, Michael Courtney from Merrill Lynch. Congrats on the result. Ken MacKenzie : Thank you. Michael Courtney : My question is just around acquisition, so it\u2019s been a while since there was an acquisition of significant size, but the previous acquisitions as you say in the report still contributing 3.3% to the growth. Just wondering if you were to assume there\u2019s no more acquisitions for the remainder of this year, if we then look at FY 2016, 2017, how quickly does that 3.3% taper-off from those previous acquisitions, because some of them would be a fair way through their synergy benefits now I would imagine? Ken MacKenzie : Right. First and foremost nobody here is giving up an acquisition pipeline, it\u2019s robust. So it\u2019s very much a hypothetical question. When we look at the acquisition pipeline today, in the last five years you\u2019ve heard me talk in a range between $1 billion and $3 billion, and we\u2019re very much in the middle of that that range today. So where is busy now as we\u2019ve been over the last five years working on acquisitions and we have announced a couple, by nature, it\u2019s going to be lumpy, and I think that\u2019s your question. It is going to be lumpy, that\u2019s how we say, we do the deals that we can do, and we pass on the deals that don\u2019t make sense. But that being said we\u2019re well resourced. We\u2019ve got a very capable M&A team. We\u2019ve got a very full pipeline. We\u2019re working on 40 projects, as we speak, and we\u2019re right in the middle of that acquisition pipeline range. And as Ron talked about the balance sheet, the balance sheet has $800 million plus of capacity. So we\u2019re in a good position, as it relates to our acquisition agenda, and we feel really good about our acquisition agenda. When we look at acquisitions, it tends to be about three years to get to the 20% return. So it depends what the acquisition EBITDA return on investment is, but typically, we\u2019re at the value end of the market, and we\u2019re buying developed market assets at five or six times EBITDA, and we\u2019re buying emerging market assets at sort of seven or eight times EBITDA. So the return on investment broadly is going to be around 10% year one, and then its synergy benefits that we\u2019re bringing to the acquisition that ramp up over the two-year or three-year period that bring us to the 20% return on investment that we target, and that\u2019s sort of our history, sometimes a little bit faster, sometimes a little bit slower, but broadly it takes us three years to get there. So you could look at the acquisitions that we\u2019ve done and build a bit of a pipeline and look at where we\u2019re at in terms of projecting forward if there are no acquisitions. We don\u2019t do that work, because we\u2019re actually projecting for that we\u2019re going to continue to make the sort of acquisitions that we have been doing. Michael Courtney : Just on the numbers that you\u2019ve given the $1.3 billion to $3 billion for the opportunities, you do some simple division and it sort of implies that there\u2019s nothing of significant size in the pipeline, because $3 billion of Autobuf [ph] already, it\u2019s pretty small ticket price going forward, should we be thinking about it as the smallest sort of bolt-ons but just with the high level of frequency? Ken MacKenzie : Yes, this is a bit how we look at things internally, and it\u2019s always - we always have to be careful about how we characterize the acquisition pipeline. The growth execution pipeline in the $1 billion to $3 billion that we talk about is, we\u2019ve really taken a look at all of the market segments that we\u2019re interested in across our portfolio on one access and on the other access is all the geographies that we want to participate in. And so we\u2019ve done a very detailed analysis in the marketplace. So, for example, medical packaging in China, what\u2019s the opportunity there? And so we\u2019ve done this big 2x2 mapping exercise, we did about five years ago, we identified all the opportunities that we\u2019re interested in. And they go into sort of think of it as a hopper. And out of that hopper, we then prioritized the opportunities based on, is it available? Is it likely to become available? What\u2019s the return? Where does it sit from a strategic perspective? And so there is a big prioritization exercise that goes in and then we work on the projects that we have in priority based on the resources that we have in the business to work against them. And that\u2019s when - so it\u2019s a big hopper of more than 40 opportunities, but any one time, we tend to be working on between 20 and 40 opportunities across the business, because that\u2019s where resource stop to do. Now outside of that, for example, I mean, it\u2019s well known, we missed out on the Constantia deal, but the Constantia deal wasn\u2019t in the pipeline. Other big deals aren\u2019t in the pipeline, they are in the hopper, but they are in the pipeline, because quite frankly some of these assets we know aren\u2019t available. So you\u2019ve got to be and but then circumstances change and then they do become available. So it\u2019s a - it\u2019s very dynamic. It\u2019s - I think you need to take a look at the pipeline as, when I talk about the $1 billion to $3 billion, you need to take that as a guide. The reality is, we\u2019re very busy, and there is no shortage of opportunity. I think the great thing about certainly the flexible packaging space is although we\u2019re a market leader, although we have a large-scale position, although we\u2019re very differentiated, there is still, it\u2019s still quite fragmented and particularly in emerging markets. And so there is a deep opportunity space for acquisitions in the flexible packaging space. Michael Courtney : Thanks for that. Can I just ask one more quick question just on market trends, just in Europe, that begs some questions all over some weightness in volumes out of Europe and it seems as though your competitors and some of your customers had sort of characterized the calendar years as a strong first quarter and a strong last quarter, but quarters two and three had been fairly weak. Three half, had you seen any noticeable change in the market conditions in Europe? Ron Delia : Quite frankly no. And that\u2019s likely because we\u2019re very defensive in Europe. If you look at the product segments in which we participate, it\u2019s tobacco, healthcare, and food, so there are three very defensive segments. We\u2019re a bit of a broken record here about Europe for the last five years, we\u2019ve had very stable conditions, and that\u2019s just the nature of our business. Thank you. Scott? Ramoun Lazar : Good morning. It\u2019s Ramoun Lazar from UBS. So just a couple of questions, just, Ken, maybe could you touch on the market trends that you\u2019re seeing in North American regions, some good growth in that hot-fill custom segment. Was that a bit of a recovery after last year\u2019s sort of seasonal weakens or are you now starting to see some underlying growth coming back to the market? Ken MacKenzie : It\u2019s a great question, Ramoun. I think a bit of both, where we are cycling a little bit of a weak comp on the custom beverage side, but we\u2019re cautiously optimistic about the economic conditions in the U.S. I think with certainly in the second-half with a good momentum in the first-half and when we look into the second-half, there is a reason for optimism with the oil price having the cost to fill up your car in the U.S. is less and a lot of our volume goes through convenience stores, people have more change in their pocket. I think we\u2019re optimistic about continuing the momentum from the first-half into the second-half in the Rigid Plastics base. But it would be combination of a slightly weaker comp last year, but also more favorable conditions. Ramoun Lazar : Okay, great. And just one for Ron, just on the operating cash flow, Ron, can you just talk about seasonality in that business and what we should expect from operating cash flow in the second-half given conversion was a little bit weaker in the first-half? Ron Delia : Yes, Ramoun, operating cash flow is a metric we focus on at the half and in general, the cash flow is quite seasonal, the business is seasonal. So it\u2019s 45%, 55% split, more or less in terms of sales and earnings. Cash flow is even more weighted towards the second-half and cash flow is even more seasonally skewed towards the second-half. So that\u2019s the pattern. If we go back and look over the last ex-number of years since Alcan and ball, and the portfolio is shaped away as it is today, you see this outflow in the first-half. So we would say that it\u2019s sort of right on track and the guidance and the thing that we really look at for the full year is the free cash flow, which is after dividends as well. And we continue to expect to have free cash flow between $200 million to $300 million this year. So we don\u2019t get too hung-up in the seasonality, we know what it is. It\u2019s very - the pattern recognition is there, and this result would be right on sort of trend. Scott Hudson : Hi, Ken. It\u2019s Scott Hudson at CLSA. Just with regards to, I guess, emerging market acquisitions, are you seeing your customers move into any other regions, or are they moving into regions that they wanting you to follow into? Ken MacKenzie : Yes, great question. I mean, our customers lead our participation. So if you look, for example, in emerging markets, our major customers would have, at least, 50% of their portfolio in emerging markets, and we\u2019re sitting at 30%. And that\u2019s because they\u2019ve got to go and build the business, they get their business to a certain scale and then they want a packaging supplier that\u2019s capable of taking them forward with innovation and local supply and all the benefits that we can provide. So we\u2019re playing a bit of a catch-up game versus our customers particularly in Asia. And then to your question looking forward, clearly, there is a lot of investment and we\u2019re going into Africa. Right now, it\u2019s not at a point or a scale, where in certain parts of Africa, it would be of a scale that would be of interest to us. But in other areas they still have some work to do to get further in front of us before we\u2019re able to make investments there. But that\u2019s clearly one of the regions which is a white space for Amcor that that\u2019s on the horizon. Scott Hudson : Got it. And then maybe this question for Ron, given where bond deals are et cetera., and I guess returns where you - the bond yields globally a pretty low, how does that affect your thinking with regards to the 20% hurdle rate? Ron Delia : It doesn\u2019t change your way you are thinking at all. I mean, biennials ebb and flow, and asset prices ebb and flow, our long-term view on the attractiveness of investments comes back to that 20% pre-tax return. And we\u2019re not changing that because of where we are in the credit cycle, that\u2019s what we\u2019re steadfast when we look at capital projects and we look at acquisitions through the same lengths of the 20% pre-tax by year three is the right measure for us. Scott Hudson : Okay. And lastly, maybe just one for Ken, six months ago how did you scorecard your Amcor\u2019s innovation, I guess, capabilities as you\u2019re departing the company? Ken MacKenzie : Great question. Industry leading, but lots of room for improvement. So on the packaging scale we\u2019re an 8 out of 10, on the broader innovation scale, we\u2019re 5 out of 10. So the new guys got a lot of work to do. Scott Hudson : What\u2019s the difference between packaging and broader scale, how do you - what do you sort of pinpointing on that? Ken MacKenzie : Yes. I think that Amcor has developed really good capability and process around customer back innovation. So we\u2019re very good at working with our key customers, understanding what their plans and what their needs are, and then collaboratively working with them to bring new products to market, that\u2019s sort of our bread and butter, I think we\u2019re very good at that. In terms of understanding consumer needs and translating that into new breakthrough technologies, similar to what we\u2019ve done with LiquiForm, I think we still have more work to do there. Scott Hudson : Thanks. John Purtell : Good day, John Purtell from Macquarie, just a question on Latin America, I mean always a volatile set of countries over there, but it looks a very strong result. I mean in summary, it appears like a whole range of things winch away, which doesn\u2019t always happen, but whether a shift in the PET\u2019s substrate new investment. I mean, how do you view the sustainability of that result going forward? Ken MacKenzie : Yes, look, John, I think the result, if you looked at our trend over, let\u2019s say, last five or six years, Latin America would have been in that 5% to 7% range, but it is volatile. We would have reported numbers here of 2% or 3%, and we would have reported numbers of 10% or 12%. So this is - it\u2019s a solid result at the top end of the range. I think what makes it very pleasing is that our value proposition is working with the customer base. We have gained market share at the right margins in the region. And so we have grown our market share and the PET continues to be the package of choice for the consumer. So I think all credit to the Rigid Plastics team who have done a just a great result both growing market share and also the operational performance across all of Latin America for the half was very good. John Purtell : Ken, sorry, can I just follow-on from last question on about Chinese destocking, what\u2019s the market intelligence? Is that the real underlying weakness and demand, or could you argue it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if you\u2019re getting destocking simply, because you\u2019ve got a raw material price coming very, very fast, decrease coming fast? Ken MacKenzie : Look, that\u2019s possible, Richard. Look, our experience in our business given that and China is no different. Given that we are consumer staples, there are destocking events when there is some weakening demand and the supply chain realigns, but then it picks up. I mean, if you look at the ultimate financial crisis, in the GFC, that\u2019s exactly what happened. If you look back at our numbers, we had a three or four-month period where there is always some supply chain destocking and then volumes came back to GDP and move forward. So, this is a stable defensive business made up of consumer staples. I would - at this point, it looks very much like a destocking event that you see when economic growth declines a little bit, but in this business, people still need to eat and drink. And so, we expect volumes will move back to underlying growth. Might take a question from phone line, I see Larry Gandler is on the line, Larry? Larry Gandler : Hi, Ken, thanks. Not to detract from a great result, just focusing on the Europe and Americas Flexibles revenue growth, it looks to be about 1.5% expressed in euros, given the weakness in the euro I would have thought that growth might have been a bit stronger. Just wondering if there is any particular segment that may have detracted from that revenue performance? Ken MacKenzie : Yes, thanks, Larry. Look, I would characterize - the Europe result has been on trend. You\u2019ve got to be very careful and Ron talked about it earlier, you\u2019ve got to be very careful about analyzing the top line dollars in this business mainly, because it\u2019s very sensitive to raw material movements. We\u2019ve talked about it earlier 50% to 60% of our cost of goods sold is in the raw material. So if they move, we can be moving the exact same volumes, if the raw materials move up, the dollars move up and if they move down, the dollars move down on the top line. So I think you need to be very careful about how you look at the top line in our business. That being said, we would characterize that business as having stable performance in H1, and the team is doing an outstanding job continuing to bring new innovations to market and to keep the costs well and truly under control. There is a big simplification and standardization agenda that continues to bear fruit in that business and you can see it in the continued margin expansion that we\u2019re having across the flexible packaging segment. Larry Gandler : Okay. Great. So I would have thought raw materials would have added to revenue in that last half, but it sounds like you\u2019re suggesting there might have been a detraction. Ken MacKenzie : No, I\u2019m just cautioning you not to look at the top line too much. Larry Gandler : Okay. Great. Ken MacKenzie : There are no questions on the phone lines. Are there any questions from the room? Ken MacKenzie : Great. Well, thank you everybody. Ron Delia : Thank you.",

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Erin Winters. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Erin Winters : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2015 conference call. Today is October 22, 2015. After today\u2019s call, a replay will be available on our website, bemis.com, under the Investor Relations section. Joining me for this call today are Bemis Company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Austen, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Clauer and our Vice President and Controller, Jerry Krempa. Following Bill and Mike\u2019s comments on our business and outlook we will answer any questions you have. However, in order to allow everyone an opportunity to participate, we do ask that you limit yourself to one question at a time with a related follow-up and then fall back into the queue for any additional questions. On today\u2019s call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures as we talk about our performance. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures that we consider most comparable can be found in the press release and supplemental schedules on our website. And finally, a reminder that statements regarding future performance of the company made during this call are forward-looking and are therefore subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from historical, expected or projected results due to a variety of factors. Please refer to Bemis Company\u2019s regular SEC filings, including the most recently filed Form 10-K to review these risk factors. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill Austen. Bill Austen : Thank you, Erin, and good morning, everyone. Bemis performed well this quarter in a slow growth and volatile currency environment. Our operations are strong and we are executing our strategy with focus, alignment, accountability and rigor. We delivered adjusted earnings of $0.67 per share, a 9.8% increase over the prior year; this in light of a $0.06 translation headwind as currencies in Latin America devalued significantly compared to one year ago. We delivered highest gross margin in many years at 21.8% driven by our recapitalization efforts focused that improving productivity and efficiency, our innovation pipeline that continues to improve the mix of the products we sell and our strong operational performance across the entire company. We increased operating profit margins in our U.S. packaging segment to 14.5%, a 120 basis point increase over the prior third quarter, reflecting great progress toward our long-term goal of 15% to 18% in this segment. We increased adjusted operating profit margins in our global packaging segment to 9.7%, a 110 basis point increase over the prior third quarter, exceeding my expectations and above pace toward our goal of double-digit returns in this segment over the three to five-year horizon. We again increased ROIC to 10.3% versus 9.6% one year ago. We generated $194 million of operating cash flow, another quarter of vast improvement, and through the third quarter, we have already exceeded our original full year cash flow target stated in January, an excellent demonstration of the focus, discipline, accountability and urgency, we have instilled and continue to drive throughout our entire business. And finally, we continue to execute our capital expansions and improvements to plan. Again this quarter, we are selling at most items that we\u2019ve targeted. Currency and unit volumes continue to be a challenge in the short-term, but I am pleased with the following actions we have taken to deliver growth in the long-term that will help provide continued margin expansion. First this month, we officially open the Bemis innovation center in Neenah, Wisconsin. This facility is already becoming a global hub for our customers, a place where we work side by side with them to ideate, innovate and collaborate packaging solutions to provide success and growth to their brands. The innovation center supports long-term growth and we have already had some early wins that have created success for our customers and ourselves. For example, while the facility was still under construction, we hosted a customer at our Innovation Center in February to help solve their packaging needs for a new product. Leveraging our base of innovation, we were able to ideate, develop a prototype and test a self-venting retort standup pouch for their pasta meal in a very short time frame. From ideation to store shelf it took only six months. I am confident that in conjunction with our strong innovation pipeline, our disciplined stage-gate process and our drive and ambition to grow, the innovation center will support success in the years to come. Second, we are executing on our capital plan. Our healthcare expansion project in Wisconsin that will elevate our industry-leading quality and support growth is on track and progressing well. The facility and equipment installations were completed on schedule and in October we successfully achieved CODR [ph] validation and product functional equivalency, which allows us to ship commercial product from the new facility, a great job by our healthcare team. We continue to expect to see margin improvement from this project in 2016. We have a variety of growth and productivity projects that are coming online in the near term and will support both revenue and continued margin improvement in 2016 and the future. We continue to execute our capital projects that will support the growing demand for our high-end packaging used for protein, liquid, and medical applications. We also continue to execute on select capital investments to improve the margin profile in specific end markets where technology and differentiation are not as important to our customers. We are recapitalizing select printing presses, slitters and other converting equipment for our strategic plan with diligence and speed. Third, as I mentioned last quarter, while in its early stages, we have made some changes in our sales and marketing organization in U.S. Packaging to increase urgency toward growth. Rick Michaletz, who many of you met at Investor Day has successfully completed his assignment as President of our European business and has taken on a new roll of Vice President of sales and business development for U.S. Packaging. Rick is an exceptional and proven leader with a strong commercial and operations background and I'm confident that Rick\u2019s leadership of our commercial teams in the U.S. will drive our growth plan as we move forward. I\u2019m pleased with the actions and progress we are making toward growing our business. Turning to the full year, we are bringing down the top end of our EPS range from $2.62 to $2.57 fully on account of currency translation. Mike will cover the details in a bit, but while currency has been a challenge to profits this year, particularly in Latin America, I am very pleased with how our business is performing in local currency. My long term view has not changed. We continue to target EPS growth at 10% plus per year, balanced organic and inorganic revenue growth, operating profit margins at 15% to 18% in U.S. Packaging and 10 plus in Global in the three to five-year window, ROIC in the top quartile of our peer group by 2019, cash from organic operations that exceeds $550 million by 2019. I remain very confident that we will continue to deliver performance improvement towards these long term goals. In summary, we performed well in the quarter. I\u2019m proud of our teams across the globe who are executing our strategy with a renewed sense of urgency and improving all that they do on a daily basis. It is an important time in Bemis history as we continue to transition toward high performance that is reflected in all of our financial metrics. We still have a lot of work to do, but our strategy is right, our resources are aligned and we have the drive and talent to execute our plans. With that I\u2019ll turn things over to Mike for a review of the financials and his comments on the future. Mike Clauer : Thanks Bill and good morning. As Bill mentioned, we reported adjusted earnings of $0.67 per share, a 9.8% increase compare to the prior third quarter. This includes overcoming a currency translation headwind of approximately $0.06 versus the prior year third quarter, primarily driven by currencies in Latin America with continued value against the dollar. We delivered solid improvement in gross margins at 21.8% versus 20.1% the prior third quarter. This improvement was driven by continued effort in executing our strategy, specifically the favorable impact of productivity and efficiency projects we have executed as part of our capital plan and improved price mix, as we execute our strategy to sell a higher portion of value added sophisticated packages. I will provide comments on each reportable segment, followed by a discussion of total company expenses and performance. First U.S. Packaging; in the third quarter sales dollars in our U.S. segment declined 3.7%. Overall unit volumes were down approximately 3% compared to the prior third quarter. Approximately two-thirds of this unit volume decline was driven by our strategic pricing decision to exit some low margin bottle water overwrap business in the prior periods, and the remainder was driven by a select customer, who lost share with their beverage pouch at the retail level. Aside from volumes, the remaining decline in sales dollars was driven by contractual price reductions to pass through lower raw material cost, which do not have pack operating profits, partially offset by favorable mix in-line with our strategy. Some additional end market details for the quarter, unit volumes in our meat and cheese, dairy and liquid end markets were down slightly. Our analysis indicates there are no drivers out of the ordinary and we continue to be optimistic about volumes in the long term. Mix within these end markets were strong as we continue to gain traction with new product innovation. Everything from our flat film for meat were portion packaging for protein snacks to high end laminations used in liquid applications. With regard to our book growth plans in the U.S. over our strategic horizon, we have completed our normal periodic review of our business plan and continue to expect volumes to return positive in 2016 and future years. We have a good line of side of upcoming product launches for high technology products, our innovation pipeline is strong and we see benefits from our recapitalization of converting equipment that will support retaining current volumes in our less differentiated business. We remain confident and determined in our long-term plan to grow our business. U.S. packaging operating profit return on sales for the third quarter was 14.5% compared to 13.3% in the prior year. Third quarter returns benefited from operational efficiencies, favorable sales mix and continue diligence in controlling costs. Moving to our global packaging segment. In the third quarter global packaging sales decreased 14%. Currency decreased sales by 22.1% as currencies in Latin America and the lesser extent Europe could be valued against the U.S. dollar. Excluding currencies, global packaging delivered total organic growth of 8.1%, which included a 2% increase in unit volumes in addition to a favorable price mix. Before commenting on the various regions of our global business, I will cover returns in our global packaging segment, another very profitable quarter. Adjusted global operating profit return on sales for the third quarter of 9.7% compares with 8.6% for the prior third quarter. High returns in global packaging were a result of strong operational performance throughout all regions and improved price mix from sales of meat, cheese, dairy and liquid packaging. Currency negatively impacted operating profits by $8.8 million this quarter or about $0.06 related primarily to the translation of profits in Brazil to the U.S. dollars, compared to the prior third quarter. Through three quarters, currency translation has trimmed 17.5% from our profits versus the prior year or approximately $0.12 of total company earnings per share. Well currency has certainly been a challenge, we are very pleased with the performance of our global businesses in local currency. We are improving returns, growing sales in our targeted end markets and demonstrating urgency and discipline in all areas. Some regional details. In Latin America, while the environment is tough for some industries, our business continues to do well. Our teams are doing an excellent job of passing through inflationary cost. While overall unit volumes were flat to slightly down during the quarter, we are executing on our strategy some more value-added products, particularly to our meat and cheese and dairy and liquid end markets where volumes were very strong this quarter. In Europe, where our business is focused on meat and cheese packaging, unit volumes were up mid-single-digits, again in line with our strategy to grow these value-added products. In Asia-Pacific, unit volumes were also up mid-single-digits. This growth was in a variety of areas including meat, which we strategically target in Asia. We continue to see our customers expanding their use of meat packaging and the reach to applications that were formally sold in open air markets and had never before than packaged. Our global healthcare business is performing well. Overall unit volumes were flat during the quarter with particular strength in the U.S. and Europe offset by softer consumption in Latin America and timing of orders in Asia. Our healthcare business is strong and continues to be an integral part of our growth strategy. Now on to Bemis consolidated results. Total Bemis Company SG&A expense was $101.8 million, down from the prior year. We continue to be focused on implementing discipline and accountability to keep SG&A dollars flat over a long-term strategic horizon. Research and development expense for the quarter was $11 million, approximately flat with the prior year. We expect to continue at this level to support new product innovation and commercialization. The income tax rate for the third quarter was 33.6%, in line with our expectations for the full year \u201915. Year-to-date cash from operations has increased to $412 million, compared to $192 million the prior year. We have exceeded our original plan of $400 million plus for the entire year within the first three quarters. As you may recall, we established a target early this year to reduce working capital percent of sales to 14% range by the end of 2016, which equates to taking out approximately $140 million of working capital. While our original 2015 cash flow guidance assumed that working capital will not be a source during the year, we began executing to improve payment terms with our vendors to industry standard levels during the third quarter and started realizing significant benefits. We also recognized that cash flow benefited by $20 million to $25 million from the mathematical flow through of lower raw material cost. We are updating our full year 2015 guidance for cash from operations to $500 million plus. We will continue with focus, discipline and urgency to deliver continued success and generating cash. Capital expenditures were approximately $148 million through the first threes quarter this year as compared to $113 million last year and in line with our expectations. We continue to expect 2015 capital expenditures between $200 million and $215 million to support growth and productivity projects in our pipeline. Touching on our leverage metrics, net debt to adjusted EBITDA at the end of third quarter was 2.1 times within our expected range. We will continue to generate strong cash flow, invest capital wisely and not accumulate cash. Our priorities continue to be to support our dividend program and invest in capital projects and fund strategic acquisitions or share repurchases. During the third quarter, we repurchased 0.5 million shares for a total of $20.9 million. At September 30, the remaining Board authorization for share repurchase was 4.4 million shares. Turning to the full year outlook, as Bill mentioned, we are narrowing our adjusted EPS for 2015 to the range of $2.52 to $2.57, fully on account of currency translation. While currency and volume have challenges, this year we are still maintaining the low-end of our guidance. Since our earnings call in July, currencies, particularly the Brazil real have moved unfavorably, creating an additional headwind of approximately $0.05 in the back half for the year versus our guidance shared at the end of the second quarter. In relation to the EPS range of $2.52 to $2.57, where we are in the range will depend on further movement of currencies and volumes in our business. Fourth quarter is seasonally light quarter for us. Without a meaningful improvement in unit volumes I anticipate that we would be toward the lower end of the EPS range. We will continue to focus on the things we can control to deliver earnings. In summary, I remain confident in our business in our ability to further improve financial performance to create long term shareholder value. With that we will turn the call over for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We ask that you ask one question and one follow-up question, we will release you after your follow-up at which point you can re-queue to get back into the question queue. Our first question comes from Ghansham Panjabi from Robert W. Baird & Company. Please go ahead. Mehul Dalia : It's actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. Can you quantify the benefit from lower raw material cost during 3Q on EBIT margin? Mike Clauer : On EBIT margins it was very minimal. As you guys all know, we\u2019ve done a really good job of taken the volatility out of passing through changing input cost. Mehul Dalia : Great and thanks for the commentary about the improvements you are making in the U.S. Do you know that when should we expect to see some sort of inflection in North America volume? Mike Clauer : As I said in my remarks, we are still -- our view hasn\u2019t changed. We viewed 10% EPS growth in 2016 and we see that volumes will increase in North America to the 2% range where we've targeted in our Investor Day 2016. That's why we made some of the changes in our commercial team. Operator : And our next question comes from George Staphos from Bank of America. Please go ahead. George Staphos : I want to hear you back a little bit on that last comment Bill in the question. So you did this review. It sounded like of your markets and products, could you provide a little bit more clarity in terms of what that review told you about the long term volume outlook and why you should be confident and if you're confident, whether you need to change management. And then second question I had, can you parse for us what the mix benefit was? Obviously price mix was down, because the resin passed through but what was mix up in the quarter, if you can share that? Thank you. Bill Austen : George this is Bill. I will take the volume side of that. Yes, we gone through, a good review of our innovation pipeline in the productivity projects that we have slated based on our capital spending and we feel very comfortable with what we\u2019ve targeted for 2016, the 2% growth in North America. We filtered with that based on the innovation and the productivity improvements that we have slated. George Staphos : And touching on your margin, when I think about the margin improvement for the company about half of it came from productivity and efficiency and that would have been heavier in U.S. Packaging, and about half of it was innovation mix which would have been heavier in Global Packaging? Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Scott Gaffner from Barclays. Please go ahead. Scott Gaffner : Thanks. My question is really around Mike just mentioned the margin improvement and at least in the quarter of 50% productivity, 50% innovation. If I look at sort of our model here, you have got about 120 basis points of margin improvement 2015. What would keep you from getting another 120 basis points of margin improvement in 2016, or maybe it's achievable? Mike Clauer : At this point, it's a steady build. I think we\u2019re doing a little bit better in \u201815 than we would have anticipated in our five-year plan. But again I\u2019m not going to -- I don't think I\u2019m going to -- we\u2019re going to sign up for 120% improvement right now. But we do still feel confident we\u2019re going to be improving as we move towards our long term goal. So 15 to 18 in U.S. Packaging and plus 10% in Global. Scott Gaffner : Sure, but even just conceptually, as we move into 2016, has that productivity come down and innovation, it sounds like Bill you are saying innovation goes up. How should we think about the mix there? Bill Austen : Scott, this is Bill. We looked the next this year. It\u2019s a 50-50 split between innovation and productivity and efficiency, because we\u2019ve got the lower hanging fruit on the productivity side. You see that earlier. We\u2019ll continue to get that productivity from projects we\u2019ve installed this year, because they'll lap themselves somewhere in 2016. But we have good site to more productivity projects that as you recall from last quarter we pull capital forward to drive sooner productivity gains into 2016. So we\u2019ll continue on that pace and then the innovation will start to kick in even greater than it has now. So it's still going to be that 50-50, 60-40 kind of a split in that range between innovation and productivity. So we\u2019re comfortable and we have good line of sight. Operator : And our next question comes from Chip Dillon from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Chip Dillon : Yes, thank you very much. Just a couple of financial questions to near-term Mike. One is, when you look at the impressive cash flow, thanks for calling out the working capital benefit of the raw materials. Is there also a measurable working capital benefit because of the FX changes, I guess with the financing of receivables down in Brazil? And then secondly can you give us updated view of how you see CapEx in 2016 and 17 based on your current footprint and given that it\u2019s been elevated this year? Mike Clauer : First of all, I don\u2019t see any big change or any impact on cash flow as a result of FX. We kind of pull that out and look at it without it. And then as far as capital\u2019s concern, as we said on Investor Day and it still holds through, we\u2019re still going to be that $200 million to $215 million in '16 and maybe '17 and then after that we should start seeing a decline other than any potential acquisitions and how that might change our capital requirements on adding more revenue and assets to our business. Operator : And our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari from Citibank. Please go ahead. Anthony Pettinari : I just had a question on the global business since specifically Brazil. You indicated you\u2019re pretty happy with how those businesses are performing on a same currency basis. In Brazil, meat production is down pretty sharply year-over-year. I was just wondering if you could give a little color on how your business is performing in Brazil and maybe overcoming some of those headwinds? Bill Austen : Yes, thanks Anthony. This is Bill. As we said, we\u2019re very happy with the performance of our business in Brazil. And if you look at what we do, as we make packaging for products that people use every day, two years ago, we made some investments in some technology in Brazil to bring down some proprietary meat films, protein films for that market to start to change the market away from what locally produced films are all about, to bring down Bemis innovation in terms of ISO. We\u2019ve been gaining share with that technology from locally produced film. So whether meat film is now -- we were not big in that market prior. Now we\u2019re big in that market because we\u2019re gaining share from locally produce suppliers. So that\u2019s a good thing for us and we see that continuing as we -- at capacity utilization on that line continues to increase. Anthony Pettinari : And then just switching back to the U.S., the capitalization of kind of lower margin converting assets, when is that process completed? Bill Austen : Probably '17, and honestly it\u2019ll never be completed. What we\u2019re doing right now is probably catching up for underspending from 2010 through '13 as the Company was a lot more focused on integrating that large acquisition. So what you\u2019re seeing right now is a catch-up, but we will -- it\u2019s going to become part of -- it is become part of our DNA that we will always be capitalizing assets going into the future. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Philip Ng from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Philip Ng : Hey guys. With the share loss lapping next year in North America for some of your commodity business, comps obviously get a lot easier in 2016. To the 2% growth target you have for North America, how much of that is driven by new products and maybe some of the benefits from the recapitalization of assets? And are you assuming any recovery in packaged fruit demand for the bottom market overall? Thanks. Bill Austen : At this point, we are not anticipating any recovery. We\u2019re going to work off the assumptions that consumption in the U.S. is flat to slightly down. We have no reasons to think otherwise. So I think more of the growth is going to really be coming from the innovation side of our packaging. Hope that answers your question. Operator : And our next question comes from Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Chris Manuel : I wanted to kind of focus for a second on the global business if I could or the global packaging component. Again made great progress there, already kind of upper nine as far as margin percentage and close target. Is there anything that could happen that you'd foresee over the next few quarters that might kind of go backwards a little bit? Or seemingly you're pretty far down the path of exceeding some of those goals or how would you think about maybe raising the bar a bit further. How do you balance that Bill? Bill Austen : Look, Chris, I don't see anything that's going to change where we are over the next couple of quarters. And we\u2019ve always said 10 plus. So we\u2019re not going to back off on 10 and then stop. We\u2019re going to continue to drive for 10 plus, and our business teams know that. We're continuing to put innovation into all of the regions of the world. We\u2019ve got assets going into Europe right now that continue to drive their improvements, that have been significant for us over the last year or so. Same thing in Latin America. We're going to continue to invest there to continue to drive innovation and bring new packaging technologies to those regions to continue the change the mix and up-scale the mix that we\u2019ve always been focused on. And same thing in medical. That medical facility in Wisconsin is now up and running. Its validated and qualified. So we can ship commercial product from there and we're still focused on that 200 basis points improvement in the medical business next year that we\u2019ve stated right from the start. So we\u2019re going to continue to push that beyond 10. Chris Manuel : Okay. And then the second question kind of centers around capital allocation, and a particular -- some of the working capital and progress you are making what you might do with some of this, but on first element of this, Mike you had talked about $140 million of working capital opportunity from your reduction program. I don't think that was inclusive of the 25 you've got from raw material. So can we kind of think of that total bar as maybe 165? And then second part of this is what your intentions are to kind of the near term to do with it. It looks like share repurchase kind of slowed a bit. Are you seeing anything in the M&A markets that get you excited or how might you think about uses of cash over the balance of the year? Bill Austen : First of all, I answer your question, it's more important is it that when we made the statement about $140 million, it's really more about getting ourselves to that 14% primary working capital percentage in that sales. We kind of ended Q3 -- we were just south of 16%. So we\u2019ve made some pretty nice progress, and we\u2019ll continue to make progress as we drive to get to that level. So I think that answers your first question. As far as second question on the M&A side, we do have [indiscernible] right now. The positive side is there seems to be no road blocks at this point in time. It's now just a question of when we get approval on the process. So that would be potentially a use of cash in the fourth quarter, but of course I've said it before. We\u2019re not going to delever. So we're going to use the stock, either do an acquisition or buyback stock, and the way I\u2019m looking at it right now, we'll react to the timing of M-plow [ph] as we know a little bit better. Operator : And our next question comes from Mark Wilde of Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Mark Wilde : Bill I wondered if either you or Mike could just give us a little update on what you are seeing in terms of the M&A market right now? I know acquisitions are an important element in your overall growth targets? Bill Austen : Yes, Mark, we do have them M-plow [ph] there. We're pretty far down the road on developing our strategy, which included working with all the business units to identify the type of companies we want to own in the regions and geographies. As I said before, we like to think we can start moving the revenue ball from 70-30 to 50-50 global. So we\u2019re going to be thinking and looking in Latin America and the western side of the continent that we really don't participate in per say. In Europe clearly looking at eastern and central Europe as a priority, healthcare anywhere, and we\u2019ve got things percolating is a better term for it. Again like we\u2019ve said, we really don't want to be in processes. The multiples are pretty high right now. What we\u2019re trying to do is find organizations that we want to own and get to know the ownership family, if its private and see if we can strike up a conversation about helping them with their succession plan or exit strategy. So I would say it's going quite well, Mark. Mark Wilde : Okay and then Mike, if I could just as a follow-on to that, just from what you\u2019ve said, it doesn\u2019t sound like the strength in the dollar, the weakness in some of these emerging market currencies, this is really going to change your pace or your strategy in terms of looking at acquisitions. Is that right? Bill Austen : That is correct. But the other side of it though as we -- in some of these emerging markets, it's also looking at countries that have higher growth rates. You look at eastern, central Europe, those growth rates in the food categories are 5% plus type growth into the foreseeable future. And we just feel that would be -- other drivers is that -- we\u2019re targeting countries where geographies that are going to grow a lot faster than a U.S. economy is. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Adam Josephson from KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Adam Josephson : Mike, one more on capital allocation. How would you compare the attractiveness of buybacks and M&A at the moment, particularly given what you just said about multiples being rather high? Mike Clauer : Our objective right now is we want to be able to get a 15% return on invested capital on an acquisition. And as you guys -- anybody knows, that's not an easy task, when you're paying 9, 10 times EBITDA for an acquisition. So we\u2019re very balanced on the attractiveness of an acquisition. We have got to be very confident that we\u2019ve got the synergies, be it cost take outs, consolidations, SG&A take outs or revenue synergies to make that investment versus a share repurchase. Adam Josephson : Thanks Mike, and just one on the flat film line that you\u2019ve been building. I know its early days, but can you give us any sense as to what volume and/or revenue contribution you might expect from those lines next year and as well as what kind of capital you\u2019ve put into those lines and are planning to put into those lines? Mike Clauer : Adam, we\u2019ve got three lines in. Okay we line in Swansea wales. We have a line in Pauls Valley, and we have a line going in here into Wisconsin. That's what we\u2019ve invested in thus far. We have two others on the back burner, that we have not yet pulled the trigger on. We are linked with a customer and their ramp-up in the use of that flat film, and at this point that's all I will say about that flat film market and where we see that headed. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take a question from George Staphos from Bank of America. Please go ahead. George Staphos : Just want to follow-up on our earlier discussion on volumes and the outlook. So -- recognizing that you are confident of volume outlook bill for next year in U.S. Packaging, I was curious again, what your review kind of revealed in terms of why you should be confident in the outlook on volumes and some of the organizational changes that you made, how does that help you? So that's question number one. Question number two, just more of a housekeeping question. If I look at the P&L versus the segment reporting and the restructuring and other item, I think it's like $4.6 million in P&L it's something under $10 million in the segment. Just what caused that variance Mike? Thank you. Mike Clauer : George, what gives us the confidence in the volume is the pipeline. We do an exhaustive review of the global pipeline, not just of the U.S. Packaging pipeline of where the projects stand in the stage gate process. Are they a P1 or are they a P4? Are risks retired, are risks not retired? And as we look at that, when those projects are going to be completed, and if you go back to our whole premise around our stage gate process, it starts and ends with a customer. So we don't develop unless as a customer tied to it all the way through. We feel very good about that and very good about what\u2019s going to launched in the upcoming months and quarters. Not just in U.S. but also global. Bill Austen : And as to your question on restructuring, there is really three elements of the restructuring this quarter. $1.4 million associated with facility closure in the medical division and about a $0.5 million associated with acquisition related cost on M-Plow [ph]. Those are included in the segment. There is a $2.7 million charge that was not included in segment and reported as corporate and that's for identification, obligation related to a past acquisition. It's a one-time non-recurring charge. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Scott Gaffner of Barclays. Please go ahead. Scott Gaffner : Mike, just quick question on the CapEx spend for 2015. As you sort of move through the year, sounds like innovation spending maybe has moved more towards 2016 and some of the cost reduction on the existing business is taken over. Has there been any shift in the mix on CapEx innovation versus cost reduction on some of the existing business? Mike Clauer : There is really been no shift. If you think about how to think about it, about $60 million of our spend is environmental health and maintenance and I would say it's 50-50 split above there between innovation and recapitalization. Recapitalization is heavier in U.S. Packaging. Just from the standpoint that's where the assets really need to be recapitalized. And as Bill kind of pointed out, a big part of our global strategy is the migration of capabilities and higher barrier products from the U.S. to those emerging markets as packaging sophistication increases. Scott Gaffner : Okay. And just on the working capital if I recall correct 4Q of last year, there was some noted confusion as to why working capital built the way it did. Obviously you made some change in the payment terms to get towards industry standards, but have you figured out -- it seems like you have the -- what the issue was with working capital within the last year? Just trying to figure out how of much this is just a recapture of that issue versus some of these better payment terms? Mike Clauer : I think we figured out, we -- first of all Scott, I just don't think we\u2019re -- we were really focused on cash flow and we\u2019re now focused on cash flow. Last year in Q4 the number was $56 million. As we've given you the guidance, I would expect that to be $90 million plus next year. So we will continue to get improvements. And we\u2019ll continue into \u201916. I think we've made a lot of progress on terms with suppliers. We\u2019ve done a good job with the big ones, and now as we go in the Q4 and Q1, we\u2019re focused on kind of the next tier of vendors to kind of get those terms improved. From an inventory side, I think we\u2019ve done a nice job of getting inventory back to what we want it to be, but clearly the big progress still going to be linked to our rollout of supply chain optimization management and demand forecasting, which those investments are being made right now and I would expect that to start realizing second half of \u201916 into \u201917 when we complete our ERP implementation in U.S. packaging. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Alex Ovshey from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Ovshey : Just one for you. The lower resin price environment, is that having any positive or negative impact on the competitive dynamics in the business? Mike Clauer : No. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take another question from Adam Josephson. Your line is open. Adam Josephson : Thanks a lot and thanks for taking my follow-up. Mike one more on working capital. It\u2019s been a $95 million source year-to-date. Assuming it ends up being a $150 million, which is exactly what the drag was last year, you\u2019d be a 550 of operating cash flow this year, which is your 2019 target if I\u2019m not mistaken. Is there any reason to think that the long-term target is particularly conservative? Mike Clauer : No. First of all, I don\u2019t think, I wouldn\u2019t read anything into it -- it\u2019s going to be 550. We\u2019re just get back to normalized. When Bill makes that 550 comment, think about it, our EBITDA will have grown substantially as a contribution to that. So I would think in terms of -- we\u2019re targeting get to primary working capital to be 14% of net sales and then the additional growth will come from our improvements in EBITDA as we continue to drive our performance. Operator : And currently, there are no further questions in the queue. Erin Winters : Thank you, Destiny. Thank you all for joining us today. This concludes our conference call. Operator : I do want to thank everyone for their participation. Your conference call has concluded. You may disconnect at any time.",

George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Bemis Company Hosted Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Erin Winters. Please go ahead. Erin M. Winters - Director- Investor Relations : Thank you. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter 2015 conference call. Today is January 28, 2016. After today's call, a replay will be available on our website, bemis.com, under the Investor Relations section. Joining me for this call today are Bemis Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Austen, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Clauer, and our Vice President and Controller, Jerry Krempa. Following Bill and Mike's comments on our business and outlook, we will answer any questions you have. However, in order to allow everyone the opportunity to participate, we do ask that you limit yourself to one question at a time, with a related follow-up, and then fall back into the queue for any additional question. At this time, I'll direct you to our website bemis.com under the Investor Relations tab where you'll find our press release and supplemental schedule. In Mike's discussion of the financials, he'll specifically be referring to page five of the supplemental schedule. On today's call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures as we talk about our performance. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures that we consider most comparable can be found in the press release and supplemental schedules on our website. And finally, a reminder that statements regarding future performance of the company made during this call are forward-looking, and are therefore subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from historical, expected or projected results due to a variety of factors. Please refer to Bemis Company's regular SEC filings, including the most recently filed form 10-K to review these risk factors. Now, I'll turn the call over to Bill Austen. William F. Austen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Erin, and good morning everyone. I'm pleased with the strong performance Bemis delivered in 2015. We exceeded my expectations and made great progress toward our long-term financial objectives. I couldn't be more proud of the effort and execution demonstrated by our global team throughout 2015. Looking at the full year. We achieved record adjusted earnings per share of $2.55, almost an 11% increase over last year, despite currency translation headwinds of $0.16 per share. We increased gross profit margins 170 basis points over the last year, driven by productivity improvements from our asset recapitalization program, mix benefits from our focus on innovation and strong operational performance across the entire company. We increased operating profit return on sales in our U.S. Packaging segment to 14.3% a 140 basis points point increase over the prior year, reflecting great progress toward our long-term goal of 15% to 18% in this segment. We increased adjusted operating profit return on sales in our Global Packaging segment to 8.8% a 120 basis point increase over the prior year, and above pace toward our goal of double-digit returns in this segment, over the three year to give year horizon. We increased ROIC to 10.5% versus 9.7% one year ago. We generated $552 million of operating cash flow more than doubling last year's performance in this area. An example of the focus, discipline, accountability and urgency we are driving throughout the company. We acquired the rigid plastic operation of Emplal in Brazil during December, a step toward our long term inorganic growth targets. We continued to focus on innovation as reflected in our product vitality measure, which continued at 15% this year, in line with our strategy and expectations. We invested $219 million in capital to expand and improve our business, positioning us well for additional margin expansion in 2016, and we returned value to shareholders through our 32 annual dividend increase, and through the repurchase of 3.3 million shares of stock. We have initiated change and improved performance this year at Bemis. We will continue to execute our strategy of accelerating growth, focusing innovation and continuously improving all we do to deliver continued return on sales and ROIC improvement during 2016. I'll now turn the call over to Mike to discuss details of our 2015 financial performance and 2016 guidance. Then I'll come back to discuss my view of priorities as we enter 2016. Mike? Michael B. Clauer - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks Bill and good morning. We reported adjusted earnings of $0.60 per share for the fourth quarter and $2.55 for the full year of 2015, a 5.3% increase over the prior fourth quarter and 10.9% increase over the prior year. This includes overcoming a currency translation headwind of approximately $0.04 per share during the fourth quarter and $0.16 per share for the full year, primarily driven by currencies in Latin America that devalued against the dollar. We delivered solid improvement in gross margins for the full-year 2015 at 21.5%, compares to 19.8% in the prior year. This improvement was driven by the benefits of our asset recapitalization program in increasing the margin profile of our existing business and by improved price mix as we execute our strategy to sell a higher portion of sophisticated packages. I will comment next on each reportable segment followed by overall company performance, and then wrap up with guidance for 2016. First U.S. Packaging, following page five of the supplemental schedules posted on our website, sales dollars in our U.S. segment declined by 4% for the full year 2015. Excluding the impact of the 2014 Paper Packaging divestiture, net sales decreased 2.7%. Overall unit volumes were down approximately 2% for the full year 2015 as compared to 2014. As discussed throughout the year about two-thirds of this unit volume decline was driven by our pricing decision to exit some low-margin bottled water overwrap business and the remainder was driven by a select customer who lost share with their beverage pouches at the retail level. Specific to Q4, volume was up 2%, better than previous quarters in 2015. However, a single quarter doesn't form a trend and the bottled water overwrap and beverage pouch comps won't fully lapse until Q2 of 2016. Aside from volume, net sales in U.S. Packaging were impacted by contractual price reductions to pass-through lower raw material cost throughout the year which for all intents and purposes is neutral to profit. Partially offset by favorable mix in line with our strategy. U.S. Packaging operating profit return on sales for 2015 was 14.3% compared to 13.1% the prior year, great progress towards our goals of 15% to 18% over our strategic horizon. This improvement was driven by operational efficiency from our asset recapitalization programs, favorable sales mix and continued diligence in controlling cost. Moving to our Global Packaging segment. Net sales for 2015 were down 10.7%, currency translation reduced sales by 18.2% driven by currencies in Latin America that significantly devalued throughout the year. The December acquisition of Emplal contributed 0. 3% increase when included in full year net sales, excluding the impact of currencies and acquisition, our global business delivered strong organic growth of 7.2% in 2015, driven fully by positive sales price and mix. Overall, Global Packaging units were flat during 2015. Some regional details. As expected, unit volumes were up single-digits in Europe, Asia and healthcare excluding Latin American healthcare products. Overall unit volume decreased in Latin America were result of a tough economic environment in the region. However, even in Latin America, we saw positive mix from increased sales of high barrier packages, particularly for meat and other proteins. We are pleased with the success we continue to have globally and growing sales of this sophisticated packaging. Global Packaging operating profit return on sales for 2015 was 8.8% compared to 7.6% the prior year, on pace towards that goal of a 10% plus over our strategic horizon. Higher returns in Global Packaging were a result of improved price mix from sales of meat and cheese, dairy, liquid and also Healthcare Packaging. Currency translation negatively impacted operating profit by $24 million for the year or about $0.16 a share of the total company's earnings. This negative impact is related primarily to translation of profits in Brazil to the U.S. dollar, compared to the prior full-year. Currency was a challenge in 2015, but I'm pleased with our performance in local currency, where we are improving returns and growing sales of sophisticated packaging. Now on to consolidated Bemis. Total Bemis Company SG&A expense for the full year was $420 million basically flat with last year. We continue to be focused on implementing discipline and accountability to keep SG&A dollars flat over our long-term. Research and development expense for the full year was $44 million, flat with the prior year. We see this as the appropriate level to support new product innovation and commercialization. The income tax rate for 2015 was 33.6% in line with our expectations. We anticipate the tax rate for 2016 to be slightly above 33%. Cash flow from operations for the full-year 2015 totaled $552 million above my expectation of $500 million and a vast improvement over the $248 million last year. Most of our improvement year-over-year came from our sharp focus on working capital, which was a use of cash in 2014, but a strong source of cash in 2015 as we extended payable terms and managed inventory levels well. I also recognize that the mathematical flow through of lower raw material cost during 2015 bolstered our cash flow by approximately $20 million to $25 million. As you may recall on Investor Day, we shared our targets to reduce primary working capital as a percentage of sales to the 14% to 16% range by the end of 2016, which equated to taking out approximately $140 million of primary working capital throughout 2015 and 2016. During 2015, we realized approximately $110 million of this improvement, primarily driven by improved payment terms with our vendors. Capital expenditures in 2015 were $219 million, in line with our expectations. Incremental spend in 2015 funded our asset recapitalization program, as well as expansions to support projected growth. Look next at return on invested capital. Our goal is to improve this metric year-over-year toward our long-term goal of being in the upper quartile of our peer group. In 2015, ROIC increased to 10.5% compared to 9.7% in 2014. This improvement is driven by sound capital investments that meet or beat our 15% ROIC hurdle rate over a five-year period, and our improvements in working capital. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares for a total of $45.8 million for the full year 2015, we purchased a total of 3.3 million shares for $150.1 million. At December 31, the remaining board authorization for share repurchase was 3.4 million shares. Now turning to guidance. Established adjusted EPS range for 2016 of $2.68 to $2.83, which is in line with our long-term targeted strategy to increase EPS by 10% annually on a currency neutral basis. Currency translation will continue to challenge us in 2016. Our guidance assumes foreign currencies remain at current levels, specifically, since we have a significant business in Latin America, I will mention that the mid-point of our guidance assumes the Brazil real at 4.1 to the U.S. dollar. With this assumption, we have naturally accounted for a $0.10 per share impact from the currency in our 2016 guidance versus 2015 actuals. Specific to the Brazil reais the majority of this headwind will occur in the first two quarters of 2016. Next, I will discuss a few unique items that we have considered in our EPS guidance range. First, the benefit of our acquisition of Emplal, our EPS guidance range includes approximately $0.02 to $0.03 from our recently acquired business in Brazil, dependent on timing of synergy impacts. In these early stages after the December acquisition, we are developing our execution plan. We have identified $7 million to $8 million of synergies in the form of SG&A, procurement and plant and equipment rationalizations. We will start implementing these in 2016 and fully realize the benefits in 2017. Second, the benefit of our healthcare expansion. Our EPS guidance range includes about $0.03 per share related to the expansion of our healthcare operations in Wisconsin. Based on our successful completion of the project in December, we fully realize the expected 200 basis point margin improvement in our U.S. healthcare business during 2016. We're pleased to start out the year with this momentum that will elevate our industry-leading quality in the Healthcare Packaging space. Third, interest expense. Our EPS guidance range includes a headwind of approximately $6 million from interest expense as a result of generally higher interest rates following the forward curve. The remaining year-over-year increase in EPS reflects the improvement that will result as we continue to see margin benefits from our asset recapitalization program. And we continue to execute our strategy to sell more higher margin products while controlling cost. Where we are in the EPS range of $2.68 to $2.83 will depend on further movement of currencies, the successful commercialization of new products, and volumes in our business. Similar to history, you continue to expect second quarters and third quarters to be seasonally stronger, while the first quarters and the fourth quarters are typically lighter. An additional unique comp to recall is that the first quarter of 2015, we had a one-time $3 million tailwind from resin driven by the abnormal decrease in resin prices for four consecutive months during that timeframe. Turning to capital expenditure guidance for 2016, we continue to expect to spend $200 million per year, of this about $60 million is for maintenance and safety at our 60 plants around the world. That leaves approximately $140 million, which we target roughly half for growth projects to support new high-barrier, innovative applications and the other half for asset recapitalizations that support all of our end markets, including those that are less differentiated. And finally, we have established 2016 guidance for cash from operations in the range of $450 million to $500 million. As I mentioned earlier at Investor Day, we committed to taking out approximately $140 million of primary working capital by the end of 2016. While we realized approximately $110 million of this in 2015, I expect to see another $50 million to $75 million of working capital takeout take out during 2016, primarily from global payment terms improving. This will drive us to the low-end of our target, primary working cap percentage of net sales range of 14% to 16%. I anticipate normal seasonality in cash flow throughout the year with cash from operations lighter in the first quarter and then building from there. In summary, I remain confident in our business and in our ability to further improve financial performance to create long-term shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call back to Bill for his comments on 2016. William F. Austen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Mike. As I look to 2016, a few items are key to our continued financial performance. First, we must continue to execute on our asset recapitalization projects in the U.S. that are delivering margin improvement. We started this initiative in 2014 when we increased our capital spend to D&A levels. Our asset recapitalization support all of our end markets, including those that are less differentiated. My view is that there's no such thing as bad business. It's simply up to us to find ways to improve the margin profile of products, where there's a market price or heavy competition, such as candy bar wrappers or bread bags. Our asset recapitalization of printing presses and slitters does just that. Helps us be more efficient in producing products that are less differentiated. I am pleased with the margin and ROIC impact these recapitalizations have had thus far and in my view, it is critical that we continue executing these projects that meet and/or beat our 15% ROIC hurdle rate, during the next couple of years. Not only do these recapitalizations help increase our margin profile, but they also help us maintain unit volumes in less differentiated products. Second, during 2016, we will continue to focus our innovation efforts and commercialize new products across our entire business to spur growth. Our innovation pipeline of new products is strong and includes a wide variety of new packaging launches, everything from aseptic bulk liquid packaging for fruits and vegetables, to skin film for fresh meat in Europe, to protective films used in the electronics industry in Asia, to high barrier film for transdermal patches. Most of our new innovations serve developed markets around the world. But we'll also continue to share our existing innovations globally in Latin America and Asia. Our existing packaging technology is new to these developing regions where we continue to see the demand for more sophisticated packaging. A couple of great examples of global technology sharing : one, retortable films technology that we developed in Asia has now transferred to Latin America for local manufacture and sale of tuna packaging. And two, hard-to-hold liquid technology developed in U.S. is now being used in Latin America to package motor oil. We are well positioned to meet the growing needs and packaging demands in these evolving economies. And we are working cohesively across the globe to leverage our technologies, but I believe we can drive this effort harder. Innovation is important to our growth. And I'm confident in our process and plans to execute in 2016. Turning for a minute to my view on growth in 2016. In North America, I anticipate market demand for packaged foods to be flat to slightly down. I expect our business to grow above this at approximately 1% driven by new innovations that grow our high-technology business and by our asset recapitalization program that will help us maintain overall volumes in our less differentiated product lines. These two in combination will deliver overall unit volume growth in our U.S. business. Based on my current view, I would anticipate volumes in the second half of 2016 to be slightly better than the first half of the year. In our global business, I expect us to grow in Europe, Asia, and our healthcare business at approximately 4%. In Latin America where the environment remains tough, I expect us to grow slightly in 2016. Circling back to the key items of our success in 2015, the final piece is our relentless pursuit of continuous improvement in all we do. Here are just a few examples. We will continue to manage SG&A cost targeting flat dollars over our long-term planning horizon. We will continue to find ways to improve our operations such that our cost takeout programs overcome annual inflation. We will continue to control and decrease working capital globally in the form of inventory reductions and increased payable terms, all in support of generating cash. We will continue with the rigor and accountability in our capital expansions including finding new opportunities and executing our existing projects to plan. I am confident as we begin 2016. Our focus on customers is more intense than ever when we help our customers succeed, we succeed. Our culture continues to evolve toward high performance. We have momentum from our success in 2015 and we have high expectations of ourselves. And we will continue to aggressively execute our strategy in 2016 to increase earnings and create shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over for questions. Operator : Thank you. The first question comes from Anthony Pettinari of Citi. Please go ahead. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning. Just to clarify on the volume outlook in 2016, I think you said U.S. volumes would be up 1% and maybe better in the second half than the first half, and you referenced I guess 2Q is when a specific customer loss was lapped. Is that correct? And then, I mean, for the first quarter, could volume still be flattish or negative or just how do you think about the trajectory of that volume growth in the U.S. as you kind of go through 2016? William F. Austen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Anthony this is Bill. The way you described it is correct. What you heard on the call was correct. And yes, we see first quarter could be flat, because we still have not lapped some of the loss business if you will. So we see second half, we have much better visibility, much into our innovation pipeline, the commercialization of products that are going to hit in the second half is going to drive those volume increases higher in the second half than the first half, once we lap some of that business that was lost in the first half of 2015. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Great, that's helpful. And then just thinking about capital allocation for 2016. Obviously you bought back a little bit more stock, how do you think about the M&A environment versus share repurchases and are there other opportunities like Emplal and with valuations coming down especially in emerging markets. So, are you seeing \u2013 how are you seeing that pipeline? Michael B. Clauer - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Anthony this is Mike. I mean, as we've stated in the past, we're not going to de lever the company. So, if there is no acquisitions available, we would buy back stock. There are a few things we're looking at right now, nothing is eminent, but I feel like we've got a pretty nice pipeline being developed, and that's what I have to say for now. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi, good morning. This is actually Matt Krueger sitting in for Ghansham. How are you guys doing today? William F. Austen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Doing well. Thank you. Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. And then my first question is on the Global Packaging, organic results, can you break those out by volumes versus pricing, both as a whole and then kind of by region in terms of Europe, healthcare, Latin America and then Asia? William F. Austen - President and Chief Executive Officer : I got it. Michael B. Clauer - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : You got it, Bill? William F. Austen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yes. If you're talking about 2015, organic growth was 7.2%, price mix was 7.5%, so volume was flat in 2015. Remember that Latin America was down significantly, so the rest of the business performed really well, that's how it shaped up for 2015. Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. That's helpful. I'm sorry.. Erin M. Winters - Director- Investor Relations : Go ahead. Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): What was that? Erin M. Winters - Director- Investor Relations : As Bill mentioned in his comments, you asked about regional detail and if you look at the year 2015 in terms of unit volumes, we saw a good growth in Latin America \u2013 excuse me, in Asia and Europe in our healthcare business and Latin America, given the tough environment there was just a piece that was down a bit. William F. Austen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. And then kind of moving to pricing within the marketplace, what are you guys seeing in terms of competition, given the customer consolidation and then lower raw material costs, excluding the contractual pass-throughs. Has price remained pretty stable? William F. Austen - President and Chief Executive Officer : This has always been a ultra-competitive environment and the way that we've built our model, you may or may not be familiar with, but we built our model such that, we don't see volatility, we try to minimize the volatility in our earnings based on what's happening with raw materials. So it's always been a competitive environment and the recapitalization effort that we've going on in the company is helping us to be much more competitive in some of the less differentiated product lines at current market prices. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from comes from Scott Gaffner of Barclays. Please go ahead. Scott Louis Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. William F. Austen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Scott. Scott Louis Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, Bill. Just had a question. So, you said the volumes in the U.S. were up 2% in the fourth quarter and you were quick to note \u2013 not to call that a trend, obviously that \u2013 after that came the 1% U.S. volume guidance for 2016. So, was there something in the fourth quarter that was out of the ordinary like a product launch or something that really led to that accelerating organic growth in the second quarter \u2013 sorry; in the fourth quarter, that doesn't repeat again in 2016? William F. Austen - President and Chief Executive Officer : We're quick to point out it's not a trend. The fourth quarter is always a very fluid quarter. Yeah, the holidays, you have customers that have launched products, which has taken off on shelf, do they have promotions, do they not have promotions. So, fourth quarter, is kind of a \u2013 it's not a good one to look at to determine what it looks like going forward. So, we performed well in Q4, more so in the less differentiated product lines than in the core product line. So, we got some nice movement in Q4, but it's hard to say that Q4 is a good quarter to look at for what a trend is going to established. Scott Louis Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And the other question, then, is your year end to the targets you put out, 2015 to 2019, organic growth in 2015 was below that the targets you were looking for, and 2016 looks like it could be the same. Realizing that's as much a function of the macro environment as it is your ability to push organic growth higher, I mean, are you thinking about managing the business in any different way, are you putting more money into the recapitalization of the equipment versus some of these growth projects? I mean, how are you \u2013 how has the plan changed on the edge with the slower organic growth? William F. Austen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Scott, we haven't changed our plan. We're sticking with the plan. We're sticking with our strategy. We're seeing that as \u2013 we're seeing that gain a lot of traction. We're going to continue, as Mike said, to invest in the recapitalization programs and we're still funding our R&D levels at the same levels as we did this past year. Some of the things that we see, we see commercializations coming on stream in the latter part of this year, which are very encouraging. And we think our plan is working, we see our strategy working, and we're seeing it in our results. So I'm confident that what we presented on the Investor Day a year ago, we're sticking with it and we're driving hard to maintain it. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Chris Manuel of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, gentlemen. A couple of questions for you... William F. Austen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : If I could, I wanted to ask a little bit about the Emplal acquisition. I think, from the time you first announced it you talked about 2014 revenues, that were $75 million and then $58 million in 2015, as you got it closed. I'm sure a good slug of that's currency, but it would seem as though the business kind of fell off a little bit, 2014 to 2015. Maybe what's the trajectory like, as you look forward to 2016 or how we think about that? Michael B. Clauer - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Okay. This is Mike, Chris. You're correct, it's all a result of the translation. The real value of the revenue acquired hasn't changed at all. So the business is still quite some strong. The way I'm thinking about it right now, we're still at that \u2013 at the current exchange rate we'd still be at $53 million to $55 million of sales associated with Emplal. We also mentioned, we're really embarking on starting our integration and we feel really good about the synergies and our ability to deliver them. Feel very confident that all activities will be implemented in 2016 and we'll see the full benefit in 2017. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I did have one follow-up regarding your new center there in Neenah. I think you've now had it a quarter or two in operation. Can you give us any \u2013 maybe build some updates or color on how customer activity has been coming through there? How response has been? Do you think it's helping you win some new business, et cetera? Kind of us give us a gauge as to how efficacy of the center is perhaps. William F. Austen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yes. The center is gaining great \u2013 it has gained great traction with the customer base. We've had many, many, many customers. We have multiple customers in on a daily basis. We've had close to probably 100 ideation sessions thus far. And we're driving new ideas and new thoughts for different types of packaging out of that location, not just for the United States, but the interesting thing is, it's gaining traction with our international customer base as well. So people are coming from all over the globe to use our equipment, use our labs, use our process technologies to develop new packaging ideas. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chip Dillon of Vertical. Please go ahead. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Good afternoon, or morning still there. First question has to do with the volumes in the global segment overall. You mentioned that for the year the volumes were flat, but could you tell us what the fourth quarter was? Erin M. Winters - Director- Investor Relations : The fourth quarter unit volumes overall in global were down about 2%, and trend wise pretty must just the same concept, as the full year meaning, LatAm slightly tough and the rest of the regions of the world were doing well or flat. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Got you. And obviously, if we look at that number that means that volume, I'm sorry the price and mix were up a huge, I mean 9.5%. How should we think as we \u2013 you mentioned next year, probably the segment overall, I don't know if you said but it sounds to me it will be maybe flat to up a little bit, probably up a little bit because, Europe is up 4% and LatAm is up slightly. But what kind of progression should we expect on that, price mix aspect? William F. Austen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well if you look at the 2015 number, that you just quoted, probably half of that came from inflation just and primarily in the Latin American companies is just higher cost, pass-through and the other half was price mix. So, we've made very good progress on price mix and our guidance for 2016 expects that same level of performance. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Frederick Searby of Dunbar Investment Partners. Please go ahead. Frederick Searby - Dunbar: Yeah. Congratulations on the cash flow, it was exceptionally strong. I'm not sure you've delineated this but you hinted at it. How much was structural changes versus resin and raw mats being weak and the improvement in the working capital. And if most of that... William F. Austen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Okay. Frederick Searby - Dunbar: And if most of that's structural why are you guiding down even though you are still growing free cash flow? I mean, it was a massive number. And then just secondly, if you could give us some color on what the trends are right now in Latin America? You managed through a fairly apocalyptic environment in Brazil and also, it's not as relevant to you but Argentina with the devaluation and things that have gone on in Latin America this year. Can you just talk about trends right now, you've been seeing in the last couple of months given how well you've handled what's been a very, very challenging environment? Michael B. Clauer - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Okay. I'll start first with your questions on cash flow. The structural improvement was about $110 million and that was really driven by focusing on vendor terms and getting back to what we perceive \u2013 what we expect is reasonable terms with our vendors. The benefit we got from lower resin cost was about $20 million to $25 million. So, I think we've made a really good overall progress. As far as guiding down I think what I would probably say is if you think about the mid-point of our EPS guidance, that would represent about $420 million of operating cash flow if working capital was not a source or a use of cash. So, being at that $400 million-$500 million we continue to go after some additional structural improvements that I commented would be $50 million to $75 million. And, Bill, do you want to ... William F. Austen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Frederick, this is Bill Austen. I'll give you some color on the Latin American environment. It's a difficult environment, it's a high inflation. However, our customer base is continuing to innovate and want new products and launch new products and remember, we are not building automobiles and we are not building white goods or electronics. We provide packaging for everyday products that people use in their households. So while maybe some package architecture gets smaller to hit a smaller price point that allows us to innovate and develop a new product for them around the smaller size, different print, different medium and we're bringing in technologies from other parts of the world and introducing it to our Latin American customers, who now want new product and new product innovation. So, we continue to see, our core customers wanting innovation, wanting new products developed and launching new products. So we are managing our way through this environment, the team down there is doing a great job of staying ahead of inflation, continuing to push on price and continuing to innovate with product technologies that we're bringing in from other parts of the world. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Mark Wilde of BMO. Please go ahead. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning, Bill, Mike, Erin. Erin M. Winters - Director- Investor Relations : Good morning. William F. Austen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Mark. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I wondered, Mike, could you just update us on the acquisition process. Right now, I think the focus over the last several quarters has been mainly the Pacific side of Latin America and maybe Central Europe. So if you could maybe talk about that a little bit? And also just kind of whether that slowdown in Latin America has affected sort of valuation expectations? William F. Austen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I could, I mean the update is that we continue to be more focused on businesses and assets that would benefit our Global Packaging business. I would say our pipeline if everybody remembers, we're not as interested in being involved in processes, we are more interested in getting to know companies and having a conversation with them. I would tell you we shifted from kind of creating a pipeline to actually having one where it's more active, as far as relationships being created, meetings, dinners, et cetera. So that's my update right now, and again I'd say there's nothing out there that would be a transformational typed acquisition, these companies tend to still be at that $50 million \u2013 $100 million to maybe $450 million, $500 million of revenue. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And any thoughts on valuation, Mike? Michael B. Clauer - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : When I like \u2013 first of all, Mark, I know my valuation, I mean, we're trading at 9.2 times EBITDA, so I'm not going to pay more than that. I look at Emplal, we had a \u2013 we were lower than what we're trading at and that's kind of how we think about it, as it relates to businesses that would be more associated with food, clearly as we're looking at healthcare type assets those would have much higher multiple, because they got much higher growth projections. But, I'm still thinking for the food side of the business kind of 8 times we could get it done in that range, depending on synergies. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Philip Ng of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Hey, guys, nice to see volumes up nicely in the U.S., but if I do my back of envelop math, it would imply price was down significant, I know it's not a P&L impact from a EBIT end point, but was most of that step down a function of negative mix from the recap or just the raw material pass-throughs? And net-net when you go to 2016 you expect top line to be actually up with pricing down? Michael B. Clauer - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. This is Mike. I don't if you are asking Q4 or full year, but in Q4 a lot of the actually the whole revenue down is a result of the resin pass-through. And then volume was up 2% and price mix was down 1.6%, so and that is completely related to this mix of the business. We just sold more, less differentiated packaging in Q4. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Michael B. Clauer - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : I think that concerns us at all. Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then I guess you noted packaged food demand for this year in the U.S. you're expecting to be flat to down. I'm just curious have you seen any changes in your customer order patterns with the stock market obviously concerned about potentially a recession. I just wanted to get your thoughts in terms of how your customers are behaving? Thanks. William F. Austen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Phil, this is Bill. No, we haven't seen any changes in our customers ordering patterns. Not as we went out of Q4 and not as we've been now in the Q1 for several weeks. We haven't seen any changes in order patterns. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Adam Josephson of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks a lot. Good morning, everyone. Mike, one resin, I think you said there was a $3 million earnings benefit for the full year. Correct me, if I'm wrong, but I thought it was $3 million benefit in the first quarter alone. If I'm wrong about that, was it neutral in the later three quarters even though polyethylene prices fell in both the third quarter and the fourth quarter? And just lastly along those lines, do you expect a comparable resin benefit in 2016, given that polyethylene prices continue to decline? Michael B. Clauer - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : First of all you're correct, it was a $3 million benefit for the full year of 2015, that all happened in Q1. And that was really driven by a very unusual exceptional period where resin fell pretty significantly for four months in a row. We did not get any benefit at all in two, three or four. We're not anticipating any benefit or determent in 2016 other than, we're comping up against the favorable tailwind in Q1 last year. Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. Just one on price mix, I know you said it was \u2013 in the U.S., it was a negative I think 1.6 and in previous quarters, it had been a positive and you're talking about it being a positive as you get rid of this lower margin business and sell more value added products and now, it was down in the fourth quarter and you're saying don't worry about that. So, can you just help us with why it would be kind of more relevant in the first three quarters than it was in the fourth quarter? Michael B. Clauer - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : I think the best way to think about it is this. We just sold a lot more, less differentiated product which would just normally have a lower margin. So, when you're calculating your price mix on your total business, it would trend down. For the full year, our price mix for U.S. Packaging was up 2%. And that \u2013 those are the type of expectations we have of our business going forward. William F. Austen - President and Chief Executive Officer : As I said earlier Adam, Q4 is not a good quarter to use because there's so many, there's a lot of moving parts from a customer's perspective, where they're adding inventory, running inventories down, do they promotions going out, did the promotion that they have at the end cap take off or not? So, there's a lot of things that move around in the fourth quarter, due to the holidays that are in there as well as customer order patterns, take patterns if you will from their end markets. So, tough to use fourth quarter as a trend setter. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from George Staphos of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Hi, everyone, good morning, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on the progress so far. I guess, first question I had, Bill could you remind us why you think that you can keep R&D at around whatever you said $44 million, so while keeping up innovation? I recognize some of this related to the discipline around stage gating and the like, but could you go through some of the color there? What your learnings have been so far in 2015 about your ability to get leverage off your R&D related innovation? Because obviously innovation is very important in terms of \u2013 what you want to do in terms of volume and price mix longer term. William F. Austen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. George, you're absolutely right. The rigor and accountability of that stage-gate has driven into our R&D organization allows us to move resources quicker to new projects as a project gets cancelled or walked away from partway through stage-gate, because a customer doesn't want to implement it, they don't see there is going to be any market traction. So, we're able to redeploy resources much faster than we ever have before. The other part of that goes to our -- this whole concept of a global operation company, where we can move technology from region A to region B much faster because we now have an R&D organization in our regions that's headed up by a Vice President of Research and Development that's connected back to the innovation center. So, that as they see an emerging trend for instance, duck part packaging becoming hygienic in China, we can move that technology from Europe immediately to China. We have the assets in China that can produce it, and we can produce it quickly and meet the customers' demand very quickly. So, we got a network and it's getting much, much better, and we're able to deploy those resources and technologies around the world much faster with the existing base that we have. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Appreciate the thoughts there. And then, I want to take one more question in terms of this turn on price mix, so as we think about this coming year or the year that we're in right now, if I heard you correctly, I thought you said price mix would be relatively flat other than the comparison that's offered in the first quarter. Or is that purely a resin comment and you'd expect price mix to be up this year? And if you did mention that, what's the figure we should be at least thinking about, as we're modeling you for 2016? Thank you. Michael B. Clauer - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : This is Mike, George. I think the way to think about it is our price mix, unlike U.S. Packaging, was up 2% in 2015, that's a good number at the midpoint of our guidance to use for 2016. And could reference on the first half is more to do with \u2013 we're still going to live with lapping the bottle water overwrap and the Capri Sun (48:33) that really started occurring in Q1 and Q2 next year or so. Once we can kind of get over those comps, which is, as you know, is a lot of volume, low calorie \u2013 I think Bill's comment was more that we would expect to see more positive volume growth in the second half. And the same on global. I mean, we had call it 3.5% to 4% price mix without inflation in 2015. I would not expect to see anything less than that in 2017. And then if you add in just what we're doing in healthcare, you are going to have a much stronger number in Global Packaging. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Arun Viswanathan of RBC. Please go ahead. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just had a couple quick questions on your outlook for 2016. Maybe you can just describe how you kind of come to that flat to slightly down for consumer packaging industry. I understand you guys have the new products and the asset recap, but is that more of a macro call or something that your customers are alluding to or what drives that outlook? William F. Austen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Arun, we triangulated off of a couple of different data points and it's \u2013 so it's a much more of a macro view that we look at being flat to down and flat to down 1% for the packaged food environment, and our view is, is that we'll be flat to up 1% in our U.S. Packaging business. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Great. And just a little bit more on that. Is there another period in history where you saw a decline in raw materials ,and was there any commensurate rebound or increase in demand on consumer packaging, or is it mainly to track GDP? William F. Austen - President and Chief Executive Officer : My history would say it mainly tracks GDP. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Scott Gaffner of Barclays. Please go ahead. Scott Louis Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Just had a couple follow-ups here. When I look at the margin progression, Bill, over the last couple of years 2016 looks like you're \u2013 I' m sorry : 2015 you're up in about a 100 \u2013 over 100 basis points on the margin progression. You were up maybe similar amount 2013, 2014. Is there the possibility of getting to another 100 basis points of margin improvement in 2016? William F. Austen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Good question Scott. The way we look at it is, is that what we said at Investor Day, 2015 to 2018 in U.S. Packaging, 10% plus in Global. We're on that trend. We're on that slope that we'll be within those ranges that we called out. Is that 100 basis points? Is it 80 basis points? Is it 70 basis points? Our goal is to push it as fast and as hard as we can. Scott Louis Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then, Mike, in your prepared comments in answer to one other questions I think, you mentioned you weren't prepared to de-lever the balance sheet. What about levering the balance sheet? Michael B. Clauer - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : I'm going to stick with what I have been saying at this point, Scott, that I'm comfortable with where we are at. If you noticed our leverage ticked up with the Emplal acquisition and the share repurchase in Q4. We're going to continue use our free cash flow. If there's an acquisition available, we're going to do it, and if there's not, we're going to return it to our shareholders. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Chris Manuel of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hello, again. One is maybe a request for future \u2013 the way we present some things going for future, and then I do have a second question. The first request is perhaps, because we're all kind of focusing on the organic volume growth particularly in North America and in the other regions and then price mix separate, could you perhaps on slide five when you present things maybe break out the difference between price mix and volume, so that we can kind of look at those? That's, I guess, kind of maybe request one. And then, my second question was could you help us with the scope of the kind of business recap where you're going back into some of your existing products and recapping them? How would we think about the scope of revenue that that covers? Is that \u2013 are you recapping 10%, 20%, 30% of your business or how significant maybe is it isolated to certain products in particular, where you're seeing the most need to do that, how would we think about that process as it goes on and maybe perhaps how long it might go on? William F. Austen - President and Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Chris this is Bill. What primarily gets recapitalized, our printing presses, slitters, rewinders, pieces of equipment that are old, they run slower, they create higher waste, they don't have the same quality, they're low tech. So and a printing press it doesn't matter whether it runs a high end product or a low end product, it runs the same product. So to try to delineate, what side of the business it's on, we see the biggest benefit in the less differentiated products than you would see at the \u2013 but it benefits both sides of our product portfolio. But it benefits the high end products and they also benefit the low end products more, so the low end products, because it's got different price points, right, so we can generate productivity and efficiency to expand margins at existing market prices. So, there's still a long way, we're still in the early innings of this overall recapitalization effort and we're going to continue to stay on this path, because it is benefiting the shareholder and it's benefiting the company. Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Maybe let me come at the question just a little differently, see you're spending $140 million on of all of these projects and I think it was about half, for some of the recap stuff, so $70-ish million, is this something that I am guessing, it's going to be an ongoing thing, it will be \u2013 always be looking at it, but perhaps being this is the first year, so that you're really going at it hard, it's a little higher than maybe it would be on a go forward basis. So, perhaps does it maybe stay at $70-ish million the next one, two, three years and then get dialed back some \u2013 really I'm kind of coming at it thinking of what CapEx needs might end up being longer-term? Michael B. Clauer - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Scott, you should think about it \u2013 Chris, I'm sorry Chris. Chris, you should think about it that we \u2013 what we're doing is catching up, if you go back to when we bought Alcan all of our energy was on taking capacity out and moving things around and what we weren't doing was investing in new capabilities. So, I would think about 2014, 2015, 2016, probably 2017 as we're just kind of catching ourselves up. And then we're going to be back into what I would consider a normal spend where we're still going to be redoing \u2013 recapitalizing, it just won't be quite at the stepped level as it is today. And I'd like \u2013 the other thing to think about too is just \u2013 when we throw out those numbers of half or $70 million, that's \u2013 those are assets that are going to get a 15% plus ROIC in the future. And it's pretty easy to do the math on that, that it's a big driver of our margin expansion in the future. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from George Staphos of Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, guys. I actually have three cat and dog types of questions and so I'll ask them in sequence. That way you don't have to come back to me in queue. One, what have you found out of the consumer studies that you've been underwriting thus far in terms of what it's telling you about consumer behavior and what that means for Bemis going forward. And then secondly, Mike, other operating income on the P&L had a $4.7 million versus a lesser number in the year-ago. What was driving that? And then within free cash flow and working capital, it sounds like it's more inventories and payables but are you using any kind of factoring program to drive the working capital improvement as well? Thanks, guys and good luck in the quarter. Michael B. Clauer - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, George. George, what we're getting out of the consumer information and consumer study work that we're doing. Is that it's confirming everything that you read in the press today. It confirms that there is a new buying pattern, it confirms that there is new habits of people that natural, fresh, less ingredients, cleaner labels are all what consumers are looking for. And that's generating a new and smaller food companies that go-to-market through different channels. So what we're going to be doing is investigating those channels and driving harder to generate traction around the new channels. And it's \u2013 when you see companies like General Mills by a jerky company called the Epic. It's driving the large CPG companies to do new things and look for different ways to get to market with different products. And that's what's our \u2013 that's what the study work is confirming and it's driving us to go after new channels and new markets. Erin M. Winters - Director- Investor Relations : And George, I'll follow-up with you on all those details on that other operating line, it's a fair amount of small, small items just talk to, so I'll take that offline. Michael B. Clauer - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : And I'll answer your last question on cash flow, you kind of \u2013 our real focus had been in 2015, going after improving payable terms with our vendors we really didn't use any as you refer to factoring programs. We are going to in 2016, we have implemented a supplier financing program that we will make available to our kind of next set of suppliers that we're going to be working with and that in essence allows them to determine how quickly, so \u2013 I may give you an example, if we make our terms, net 65, they can decide it, if they want to take it earlier and that \u2013 so that will be a big part of our progress. And then on the AR side, there are supplier financing programs that put in place all the time by our customers. We participated in them but we generally do not take the cash early from that reason of the factoring. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Michael B. Clauer - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time, please continue. Erin M. Winters - Director- Investor Relations : Thank you, operator. Thank you, everyone for joining us today. This concludes our conference call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. You may now disconnect your line and have a great day.",

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Erin Winters. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Erin Winters : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2016 conference call. Today is April 28, 2016. After today\u2019s call, a replay will be available on our website, bemis.com under the Investor Relations section. Joining me for this call today are Bemis Company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Austen; our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Clauer; and our Vice President and Controller, Jerry Krempa. Following Bill and Mike\u2019s comments on our business and outlook, we will answer any questions you have. However, in order to allow everyone the opportunity to participate, we do ask that you limit yourself to one question at a time, with a related follow-up and then fallback into the queue for any additional questions. At this time, I will direct you to our website, bemis.com, under the Investor Relations tab, where you will find our press release and supplemental schedules. In Mike\u2019s discussion of the financials, he will specifically be referring to Pages 4 and 5 of the supplemental schedules. On today\u2019s call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures as we talk about our performance. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures that we consider most comparable can be found in the press release and supplemental schedules on our website. And finally, a reminder that statements regarding future performance of the company made during this call are forward-looking and therefore subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from historical, expected or projected results due to a variety of factors. Please refer to Bemis Company\u2019s regular SEC filings, including the most recently filed Form 10-K to review these risk factors. Now, I will turn the call over to Bill Austen. Bill Austen : Thank you, Erin and good morning everyone. As I look at the entirety of our business, there are many indications of continued progress towards our long-term goals. We increased gross profit margins 70 basis points over last year. We increased ROIC to 10.5% versus 9.9% one year ago. We announced another strategic acquisition, SteriPack, that supports our inorganic growth plans and we continue to execute our capital investment program to support growth and efficiency. I am pleased with the progress we are making at implementing our long-term strategy. However, in the short-term, our operational performance for the quarter was mixed. In the U.S., we performed very well. As expected, overall sales volumes were flat. Operationally, our U.S. business made great progress on margins, a good portion of which was driven by our asset recapitalization program. While I am proud of the performance our U.S. plants demonstrated this quarter, I don\u2019t expect future improvements to be at this exceptionally high pace. In our global business, sales unit volumes were strong across all regions. We continue to see our strategy working as we leverage our technology and know-how globally to increase the sophistication level of packaging. However, we stumbled operationally in the two specific areas of our global business. In Latin America, we didn\u2019t react to short-term order patterns by properly reducing costs. And in our newly expanded Oshkosh healthcare packaging facility, we underestimated the hiring timeline and learning curve associated with doubling the workforce and the impact it would have on the financials. Mike will provide additional color in a few minutes. But in short, we disappointed ourselves. Our teams are working to rectify these issues and reestablish an acceptable steady-state operating environment. I have complete confidence in the dedication and capability of our leadership and workforce to fully remedy the issues by the third quarter. Moving now to an update on our recent strategic acquisitions. We announced last week that we signed an agreement to purchase the healthcare packaging business of SteriPack. This is an excellent strategic acquisition for several reasons. First, while the healthcare packaging space tends to have a long gestation period for gaining new business organically, this acquisition fast tracks us with some strategic customers in the medical device packaging. We look forward to the inroads we will now have in this base of customers. Second, there is a geographical fit. We are acquiring a facility in Ireland just hours away from our legacy healthcare facility in Northern Ireland and we are also acquiring the packaging assets from a facility in the U.S. and one in Malaysia. Assets from these two locations will be integrated into our existing facilities in the U.S. and in Kuala Lumpur. Third, we see meaningful synergies from our capabilities in film coating technologies. Once qualified, we can start using Bemis-manufactured films in the converting process of the acquired business. After closing this transaction, I look forward to integrating the SteriPack business to create an even stronger, more customer-centric and more profitable Bemis healthcare packaging business. I welcome the SteriPack team to Bemis and look forward to their contributions to enhancing and growing our combined businesses. Now, an update on Emplal, the acquisition we closed in December. Integration is in the early stages and on schedule. We are solidifying our $7 million to $8 million synergy plan, which covers SG&A, procurement and plant and equipment rationalizations. We are starting to implement these plans and will fully realize the benefits in 2017. Turning to the topic of guidance, our intent is to reflect our expectations, expectations that are realistic. We are therefore trimming the top end of our 2016 EPS range fully on account of the operational inefficiencies in our Global Packaging segment that I mentioned earlier. This updated range of $2.68 to $2.78 assumes today\u2019s currency exchange rate and also assumes Global Packaging segment will return to our originally expected profitability levels by the third quarter. In summary, while we had some operational struggles this quarter, I am very confident in our strategy and our desire to improve and our ability to create long-term shareholder value. My confidence is built on several things. One, we have the right people taking action in our global operating units, specifically in Latin America and our Oshkosh healthcare business. Two, our innovation pipeline remains strong, the rigor dedicated to this plan gives me clear line of sight to our growth. Three, we have the right capital plans in place and we are executing on our asset recapitalization program that is driving real margin improvement across all end markets in our U.S. business. And finally, we have the will and the sense of urgency to perform at a higher level each and everyday. With that, I will turn the call over to Mike for his comments on the financials. Mike? Mike Clauer : Thanks, Bill and good morning. We reported adjusted earnings of $0.60 per share for the first quarter compared to $0.61 the prior year. Currency translation decreased EPS by approximately $0.03 versus 1 year ago primarily driven by currencies in Latin America that devalued against the dollar. From a total company perspective, we delivered solid improvement in gross margins during Q1 at 21.6%. This improvement was driven primarily by strong operational performance in our U.S. Packaging segment partially offset by challenges and portions of our global segment. Looking at Slide 4, some detail in U.S. Packaging. Sales dollars in our U.S. segment declined by 6.6% over the prior year. The decline in sales dollars was driven by contractual price reductions to pass through lower raw material costs, which is neutral to profit, along with lower sales mix from less differentiated products. Keep in mind that a lighter sales mix does not necessarily translate to less profit, a clear benefit from our asset recapitalization program that is increasing the margin profile of all product lines through increased run speeds, lower waste and overall efficiency improvements. Unit volumes were flat during the first quarter versus the prior year. U.S. Packaging operating profit return on sales was 15.4% compared to 13.5% last year. 50 to 60 basis points of this quarter\u2019s improvement over the prior year first quarter was mat related to lower priced raw materials passing equally through the cost of goods sold line and the revenue line. I point this out because we do not consider this improvement when judging our performance against our long-term targets of 15% to 18% in this segment. And we will continue our strategic efforts to drive margins in the long-term regardless of what raw material prices do. The remainder of the improvement in margins this quarter was driven by manufacturing efficiencies primarily from our asset recapitalization programs. I do not anticipate this exceptional high pace to continue through the remainder of the year. Turning to Slide 5, moving to our Global Packaging segment, sales dollars were down 7.7% over the prior year. Currency translation reduced sales by 20.3%, driven by currencies in Latin America that devalued versus the prior first quarter. The December acquisition of Emplal contributed a 4% increase in sales over the prior year. As we integrate the Emplal business this year, it is becoming increasingly difficult to bifurcate the sales attributable to Emplal on a meaningful standalone basis as we optimize where things are being produced. Excluding the impact of currencies and acquisitions, our global segment delivered organic sales growth of 8.6% this quarter versus the prior year driven by unit volume increases of 3% and the remainder by selling price and mix. Adjusted Global Packaging operating profit return on sales was 5.3% compared to 8.8% last year. Currency translation negatively impacted operating profit by $3.8 million or about $0.03 a share of the total company\u2019s earnings compared to the prior year. While our business in Europe and Asia performed quite well from both a volume and operational perspective, our Latin American healthcare business has struggled operationally. First, a bit of detail on our business in Latin America, which contributed approximately three quarters of the overall decline in our Global Packaging segment operating profit. Overall, sales volumes in Latin America were stronger than expected driven by our flexibles business. Our customers continue to transition to the high-end deli style meat packaging along with a variety of other products that are gaining tractions due to our efforts to lever our technology know-how globally. I am pleased with our continued progress of this companywide front. However, in Latin America\u2019s rigid business, where we make products such as tubs for margarine, yogurt and ice cream, we did not perform well operationally during the quarter. Customer orders were softer than planned due to producers\u2019 aggressive pricing actions that were initially resisted by the retailers and also due to a fire at one of our customers\u2019 plants. We did not take out variable and semi-variable costs at a fast enough space, creating a $0.04 EPS drag during the quarter. We have already implemented corrective actions within our Latin American business, but we anticipate seeing hangover in the financials during the second quarter. Second, turning to the issues in our healthcare packaging business this quarter. As you may recall last year, we embarked on the closure of our healthcare packaging facility at Philadelphia and the expansion of our facility in Oshkosh, Wisconsin that will elevate our industry leading quality and support additional growth. By October of last year, we had achieved validation and product functional equivalency on our coder, the prominent piece of equipment which allowed us to ship commercial products from our expanded Oshkosh facility. As planned, our Philadelphia plant closed in January this year, at which time we have relocated the final remaining converting assets to Oshkosh. Over the last couple of quarters, we have almost doubled our workforce in Oshkosh to support the expansion and have done a reasonable job managing that. However, in Q1, as we move the final pieces of equipment to Oshkosh from Philadelphia, we struggled bringing the last large round of the new employees up to normal operating levels on these machines. It was a steep learning curve. And while our new workforce is motivated and well intended, the experience level cost higher waste, slower run speeds and duplicate cost and training. This resulted in a $0.02 negative EPS impact versus the prior year instead of the $0.005 improvement that was expected for the first quarter. While we are disappointed in the short-term financial results of the situation, improvement is underway and we anticipate the financial impact to be remedied by the third quarter and return the investment to its original financial objectives albeit a few quarters behind the schedule. Moving to Bemis consolidated results. Total company SG&A expense in the first quarter was $99.4 million as compared to $106.4 million last year. We continue to expect SG&A dollars to be flat on a full year basis in line with our long-term targets. Research and development expense for the quarter was $11.5 million flat with the prior year. This is an appropriate level to support new product innovation and future product commercialization. The income tax rate for the first quarter was 33%, in line with our expectations of full year tax rate slightly above 33%. Operating cash flow for the first quarter totaled $52.6 million, slightly less than my expectation due to inventory levels in U.S. Packaging. We continue to expect cash from operations in the range of $450 million to $500 million this year, which includes $50 million to $75 million of working capital takeout during 2016 primarily from global payment terms. As mentioned at the start of the year, I anticipate normal seasonality and cash flow throughout the year with cash from operations building from first quarter levels. Capital expenditures were $30.6 million this quarter. We continue to expect the full year CapEx will be approximately $200 million as we previously stated. Looking next on return on invested capital, our goal is to improve this metric year-over-year toward our long-term goal of being in the upper quartile of our peer group. In the first quarter, ROIC increased to 10.5% compared to 9.9% last year in Q1. During the first quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares for a total of $44.3 million. On February 4, our board increased the share repurchase authorization by 20 million shares. We anticipate buying these shares back over the next 3 to 5 years. In making this decision, we took a fresh look at our capital allocation strategy. I hold a high regard for our investment grade credit rating, particularly at this point in the cycle. We will prioritize capital spending for organic growth and efficiency improvements. We will return free cash flow to our shareholders over the long-term horizon. At March 31, the remaining board authorization for share repurchase was 22.4 million shares. Turning to EPS guidance, we are lowering the top end of our range by $0.05 fully on account of operational issues in Latin America and our Oshkosh healthcare packaging facility. We expect adjusted EPS for 2016 of $2.68 to $2.78 a share. The impact of currency translation and SteriPack acquisition that is planned to close soon, are both included in this range. Specifically, on currency translation, we have assumed the Brazilian real at 3.6 for the remainder of the year. And specifically on SteriPack, we expect $0.01 to $0.02 of EPS in the current year. Where we are within the EPS range of $2.68 to $2.78 will be dependent on volumes in our business, movement of currencies and our correction of short-term operational issues in our global segment. While I am disappointed with the issues encountered in global segment this quarter, I continue to remain confident in our ability to further improve financial performance to create long-term shareholder value in line with our targets. With that, I will turn the call over for questions. Erin Winters : Operator, are there questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will go first to George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead. George Staphos : Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for the details. Couple of questions to start. Number one, recognizing that the operational issues were the reason why you lowered the top end of the guidance why did you maintain the low end of the guidance? Was it just cushion you had in the model? Was it a little bit of the benefit you are getting from Stericycle if you would comment there? And then again, within guidance, can you remind us, Bill, what are you looking for in terms of volumes for the two segments over the remainder of the year? Thank you. Mike Clauer : George, this is Mike. George Staphos : Hi, Mike. Mike Clauer : I will talk about the range and then I will let Bill comment on volumes. We really didn\u2019t have a lot of cushion. Why we held the bottom of the range is definitely the reais coming down has been a benefit and the addition of SteriPack has helped. I think everything else that we are looking at we see really no other problems at this point in time. And it\u2019s really more a function of how quickly we get the operational issues improved. And at this point in time, we are feeling confident that, that will \u2013 that there will still be some drag in Q2, but we will get it back to where we want it to be in Q3. And then Bill? Bill Austen : Yes. On volumes, George, what we said on the last call for U.S. Packaging volumes would be flat in the first half and pickup in the second half of the year for a plus 1 total year. We still see that in our sites. And on global, we see up 4% volume in \u2013 for 2016, that\u2019s what we said on the last call and that\u2019s where we are today still. Erin Winters : Is there a follow-up a George? Do you have another question operator? Operator : Yes. We will go next to Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Matt Krueger : Hi, this is actually Matt Krueger sitting in for Ghansham. How are you guys doing today? Bill Austen : We are doing fine. Thank you. Matt Krueger : Great. Can you walk us through what you guys saw in terms of regional demand for the quarter and kind of what your outlook is for regional demand through the remainder of 2016? Bill Austen : Sure. This is Bill. If you look at the overall company, if you go around the globe, U.S. Packaging is just what I just said. We see flat in the first half and our volumes picking up in the second half, primarily due to some innovation that comes on-stream and orders that come up on on-stream in the second half of the year versus the first half. If you look at the rest of the global business, demand is good. Order rates are good around the world. Latin America, Argentina is solid. We see good demand in Mexico. For flexibles, good demand in Brazil for flexibles. And coming out of the issue, the operational issues we had in Q1 based on margarine edible fat demands, those volumes are now starting to pick-up to levels that would be acceptable. Europe, we continue to see 1% growth across Europe in our protein business. And in Asia Pacific, we are continuing to see demands in that low single-digit range. Matt Krueger : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then one follow-up from me, understanding that inflecting raw material costs can impact the industry competition levels, how has competition trended across your various businesses and can you break that out by region as well? Bill Austen : As we built our model around raw materials, we have taken the volatility out of our earnings due to whatever happens with raw materials, so we really don\u2019t see our position impacted from a raw material perspective on the competitive front. What others have built into their models for raw materials, we don\u2019t know. But ours, we see as \u2013 we built a sound model, where we don\u2019t have variance in our earnings because of raw material. Operator : And we will go next to Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Please go ahead. Scott Gaffner : Thanks. Good morning. Bill Austen : Hi Scott. Scott Gaffner : Bill, Mike, just looking at the operational issues, specifically in Brazil you said you didn\u2019t react quickly enough, I guess two parts on that. One is do you feel like there was a breakdown in the line of communication from the region back or was there some sort of hope that the volumes would recover. Can you just maybe walk us through sort of operationally how that came about? Bill Austen : Yes, Scott. This is Bill. Scott Gaffner : Hey Bill. Bill Austen : We have a rigid business in Brazil. If you go through across the whole region, Argentina is in great shape, Mexico is in great shape, flexibles across the entire region was in great shape. So what were the operational issues we suffered was solely dedicated to our rigid business in Brazil. A large percentage of that business is dedicated to manufacture of margarine tubs. The margarine producers jacked prices up. The retailers pushed back. They squelched our volumes and what our team did down there was what most teams would do, think that those volumes are going to come back and they waited too long. Coupled with that, one of our large margarine producers happen to have a plant fire, so the plant fire took several weeks out of production at one of our facilities, compounded with the fact that retailers stopped drawing margarine. It\u2019s costly to take variable cost out meaning severance charges are expensive in Brazil. Our team thought this was going to be a short-term issue, meaning weeks. It turned out to be quarter-long, so they struggled. And it wasn\u2019t a communication issue. It was a decision they made not to take out the variable, semi-variable costs because they thought the volumes were going to come back. They didn\u2019t. We are now much \u2013 we are in a much better position now, having gotten in line. Orders are ramping back up again, coming back to normal levels in that margarine segment. And the fire, that plant is back up and running again. Scott Gaffner : Okay. So when you said the operational inefficiencies would be fully recovered in the third quarter, we should expect some gradual improvement in the second quarter, is that the best way to think about it? Bill Austen : Yes, ramping up through the second quarter. It\u2019s not something that we are going to get in line tomorrow. It will take the quarter to get it back in line. Mike Clauer : Scott, this is Mike. Also keep in mind we are actually \u2013 I am going to make a \u2013 I want you all to read this. We are going to take capacity down, meaning we are going to take shifts out. We might \u2013 if the plant has 20 pieces of equipment, we might take two down because that was the other part of the problem, was they had staffed themselves to forecast that wasn\u2019t being hit. What we are going to do now is we are going to use over time to flex manufacturing up in the event we get a spike in production. Operator : And we will take our next question from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. Just a question on the M&A pipeline, I was wondering if you could talk generally about availability of attractive assets and the multiples you are seeing. And then following SteriPack, is healthcare \u2013 is it safe to say healthcare kind of remains the most likely target of M&A. And then during the quarter, you had a large global competitor that bought, I think the largest flexible packager in Latin America, is that a business that you compete against or was it one that you looked at or if you can give any color there? Mike Clauer : Yes. I will start with the Techpack down in Latin America. Number one, we don\u2019t compete with them at all. We don\u2019t \u2013 we are not in the same markets. We had spent time with the company about a year ago. It\u2019s a nice business. There had been a lot of talk. It was going to come into a process. I applaud Amcor for being preemptive. I think it\u2019s a nice foothold for them. I don\u2019t feel bad about it because I don\u2019t view it as changing any of the competitive landscape in Latin America. As far as our pipeline, yes there is a lot of activity going on. There is assets coming into the market. Healthcare again, as you indicated would be a high priority of ours, but also geographic expansion. So we are excited about SteriPack and we have other things that we are working on. Multiples, we are still seeing for kind of food, flexible food type assets, you are 8x, 9x-ish. In healthcare, you are going to be 9x to 11x depending on the asset and the growth profiles. But that\u2019s kind of what we continue to see. Anthony Pettinari : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then maybe for Bill just kind of a bigger picture question, as you come in, you are sort of shaking up the innovation function and tried to take a fresh look at the portfolio and Bemis obviously has leadership in food and bev and healthcare packaging, I am just wondering as you kind of take a fresh look, are there other packaging categories, I don\u2019t know protective packaging for instance, where we are seeing a lot of growth and competitor margins look pretty attractive or do you think Bemis\u2019 capabilities in innovation would be a good entry point and is it possible to, I don\u2019t know size the opportunity there or is that something that you could do in 2017, 2018, just kind of any thoughts that you have there? Bill Austen : Yes. Bigger picture, if you step back and you look at what we are today, we are very focused on polymer-based packaging. So you are not going to see things like paper and liner board and things like that for us to look at in adjacency in, Anthony. We are going to look at adjacencies that are in the polymer space and it would be polymer barrier, alright. So any other types of polymer-based packaging that would incorporate barrier, incorporate high graphics, incorporate barrier fitments. Those are the areas that we have on our radar screen that we have on our list of other types of technologies that we want to get into, where we could leverage our material chemists and our material science guys to create something different. So those are the spaces that we are looking at. Operator : And we will take our next question from Mark Wilde with BMO. Please go ahead. Mark Wilde : Good morning. Bill Austen : Hey, Mark. Mark Wilde : First question I had, North American volumes were flat in the quarter, but I know that you have actually been picking up volume in some markets like that bread bag business that you would put capital into. So Bill, can you just help us understand sort of where the different puts and takes are in the domestic business in the North American business? Bill Austen : Yes, I think as you look at Q1, Mark, some of \u2013 there is always some seasonality on what would be the higher margin profile types, meat, cheese types of markets in Q1. You come out of a Q4, where a lot of companies build up their inventories. They slow down in Q1 and they start to pick up toward the tail end of Q1, but you don\u2019t see those sales into Q2, Q3 for, I hate to say it, but summer grilling season and a lot kind of stuff, right, that\u2019s where you see that pickup. But if you look at what\u2019s going on with us right now in U.S., for the last two quarters, our recap program is starting to gain a lot of traction and you are seeing those what we would call our less differentiated products picking up the volumes of the down seasonality in the higher end, higher barrier end of the markets, so that we have got a much better position from a volume perspective, which has been our strategy all along with that recap program to attack the less differentiated products, so we can continue to grow margins and maintain and grow volumes in that end of the business. Mark Wilde : Yes. But if your overall volume is flat and you are picking up volume because of this recap activity, does that actually mean like the seasonality perhaps in some of the businesses like protein was actually sharper than normal? And so you actually had kind of negative year-over-year volumes? Bill Austen : Well, if you look \u2013 if you went to the IRI data, you would see that some of those protein markets were down in Q1. So, we just follow that seasonality down in Q1, comes back in Q2 because now the customers are filling their pipelines again. And we have made up those volumes in the less-differentiated product categories. Mark Wilde : Okay. Just to kind of follow on this a little more, one of the big paperboard packaging companies yesterday said that they were seeing better volumes in recent months from kind of food processors and other food-related businesses. Are you seeing any of that? Bill Austen : I can\u2019t specifically say that we are seeing it from any one specific food processor, Mark, but we are seeing volumes \u2013 we are seeing increasing volume in our less differentiated product categories. Operator : And we will take our next question from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead. Adam Josephson : Thanks. Good morning. Bill, just one on Avery Dennison\u2019s announcement yesterday, they are buying the Mactac Europe business. Obviously, they are paying more for just the Europe piece than you sold the business for a little under a couple of years ago. Are you surprised by what private equity is able to sell that piece of the business for? And do you have any regrets about selling it when you did? Bill Austen : No, not at all, Adam. Quite frankly, we looked at that scenario, but based on antitrust issues that we would have had the leftover U.S. piece and nothing to do with it. We wouldn\u2019t have had any exit strategy for the U.S. had we sold the European piece outright. So, no, not surprised, it\u2019s what we had thought. Adam Josephson : Okay. And just one on buybacks, what is your view of buybacks at current levels? Mike Clauer : Well, my view of buybacks is kind of what I said in my comment is that we are going to return our free cash flow to our shareholders over a 3-year to 5-year period of time via dividend and share repurchase. Operator : And we will take our next question from Philip Ng with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Philip Ng : Hey, guys. Can you provide a sense of what the margin profile is for SteriPack and type of synergies you expect to realize over time? And then separately, if I remember correctly, margins in healthcare was probably middle of the pack among your different verticals, do you now have enough scale where you can bridge that gap over time? Mike Clauer : First of all, the margin profile of SteriPack was very comparable to our existing business, so low single-digits. So, we are excited with that. It\u2019s low-teens. Erin Winters : Low-teens. Mike Clauer : I am sorry, low-teens. The synergies we see with SteriPack, number one, the biggest synergy is the fact that once we can get our films qualified, we will be able to use that in their packaging business. So today, they are going to be buying most of their film structures from outside of competitors of Bemis, so that\u2019s a pretty meaningful synergy. Also moving those, the production into \u2013 in the U.S. and Malaysia into our facilities, there is quite a bit of margin enhancement just from those plants where we are really being used for the piece of business that the founders are going to keep, which is contract manufacturing. So, we will get a nice margin uplift there. And as Bill mentioned, we have no intentions of a facility consolidation, but we have two plants now within a couple of hours of each other that we will definitely go after the SG&A side of that equation to make sure we run both those plants as kind of one plant over a long period of time. So, those are the type of synergies that we fully expect. We don\u2019t see any this year. And a lot of that\u2019s just really driven by as you guys know in the healthcare packaging, things take a little bit of time to get qualified. Philip Ng : And the low-teen margins, is that EBITDA margin or EBIT margin? Erin Winters : OP. Mike Clauer : OP. Bill Austen : Yes, EBIT. Philip Ng : Okay, alright. Got it. And then last one from me, with the B cycle turning in North America and perhaps protein getting a little better as well, can you size that opportunity for you in the grand scheme of things? Is that about like 5% of your business in U.S. Packaging or a little less? Mike Clauer : Shrink bags, right? Philip Ng : Yes. Erin Winters : Yes. We are primarily processing as you know Phil. Our shrink bags business in the U.S. is relatively small, $150 million or so. So, it\u2019s a space for us to improve, but most of our meat would be in processed. Operator : And we will take our next question from Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Debbie Jones : Hi, good morning. Bill Austen : Hi, Debbie. Debbie Jones : Just to go back to the healthcare facility in Oshkosh, are you making product at this point that can be delivered to the customer? And then what would or could you think you could have done differently? Bill Austen : Debbie, we have been making and shipping product since October... Debbie Jones : Yes, I guess on the expansion, the specific expansion. Bill Austen : Yes, yes. From the expansion, we have been shipping product from October. We moved the last piece \u2013 several pieces of equipment in late December, January into that facility from Philadelphia and it was bringing the labor force up on those critical pieces of equipment where we stumbled. And it was \u2013 we are now producing at above the levels we need to be at to work through the backlog. So, we have been shipping from there right throughout the whole cycle. Debbie Jones : Okay. My second question something related to George\u2019s initial one about guidance, you didn\u2019t take down your CFO guidance and I am just curious, is that \u2013 one is SteriPack going to be cash flow positive this year and this suggests you are kind of tracking at the higher end of your internal assumptions? Mike Clauer : Well, to be completely honest, I mean the reason we didn\u2019t move on our free cash flow guidance is because our outlook and our projections still suggest that, that\u2019s a very achievable number. And I would expect a modest add to cash flow as a result of SteriPack during the year. Operator : And we will take our next question from Chip Dillon with Vertical. Please go ahead. James Armstrong : Hi, it\u2019s James Armstrong for Chip. First question I had is on the Oshkosh, Wisconsin healthcare packaging facility. Why put that in the Global Packaging segment? Should it not be in the U.S.? And what proportion of that facility actually gets exported? Bill Austen : The reason that healthcare packaging is in global is because that\u2019s a global, around the world business for us. We have plants everywhere that serve the same customers with the same specs. So, we add that into the global business and not part of the U.S. business. We don\u2019t have broken out what components might get shipped from there that end up going outside of the United States. We would ship to somebody in the U.S. and then they might ship it outside the U.S. James Armstrong : Okay, that makes sense. Switching gears, just could you review how the roll off of lost business in early \u201815, really referring to the Capri Sun and beverage wrap, will occur through 2016? Is it all pretty much done or will it be over the entire year? Mike Clauer : It\u2019s going to be \u2013 it\u2019s going to continue in both Q1 and Q2. And I think somebody asked an earlier question, was flat good? Flat was good from the standpoint we were still lapping the Capri Sun business in Q1 and will continue in Q2. Operator : And we will take our next question from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Arun Viswanathan : Good morning. Thank you. I guess just trying to reconcile a couple of things we are seeing in the industry. Many of your upstream suppliers are speaking of very strong volumes in packaging and many of the downstream packagers like yourself and some other folks and then what we are seeing in the Nielsen data is relatively muted, flat to low single-digit growth, I am just trying to understand why the polyethylene price increases are going through and what kind of volumes you guys see for the rest of the year, if that could increase sequentially? Bill Austen : Sure. I can\u2019t speak to what\u2019s going on with polyethylene prices other than there was a nickel that was \u2013 went into the market in March, that\u2019s a function of the polyethylene providers\u2019 capacity, capacity utilization, what outages they have coming, which outages are underway right now. So I can\u2019t speak to that. I can speak to the fact that there was a nickel that went in, in March. Volumes, we are on our track for volumes right now. We said we would be flat in the first half. We still see that is happening and we see volumes in the back half of the year in U.S. Packaging being up for a total year of plus one. And globally, we are seeing good, solid demands across the globe in all of our global packaging entities in Latin America, Asia, Europe and healthcare. So we are on our pace to where we wanted to be in 2016. Arun Viswanathan : Great. And then just as a follow-up, maybe you can just give us an update on the asset recap program, maybe what inning you are in and how you see that playing out for the rest of the year? Thanks. Bill Austen : Yes. Just go back to our CapEx guidance this year. We are on pace to hit that. We re continuing with our asset recapitalization program in North America with presses, rewinders, film lines, taking out old equipment, bringing in new, reducing our costs, expanding our margins. That\u2019s the plan we have been on and that\u2019s what we are going to stay on. We are still in the early innings there as we have 27 plants across the U.S. And there is a portion of recap that can certainly be utilized in all those plants. But we prioritize them using 15% return on invested capital over a 5-year average and that is what we are continuing to pace and see with all the projects that are coming in. So you are going to see our recap program continue to gain traction through 2016. Operator : And we will take our next question from Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Chris Manuel : Good morning gentlemen or I guess good afternoon now, I apologize. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. I do have one follow-up though, one question. But before I say that, thank you much for the color, it\u2019s very refreshing that you are so transparent about where the problems are and helping us quantify them without digging it out, so difficult. My question is it sounds like with the Oshkosh facility that\u2019s coming on-stream, well as we sit today just a little bit delayed, it sounds like you are going to be putting some more business through there, what you bought with the most recent acquisition. Once you get that all kind of layered in or get all the facilities together, where are you going to be sitting on the utilization rate or how do you feel you will be for utilization in the healthcare business or do you still have \u2013 I guess really, what I am trying to get is do you have a lot of room yet to grow there? Bill Austen : Yes. Chris, we have room to grow in the healthcare space, okay. Because basically when we move from Philly to Oshkosh, it was a new facility, but it also recapped that new facility because of all the older assets, slower speeds, narrower webs that we are running through the Philadelphia facility. So we have got room to grow within the healthcare space as we built out that new facility. And it was done with that in mind. Chris Manuel : Alright. It sounds like with SteriPack as well, you were intending to transition them to some of your coated films and such I am guessing that\u2019s coming out of that facility as well? Bill Austen : Yes. And in Europe as well, Chris. Chris Manuel : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Another follow-up question I had was as you are seeing some of the new business wins and those will begin to really trickle through, I guess in more earnest over the balance of the year, can you maybe give us some color as to what categories or areas that you are seeing the most opportunity today as well as \u2013 I mean usually, you always have some businesses that are kind of growing, some that are shrinking, but maybe if you can give us a sense of where you are seeing the most growth, the most opportunities within the markets and where quite frankly, maybe some of the areas that you are seeing a little bit of shrinkage? Bill Austen : I will address where we are seeing the project activity, I guess is the best way for me to put it. And that, when I say project activity those are stage gate projects. We are seeing good stage gate projects and traction in liquid. Again that\u2019s the conversion of glass and cans to flexibles. Protein, good projects in the protein space, we are also seeing good projects and commercialization of projects in the medical space, which is for film and coated Tyvek. So as well as in pharma with our CXB product and that\u2019s a global product that we are taking to all the pharma companies around the world. So we have got good traction through stage gate in basically the vast majority of our segments. Operator : And we will take our next question from George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead. George Staphos : Thanks for taking my follow-up. I guess first thing I want to come to is when we look at the asset recapitalization program, Mike you said \u2013 and Bill you said we won\u2019t see this repeat in terms of margin performance at the same pace in the next few quarters, I was wondering if you could \u2013 I saw the fact that you did pretty well in the first quarter, provide some color as to why you think the pace of improvement won\u2019t continue at the same rate. And then as you look at the mix of returns that you are getting across the end markets that you are running now more efficiently because of the recap program, what\u2019s been some of the surprises, either positively or negatively in terms of return by end market, would you be able to talk to that a little bit? Thanks. Bill Austen : Sure. George, the first part of your question has to do with why we won\u2019t see that extraordinary ramp up of margins as we go through the rest of the year. George Staphos : Yes. I am assuming it was tough comps. I just want to hear from you guys. Bill Austen : Yes. No, you just recall, this is first quarter. So at the end of the year, we got a lot of equipment that comes down for maintenance, for outages, for the holidays. And normally, as you ramp that equipment back up again, you incur a lot of waste, a lot of scrap, you are not quite there with throughput, you are not running the right spec. We had a great startup in North America this year, okay. That being completely transparent, we had really good startup in North America. Again, that goes to good effort by our plant teams, newer equipment that starts up easier, starts up quicker, doesn\u2019t have all the startup waste that some of the older equipment might have had. So on a year-over-year, first quarter to first quarter basis, we might have seen 40 basis points to 50 basis points of margin improvement just from that lower waste, lower scrap, getting online quicker than we have in the past. And second part of your question about margins across segments, when we put in those recap pieces of equipment, we step up margin without \u2013 as we have talked, without having to adjust market pricing. So we are able to do that across the board, whether it\u2019s in bread bags, whether it\u2019s in non-barrier polyethylene type markets. And we are going to continue to do that as we go forward. I can\u2019t give you specific numbers across those market segments, but just know that we are expanding margins in that less differentiated product categories. Mike Clauer : George, this is Mike. And just to clarify my comment, our guidance for U.S. pack, our guidance would suggest U.S. Packaging for the balance of the year would be 70 basis point to 90 basis point improvement, I just didn\u2019t want people running away with 190, thinking that\u2019s where we are going to stay at that pace. We are still going to stay at what I consider a really good pace as we drive towards our long-term horizon goals. Operator : And we will take our next question from Mark Wilde with BMO. Please go ahead. Mark Wilde : Yes. I got a couple of follow-ups. One, can you just \u2013 can you talk about where that kind of flat film rollout or build out is right now? Bill Austen : Sure Mark. We have received some nice orders from a large processor here in the United States and we are ramping up the sales of that product to that customer and we will be fully on-stream in Q3 with that customer at full run rate orders. Mark Wilde : And then the other question I had \u2013 the other follow-up I had is just I wonder if you could talk about this $20 million share repurchase authorization just in terms of sort of the change in kind of strategy that it might represent for Bemis going forward, because it is a big change from the way you have used repurchase in the past? Mike Clauer : Yes, this is \u2013 it\u2019s really about the allocation. We put a lot of effort into the optimum ratings that we wanted. And the work that was completed suggests that our current rating of investment grade, BBB for better terms is where we should be, but that doesn\u2019t suggest, number one that we have to have leverage down at 2.1x. It says we can be more comfortable at 2.5x. And the big change in the strategy is we are going to prioritize first our needs for growth and recapitalization of CapEx. And then put it simply, we are going to return free cash flow to our shareholders via dividend and the share repurchase. And we will use leverage to do our acquisitions. That\u2019s the simplest way I can put it, Mark, of how we are looking at this going forward. And we are always going to be looking on a forward horizon and what we feel about our free cash flow and what kind of M&A activity might be imminent. And if there is nothing imminent that we need, we would return that cash to our shareholders. Operator : And we will go next to George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead. George Staphos : Hi, guys. Some last ones from me just to finish up. Obviously, you have got your hand on the pulse in terms of the operational issues in the Global Packaging segment. From where we sit, obviously, we are not to be able to get a heck of a lot of visibility in terms of how you are proceeding against your plan for obvious reasons. If you were in our shoes, aside from second quarter reporting season and the results that you put out in your comments there, is there anything \u2013 any mile markers you would guide us to, to know or have a bit more comfort that you are resolving those operational issues? That\u2019s question number one. My question number two, I think you mentioned that working capital was a little bit below \u2013 or efficiency was a little bit below your plan for the quarter. Can you remind us what was driving that? And then lastly, you said you talked about capital structure and the cycle suggesting you have a view on where we are in the cycle. And if you do, could you sort of add a bit more color there in terms of your expectations for the next couple of years? Thanks. Mike Clauer : Okay. First of all, there is \u2013 I mean, we don\u2019t talk in between quarter ends, so unfortunately, there really would be no way for you to know if things are getting better prior to us releasing Q2 earnings. So, that\u2019s just \u2013 that\u2019s a fact. George Staphos : But if we see better margin trends out of Latin America, I guess that would be one minor signpost, but anything else like that? Mike Clauer : You would see it in Q2, the Global Packaging margins get back on pace with where they should be like that would be an indicator that it\u2019s improving. The comment on over the cycle on investment grade, we don\u2019t have visibility into where we are in the cycle. What we did is we looked at a 10-year period of time and the optimum level to be at from a borrowing perspective. And quite honestly, from how..... Bill Austen : Availability. Mike Clauer : Availability in the markets and also linked to how stock of companies perform that is just the best place to be over a long period of time. I mean, so that was meant by that comment. George Staphos : Understood. And the working capital? Mike Clauer : On the working capital, yes, we missed \u2013 my internal expectations, was about a $9 million miss and that was primarily in heavier inventories in our U.S. operations. I think it\u2019s pretty hard to peg this thing exactly where it needs to be on a quarter-to-quarter basis. However, we have sat down with the group and they fully understand that we have cash flow \u2013 operating cash flow objectives like we have the EPS objectives. And there is an expectation that we get this inventory back to where we, including the business that actually helped develop those objectives get it back in line as we go through the year. George Staphos : Okay, thank you. Mike Clauer : You are welcome. Operator : And we have no further questions at this time. I would like to hand it back over to our speakers for any final remarks. Erin Winters : Thank you. Thank you everyone for joining us today and this concludes our conference call. Operator : Thank you. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Erin Winters. Please go ahead, ma'am. Erin Winters : Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2016 conference call. Today is July 28, 2016. After today's call, a replay will be available on our website, bemis.com, under the Investor Relations section. Joining me for this call today are Bemis Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Austen; our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Clauer; and our Vice President and Controller, Jerry Krempa. Following Bill and Mike's comments on our business and outlook, we will answer any questions you have. However, in order to allow everyone the opportunity to participate, we do ask that you limit yourselves to one question at a time with a related follow-up, and then fall back into the queue for any additional questions. At this time, I'll direct you to our website, bemis.com under the Investor Relations tab, where you'll find our press release and supplemental schedule. In Mike's discussion of the financials, he'll specifically be referring to pages three and four of the supplemental. On today's call, we'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures as we talk about our performance. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures that we consider most comparable can be found in the press release and supplemental schedules on our website. And finally, a reminder that statements regarding future performance of the company made during this call are forward-looking and, therefore, subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from historical, expected or projected results due to a variety of factors. Please refer to Bemis company's regular SEC filings, including the most recently filed Form 10-K to review these risk factors. Now, I'll turn the call over to Bill Austen. William Austen : Thank you, Erin, and good morning, everyone. As I reflect over the last few years of leading Bemis, I am proud of the progress we've made. Every day has been a critical step toward reshaping this company's culture toward high performance. A culture that's first passion for meeting our long-term objectives, while holding ourselves accountable. Ice-T and feel the change, and we've been seeing the results in our financial performance. We've increased operating margins and ROIC. We've been still disciplined in product development and performance management, and in our capital spending process, just to name a few. We've wisely invested capital to support growth and efficiency. We've acquired two businesses with great strategic fit, and most importantly, we are not finished. Specific to our second quarter, I view the financial results as just okay. Quarters have ups and downs, but our focus and drive at Bemis is to create long-term sustainable shareholder value. In our U.S. business this quarter, sales volumes were up approximately 1%, with a higher portion of sales from less differentiated products, a clear indication that our asset recapitalization program is helping us to be competitive in areas, where we hadn't been in years. As we move ahead, we will continue to recapitalize converting assets that'll allow us to improve margins in our less differentiated business, while also delivering innovation. In our global business this quarter, sales volumes were also up approximately 1%, with particular strength in healthcare packaging. Operationally, we made progress and improved sequentially from the first quarter, specifically at our expanded healthcare facility in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. As you recall during the first quarter, earnings lagged by $0.02, due to the learning curve associated with doubling the workforce. During the second quarter, we made operational progress in training new hires, but the expense of duplicative workforce required for training and waste from the learning curve continued, reducing earnings another $0.02. My view is that this full rate of expense will continue through the third quarter and we will come out of it during the fourth quarter. Our team at the Oshkosh Healthcare facility is focused on creating quality products to meet customer demands and that will remain our priority in the short-term and long-term. Related to the operational issues in Latin America from the first quarter, as you recall, we didn't react to short-term order patterns in our rigid plastic Rigid Plastic business by properly reducing costs. During the second quarter order patterns recovered, our cost structure was properly utilized, and there was minimal adverse impact to profit. Stepping back for a minute, over the last year our profits in local currency have been relatively untouched by the struggling Latin American economies. Our customers continued innovating high technology packages, and we've done a great job passing through inflation to our customers. Now as consumers' disposable income continues to be stretched due to the impact of the prolonged economic environment in Latin America, our business is beginning to feel the effects. While our product portfolio serves basic needs for consumers, we've started to see a mix shift from higher price point products to those with lower price points. Yogurt is a prime example. While total demand for yogurt packaging in the quarter was strong, we are starting to see some customer shift to simpler style packages, instead of the high end pre-made cups for drinkable yogurt, we saw more demand for films using simpler, traditional packages for yogurt. With the potential impact of this shift in mind, we took a hard look at the capacity in the region. The Emplal acquisition came with modern and efficient facilities that provide us the opportunity to consolidate production. Beyond the original Emplal synergy plan to close one legacy facility, we initiated a larger effort in which we'll close a total of four legacy plants in the region. We are taking action in order to maintain our leadership in the region and to ensure that we will meet our original target of 10% plus operating margins in our global packaging segment. Latin America is and will continue to be an important part of our portfolio as the local economy recovers, our business will continue to be well-positioned with the right products, management team and asset base. A quick update on our most recent acquisitions SteriPack. Our teams have started working together to familiarize our businesses and learn from each other. We are finding the SteriPack business to be very strong from both an operational and leadership perspective. Our teams will continue to work over the next year to qualify Bemis Films with our SteriPack customer base. In the interim I'm pleased that the acquired business contributed to second quarter earnings, so we're off to a great start. We will continue to build a combined Bemis Healthcare packaging business that is stronger, more customers centric and more profitable as we move forward. Turning to the topic of guidance. We confirm our EPS range of $2.68 to $2.78. This considers today's currency exchange rates, the continued expense in global packaging related to the Oshkosh Healthcare facility, and our views of the balance of the year in Latin America. In relation to volumes in the business, my view hasn't meaningfully changed. In the U.S., I feel good about 1% plus for the full year. And in our global business, my view is that Latin America will be slightly up and the balance of the globe will average in the 4% range. In summary, I remain very confident in our long-term health of our business, in our ability to adapt, and in our drive to create long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for his comments on the financials. Michael Clauer : Thanks, Bill, and good morning. BMS' adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $0.67 per share, flat with last year. Currency translation decreased EPS by approximately $0.02 versus one year ago, primarily driven by currencies in Latin America that devalued against the dollar. From a total company perspective, gross margins was down during the quarter at 21.2%. About 30 basis points of this decline resulted from continued inefficiencies at our Oshkosh healthcare facility. On a year-over-year basis, sales mix in the U.S. trended toward our less differentiated business, which is a natural outcome of the asset recapitalization program. Nonetheless, we continue to expect gross profit to improve over long-term. Looking at slide three, some detail on U.S. Packaging. Sales dollars in our U.S. segment declined by 3.4% over the prior year. Unit volumes increased about 1% during the second quarter versus the prior year. The decline in sales dollars was driven by contractual price reductions to pass through lower raw material costs, which is neutral to profit, along with a lower sales mix from less differentiated products. U.S. Packaging operating profit return on sales was 15.4% compared to 14.8% last year. About half of this margin improvement was mass related to resin pasture. As I've said before, we do not consider this mass improvement when judging ourselves against our long-term targets of 15% to 18% in this segment. We will continue our strategic efforts to drive margins in the long-term regardless of what happens to raw material prices. The remainder of the improvement in margins this quarter was driven by manufacturing efficiencies from our asset recapitalization program. Our margin performance in the U.S. was a bit lower than expected, however, we continue to expect the full year 2016 to provide approximately 70 basis points of real improvement over the prior year, which is on pace toward our long-term targets. Turning to slide four, and our Global Packaging segment. Sales dollars were up 4.4% over the prior year. Currency translation reduced sales by 12.6% driven by currencies in Latin America that devalued against the U.S. dollar versus the prior second quarter. The acquisitions of Emplal and SteriPack contributed about 7.7% increase in sales over the prior year. Excluding the impact of currencies and acquisitions, our global segment delivered organic sales growth of 9.3% this quarter versus the prior year, which reflects a unit volume increase of 1% along with overall selling price and mix increases. Before turning to adjusted operating profits in Global Packaging, I will discuss the restructuring program we initiated this quarter. As bill mentioned, we looked extensively at our manufacturing footprint in Latin America and determined that we could close four facilities, which is more than the original synergy plan associated with our Emplal acquisition. The total program will cost between $28 million and $30 million through 2017. Approximately two-thirds of the total program costs are employee related and our primarily severance costs for the elimination of 1,100 jobs that will take place at the four facilities we are closing. When the program is over the net reduction in employees will be approximately 700 as we hire additional direct labor to support the transferred volume. The remaining one-third of the total program cost consists of a variety of other items including asset related costs, reinstallation costs and legal costs. From a cash flow perspective, approximately $10 million of the total program cost will impact 2016, less than $1 million flow through Q2 and the remainder will flow equally through the remaining quarters. Beyond the program cost, we will also invest $10 million to $12 million of capital to effect these integrations which will be absorbed in our normal annual CapEx spend. Cost reductions from this program will be approximately $16 million, that total includes our original estimate of $7 million to $8 million related to the Emplal synergies. Adjusted Global Packaging operating profit return on sales was 8% compared to 8.1% last year. Currency translation negatively impacted operating profits by $2.6 million or about $0.02 of the total company earnings per share, compared to the prior year. As Bill mentioned our Oshkosh healthcare facility pulled down earnings, another $0.02 during the second quarter due to continued operational inefficiencies that we had anticipated. Without that drag, Global Packaging operating profits would have been up nicely as a result of strong sales mix during the quarter. Moving to Bemis consolidated results. Total company SG&A expense in the second quarter was $100.4 million as compared to hundred and $103.9 million last year. While recognize, inflation and currency can impact this line, over the long-term I continue to expect SG&A dollars to be flat. Specific to this year, I anticipate SG&A dollars be down on a year-over-year basis in the second half of the year. The income tax rate for the second quarter was 32.7% in line with our expectations of full year tax rate of approximately 33%. Looking next at return on invested capital. In the second quarter, ROIC increased to 10.4% compared 10% last year in Q2. Current year ROIC would be slightly higher, if not for the expected near term impact related to Emplal acquisitions. Simply put, investment capital has [indiscernible] calculation while a full year earnings and synergies have not. We continue to expect this metric to improve year-over-year toward our long-term goal of being in the upper quartile of our peer group. Operating cash flow for the second quarter totaled $100 million less than my expectation by $50 million due to the timing of collecting accounts receivable related to financing programs we have implement with our customers on contract renewals that will be recovered in Q3. We are reducing full year cash flow from ops guidance to $425 million to $465 million due impart to the $10 million of restructuring. Our original expectation was that payables were delivered $50 million to $75 million of working capital improvement this year. I will reduce that expectation by $25 million for the current year. However, we will continue to push on this initiative and expect the difference to be recovered in 2017. Turning to EPS guidance, we continue to expect adjusted EPS for 2016 in the range of $2.68 to $2.78, where we perform within this range will depend on currency movement in rest of the year, the speed of operational improvements at our Oshkosh Healthcare facility, volume and mix across our businesses, and the pace of implementing our restructuring program. With that, I'll turn the call over for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go ahead and take our first questions from George Staphos with Bank of America. Your line is open. George Staphos : Hi, everyone. Good afternoon or good morning, depending on where you are. A couple of questions. First of all, Mike or Bill, can you talk a bit about why U.S. performance is maybe a little bit below your expectations if you had mentioned, I had missed it. And then, second question, as far as Oshkosh, I seem to remember that you had assumed the inefficiencies would last the second quarter, and you'd be on a more normal plane, maybe not all the way back, but more normal in the third quarter. It sounds to some degree like that's been pushed back a bit. If that's true, why is that the case? Thanks. William Austen : George, this is Bill. I'll take \u2013 I'll start with the Oshkosh healthcare piece first. We look at five pieces as being critical to that facility forward, manufacturing output, staffing quality of the product we produced waste and service levels. All of those metrics sequentially have improved from Q1 to Q2. Manufacturing output is up, we're staffed, quality continues to improve and we've implemented procedures that people sign off on the quality of the product before they move it to the next station. Waste continues to trend at a higher level than we had anticipated moving out of Q1 to Q2. And, our service levels are continuing to improve. We were overly aggressive when we thought we could move the needle faster coming out Q1 to Q2. We were not able to achieve those rates. So it's being pushed through to Q4. However, all of those five key metrics that we look at are continuing to improve and get better as we go forward. The first question you had was \u2013 was there anything in U.S. packaging that really caused us concern in Q1 \u2013 Q2 rather. The answer is no. We don't look at quarter-to-quarter basis. If we look at our operating profit \u2013 if we look at our margin improvements on a full year basis year-to-date, we've improved operating margins there 80 basis points to 90 basis points for the first half of the year. We don't look at things on a quarter-to -quarter basis that way. The business is moving in the direction that we have anticipated. So, we don't see any unusuals there happening in Q2. Operator : And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Your line is open. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. Just following up on U.S. packaging. I think you had two customer losses that you lapped in the quarter or maybe early 3Q. Can you just remind us the timing of that? Does your outlook still expect kind of 2% volume growth in the U.S. in the second half and if you've seen any kind of inflection point early in the quarter. William Austen : Hi, Anthony, this is Bill. Yes, we lapped those two losses in the quarter and as I said in my remarks, we see U.S. packaging 1% plus growth in the back half of the year. What we've talked about at the start of the year was the second half would always be better than the first half and that view has not changed. We will see a better second half in volumes than we saw in the first half. And the first half volumes were plus the half in U.S. packaging. Operator : And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Your line is open. Ghansham Panjabi : Hey, guys. Good morning. William Austen : Morning. Michael Clauer : Morning. Ghansham Panjabi : Hey, I guess, switching to Latin America and the announced restructuring, does that lower your production footprint in the region, or you just consolidating towards more efficient facilities? I guess what should we take away from your long-term view on the region with this announcement. And also are you shedding any customers as part of that? William Austen : Sure. George, this is Bill. We step back for a minute, and we looked at the \u2013 the overall situation in the region. Unemployment 11% a year ago it was 8.5%, inflation 9.5% versus about 9.5% a year ago. GDP at negative 3.5%, the prolonged economic environment caused us to step back and take a look at what was going on in the region. What we're doing is we're taking out less efficient, smaller, older legacy facilities that we had within the Bemis portfolio now that we've acquired Emplal, which has got newer, bigger more modern facilities along with more modern equipment. So all we're doing is, taking out older legacy Bemis plans, consolidating and moving that volume to the newer more efficient facilities at Emplal that we acquired. We're also putting a little bit of a footprint onto one of the newer Emplal plants to absorb some of the equipment that we will move. So, no losses of customers, no loss of volume, much more efficient operation when this is all over, and we're doing this to continue to be the leader in the region and to be stronger as we move forward. Operator : And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Please go ahead. Scott Gaffner : Thanks. Good morning. William Austen : Hello, Scott. Scott Gaffner : Mike, just wanted to talk about the increase or the decrease in working capital improvements for 2016. Can you give us a little bit more details what's going on with the payables there and what gives you comfort that you get it back in 2017? Michael Clauer : What we have done, Scott, is we have implemented basically supplier financing for our kind of Tier 2 and Tier 3 suppliers. And I just believe the traction of getting that implemented is not at the pace that we originally anticipated. I do not at all believe the pace, the targets were unachievable or unrealistic, is just the pace of getting the implementations made. Operator : And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Brian Maguire : Hey, good morning, guys, thanks for taking question. Just a question on the negative mix in U.S. Packaging, you alluded to \u2013 and I take it to me that was related to the asset recapitalization program you've been doing. So it sounds like the volumes have been growing a little bit faster in some of the less differentiated markets, how does that impact margins overall and as you think about the capital investments, does that lead to a drag on return on capital down the road as \u2013 you have to try and sell more or the less differentiated products that are a little bit lower margin than the overall business? Thanks. William Austen : Now we take a longer term view on that, so if we look at our \u2013 if we look at our margin as I said on a year-to-date basis this year, it's 80 basis points to 90 basis point improvement in U.S. Packaging. It's tough to look at it at a 19 day window, you have to take a longer view of where those margins are headed and the visibility we have with our innovation pipeline, projects that we have in place that we're recapitalizing on today, all of our projects that go into the recap program have to have a minimum 15% return on invested capital over a five-year average. So, nothing has changed in our view, nothing has changed in our process, we continue on the same track that we've been on. Operator : And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Adam Josephson : Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. Bill, just one on the margin expansion. So, you've obviously generated substantial margin expansion over the past year and a half, but over that period, your EBITDA is flat. So what do you focus more on margin expansion or growing EBITDA and why? Michael Clauer : This is Mike. I'll take that question. Clearly, our primary focus is EBITDA. We want to grow EBITDA dollars, in fact from an internal metric perspective, we have added that, so in addition to ROIC and return on sales, we now measure and compensate based on EBITDA. So, it dollars so that's the future and I hope that kind of answers your question. You want both, but from an overall perspective, we would much rather see EBITDA dollars increasing. William Austen : Adam, I'll just add on to that, why didn't we make the shift. We had ROS as a metric in our incentive plan a year ago, because we wanted to improve the quality of our business, which is get it back to the margin rates we were at several years ago. We are succeeding to do that, now we've put EBITDA dollars as part of our incentive plan. Operator : And we'll go ahead and take next question from Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Mark Wilde : Good morning Bill, Mike, and Arun. William Austen : Good morning. Michael Clauer : Hey, Mark. Mark Wilde : Just a couple of things on Brazil. One, can you talk about the business impact of customers going to these lower cost kind of simpler forms of packaging. Because it seems like one of the things you've been doing down there is trying to move people in the other direction to kind of higher value-added and then if you could also just talk about sort of any lags in terms of really implementing restructuring down in Brazil. I don't know what the rules are in terms of severance and things like that? William Austen : Sure. It's a good question, Mark. On the rigid side of things, we are \u2013 we're the leader in rigid packaging, whether it's the less differentiated type of material or the higher value-add, the drinkable yogurt cups for instance. We added that to the portfolio. We've always been there in the less differentiated product as well. So, it's really just shifting the mix of higher value-added came down because consumers valuing down. We just made more of the less differentiated type of materials. We still had a very good quarter from yogurt perspective. So we don't see that as being a problem. Mark Wilde : Any lags of implementing the restructure... William Austen : Oh, I'm sorry, the lags of implementing. Michael Clauer : No, regulations are pretty [indiscernible]. William Austen : They are very, very open and clear and there should be no lag.. It's already phased out and scheduled to go. Operator : And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Arun Viswanathan, your line is open, with RBC Capital. Arun Viswanathan : Hey, thanks. Good morning. I guess, wanted to understand you are making some changes to your Outlook. So, what gives you the confidence, maybe you can just differentiate between those things under your control, both in U.S. and Global Packaging versus your innovation pipeline. If you were to look at U.S. packaging, if that accelerates from the 1%. If you get into the mid-single-digit range, how much of that is under your control and how much of it is market dependent and similarly on the Global Packaging side, how would you parse that out? William Austen : Arun, you're questioning the volume, going forward? Arun Viswanathan : Correct. Mainly volume. William Austen : Okay. Yeah. We have a very robust pipeline at this point of projects that are customer driven on innovation. And we have a pipeline of recapitalization projects that's very robust and already in play. So we're confident in our second half volumes being better than first half as we've said and as we go forward those recap projects just continue to allow us to be more competitive in the non-differentiated product. So, we have visibility to volume growth there as well. Operator : And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Chris Manuel : Good morning or good afternoon, folks. Thank you for taking the question. I kind of wanted to follow-up on the kind of business recapitalization process and where you are in that process, but kind of as a transition into that I mean your volumes got better here at least in North America got better 1Q \u2013 2Q versus 1Q, so it looks like you are seeing some modest acceleration. And I guess, the way I'm coming at this is how are you doing some of the business recap stuff is it mainly as products come up for renewal, and it's a new contract or you in fact kind of going back looking at some of the business you have today saying, hey, let's go out and extend some contracts and maybe try to take some cost out of manufacturing and up to your things in the process, how are you doing that and then how far in the process are you with respect to you addressed how would I think about it, how much of the portfolio you've addressed with that? William Austen : Right. Hey, Chris this is Bill. The recap program is completely driven by ourselves of the assets we have in place today. We know what the age of the equipment is, how it runs, the waste it creates, the length, the time it takes to change over. That's all within our preview, we have that and that's how we recap. We have volume running across those machines today if we can put in an asset that takes one to take out two that's what drives the asset recap program. It's not contract driven, it's not contract specific, it's asset specific. Michael Clauer : And then, he asked how far we're along in the process [indiscernible]. William Austen : Well, we're phasing in, in overtime, Chris. We have 27 plants in the network in North America. And there is a lot of assets in those plants that \u2013 a lot of opportunity for us to continue to push forward on. Chris Manuel : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Jason Freuchtel with SunTrust. Your line is open. Jason Freuchtel : Hey, good afternoon. Can you quantify any benefits from innovation you saw in the quarter, and how much of your volume growth expectations are driven by innovation in the back half of the year in the U.S. Packaging segment? And then lastly, do you still expect to generate higher profitability in 2017 from implementing pricing analytics? William Austen : Sure. Jason, for the first part of your question, when we look at our two segments, we would see Global Packaging as where the innovation would have come from in the quarter, we had some good mix there. In our U.S. business, that was really more so a function of asset recap that help to bump up margins a little bit. Second piece of your question was? Sorry, can you give us a second piece of your question again, Jason? Jason Freuchtel : Sure. Do you still expect to generate higher profitability in 2017 from implementing pricing analytics? William Austen : Jason, this is Bill. Pricing analytics is a long-term \u2013 a long-term view. It will \u2013 we will start to see the benefits of that in 2017. Jason Freuchtel : Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Philip Ng with Jefferies. Your line is open. Philip Ng : Hey, guys. I guess, packaged food volumes for the U.S. has generally been pretty muted for some time now. With growth coming more from the fresh and organic side of things, particularly from some of the smaller private label guys or co-packers, are you doing anything different to target this market and with some of the investments that you've made, what allow you better service customer base? Thanks. William Austen : Yes, Phil, we're, part of the asset \u2013 not part of, but asset recapitalization allows us to attack that pieces of the market, the afresh trend if you will, because it's usually shorter runs, quicker changeovers are required, better service to customers and these newer assets, clearly help us do that, which the older legacy facilities just couldn't handle. Operator : And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Chip Dillon with Vertical. Your line is open. Chip Dillon : Yes, hi. Good morning, good afternoon. First question is really dealing with the reduced working capital sourcing this year, and wanted to know how \u2013 I think you mentioned it was mostly inventory related, but maybe part of it was receivables. But could you talk about how that has gone from being down $50 million to $70 million to just down $25 million this year? Michael Clauer : Yes. I can answer that. As I mentioned it, the target was to reduce improved days payable outstanding, which would add $50 million to $75 million of working capital benefit in the current year. We are absolutely doing that, however not at the pace that we had expected. And so I think we'll get $25 million to $50 million of it not $50 million to $75 million, but we still are going to target getting the entire $50 million to $75 million range. It will just spill into $70 million. Chip Dillon : Okay. Got you. And also just a quick follow-up if I could. Could you -you mentioned, I know in the first half of the year, there were sort of a $10 million per quarter headwind from the issues with Brazil and also in the new plant. Did you say that those headwinds would continue into the third quarter? I think you did, but could you just reiterate how much of an impact you think you'll get in the third quarter? And does that, it should have been done by then? William Austen : Yes, Chip. This is Bill. You were correct on the first quarter. However, we don't see the headwind from the Latin American piece of that. We only see the headwind from the Oshkosh healthcare facility piece going through Q3 and minimizing it in Q4. Operator : And we'll go ahead and take our next question from George Staphos with Bank of America. Go ahead. George Staphos : Hi, everyone. And apologies, before I took two questions. That was in two question from the last conference call. I guess, my next question and Bill, I wasn't trying to say or ask whether you are concerned at all, about U.S. packaging in the quarter, but I did think, I heard you say, that performance was less than what you had anticipated. So, if I was correct in that and that's the right premise. What was trending a little bit, below your expectations, recognizing again 90 days isn't an eternity? William Austen : Yeah. George. It's just might being built, where I think, these guys can perform better, they did a nice job, but hey, nice doesn't cut it, they have to do better and I expected them to do better. We don't \u2013 as you said already, we don't measure things in 90 day increments, we look over the long-term, but I thought those guys could have performed at a little bit higher pace. George Staphos : Fair enough. Operator : And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Adam Josephson : Thanks. Bill, just one more on emerging or merger market strategy broadly. I mean, are you concerned at all that you could have something similar happened in another of your emerging markets, in other words the economic conditions in another market were to deteriorate and need to have to do another restructuring. I mean, what gives you confidence that you have the right strategy in emerging markets in light of this development? William Austen : Right. Adam, if you look at our Brazilian footprint or Latin American footprint, it's pretty big, right. If you go to the other emerging markets, we have the small footprint, where we're much more contained, much smaller, more focused on some end markets in the other emerging markets. So, Brazil was just a big exposure, we had a lot of older legacy facilities in and around Brazil. In our other emerging markets, we have much more newer, more modern facilities, and they're much more efficient. So, this was our opportunity to continue to be the leader in that region of the world. We're continuing to do well, we're continuing to do all the things we should be doing down there, now is the time to restructure as we looked at what the longer-term picture is going to look like for that economy. Operator : And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Debbie Jones : Hi. Thank you for getting me in the queue here. My first question is, Mike, what gives you the confidence that you can get that payable benefits in 2017, and then can you just talk about the potential for some benefits from inventory as well in 2017, I think that you've been talking about the SAP program driving that? Michael Clauer : Yeah. What gives me the confidence is the discipline we're instilling in this company. This is ours to get. There is absolutely no reason to get it. We have other packaging companies that we can look at their metrics and they have them, so we're not any different than anybody else. So that's what gives me the confidence and the fact that we're going to stay focused on it relentlessly. As far as 2017, what we've talked about in the past is, as we get more and more of our facilities on our common ERP platform. We are also introducing demand forecasting and scheduling that is starting to get introduced right now, and the intention of those systems processes are really to if you think through it's really to reduce with. So, it's really to get better at forecasting and scheduling your plants that allows you to kind of move your lead times down, which lead to a reduction of work-in-process. Operator : And we'll go ahead and take our next question from George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead. George Staphos : Thanks. Hi, guys. As we think about the three broader categories that are driving, we expect improvement and return for you. So, we have the recap program, we have innovation and we know we have pricing analytics. Is there way to recognizing that, you don't have discrete stoppages and beginnings with these programs per se. So, way to maybe tell us where you're on the timeline for each of them. So, the recap program is a making this up now? A third done and you have another two thirds to go and similar type of discussion on the other programs related to your longer-term goal. And then relation back to \u2013 I think maybe it was Adam's question on the volume with innovation kicking in why aren't you seeing closer to the 2% goal I think you had had for the second half and looking out? Thank you. William Austen : Yeah, George. We've always had a history of innovating, right. And we've always innovated at what we would call the high-end the high barrier end of things. What's occurring now is the company continues to change and move forward and drive toward high performances, the whole process or recapitalization and innovation all start to blend together. The recapitalization projects allow us to bring innovation to customer that we hadn't dealt with before. Innovation is now being driven across the big middle of the packaging space for us because we're dealing with customers that we hadn't served for the last three years four years, because we walked away from business because the margins were too low. Well now, we're back in there, bringing innovation to bakery customers. We're in there bringing innovation to health and hygiene customers that we had not served for the past few years. So, we're going to start to see a big blending of these three buckets or the two buckets of innovation and recap. And pricing analytics we're just starting on that journey, we're just getting into that now. We're going to start to see those impacts helping us in 2017. But as far as innovation and recap, they are all co-mingled as we're going forward here, because one feeds the other. Michael Clauer : George, the second part of your question, I think may have been about volumes and just to reconfirm in the U.S. our view is still that the full year for 2016 would be at that one plus range, which to your point means heavier in the back half of the year. So, hopefully that helps clarify. Operator : And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Mark Wilde : Yeah. Bill I want to just come back to comment you made about the global volumes were you said Brazil was going to be weak, but you get 4% in the other pieces of the global business, but I just wonder with Brazil being such a large part of the global business. Can you really hit the kind of 4% global overall target that you've set out there, kind of now I think the 2019 if Brazil remains weak? William Austen : We think we can Mark, because of obviously organic growth in some of the other areas is going to be higher than that 4%. We've got some really nice, very significant growth in our healthcare business and we're going to continue to push on that and that's on the organic side of things in the double-digit range. So, we think we can offset that \u2013 some of that weakness in Latin America with much higher growth rates in some of the other segments. Mark Wilde : Okay. And if I could there is a follow on. Could you just talk, maybe Mike, about sort of where you are at with acquisitions right now? I think in the past you have talked about sort of BNDN regions and you've talked about Central and Eastern Europe and you've been growing I think over in China. So, if you could just maybe update us on where you stand in that process? William Austen : Yeah. We still have sort of better term of good pipeline. We've got some interesting things we are working on directly, we are aware of some kind of interesting type investments that could be coming to the market later this year. It's same old markets. It's still in Eastern Europe. In the U.S., looking at things that could have a lot of synergies with them. Not a lot going on right now down in Latin America. I mean I think the way we look at it, we're not going to tax a management team and I think the people or groups down in Latin America have the hands full with restructuring and the integration of Emplal also it would not be an [indiscernible] best interest or those to probably add anything there for the next year or so. So, again I think things continue to move forward. I'm excited about some of things that they are in \u2013 that we're looking at but nothing imminent at this point in time. Operator : And we will take your next question from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Arun Viswanathan : So I just wanted to understand make sure I got this right. So in the second quarter, there was a negative price mix from the contractual pass through of lower raw materials in U.S. packaging, has that kind of fully flowed through? I know resin costs were actually up in Q2 on an index basis, I guess, what you expect in Q3, Q4 if resin is flat or what you would be modeling? William Austen : We don't forecast the resin pass through numbers on a go forward basis, Arun. So it'll shake out to be what happens during each of those quarters as it's comp versus the prior year. So to answer your question on second quarter, in the U.S., the resin pass through was a couple of points on that top line revenue just passing through contractual differences versus the prior year. Arun Viswanathan : But it didn't have any effect on income then. William Austen : Correct, you're correct. Michael Clauer : And that's how we would look forward as if you're modeling, as you can assume whatever you want with resin. Our assumption and our experience has been that we don't get hurt or helped with that pass through. Arun Viswanathan : Great. And then on the global side, similarly it was just the sales of the lower sophisticated products, I guess, that affected to the sales, the top line and... Michael Clauer : In global... Arun Viswanathan : ...impact Michael Clauer : Yeah, in global, there is a few things going on there. So if you pull out the currency effect, which decreases your top line, you have a positive effect from acquisition and you're left with organic growth, price volume mix positive 9%. And that's really a couple of things, you've got unit volumes up 1%, you've got some inflation that passes through, and then we're left with positive price mix in the global business during the second quarter, and you can think of that a good chunk of that is going to be your Healthcare business that was quite strong in the quarter. Operator : And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Adam Josephson : Thanks a lot for taking my follow ups. Mike just one on free cash flow, it's been \u2013 it's fluctuated a fair bit over the past three years or four years, obviously and have a conversion ratio as well as has fluctuated quite a bit, net income to free cash flow, what you think to the normalized -normalized free cash or to the normalized conversion ratio is and why? Michael Clauer : Well, I mean, we've got a very specific target at working capital and that is what we're trying to get to it. I look at this year $425 million, $450 million based on current year kind of guidance and EBITDA, would be where, I would expect it to be in the group, but we still feel we've got some improvement opportunities, but I'd like to get to the point, I mean, first of all I love it when we start growing, and there will be a little bit of working capital load, but I'd like to start assuming the way we should think about it is, EBITDA minus kind of and a cash taxes and cash interest is what you should expect from us. I hope that helps answer your question. Adam Josephson : Sure. Thanks, Mike. And just one last one on resin appreciating that fluctuations and resins don't have a meaningful impact on your EBITDA, do you have a view as to what impact the additional polyethylene capacity that's being added in North America will have on domestic polyethylene prices overt thee next year or two years? William Austen : Adam, this is Bill. This is just my view. I don't think there is going to be any impact downward on polyethylene prices in United States from the added capacity. Just my view, these guys do a great job of managing that capacity around the world, taking out older assets that are less efficient, running a more efficient assets and maintaining that balance between demand and supply. Adam Josephson : Thanks a lot, Bill. Appreciate it. William Austen : Yeah. You're welcome. Operator : And we'll go ahead and take our next question from George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead. George Staphos : Hi, everyone. Last one from me. Just as we think about the impact of the new ERP system, Mike, is any of that showing up in your working capital performance this year? How would that phase in? And recognizing that there is a risk of double accounting here, what kind of benefits do you expect to get from the ERP system in terms of working capital when the systems all implemented in the next couple of years. Thank you and good luck in the quarter. William Austen : First of all, we're getting no benefit. Right now from the implementation of the ERP platform, I think last year, we got some inventory improvement. I think that was just get rid of some bad behaviors and I really haven't given a number yet going forward, but what the people are doing the work, the people that we brought in new employees that have done it in other places, truly believe that they can get 20% to 25% of the work in process out over a period of time. And so it's probably $50 million, $75 million, $100 million that would start coming in latter part of 2017, into 2018 and 2019. Operator : And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Jason Freuchtel with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Jason Freuchtel : Hi. Thanks for taking my follow-ups. Have you seen any incremental business wins recently as a result of your new Innovation Center or how would you characterize the quantity of volumes that have \u2013 that have benefited from your Innovation Center, and does that Innovation Center serve customers, both in the U.S. and Global Packaging segments? William Austen : Yes. Jason, the tail end of that first, it's a global center. We've had customers from every region of the world, come and collaborate with us in that facility. Since the facility has been open, we've had over 200 collaboration sessions with customers in that facility either using our labs, looking our equipment, doing some things differently, having ideation sessions. We \u2013 some of the recent wins that you may have seen in the marketplace is a flexible standup pouch for salad dressings that are single-served, on the go convenience type of products. All of the protein snacking that you might see out in the marketplace today that incorporate protein, whether it comes from cheese, processed meat, or nuts and dried fruits, those have all been innovated from our center. Some of the food service applications that we've had for the food service industry for cook-in types of products have been coming out of the Innovation Center, so I mean I could go on and on. The Center is at the heart of what we do, which is focusing on the customer, bringing the customer in, helping them innovate their products, so they can get their brand off-the-shelf faster than their competitors. Jason Freuchtel : Okay. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we have no further questions at this time. William Austen : Excellent. Thank you, all for joining us today. This concludes our conference call. Operator : And that's concludes today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Erin Winters. Please go ahead. Erin Winters : Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter 2016 conference call. Today is October 27, 2016. After today's call, a replay will be available on our website, bemis.com, under the Investor Relations section. Joining me for this call today are Bemis Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Austen; our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Clauer; and our Vice President and Controller, Jerry Krempa. Following Mike and Bill's comments on our business and outlook, we'll answer any questions you have. However, in order to allow everyone the opportunity to participate, we ask that you limit yourself to one question at a time with a related follow-up and then fall back into the queue for any additional questions. At this time, I'll direct you to our website, bemis.com, under the Investor Relations tab, where you'll find our press release and supplemental schedules. In Mike's discussion of the financials, he'll specifically be referring to pages three and four of the supplemental. On today's call, we'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures as we talk about our performance. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures that we consider most comparable can be found in the press release and supplemental schedules on our website. And, finally, a reminder that statements regarding future performance of the company made during this call are forward-looking and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from historical, expected or projected results due to a variety of factors. Please refer to Bemis Company's regular SEC filings, including the most recently filed Form 10-K, to review these risk factors. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Michael Clauer : Thanks, Erin, and good morning. Before reviewing the financials, my thoughts on where our business stands. We delivered several positives this quarter, but we still have a lot of work to do to get our company where it should be and can be. Since day one of our leadership, both Bill and I have viewed the story as a long-term one. We are changing the culture of Bemis to think and act differently. That takes time. I will continue to be impatient with our progress, but I have no doubt we will get there. Frankly, it's why I came to Bemis, to win. Turning to the financials, Bemis adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.75, up almost 12% versus the prior year. Currency translation was minimal this quarter and did not impact EPS. From a total company perspective, gross margin was up slightly and adjusted EBITDA increased to $160.7 million compared to $148.4 million in the prior third quarter. This reflects our highest adjusted EBITDA since 2014 when the company footprint included the Pressure Sensitive Materials segment, a clear indication that we are improving the business. Looking at slide three, some detail on U.S. Packaging. Sales dollars in our U.S. segment declined 4.7% over the prior year. The decline in sales dollars was driven by mix of products sold, which you would expect given our asset recapitalization program, and contractual price reductions to pass-through lower raw material costs, which is neutral to profits. Unit volumes were flat versus the prior year, cleanly a miss, as we had planned for volumes to be stronger in the second half of the year. The difference versus our plans stem from commercialization delays, some driven by customers and some we caused due to internal processes being slow and cumbersome. In either event, I view this as timing that both we and our customers will work out. Bill will discuss what we're doing to understand and fix our internal issues. U.S. Packaging operating profit return on sales was 15.3% compared to 14.5% last year. 20 basis points of margin benefit reflects the math of resin pass-through over the prior year. We will continue to focus on strategic efforts to drive margins in the long-term regardless of what happens to raw material prices. The remaining 60 basis points of real improvement in margins this quarter was driven by manufacturing efficiencies from our asset recapitalization program. Turning to slide four and our Global Packaging segment. Sales dollars were up 12.6% over the prior year. Currency translation reduced sales by 6% driven by the Argentine peso and the British pound that devalued against the U.S. dollar versus the prior third quarter. The acquisitions of Emplal and SteriPack contributed a 9.9% increase in sales over the prior year. Excluding the impact of currencies and acquisitions, our Global segment delivered organic sales growth of 8.7% this quarter versus the prior year, driven by selling price and mix increases. Before discussing Global Packaging profits, an update on the restructuring program we initiated during the second quarter. As you'll recall, part of this program will be \u2013 we will close four facilities in Latin America for a total cost of $28 million to $30 million. The program will save $16 million, half of which relates to the original Emplal synergy plan and the other half will help us offset the impact of the prolonged, tough economic environment and business in Latin America. The program is on schedule thus far. We have started to move production from the largest of the four facilities that we will close to the destination facility. We continue to expect the first facility will be closed by year-end and the remaining three by the middle of 2017. Adjusted Global Packaging operating profit return on sales was 9.8% compared to 9.7% last year. You will recall that the third quarter of last year was particularly strong at almost 100 basis points above any other quarter last year. An update on our Oshkosh healthcare packaging facility. During the third quarter, we saw sequential improvement. Our expectation was a $0.02 EPS drag and we minimized that to a $0.01 in Q3. Our new workforce is at a point that they can run the equipment efficiently, but not at a point where they can drive productivity like veteran operators. As our workforce gets more comfortable with the equipment and the product specifications, they will be able to drive the additional necessary productivity during 2017. With the progress we have made, our healthcare leadership team is now in a position to start transitioning equipment and book-of-business from the Florida SteriPack location to our Oshkosh in Puerto Rico facilities for the original acquisition integration plan. Moving to Bemis consolidated results. Total company SG&A expense in the third quarter was $95.8 million as compared to $101.8 million last year. Strong cost controls and the impact of pay and performance contributed to the expense decline over last year. I continue to expect SG&A dollars to be down on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter. Looking next at return on invested capital. In the third quarter, ROIC increased to 10.6% compared to 10.3% last year in Q3. Current year return on invested capital would be slightly higher if not for the expected near-term impact related to acquisitions. We continue to expect this metric to improve over the long-term toward our goal of being in the upper quartile of our peer group. Operating cash flow for the third quarter totaled $195 point more (sic) [$195.4] (07:53) million, in line with my expectations. Nice sequential improvement as the timing of accounts receivable issues we had in Q2 worked itself out and as we've made headway and continue to extend terms of our vendors. As anticipated, restructuring was a small use of cash during the quarter, about $3 million. I continue to expect full year cash from ops to be $425 million to $465 million, which assumes a total of $25 million to $35 million benefit from continued working capital improvements and a total of $12 million used on restructuring. On September 15, we issued a $300 million bond at a fixed rate of 3.1% for 10 years. It made sense for us to take advantage of slow long-term rate and free-up some commercial paper that we had used to fund the Emplal and SteriPack acquisitions. During the third quarter, we also purchased 1 million shares of stock for $51.1 million, in line with our commitment to return free cash flow to our shareholders. Turning to the balance of the year guidance, we now expect EPS for 2016 in the range of $2.65 to $2.70 versus our previous guidance of $2.68 to $2.78. The update reflects lower volume expectations in U.S. Packaging considering the 2% shortfall in both Q3 and Q4 versus our original expectations. The midpoint of our new EPS range assumes volumes at 2% in Q4 in U.S. Packaging. Where we stand within the EPS range will depend on currency movements, volume and mix across our businesses. I will now turn the call over to Bill for his comments. William Austen : Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. As I look at the big picture, I see us moving our business in the right direction. Many of the numbers reflected were delivering strong EPS improvement, our highest levels of EBITDA in years, increasing margins and ROIC and robust cash flow. These things don't happen by accident. And I applaud the hard work of our 18,000 employees across the globe in delivering these results. Top of mind for me is our commitment to create long-term, sustainable shareholder value. To do that effectively requires every single one of our employees to be aware and engaged in the cause and armed with the tools needed to do their jobs effectively. While we've made progress, there is still work to do to drive accountability further into the organization, to deepen the sense of urgency in meeting our financial commitments, and to improve our processes and tools used to support our business goals. Let me provide you a few examples of the new ways we're strengthening our business for the long-term. First, related to our commercialization process. We have brought in an outside firm to review this process end-to-end during the fourth quarter. The commercialization delays in our U.S. business this quarter that we caused due to our internal processes being slow and cumbersome are unacceptable. I get the fact that customers sometimes are slow in ramping-up new business but when we have inefficiency in our system that's just not okay. So, we're launching this project to review all the touch points, all the weak links in the process, all the ways we can remove obstacles, so that new business can be commercialized on pace to our forecasts. Second, bringing in new people. This doesn't mean adding head count or additional SG&A costs. This means that when the opportunity or need arises, we will bring in new thinking and diverse experience from outside of Bemis to help drive change within the organization to deepen the sense of urgency and intensify our drive to win. A relevant example is the recent leadership change in our Healthcare Packaging business. After 20 plus years of dedicated and meaningful service to Bemis, the President of Healthcare Packaging business, Paul Verbeten, is retiring. Our new President of Healthcare Packaging, Jorg Schneewind, comes to Bemis with experience in the medical device industry. And I look forward to Jorg's leadership in bringing our Healthcare Business to the next level. We also welcomed a new Vice President of Operations for our Healthcare Packaging business, Chris McHugh. I look forward to the impact Chris will have on improving operational efficiencies and delivering the expected returns on the investments we've made in our Healthcare business. And the third example of ways we're supporting our business for the long-term, we're fortifying our business development initiatives. Jim Ward recently joined Bemis as Vice President of Corporate Development to strengthen and accelerate our inorganic growth strategy. Jim is a former investment banker who has spent the past several years as a Business Development Director at a large consumer packaged goods company. I'm confident that the addition of Jim will support our external commitment to grow Bemis Company revenue 3% inorganically by 2019. To be clear, I'm proud of the progress our teams across the globe have made to-date. Change continues. And I will continue to take action and do everything possible to help us deliver our long-term commitments to make Bemis successful. Turning to outlook. We do remain committed to our long-term financial objectives. Most of our metrics are moving in the right direction. However, we can't run away from the lack of volume growth in U.S. Packaging and our operational issues in Global Packaging. These two topics are front and center at our company today and resolving both is important in meeting our long-term EPS targets. While our 2016 guidance range doesn't meet our 10% EPS growth objective, we're determined to get back on track to achieving this annual target going forward. I remain very confident in the health of our business, in our drive to change the culture, and in our ability to deliver improvement. With that, I'll turn the call over for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll now take the first question from George Staphos from Bank of America. Please go ahead. George Staphos : Thanks, operator. Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for the details so far. I guess my first question is around volume. One, I just wanted to understand a little bit more clearly, Mike or Bill, what you're referring to in terms of the \u2013 I think you said 2% volume shortfall relative guidance in the third quarter and fourth quarter. And you then mentioned that, I think, the fourth quarter midpoint of your guidance assumes 2% volume growth. If I incorrectly phrase those, please correct me, otherwise if you can provide a little bit more color around that and why the 2% goal in the fourth quarter would be realistic? Thank you. Michael Clauer : George, when we gave guidance for the second half of the year, the assumption was \u2013 the forecast was we were going to have 2% volume growth in Q3 and 4% in Q4. We told \u2013 externally we watered it down and said we would be up 1.5%. We didn't hit that in Q3 and we're going down Q4 from 4% to 2%. And, again, we have a lot of visibility into what should be commercialized and be happening in Q4. George Staphos : All right. Thanks. I'll turn it over. Operator : Okay. We'll now take the next question from Anthony from Citi. Please go ahead. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. Just following-up on George's question, I was wondering if you could provide any kind of additional color on the U.S. volumes in 3Q. And externally, obviously, Nielsen volumes haven't been great. Internally, you referenced some missteps. I don't know if it's possible to kind of put a finer point on it, but how much of the volume shortfall was maybe things that you could control and how much is maybe continued tough external environment? And are there any specific categories or end markets that have been weaker than expected? William Austen : Yeah. Good morning, Anthony. This is Bill. If you were to look at in total, we would look at 60% of the misses were controllable by us, 40% were extended launches from customers that might have had an issue and a factor in a plant, a late startup related to a customer. However, that 60% were issues we had internally where we couldn't and didn't get the product launched and/or commercialized through our system. And that's why we're bringing in the external consultant. We're going to have them look at the end-to-end commercialization process that we have within the company and find out where the weak links are, where the slowdowns are, where the obstacles are, where the bottlenecks are, because we put forecast together based on commercialization dates. And if it's within our control, we've got to fix those. But nothing specific to any one segment across the landscape, just internal misses. As Mike said, we have visibility of the orders. We have visibility to what's supposed to launch. We missed \u2013 internally we missed it. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's helpful. And then, kind of, referencing some of these operational slowdowns that hit earnings this year, understanding you're not giving 2017 guidance. But when you think about Oshkosh, Latin America, some of the issues in 3Q, is there an earnings hit in 2016 that maybe you get back in 2017 or costs that don't reoccur in 2017, any kind of rough thoughts on that in terms of quantifying that? William Austen : Yeah. Anthony, this is Bill. What Mike tried to layout in his prepared remarks was our workforce is now in Oshkosh. They run the equipment effectively. What the team in healthcare was probably overly aggressive at when they put the plan together was thinking that the workforce would be able to establish the same kind of productivity that a veteran operator and veteran operators establish over a 20-year window. So, once the operators learn the product specifications, not just how to run the equipment, but how better to run each spec, that's how you drive productivity. Our team in healthcare was probably overly aggressive thinking that a new workforce would understand how to do that quicker. We're going to be able to get through that in 2017, but we're still going to be working through the productivity issues in 2017. Sequentially, that facility continues to improve, throughput is going up, quality is going up, scrap and waste are going down. Now, as the operators become more and more familiar with the product side, we'll start to drive more productivity and that will happen as we go through 2017. Operator : We'll now take the following question from Scott Gaffner from Barclays. Please go ahead. Scott Gaffner : Thanks. Good morning, guys. William Austen : Hi, Scott. Scott Gaffner : Just following up on the commercialization aspect for a minute. If I look back, I think, last year, you might have had the same sort of issue. Is there any finer point you can give on that? I know you're bringing in an outside team to take a look, but is there \u2013 I mean any more clarity you can give us on that would be really helpful. William Austen : Yeah. Scott, this is Bill. We didn't have this issue last year. We have visibility to orders. We have visibility to product launches. What we're understanding and finding out is that there is a way too many handoffs and way too many touches in the process of taking the customer order, getting it through graphics, getting it scheduled, getting it into a plant, running a truck. There is way too many touches, way too many handoffs, way too many bottleneck. That's what we're understanding and now we're bringing in the consultant to help us streamline that, take out those touches, take out those handoffs, get rid of the bottlenecks. Scott Gaffner : Okay. So, was the issue last year more around external? I mean you said the 60%/40% this year. Was it all external last year? I thought I remembered some pushback of - Michael Clauer : I think last year, Scott, some of our problems were just our customers making business decisions, which they were losing volumes in the markets. This year \u2013 we really have been \u2013 the recapitalization program has really allowed us to really kind of get some new business coming in. And I don't want you to think that all this new businesses at the top of the pyramid is - William Austen : In the big middle. Michael Clauer : It's in the big middle. And we forecast these things to start happening at a certain point in time and then they don't. And they don't because of some of our inabilities to get the stuff commercialized, meaning getting it made and getting it shipped to our customer. And that's what Bill was referring to, is that we, as outside organization, is going to come in and surgically evaluate our process and look for all the ways we can improve this process and take time out of it. Operator : We'll now take the following\u2026 Michael Clauer : Go ahead. Operator : We'll now take the following question from Ghansham Panjabi from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Mehul Dalia : Hi. Good morning. It's actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. How are you guys doing? William Austen : Very well. Thank you. Erin Winters : Good. Thanks. Mehul Dalia : Great. Going back to George's question on the 2% organic growth that you're forecasting in 4Q, is there any way to give more details on how the business is performing thus far in October or any details on what products are being commercialized successfully, just to give a little more comfort on the number especially considering that, I think, the comp is tougher in the fourth quarter than it is the third quarter \u2013 than it was in the third quarter rather? Erin Winters : Yeah. Mehul, we don't have an update on October at this point. But if we think about volumes in fourth quarter, as Mike mentioned, we have a view to the order pipeline. Our order pipeline has not changed. The orders are there. It's up to us to get these things through and commercialized. Mehul Dalia : Okay. Great. And then just your initial outlook on 2017 CapEx. Given that 2016 growth has been slower to materialize than what you're expecting, do you still think CapEx would remain around $200 million or does that number change, given what you're seeing in your business right now? William Austen : With the change in the capital deployment, CapEx deployment process that we've put in place, we're already working on 2017 CapEx now. So we anticipate around the $200 million CapEx for 2017. Michael Clauer : And if you recall the lead times, a lot of our recapitalization and growth initiatives are a year to 18 months where money spent in 2018 has pretty much already been approved and worked \u2013 2017, I'm sorry. Erin Winters : Next question? Operator : We'll now take the following question from Mark Wilde from BMO. Please go ahead. Mark Wilde : Good morning, Bill, Mike, Erin. Erin Winters : Good morning. Michael Clauer : Good morning. William Austen : Hi, Mark. Mark Wilde : I wonder maybe, Mike, if you can just help us cadencing in the benefits from the restructuring in Latin America as well as sort of the ramp-up that now sounds like it's going to carry into 2017 on the healthcare line. Michael Clauer : Well, on the restructuring, main facility will be closed by the end of the year. I think we've \u2013 assuming we're going to get about three quarters of those benefits in 2017 with one \u2013 the major facility will be effective by January 1. So that's how I would kind of think about that. And as far as healthcare is concerned, right now, we're probably in Q3. We're probably about a $1 million give or take worse than we wanted, worse than the original projections, albeit we were better. I think we're still thinking Q4 will be comparable to that. And then how I would think about next year is clearly there's some year-over-year improvement just from the standpoint we've gone from the $0.02 down to a $0.01. But that's how I kind of think about it, is maybe we get back half to two-thirds of what would be disappointing to ourself as we go through 2017. Mark Wilde : Okay. All right. I just had a couple of quick follow-ons. One, I wondered if you can talk about Brazil and Latin America more broadly, just what you're seeing right now. Because we've actually \u2013 so far this earnings season, we've heard really different points of view from different companies. We just had one company that said they saw things decelerate sharply in September. We've had other companies that have said they've sensed the bottom in Brazil and they seem to be getting more optimistic. What are you guys seeing? William Austen : Yeah. Mark, this is Bill. I was just there, spent a week down there, going through the restructuring program with the team, visited both of the plants that have been expanded. They've both been completed. We're now starting to move equipment and products from the facility that will be closed into the new facilities. There is a much \u2013 where I have been anyway, okay, and I was also spent \u2013 I had a dinner with 80 of our top customers down there. I would be on the side of there is a sense of encouragement in Brazil. I'm not going to say it's all kinds of optimism, but there is a sense that things are improving across Brazil. That's the sense I got from visiting the facilities, talking with our folks as well as meeting with 80 of our top customers. Operator : We'll now take the following question from Brian Maguire from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Maguire : Hi. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on some of the earlier questions about the commercialization delays. I think you sort of said that about 40% of it was just due to customer delays. Just wondering given the weakness in the end markets, how confident you're that those are still going to go forward or do you think customers might be reconsidering that given just some challenging consumer demand trends? William Austen : Yeah. The delays we saw initiated from customers were along the lines of new lines in their plant that were coming up, new kinds of products that they were going to be delivering to the market. They hadn't gotten those lines up to the rates they wanted. They hadn't debugged those lines yet. So that's been done through the third quarter. We're now starting to begin to ship some of those units to those new plants. So it's not a function of their end market. Brian Maguire : Okay. That's really helpful. And then just one follow-up if I could on the free cash guide, the cash from ops guide staying the same despite a little bit of a volume disappointment and a little bit lower earnings. Just could you kind of help bridge that disparity? Michael Clauer : The reason I didn't change the range is because a function of that cash is really coming from improving primary working capital. And if you really think through it your Q4 EBITDA in theory doesn't really turn into cash until Q1, give or take a month. So that's the reason I kept the guide and I'm pretty comfortable that we're going to be within that range. Brian Maguire : Okay. That helps. Thanks a lot. Operator : We'll now take the following question from Philip from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Philip Ng : Hey, guys. Sorry, to beat a dead horse. On the volumes front, obviously, it's not materializing as you had hope. Are you looking to pivot your strategy a little bit more to the recap of your assets or perhaps step-up M&A or do you still feel pretty good about your longer-term growth target to shore up some of these operational issues? William Austen : Phil, it's the latter. We feel good about the longer-term as long as we shore up the issues we have today. Philip Ng : Okay. William Austen : And we're on top on that. You should know that. We're bringing in that consultant to help us do it and we've got new leadership in the healthcare business. Philip Ng : Okay. That's helpful. And then on global volumes, I mean, that was a little weaker as well. You generally sounded constructive on Brazil, but just can you give us some color how trends progressed inter-quarter in Brazil or any color on how to think about things going in the fourth quarter? Sorry if I missed, if you've already touched upon it in your prepared remarks. Thanks. William Austen : Yeah. Let me talk a little bit about that. If you look over the first nine months of 2016, LatAm is flat, okay. So, we're doing some good things down there to maintain flat in that environment. Quarter-to-quarter some is up, some down but for the nine months it's flat. Asia Pacific is up high-single-digits and you've got Europe which is somewhat flat to down a little bit, but that's on a very small base for us. And if you look at our healthcare business, that's doing quite well, up mid-single to mid-high-digits \u2013 single-digits rather, so doing well across those environments. Brazil, due to consumption, we're maintaining a flat \u2013 we're maintaining flat volumes. Operator : Okay. We'll now take the following question from Jason Freuchtel from SunTrust. Please go ahead. Jason Freuchtel : Hey. Good morning. Just wanted to clarify the commercialization issue. I believe you indicated previously that you had good visibility on your order book from innovation. Is the 60% of the commercialization issues completely tied to new innovation volumes? And then, secondarily, should we assume the innovation volume coming online in 4Q is sequentially higher margin? William Austen : Jason, we wouldn't call out the commercialization due to innovation and/or recap. It's just business that has come in. If you look at how we look at the business today, recap drives innovation, innovation drives recap. We can run a new, innovative product across the new recapped assets. So, it's all part of the volume miss that we had in Q3 in the commercialization. It's not necessarily associated to new product or old product. And if you look at some of the recent launches that we've had that we'll carry through into Q4 and into 2017, we've been able \u2013 as we talk about becoming more of a global operating company, we have done a really nice job of starting to move specifications around the world to drive growth in our Global Packaging business quite steadily. Jason Freuchtel : Okay. Great. And then, I guess, just a follow-up on your new team and on your healthcare \u2013 your VP of operations in your healthcare franchise. How specifically is he going to help improve your operation efficiencies? Is the consulting firm going to be looking at that side of the business as well or is he just focused on the U.S. Packaging business? William Austen : Yes. The specific project we have the consulting coming in on is for the commercialization within U.S. Packaging. Operator : Okay. We'll now take the following question from Arun Viswanathan from RBC. Please go ahead. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks. I guess I had a question kind of longer-term. Some of the weakness that you saw \u2013 I understand some of it was internal, though. Are you also seeing weakness in some of your core markets, meat, cheese and bread bags? And if so, did that happen recently and what's your expectation over the next \u2013 if you look out over the next couple years in some of those core markets? William Austen : Yeah. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, we might have some customers and segments that are up, some customers that are and segments that are down. Over the longer-term, we're continuing to work the recapitalization process to drive new volume, okay. It doesn't matter to us what segment it comes in. It gives us the ability to lower the watermark on what our costs are, so we can be competitive across a wide variety of segments. Whether it's meat, cheese, dairy or bakery or confection, we're gaining volume and business. And that's why we say we have this visibility to the orders and why it's so frustrating that we can't get products commercialized because we have the orders in hand. We disappoint ourselves when that happens. We also disappoint the customer. But it's not \u2013 we look at the whole business as flexible packaging, not any one segment. Arun Viswanathan : And then, I guess, is there ways that you can increase that acceleration towards different markets, if necessary? You talked about medical packaging as a focus area at the Analyst Day, innovation in your stage gate process. What should we expect, I guess, as far as vitality index or how much of your business will be coming from new products in the future? Thanks. William Austen : Our goal is to maintain the 15% product vitality in U.S. and to continue to drive it higher in Global because we can transfer specs faster to Global to gain share. Operator : All right. We'll now take the following question from Adam Jefferson (sic) [Josephson] (35:44) from KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Adam Josephson : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Bill, just, sorry to harp on the volume issue, but obviously at the Analyst Day in last March, March of 2015, you outlined certain long-term volume growth assumptions in your U.S. business. We've seen the likes of General Mills and ConAgra post substantial volume declines in their most recent quarter and most packaged goods companies are posting pretty notable volume declines. Has the \u2013 I realize some of the wounds you experienced in the quarter were self-inflected, but has the market deteriorated to an extent that perhaps that long-term volume growth target no longer applies? William Austen : Adam, we should and can drive 2% volume going forward. We have the ability to do that. There are a lot of \u2013 there is many opportunities and businesses and segments that we are not in that we're getting into through the recapitalization efforts. It's on us to make that happen. It's about the big middle, as we talked before. The top of the triangle, a high-barrier meat/cheese, processed meats is not necessarily growing. It's the big middle where the opportunity lies in conversion from glass and cans to flexible packaging. With more and more formats coming out there all the time, some of the wins that we've had throughout this year, throughout 2016 come in that category. So, we're not going to back off and we're not going to let the team off the hook, okay, for not growing that business when we have the tools, we have the people, we've got the assets in place to make that 2% happen. Adam Josephson : Thanks, Bill. Mike, a couple for you. Just one on M&A, I know you talked about it earlier. Can you talk about some of the multiples you're seeing and consequently how attractive some of these opportunities are? Michael Clauer : There is a lot going on right now and the multiples are kind of like the public packaging companies. There's an expectation that they're up, close to 10%. And clearly for a healthcare asset, we would do that. For a packaging asset, probably not. We'd be thinking more eight times to nine times. So that's the way I kind of think about M&A. And then, with the addition of Jim, I think, we've done a pretty good job of kind of nurturing the types of companies we want to own that we know. I'm really looking forward to Jim helping us kind of understand what we don't know and where we also should be looking for potential acquisitions or joint ventures. Operator : All right. We'll now take the following question from Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Chris Manuel : Good morning or good afternoon, everyone, I guess from my time zone, but good morning where you are still. Wanted to kind of approach the question maybe from a little bit different angle and that is part of your business recap strategy has been to be able to retain chunks of the business that maybe wouldn't have been at the right return levels. How has that process gone? Meaning, are you continuing to see attrition in the base? So it sounds like you had trouble commercializing some new business, but implicit in there would also be perhaps that the base business has remained stable. And I'm trying to get a sense of it because the recap stuff has helped that process or is that also where you're still seeing some challenges as well? William Austen : Chris, the recap process has absolutely helped that, okay. If you look at some of this business that we should have commercialized in Q3, its business that we had years ago that's now coming back and we couldn't get it commercialized. If you wanted to \u2013 the picture is, is that that's the volume that should be ours and we're going to get it. We're out there getting it. We couldn't get it through our system. That's the problem. That has to get fixed. Chris Manuel : No, Bill, actually that helps bringing into a lot of focus, because you've been launching new business, new products, new segments of the market for years and years and years, but it's bringing back some of the old business that maybe you had walked away from in past years as part of the program where you're seeing the re-commercialization process. That actually brings things into focus. Could you maybe talk for a second about where you're seeing the most success in winning new business? Are there certain categories, products? You've talked about the big middle being the piece where you're seeing good stuff at, but have you also seen some new adoptions, new products in kind of your core meat, cheese, high-barrier markets as well? William Austen : Yes. The latter part, Chris, I'll talk about briefly, is that meat, cheese category, what we used to call meat, cheese. A lot of that meat, cheese now is converting to what's called snacking. We used to look at in the past snacking as salty snacks, right, crackers, chips, cookies. That's not the kind of snacking that we talk about today. Snacking today is high-barrier snacking. So it's in that top part of the triangle and it's helping us to expand margins there. And that's some of the struggles that some of our customers have had in bringing their plants up to speed to go after this new category because it's a much different package architecture and a much different product than what they are traditionally been running. So that's helping and growing the big middle in what we would call the grocery, consumer and industrial category is what's helping us to feed that volume and give us visibility to this volume that's coming that we couldn't get commercialized. And some of that is in the non-food space. Operator : We'll now take the following question from Debbie Jones from Deutsche. Please go ahead. Debbie Jones : Good morning. I just wanted to touch on \u2013 I was wondering \u2013 I think you mentioned before the working cap benefit in 2016, $25 million to $30 million. I think you referenced that some of this might move into or the initial high end of the range was at $50 million, might move into Q1. Can you just talk about that a little bit and then if you have any kind of preliminary comments on working capital for 2017 as a result? Michael Clauer : Yeah. The original working capital additional improvement we targeted was $50 million to $75 million. What I mentioned at the end of Q2 was it didn't feel like the pace we were getting that improvement was and I kind of fold it down for 2016 and said we're not giving up on it. We'll get in 2017. So at this point in time, we feel like we're going to get about $25 million to $35 million of that improvement, which still says if you go back to the original $50 million to $75 million there is an additional $25 million plus to get in 2017. And that wasn't specific on it being in Q1. It will be in 2017. Debbie Jones : Okay. Thank you. And then my next question is just a follow-up on M&A. It sounds like you're trying to be disciplined around valuation, but I'm also wondering if the production issues and the new management that you're bringing in and just kind of the restructuring effort in LatAm, does that delay any type of focus you have on M&A at this time? Michael Clauer : No. It does not at all. Debbie Jones : Okay. Thanks. I'll turn it over. Operator : We'll now take the following question from Chip Dillon, Vertical Research Partner. Please go ahead. Chip Dillon : Good afternoon and good morning. As a follow-up to Debbie's question, just as we look at the working capital, I mean, obviously we're looking at maybe $15 million plus, I think you said $25 million or so next year of improvement. Mike, if you look at the various components of these payables, inventories, receivables, where would you say you're ahead or at least further ahead versus being further behind as you look at those three elements so far? And therefore that would tell us where the opportunity is. Michael Clauer : I think we still have short-term some opportunity in payables. And that's kind of when I'm talking more about payables, when we're talking about trying to get improved \u2013 additional improved terms there. Accounts receivable, I think, we do a pretty good job there and that's one that's going to \u2013 our currency levels, percent current is very high, always has been. And then we have an opportunity in inventory, but that's more once we get onto our new ERP platform by the end of 2017. I really think that the focus of that platform as some of the tools we're putting in is to go after WIP, by taking lead times out of the business. And that will be a further opportunity for us in the U.S. Chip Dillon : Okay. And real quickly, I notice that some of the resin prices had risen in like August and September. I'm sure a lot of that is production difficulty. We know capacity is coming on. And I know you have obviously pass-through mechanisms. But is there a chance that a lag issue there could be also impacting the fourth quarter or you're not particularly worried about that? Michael Clauer : We're not \u2013 we don't particularly worry about that. Operator : We'll now take the following question from George Staphos from Bank of America. Please go ahead. George Staphos : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my follow-ons. I wanted to drill back into the volume outlook. And if we look at the narrative this year, guys, despite best intentions, you thought you're going to hit a much higher volume growth. It sounds like, to use your term, you worded down for the investment community hoping to do at least as well if not better and obviously put some cushion into the model for the unforeseen. Thus far volumes have been less than you would have anticipated. And that is what it is. So as we hear you say, you've got a 2% volume target for next year \u2013 excuse me, for this coming fourth quarter, on the one hand, you say you have it in your book of business, but you're not so sure about the commercialization, from Erin's comment earlier to one of the questions. So is the 2% the number, but can't stand a watered down to be hit? I didn't phrase that the right way. But, in other words, is there any cushion in that? Or do you \u2013 is your book of business a lot larger and that's why you have comfort on the 2%? And then I had a follow-on. William Austen : George, we have comfort on the visibility of the 2%. If you look at some of the miss that we had in Q3, it is now shipping in Q4 because we missed it in Q3. So, we have comfort on the 2%. It's still an aggressive number for the team to make, but you're not going to let them off the hook. They've got plans in place to continue to run, to get that volume out. George Staphos : So, should I read there then there is not much cushion in your business model should something run afoul of your plans or you feel you have a little bit of cushion to be able to make that 2%, even though you said it's fairly aggressive to use again your wording, Bill? Michael Clauer : I said the 2% is the midpoint of our range, okay. So, you can make an assumption there that the bottom end is probably flat and the upper end is better than 2%. Operator : All right. [Operator Instructions] We'll now take the next question from Adam Josephson from KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Adam Josephson : Thanks. Mike, I think, Mark touched on this earlier, but can you try to quantify the hopefully one-time EBIT drags from Oshkosh and the Latin American restructuring program that presumably won't recur next year, just on the EBIT line? Michael Clauer : On Brazil, I can't remember. It was - Erin Winters : $0.04. Michael Clauer : It was about $0.04, would be about $6 million of OP. Assuming that everything else is constant that would be the number. And then in healthcare I believe the number is $8 million to $9 million for the year. And I think my comment would be and I think we're probably comfortable that we're going to at least get half of that back next year. Adam Josephson : Half of that is $15 million or so? Michael Clauer : Everything else constant, right. There is other puts and takes that are always going to hit any business. Adam Josephson : And just one more. Based on the bond issuance, what would you expect to happen in interest expense next year? Michael Clauer : That would go up. Commercial paper was at, what, 80 basis points at 3% on $300 million, so you can do that math. It's, what, $4 million, something like that. Adam Josephson : Okay. Thanks, Mike. Michael Clauer : You're welcome. Operator : We'll now take the following question from George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. George Staphos : Thanks, guys. Just trying to go in sequence here. I guess my last question is how sustainable is the reduction that we've seen in SG&A and corporate and recognizing that you'll probably say that you feel pretty good about it, in light of also the need to continue to commercialize, hit the market, try to more effectively grow top-line? Should the third quarter trend that we've seen be sustained a lot of your volume growth expectations? Thanks guys and good luck in the quarter. Michael Clauer : I can answer that. I mean we're going to stick with what we've been saying all along. We are trying to figure out how to hold SG&A dollars flat over a long period of time. And don't make an assumption that the commercialization process is a function of not enough people. It could be a function of too many people. So, that's how I kind of look at it. We're not going to shortcut anything, but I'm not a big believer that everything is always about more. Sometimes it's less, improves the process. George Staphos : Okay. Thank you, Mike. Michael Clauer : You're welcome, George. Operator : We'll now take the following question from Mark Wilde from BMO. Please go ahead. Mark Wilde : I've just got a couple of pretty simple follow-ons. Mike, can you give us some sense of what the benefit would have been \u2013 is going to be this year from the healthcare-related acquisitions that you've made? And then, Bill, I wondered if you could just talk about sort of lessons learned from this whole Oshkosh situation over the last year because it seems to me if we look back in time, you've shutdown facilities before and kind of rationalized production. So it's a little hard for me outside to figure out why this particular one has been quite so difficult for you? William Austen : Sure. I'll answer that one first, Mark. We have shut facilities down. We've doubled the size of the workforce in this one facility. We did it at a time when the labor force in this area just got squeezed tremendously. And we've waited through the building process, meaning expanding, doubling the size of the plant to bring the workforce in towards the tail end of the facility being completed. In hindsight, we should have backed that up several months to bring labor in sooner, send them to the facility that was being closed, to get trained at the facility that was being closed. We had some issues with union, non-union. We didn't want to do that. But in hindsight, we probably should have done that anyway. We brought in some totally new equipment at a time when labor was extremely tight. And we could not get qualified labor to stick around and run the new equipment. Hindsight, lesson learned, bring the labor in quicker, get him to the facility that you're bringing down to train and learn ahead of schedule. Mark Wilde : Okay. That's fair. And, Mike, on those acquisitions? Michael Clauer : Yeah. Well, the one acquisition is SteriPack. William Austen : Yeah. Michael Clauer : And it's a little \u2013 for the full year, it's in the neighborhood of about $0.03 a share is the benefit. And we haven't really gotten a lot of synergies yet because of the time it takes to get things qualified. I'm going to have to qualify a piece of equipment in Puerto Rico and move it there. So those benefits are coming next year. And if you recall, we did not acquire the plant in Florida or the plant in Malaysia. What we did is we signed a transition service agreement where they make it for us and ship it. Mark Wilde : Yeah. Michael Clauer : And at one point in time unless we move the equipment we get that benefit and that will be occurring as we go through next year. Mark Wilde : Okay. Fine. That's good. Thank you. Michael Clauer : You're welcome. William Austen : Thanks, Mark. Operator : It appear there is no further question at this time. Ms. Winters, I would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Erin Winters : Thank you. This concludes our conference call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our conference call for today. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Erin Winters, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Erin Winters : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2016 conference call. Today is January 26, 2017. After today\u2019s call, a replay will be available on our website, bemis.com, under the Investor Relations section. Joining me for this call today are Bemis Company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Austen; our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Clauer; and our Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer, Jerry Krempa. Following Bill and Mike\u2019s comments on our business and outlook, we\u2019ll answer any questions you have. However, in order to allow everyone the opportunity to participate, we do ask that you limit yourself to one question at a time with a related follow-up and then fall back into the queue for any additional questions. At this time, I\u2019ll direct you to our website, bemis.com, under the Investor Relations tab, where you\u2019ll find our press release and supplemental schedules. In Mike\u2019s discussion of the financials, he\u2019ll specifically be referring to pages three and four of the supplemental. On today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures as we talk about our performance. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures that we consider most comparable can be found in the press release and supplemental schedules on our website. And, finally, a reminder that statements regarding future performance of the company made during this call are forward-looking and are therefore subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from historical, expected or projected results due to a variety of factors. Please refer to Bemis company\u2019s regular SEC filings, including the most recently filed Form 10-K, to review these risk factors. Now, I'll turn the call over to Bill. William Austen : Thank you, Erin. And good morning, everyone. As I reflect on 2016 we made progress, most importantly, we truly helped our customers win with new product innovations and improved quality and service. We continue to improve toward our long-term financial objectives. Looking at the full year, we achieved record adjusted earnings per share of $2.69, an 8% increase over last year on a currency neutral basis. We increased operating profit return on sales in our US packaging segment to 15.3%, a 100 basis point increase over the prior year and putting us in the range of our long-term goal of 15% to 18% in this segment. This improvement was fuelled primarily by the success of our asset recapitalization program. We generated $437 million of operating cash flow. We acquired SteriPack in April, a great acquisition, and in addition to our growing healthcare packaging business. We invested $208 million in capital to expand and improve our business, positioning us well for the long-term. And we return value to shareholders through our 33rd annual dividend increase and through the repurchase of 3 million shares of stock. We continued implementing our strategy of accelerating growth, focusing innovation and continuously improving all we do to deliver strong financial performance. That said, 2016 had some operational issues, particularly in our global business, we have and will continue to remedy these and I am confident that we will show improvement in 2017. I'll turn the call over to Mike now to discuss details of our 2016 financial performance and 2017 guidance. And then I'll come back to the call to discuss my view of key priorities as we enter 2017. Mike? Michael Clauer : Thanks, Bill, and good morning. We reported adjusted earnings of $0.67 per share for the fourth quarter and $2.69 for the full-year of 2016, an 11.7% increase over the prior fourth-quarter and a 7.8% increase over the prior year on a constant currency basis. Total company gross margins for the full year at 21.16% were roughly in line with the prior year. This reflects the benefits of our asset recapitalization program offset by operational issues in our global business during the year. I will comment next on each reportable segment followed by overall company performance and then wrap up with guidance for 2017. First, US Packaging. Following page 3 of the supplemental schedules starting first with Q4, sales dollars in our US segment declined 3.6% in the quarter. Unit volumes were up 1% in the quarter. We delivered on all expected new or incremental business this quarter, so I am satisfied that our commercialization process is been rectified to deliver our long-term growth plans. While volume could have been better, fourth quarters can be unpredictable because of varying shipment patterns driven by individual customer\u2019s year-end needs. Looking at full-year net sales in US, dollars declined 4.6% compared to the prior year. Volumes were up nearly 1% for the full year. Of the remaining decline in the full year net sales for US Packaging, about half related to lower resin prices that are passed through, which is neutral to profit and the other have to mix driven by the success of our asset recapitalization program. US Packaging operating profit return on sales for 2016 was 15.3% compared to 14.3% in the prior year into our long-term rage target of 15% to 18% in the U.S. This improvement was driven primarily by efficiencies from our asset recapitalization program. Moving to our Global Packaging segment and page four of the supplemental schedules, I will focus on the full year here. Net sales were up 4.5%. Currency translation reduced sales by 10.7% driven by currencies in Latin America and Europe that devalued. The April acquisition of SteriPack contributed a 7.3% increase to net sales. Excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions, our global business delivered nice organic growth of 7.9% in 2016, driven primarily by positive sales price and mix, along with increased unit volumes of 1%. Some retail - regional details on global volumes. Full year unit volumes were down 1% in Latin America, a function of the prolonged economic downturn, up strong single digit - mid-single digits in Asia in our Healthcare Packaging business and down low single digits in Europe. Global Packaging operating profit return on sales for 2016 was 8.2% compared to 8.8% the prior year, which was driven by Q1 operational issues in Latin America which have been corrected and also by the slower pace of bringing our expanded Oshkosh healthcare facility up to speed. We have made progress throughout the year and by the fourth quarter our margin profile increased to 9.4% as compared to 8.6% to prior year Q4, reflecting the benefits of improved price mix from sales and more specifically packages. Currency translation negatively impacted operating profit in 2016 by $8.3 million or about $0.06 of the total company's earnings per share. Now onto consolidated Bemis. Total Bemis Company SG&A expense for the full year was $392 million down from $420 million last year. This reduction was due primarily to our pay-for-performance practices, along with currency and strong cost controls. I anticipate SG&A as a percentage of sales to be consistent in '17 with 2016, which is in-line with our long-term target for SG&A dollars. Looking next at adjusted return on invested capital. At December 31st, ROIC was 10.6% compared to 10.5 % last year. Current year ROIC would be a couple of tenths higher not for the expected near term impact related to acquisitions. We continue to expect this mix to improve over the long-term toward our goal of being in the upper quartile of our peer group. Operating cash flow for the year totaled $437.4 million in line with our recent guidance. Restructuring impacted cash flow by $8 million in 2016. For the full year total working capital was flat. We did not \u2013 we did make further progress on payables in 2016, but I was disappointed by inventory at year end. That said, we ended the year within our target range for primary working capital percentage of sales at 15.8%. During 2016 we took a fresh look at our capital allocation strategy and our board also increased the share repurchase authorization in February by an additional 20 million shares. We intend to maintain investment grade and prioritized capital spending for organic growth and efficiency improvements. And we are committed to returning free cash flow to our shareholders over the long-term horizon through dividend and share repurchases. During the year we repurchased 3 million shares in line with our commitment. You can continue to expect us to buyback shares to the extent in acquisition is an eminent as was the case in Q2 this year when we repurchased SteriPack. Turning to 2017 guidance. We have established an adjusted EPS range for 2017 of $2.85 to $3. Our guidance assumes foreign currencies at the current rates. With this assumption we have actually counted for $0.02 per share headwind from currency in our 2017 guidance versus 2016 actual. Next, I will discuss a few specific items that we have considered in our EPS guidance range. First, the benefit of organic volume growth. In our US business we have assumed 1% to 2% unit volume growth, in our global business we have assumed 3% overall unit volume growth, which is comprised of mid single digit growth in Asia and healthcare, low single digit growth in Europe, and flat volumes in Latin America given the continuing tough economic environment. Second, margin expansion. The mid point of our EPS range assumes that US margin percent is roughly in line with 2016 and the global margin percent progresses towards our long-term target. Bill will provide additional commentary on the segment outlook. Third, the EPS benefit of continued share repurchase. As we've said before, our free cash flow belongs to our shareholders and acquisition is an eminent we will not delver the company we will return our cash to shareholders. Fourth, the benefit of the synergies from our restructuring program in Latin America.  Our EPS guidance includes $0.05 benefit per share in 2017 from implemented synergies. We have closed two of the four identified plants as of December and the final two plants will close mid 2017. This is on pace to our original plan that call for half the total program savings to reflect positive in the P&L, in line with our original Emplal acquisition objective. As you recall, the other half of the restructuring plant savings are intended to offset headwinds from the impact of the economic environment in Latin America. Fifth, interest expense. Our EPS guidance includes $0.05 per share headwinds from interest. About two thirds as a result of the year-over-year comparison related to the bond we issued in September and the remainder is a result of generally higher interest rates following the forward curve. And finally, income tax rate. I expect 2017 tax rates to be approximately 32.5% which includes the impact of the new accounting standard for stock-based compensation. Where we are within our EPS range of $2.85 to $2.85 to $3 will depend on further movement of currencies, new product introductions, on-boarding new business awards, and how our end markets performed relative to the outlook. We have built this plan with consistent earnings growth each quarter of 2017. Turning to capital expenditures guidance for 2017. We expect to spend $200 million. Of this about $60 million is for environmental health and safety at our plants around the world, at least approximately $140 million which we target for growth projects and asset recapitalization. And finally, we have established 2017 guidance for cash from operations in the range of $440 million to $480 million. This includes $50 million impact in 2017 from our restructuring program in Latin America. Regarding primary working capital, we previously committed to take out $140 million towards our targeted 14% to 16% of sales. We realized $110 million of that in 2015. We are targeting an additional $30 million to $50 million of working capital improvement through 2017, primarily from payables and inventory. I anticipate normal seasonality and cash flow throughout the year with cash from operations lighter in the first quarter and then building from there. In summary, I remain confident in our business and in our ability to further improve financial performance to create long-term shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call back to Bill for his comments on 2017. William Austen : Thanks Mike. As I think about the progress we have made and also about the stability and longevity of our business, I remain confident in our continued improvement and our ability to perform well over the long-term. Our US business has seen much success in the past two years. We've expanded margins approximately 200 basis points and increased operating profit dollars almost $25 million. Our business in this region covers a broad spectrum of products and we have great position, particularly in high technology packaging. During 2016, we continued implementing our pricing analytics initiative that helps our sales and marketing teams make good commercial decisions based on data instead of gut instinct. This allows us after inputting products spec and market data to have actionable information at our fingertips, which allows us to make better strategic commercial decisions. When initiating this project, our sense was that we would primarily discover areas where we were below market and would almost with the data to surgically raise prices. While there are many examples of this, there are also instances identified by the analytics, particularly in process proteins where the data showed that we were beyond the market therefore, making us vulnerable. During 2016, we used this data in negotiations with a variety of customers to proactively protect good business for the long-term and to gain new incremental business, considering the output of these negotiations the midpoint of our guidance range assumes US packaging margin percent in 2017 to be roughly in line with 2016. In the US, we will continue our asset recapitalization program which has provided meaningful improvement to date, as it will into the future. Because of this program, we are able to pursue growth in less differentiated products that formerly we would have overlooked given our cost structure with the old inefficient equipment. We will continue to invest in new converting equipment that meets or exceeds our 15% ROIC hurdle rate. These continued improvements will help us return to margin expansion in the US in 2018. Turning to the global business. As Mike mentioned, we'll see nice improvement in 2017 as compared to last year. We're making good progress in our restructuring program in Latin America. This plan not only helps our cost structure during the current tough economic environment, but it positions us well for the long-term. We're also making great progress in leveraging our technologies globally. The success of our innovation engine in the US allows us to quickly capitalize on increasing package sophistication in our global business. We have and we'll continue to benefit from sharing our technologies globally and increasing package sophistication in Latin America and Asia. To propel this initiative further and faster, we recently launched a formal global leveraging team, led by the experience of Dan Rokjer, Vice President of Global Business Development and embraced by the entire organization. We strongly believe that we have a clear competitive advantage and can meet or exceed our growth objectives by fully leveraging our global technology platforms. A key enabler to top line growth is our ability to accelerate global collaboration within our business. This formal effort aligns three strategic full time individuals who will support our global growth strategy. I am confident as we begin 2017, as we are focused on our customers and when we help our customers win, we win. We continue to evolve toward a high-performance culture. We have high expectations of ourselves. We are focused on execution. Execution is front and center in 2017, all areas of the business, every person, every function, every day. And we'll continue to pursue earnings growth to create long-term sustainable shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Scott Gaffner from Barclays. Please go ahead. Scott Gaffner : Thanks. Good morning Bill, good morning Mike. Michael Clauer : Morning. William Austen : Good morning, Scott. Scott Gaffner : Mike, I just wanted to talk a little bit about free cash flow and the shift in working capital. I guess you said that \u2013 it sounded like your customers were managing their own working capital or their own cash flow in the fourth quarter and maybe that flow down a little bit to you or was this more the payment terms issue? Can you talk about that in the fourth quarter and then what gives you confidence that we get it back in 2017? Michael Clauer : Yes. So first of all, on our own cash from operations, what I'm positive and happy about is that we \u2013 it wasn't a source of cash, so - excuse me, use of cash. So we\u2019ve put the discipline in place, and we're really converting our cash pretty well. What I was disappointed and to be completely transparent, I thought we\u2019d be in the range of $450 million to $455 million at the end of the year. And where we saw about the deficiencies, it was about half of that was just in payables, where we just quite didn't get the terms done that we wanted. The other half was just around the world a little bit extra inventory. The confidence I have next year is just the continued focus on this. The plans are in place. The initiatives are being hit on right now as we speak, as most of you are aware with the investment we're making in the new ERP platform in North America. We've talked about in the past that that will start as we implement the system and get completed. We'll drive inventory down as we get into late '17 and into '18. So, my confidence is, we have plans. I've seen them. I've sat down with the organization and I'm very comfortable at this point that they're committed to deliver. Scott Gaffner : All right. And when you look at the capital allocation for 2017, I think you said, obviously, the cash belongs to the shareholders. Do you have any share buyback included in the guidance today? Michael Clauer : I do. We assume we're not going to delever. So if you \u2013 you can figure out that by taking cash from ops we\u2019ve given you CapEx, you calculate dividend and there will be additional borrowing associated with not delivering, if we do grow our EBIDTA. So I think you can back into it. And I think consistently with what you saw this year, we buy million shares a quarter unless there\u2019s an eminent acquisition like SteriPack in Q2. And that's kind of what\u2019s the same thing that happened in '15, we bought 3.3 million shares in the quarter, we didn't \u2013 it was Q4 when we bought Emplal. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from George Staphos from Bank of America. Please go ahead. George Staphos : Hi, everyone. Thanks for details and congratulations on the year. My questions are round on margin. And I just want to make sure that I had heard correctly. First question, I think you said margin in '17 should be in aggregate comparable with '16, even though it sounds like global packaging will be up. Bill, you\u2019d said that, US packaging would be roughly in line, but if I do the math it would suggest that maybe it's going to be a little bit below last year. So if you could confirm that and provide details around that. And then the second question I had on operations, you had mentioned that you are in the process of remedying the commercial elements of your business, the new product introductions that you're doing. I just wanted to clear up whether you're now \u2013 you feel confident with that process or it's still developing in Brazil, the restructuring and it sounds like it's ongoing. I just want to see where you are in terms of having close that out? Thank you. William Austen : Sure George. This is Bill. George Staphos : Hi, Bill. William Austen : On the margin, what I said was that US packaging margins would be comparable to 2016. And global margins would be up in '17. Your second part of that question\u2026 Erin Winters : On the commercialization piece\u2026 William Austen : On the commercialization piece, sorry. We are confident that\u2019s behind us and we've moved on. The point there is that if we looked at the new business that commercialized, the new business, meaning new products that commercialized in Q4 we are right on track with what we had anticipated. We feel that process is fixed, moving forward and it's behind us. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Mark Wilde, BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Mark Wilde : Good morning, Bill. Good morning, Erin and Mike. William Austen : Good morning. Hi, Mark. Mark Wilde : I wondered, Bill if you and Mike could just help on a year-over-year basis, help us think about some of the changes that were likely to see in 2017, the ones that I am focused on how much of a reduction is the drag from the issues in Latin America and the issues up at Oshkosh, how much year-to-year is there from SteriPack? How much benefit is there year-to-year from the Recap Program, plus Latin American restructuring and then what are your pick up from just organic business growth? William Austen : Well, I can start with Latin America. We kind of indicated we've got $0.05 related to the restructuring initiatives. And I can tell you in Q1 we wouldn\u2019t repeat kind of the performance we had last year in Q1. So that's anticipated that it was fixed and we will be back at what we would consider normal operating. I don't recall the number right off of my head what that is. SteriPack is about $0.01 and from a integration perspective we continue to integrate. We will see some synergies coming in the later part of the year as we qualify the film that was being purchased from outside of Bemis is now being qualified to run inside of Bemis. Erin Winters : On organic growth. You could expect an organic growth Mark that the EPS impacted that if you sum up the US and global going to be high single-digits EPS type range. Did we cover all of the items? Mark Wilde : Yes. I think that's most of them. Erin Winters : Okay. Mark Wilde : I just wondered as a follow-on, can you guys just talk about whether you have seen any acceleration or deceleration in business over the last say three months? Erin Winters : Mark, I'll take that. I wouldn\u2019t say there's an acceleration or deceleration. I will talk about Q4 and US Packaging for a moment, we were up about 1% and that's on top of up 2% in Q4 of 2015 and that's from a volume perspective. We felt good about that. We commercialized the new products we wanted, we needed to commercialize. There was some weakness in end markets and let's call it health, hygiene, towel, tissue, over wrap that piece of the market, but I think that's just normal. Q4 customers managing their inventories and their promotions that they have in retail. But I would say from my perspective as we exit 2016 and move into '17 that we're building a little bit of momentum within the business in US. Operator : Thank you. We will go next to Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Please go ahead. Anthony Pettinari : Hi. Good afternoon. Going back to the Analyst Day, I think there was a view that price or pricing analytics could contribute maybe around 20% of the margin expansion that you're ultimately targeting. It sounds like early findings from pricing analytics are maybe contributing to more flattish margins as you protect some business. Does this kind of recalibrate how you think about the potential benefits of pricing analytics maybe in 2018 or 2019 or how do you think about the value of the program going forward given the results might have been a little surprising at the end of the year in 2016. William Austen : Yeah. Anthony, you raised a good point. Okay? The way our initial sense with pricing analytics was we would be able to strategically use it and you always look at upside, right, you're always looking for the upside. So we would strategically use it to raise prices that were low, okay. And if you look as we've looked at it and gotten into the details of the analytics, we can look across market segments, product segments, SKUs to determine how our overall portfolio is put together, in any specific segment or at any specific account. Now to use that that way, it gives you a much more strategic focus and not just a tactical focus of the analytics. And that's what our teams have done throughout 2016. They used a very strategically to say, okay, how are we positioned across an entire segment, and where do we need to adjust, so that we can protect lock up, change terms, different materials, whatever happens to be. But it's much more strategic now than we ever thought it was going to be or that we had imagined it could be versus the tactical piece of the tool and use it to raise the low prices. So, yes, to your point it's become more strategic than it is tactical. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's helpful. And then just following up on the 2017 guidance, I think in the us you guided to 1% to 2% organic growth, and I guess it\u2019s a little bit lower than the 2% growth in the \u2013 at the Analyst Day if I'm comparing the right things. Is there any reason you're kind of maybe at the lower end or below that long-term target? Is that just kind of continued conservatism in a tough process foods market or is there specific categories where you're seeing weakness or any kind of color there would be helpful. William Austen : Yes, Anthony, what we had projected at Analyst Day was we would be 2% ahead of food, okay. So, if we look \u2013 just take a look at '16 for instance, we finished the year about 1% up. You can look at different data, you can talk to different customers, you can track process food volumes. That would \u2013 and most of them were negative, more than 1% or 2%. We see that our customers, the data we look at for '17 says possibly plus 1%. Personally, from my perspective, I don't think it\u2019s going to be that robust. I think maybe its going to be flat. We don't necessarily need all those end markets to grow at big rates to get the 1% to 2% growth that we are projecting for 2017 in US packaging. We have the business in hand. We have the accounts one, we use pricing analytics to lock up some of those accounts for the long-term we don't have to worry about that piece of the business. Commercialization issues are behind us. We've moved on from that. Now it's time for us to execute and make 2017 happen the way the business teams are planning it. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Brian Maguire from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Maguire : Hi, good morning. I just had a question following up on the outlook for US packaging in 2017. It sounds like with the EBIDTA margin \u2013 EBIT margin being flat you're guiding for generally flat EBIT growth and its sounds like that pricing was going to be a negative component in there, based on the analytics you did. Just wondering if it's a case where you think that you maybe raise price too aggressively in some markets the last couple years and you're retrenching a bit now or does it seem like it was more of a case where the end markets got a little bit softer and there's been a little bit more competition and pricing erosion in those markets? William Austen : What we looked at their and as I said in my script, this is primarily in the process protein segment. We've had business in this area for many, many years and have had exceptional kinds of prices in there. We wanted to make sure that we maintained it and locked it up for the future that's what we did. So we negotiated not just price, there's other things that go into this right? Terms, material substitutions, re-qualification of a different product, so the net-net is that our margins are going to be flat in 2017 in US packaging. Brian Maguire : Okay. Great. I appreciate that. And then just a follow-up on the volume outlook, I know it's a bit of an acceleration from the trends recently. Is some of that renegotiation work contributing to that and do you expect some of the commercialization improvement activities that lead to little bit of a bounce back as some of that business comes through? William Austen : Yes. Brian Maguire : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Please go ahead. Ghansham Panjabi : Hey, guys, good morning. It's Ghansham. William Austen : Hey, Ghansham. Michael Clauer : Hi, Ghansham. Ghansham Panjabi : So, Bill, just to help us reset expectations or caliber your performance I guess, in the context of your own volume profile in 2016 the way you defined it, what do you think your relative markets grew in '16 in the US, Latin America and Europe? William Austen : Ghansham, great question. I don't think our markets grew in the US, I don't think the markets grew in LatAm. Europe was probably flat, Asia-Pacific we had strong single-digit growth rates in Asia-Pacific. I think the markets that we are growing in Asia-Pacific are really because we're transferring technology from the US to Europe and we are creating new packaging styles for the Asian market which are new there. So it's hard to say what the markets grew in Asia-Pacific. But we feel pretty good about what we've done in Asia-Pacific, strong fourth quarter in Asia-Pacific, mid-single to upper digit - upper single-digit growth rates in healthcare. We're probably growing a little bit better than the healthcare market might be for our type of packaging only because we were working through backlog, right. So from the Oshkosh issue that we had and just to point out on Oshkosh, I'll say this now since I'm on it. The metrics that we track to see how our performances there throughput waste, scrap, on-time deliveries are all on track per what we said at the end of third quarter. So we feel good about the execution that's taken place in our Oshkosh healthcare facility. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay. And just as my second question, I guess since your last conference call there's been a broad increase in raw material prices across almost every single substrate. I guess, first-off, what are you modeling for inflation not just raw materials but just general inflation wages et cetera. And then as we think about your specific margin targets for 2018 that you sort of outlined for US packaging, being up how does that factor into your thinking for the margin threshold for that year? William Austen : Yeah. From a inflation perspective we modeled in 3%, raw materials we pass-through, so we don't spend much time with that, we pass it through quickly. And last point you had their George \u2013 Operator : Ghansham. Erin Winters : Ghansham, I'm sorry. I'm thinking through the answer here, I am trying to come up with what the last question was that you had. Michael Clauer : I had a couple more Ghansham just back in the US we use 4% inflation on utilities, 2.5% freight, we assumed our benefit plans will cost us about 5% increase and then in the global markets we like in \u2013 I think Brazil we use inflation of \u2013 I've got the numbers here. We used economic data provided by the economist in country. But back in Brazil, 6.5% inflation, Argentina 20%, Mexico 2%, China we\u2019ve assume 4% inflation So we really try to tie ourselves to the local markets. We use the GDP outlooks. And then in the case of Brazil I think they are looking at plus 1, we were assuming down one just because we were not quite comfortable yet that this is improving. Is that going to help your question? William Austen : Ghansham. Erin Winters : Next question operator. Operator : Yes. We will go next to Jason Freuchtel from SunTrust. Please go ahead. Jason Freuchtel : Hi. Good morning. William Austen : Good morning, Jason. Michael Clauer : Hi, Jason. Jason Freuchtel : Hi. I think you referenced there are some volatility in your order patterns in the US business, maybe in the health hygiene over rep business. Does that imply that that volume is pushed out into 1Q '17 and could that provide a little bit of upside to your estimates objections? William Austen : We would know. All we\u2019re saying is - two-four is always kind of challenging because you kind of get orders and commitments in the quarter for the quarter and then if they change their production schedules or when they're going to close their plants down and cancel or delay orders. So I wouldn\u2019t think about \u2013 I don't think of it is just shifts, there's too many other variables. Jason Freuchtel : Okay. And I guess secondarily, you've managed your general corporate expenses lower over the course of '16. Should we expect those costs will increase with your inflation expectations you just laid out or are there any other opportunities to potentially manage those costs down over the course of the year? William Austen : First of all I said in the comments, I think what you should do is model as percentage of sales consistent year-to-year. And we do use an overall assumption of about 3% and then we target our SG&A organizations to look for areas and opportunities to try to hold those costs constant. I think one of the drivers year-over-year is going to be as we mentioned our pay-per-performance. If we don't perform as we didn't in 2016 our short-term incentive plans globally take a hit. And then when we come to a new year, we start with the assumption that we are going to achieve our targets for 2017. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : Thanks. I just wanted to go back to a couple things you mentioned earlier on the call, you said that the $2.85 to $3 range will depend on FX new products business on-boarding and end markets. I wanted to kind of dive into the end markets discussion. Maybe you can just help us understand what you're assuming your own growth would be in some of your areas such as the big middle or medical and so on? William Austen : Sure. We don't necessarily model out growth in any one area segment like the big middle. What we do is we looked at U.S. packaging and as we said in Mike's comments 1% to 2% there. On the global side of the business, we looked at \u2013 if you boil it down LatAm flat, low single digits in Europe and mid single digits in Asia in healthcare. That\u2019s the \u2013 those are the metrics we've used in the plant to model out. Arun Viswanathan : Yeah. Thanks. William Austen : And if you look at \u2013 and just following on to that, end markets in US, we've looked at data, we\u2019ve talked to customers. There\u2019s a lot of talk that US end markets would be plus one. I'm not necessarily that robust and think that it will be zero to one, but I don't think one is a given. Arun Viswanathan : That's helpful. So \u2013 and then just, as a follow-up, the $2.85 to $3 range appears to be a little bit greater than usual. Is that a fair characterization? And maybe you can give me a little bit of confidence around some of those factors of the volatility, i.e., or the new products already booked as new business on-boarding, really confidence in that in those markets, or those factors? Michael Clauer : Yeah. So, historically our company always gives a $0.15 range around $0.075 on both sides of the midpoint. Clearly the items I mentioned, currencies, I have no idea. New product introductions, we have pretty good visibility into that. But a lot of the challenge on the new product is end market acceptance and the pace of acceptance. And that\u2019s doesn't mean it's not going to happen but it just means how quickly does it get the traction and get the pool at retail. On-boarding new awards, I'm pretty comfortable. We've rectified our issues. We've reengineered, for a better term, that commercialization process. But not all the time those issues are ours. There are occasions when a new plant\u2019s starting up for customer and it's either delayed or they're having start-up issues. So I think the things that are completely in our control we feel pretty good about. And then Bill just commented on how the end markets perform. We\u2019re going to assume about flat and I hope everybody else is right in their F1. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go next to Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Chris Manuel : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Sort of a difficult question to answer and I'm sure it's going to be a much more difficult question to ask and it's going to be more difficult to answer. But what I'm trying to get a sense of is, as you look across the end markets and such that you serve, principally here in the US, processed foods obviously have been struggling for a while and seemingly that the onslaught of a push to more less processed or more fresh or natural foods is changing. How do you think about your business mix and your winning of new business and what you're doing with either smaller or off brand, sort of natural food or non-processed food stuff, is this \u2013 and I guess really to kind of tie it altogether, is this a situation where your portfolio seems to be pretty heavily weighted towards the crafts, the PNG, and med [ph] et cetera, and perhaps growth targets are a bit challenging for the next two, three, four, five years is really what I'm trying to get at. William Austen : Thanks for this question, Chris. This is at the heart of what we're doing at Bemis Company in North America. We're moving the portfolio to more of the big middle in the flexible packaging space and we've been able to do that through the asset recapitalization program. When you heard me talk about the data analytics and the pricing analytics that we use that was primarily looking at segments across the process meet area, which we all know have been under pressure. So we lock that business up for the long-term. The recap efforts that we have allow us to go into the big middle of the flexible packaging space, which is not necessarily focused at processed foods. While processed foods is a part of that, so our non-food applications for customers that Bemis Company may not observed in the past because we were so wedded to food. So as we move the portfolio to your point, we move the mix away from the food, the processed side, lock up the process to meet side with what we use data analytics for we now have the ability to grow volume because we're taking on new share from new accounts and new customers. Chris Manuel : Interesting. Okay. Kind of follow-up question, and you guys touched this earlier; inflation does seem to be really working its way through and thank you for the color on what you're using in there. I appreciate that you need to use productivity to offset chunks of it, but how do you go out or how do your contracts handle inflation, you have pass-through or elements for some of those whether it's freight, energy, labor et cetera. But how can you go out and across most of your business, I guess you probably don't and recapture inflation, can you do general price increases from time-to-time? William Austen : Chris, that's more prevalent in places outside of the US where inflation has been much higher, say Argentina and Brazil. In the US, it has not been very prevalent over the years. And we use cost out material science, product substitution and productivity to help offset those increases in inflation. Michael Clauer : That we can pass through. Chris Manuel : All right. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Chip Dillon from Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Chip Dillon : Yes. Hi. Good morning. Question has to do with the restructuring. You mentioned that the cost that you would bear in '17 would be around $15 million. And I suppose as we look beyond the \u2013 these last two closures in mid-'17, would it be your expectation looking out that you're done with restructuring for now? I mean, there is been a lot of transformation in the last few years of the sale of the Pressure Sensitive business. Do you think you'll make it through '18 let's say without any major restructuring moves been necessary? William Austen : Look, first of all just to be really clear that restructuring numbers is the cash associated with the charges taken in 2016. I'm never going to say were not going to have additional restructurings. I think every business is constantly looking at ways to improve their cost structure. I have no opinions today that there might be an acquisition that would lead to some restructuring associated with it. So I can't say never, but as I sit here today I'm not aware of anything eminent that \u2013 I think the big one we did was in Latin America one last year. Chip Dillon : Okay. Understood. And then looking at the CapEx, you mentioned 140 million for growth initiatives, and if you could just talk a little bit about when you think those \u2013 what they are and when you think they start actually pay off on the bottom line? William Austen : Well, its growth and recapitalization initiatives. Those of you that spent some time with our capital projects generally have a 12 to 18 month delivery. So from the time we make the commitment on the capital to commercialization could be 12 to 18 months. Recap projects since we already have the business. Once those are installed, those returns hit almost immediately. And growth projects are a function of you can always add capacity ahead of \u2013 you're adding capacity based on your customers and your forecast of how that product is going to kind of accelerate over period of time. So those returns don\u2019t quite happen as quickly as a recap. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Phil Ng from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Phil Ng : Hey, guys. You mentioned you're looking to protect some business in the US and expect flash margins this year. Does this cap your margin profile in the US long return and targets you've kind of set forth at the Analyst Day, is that still realistic? William Austen : Yes, Phil. We've locked in that volume the next 3 to 5 years and the asset recapitalization is really what's driving and fueling our growth in margins as well as new product innovations that are being launched in the US. So no, our margin expectations are not capped. Phil Ng : Okay, 18 or 19? William Austen : Yeah. We see 15% to 18% as a very achievable objective. Phil Ng : Okay. That's helpful. And I guess, shifting gears to your global packaging business. Volumes have been pretty flat in back half. What's driving the acceleration you're expecting for 2017? Is that driven back to operational issues behind you or just kind of regaining share following some pretty sizable price hikes you've implemented this past year? Thanks. William Austen : On the global side, Phil, it's really the slow comeback of Latin America primarily Brazil. Okay? So they've been down -- end markets have been down, GDP has been negative 3.8, next year's its forecast to be plus 1. That drives consumption. We don't think it's going to be one we are looking at zero to flat in LatAm next year, but that drives consumption, that drives our volume growth back in that region. Operator : Thank you. We will go next to Debbie Jones from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Kyle White : Hi, good morning. It\u2019s Kyle White filling in for Debbie. I wanted to focus on inorganic growth. You laid out the 3% CAGR target at the Analyst Day a while back. Just kind of get your thoughts on if you think that's still a viable target given sort of transaction multiple expansion that we've seen and in order to get that target are you expecting more sort of smaller deals to get to it or a transformational deal? William Austen : Well, this is \u2013 I'll answer that. It's still a realistic goal. It still is our objective to do some acquisitions. We're going to continue kind of - how we've approached it thus far is that we've, kind of, identified the type of companies we want to add to the portfolio. They typically \u2013 that tend to be family type businesses and then we start working on creating the relationship and helping understand their succession plans. And in the case of both Emplal and SteriPack those are prime examples of where we got things taken care of and they really were in the process. I don't want to say we don't look at things in the process as most of you are aware. Second half of 2016 was a pretty robust period of time with assets coming up for sale. We took a look at a lot of them, none of them kind of fit. But we're going to continue focusing on bolt-on's. At this point in time honestly we're not really thinking transformational but if something of interest came along and we would not looked at it. Kyle White : Thanks. That's helpful. Second question is just more on the clarity, Mike I think you said $0.05 benefit from LatAm I believe that's just the lapping of the headwind that you had in 2016 and not necessarily inclusive of benefits from the restructuring. William Austen : The $0.05 is only the synergies associated with the restructuring. We would expect that the problems we had in Q1 that we corrected in Q2 that we're rolling over those so those would be positive. That was about $0.03. Kyle White : All right. That makes sense. Thanks. I'll turn it over. Operator : Great. And we will take our next question from George Staphos from Bank of America. Please go ahead. George Staphos : Hi, guys. I had a few more questions. The last two here, I appreciate your patience with this question on US margins, its kind of up there with no good deed goes unpunished and you've gave a lot of details, so it brings out more questions. So if I think about your US packaging business and why margins will ultimately trend up, in '18 and '19, on the one hand you said you've locked up your process meat business and contracts, presumably that came at a price and it's also business that seems to be from what you said, seeing somewhat challenged end market conditions. You are growing in the big middle through your recap program and that's good for return on capital for sure. But with tend to have a lower mix, I would think in margin then call it processed proteins. So what is actually going to lead to better margins starting in '18 and '19 in the US packaging business? The related question and I'll turn it over. And I think Brian, and some of the other folks tried to touch on this as well. You invented in many ways the process meat packaging business a number of years ago, or would did, and you're running a commercial enterprise, so it's a good thing in a way that your pricing was as high because it was generating margin in return. So the fact that you used your analytics to strategically lower pricing and lock up volume, is it driven by your competition beginning to catch up? Are you worried more about other substrates entering the market? I wouldn\u2019t expect if that's the case or is it really more just the function, hey, look the demand picture is a little bit more challenged and we would like to lock up that volume here right now and that's where the action - that's what drove the action? Thank you guys. William Austen : George, I'll answer the second half of that first, okay. George Staphos : Okay William Austen : Yes. We have invented a lot of the process meet specifications and develop that whole category, if you will. We've had that business for very long time. It's a very good business it's always going to be a good business. But the analytics now gave us the ability to look across a portfolio of not just process meet, but other specifications within a portfolio for a customer. And said this is a good portfolio, where are we vulnerable because let's face it, people will come in with a me too that may or may not meet the performance characteristics, but they will damage the market price for that specification. And we wanted to take that off the table. So yes, we locked up the business. We looked at it across the portfolio, but it's not just price, there's terms, there is materials, there is product substitutions, there are other things that go into that decision, not just price. Next piece. On the margins, what gives us comfort that we can continue to grow margins in '18 and '19? It's the asset recapitalization program and the fact that things that are converting from glass and cans to flexible is in that big middle. Those are new pieces of business, new volumes, new specs with good margins associated with those, asset recapitalization allows us to lower our cost position in our plans in the United States and if we push more volume across those plants with lower-cost, what happens. We get better absorption and we make money on the manufacturing side of the equation, not just the sale side of the equation. So we are very comfortable with the model we have in place, lowering costs, locking up high-margin business for the next few years, so it won't be attacked, and expanding in the big middle outside of food into non-food categories which allows us to continue to drive margins forward. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Frederick Searby from Dunbar. Please go ahead. Frederick Searby : Yeah. Thank you for the question. Just a question on Latin America with the restructuring. We're at the bottom of the worst recession Brazil pretty much ever seen most severe. What gives you confidence that we won't see a big pickup in 2018 or even in the back half of 2017 and you'll have to add capacity in the medium-term or more quickly than you thought. And with the plant closings what's the capacity utilization you're running at now and so how much room do you scope, do you have for growth, if things indeed rebound? William Austen : Right. The restructuring didn't remove capacity from the rigid side of the equation. We put our volume into facilities that had open capacity and much more efficient and effective capacity than we had within one of our old legacy plants. So you've really given us the ability to drive productivity in the short-term and also pick up the business, pick up the volume as consumption begins to accelerate. So we are trying to manage it in the short-term, but we really looked at it over the long-term to say okay, how can we continue to drive the business forward with this new -- Frederick Searby : So what is capacity utilization right now? William Austen : Well it would vary, but if you look at the rigid business, we are probably at about 75% capacity utilization. And in our flexible's business, we are probably somewhere around the same level, 70% to 75%. Frederick Searby : Okay. Thank you. William Austen : You're welcome. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Jason Freuchtel from SunTrust. Go ahead Jason. Jason Freuchtel : Hey thanks. Just a couple follow-ups. How dramatic could your end market exposure change as you find new opportunities through your pricing analytic strategy and would you anticipate it to change over the next couple years? William Austen : Jason, I'm not sure I quite understand the question, but how could our exposure to end markets change. We are trying to change the exposure now and as I said earlier, we've always been a big player in the food space and we are trying to take our technologies and our capacities into the nonfood areas proactively, so that we change that dynamic ourselves and don't wait for the market to change it on us. Jason Freuchtel : Right. That's exactly what I was asking. And could you see a large shift in that business in one year or would it take multiple years to see a material change in your end market exposure? William Austen : That won't happen overnight, Jason. It's a thoughtful planned out way to get there. And it isn't going to be a step change. It will be a ramp. Operator : Thank you. We do have another follow-up question from Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Chris Manuel : Hi guys. Just one quick one here because I know we're late in the call. When you guys had laid out objectives through '19, one of the key pieces of that was targeting $750 million or so of revenue in acquisitions. As we sit today, we\u2019re about halfway through the process, and if you guys have in round numbers $100 million, $150 million or so kind of a targeted revenue that you\u2019ve done. Where are you at in the process, I guess, is really what I'm trying to understand, and in particular I think early you mentioned near-term input from related acquisition costs or something like that and a discussion of why SG&A was up. Kind of where are you at in the process of finding things, how does the market look to you, and what did you mean by that question earlier I think in regards to SG&A? William Austen : First, I\u2019ll answer the last question. I didn't make any reference to acquisitions in SG&A. So, I don't know what that might have been. As far as M&A, I mean, we still think it's a healthy environment and as we commented at the end of Q3, we did add Jim Ward our new Vice President of Business Development to our team and what Jim really brings, he came from a consumer packaging company, excuse me, consumer products company and prior to that a nice career in investment banking. Jim's really brought an incredible -has been an incredible addition to our team, and I think it's going to be a step change in us looking at more acquisitions. And we clearly fully intend to deliver the 3% in organic objective that we laid out back in '15. Chris Manuel : Thank you. Operator : And we have more follow-up questions from George Staphos from Bank of America. George Staphos : Thanks. I promise that\u2019s it and I\u2019ll make it quick guys. Thanks for the Q&A. One, what were the learning\u2019s from the consultant\u2019s project on commercializing new products, and a few thoughts. And then I wasn\u2019t clear perhaps you mentioned it and if you did I missed it, of the operating issues last year and I want to say they were somewhere in the $0.10 to $0.12 range, correct that number if it's wrong, how much in your guidance this year are you climbing back? Thank you. And good luck in the quarter. Erin Winters : George, I\u2019ll take the last one first, on operating issues, you're correct it was roughly $0.10 here in 2016, you\u2019d expect for full-year '17 for that to be about $0.06 better that\u2019s LatAm in Q1 and a portion of the healthcare improvement. And Bill I\u2019ll turn it to you for learning\u2019s from the\u2026 William Austen : Yeah. A good set of learning\u2019s that came in quick, tactical work with our team, developed the plan going forward, implemented a plan very quickly and essentially George the learning was that we had a process that was more, and these are my words, ad hoc than it was scientific or process oriented. We assigned accountabilities. We assigned a much tighter screen on the front end of those projects that needed to be commercialized. We back data up to get information earlier in the process and not hand it off. And when I say we assigned accountabilities, we put an owner onto those projects so that they take it from start to finish and get it through the funnel, to build the materials, shop floor, to out the door. So good project, quick and we saw the results benefit us in Q4. Operator : Thank you. And it appears there are no further questions at this time. Erin Winters : Thank you everyone for joining us today. This concludes our conference call. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude the teleconference for today. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Erin Winters, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Erin Winters : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2017 conference call. Today is April 27, 2017. After today\u2019s call, a replay will be available on our website, bemis.com, under the Investor Relations section. Joining me for this call today are Bemis Company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Austen; our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Clauer; and our Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer, Jerry Krempa. Following Bill and Mike\u2019s comments on our business and outlook, we\u2019ll answer any questions you have. However, in order to allow everyone the opportunity to participate, we do ask that you limit yourself to one question at a time with a related follow-up and then fall back into the queue for any additional question. At this time, I\u2019ll direct you to our website, bemis.com, under the Investor Relations tab, where you\u2019ll find our press release and supplemental schedules.  On today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures as we talk about our performance. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures that we consider most comparable can be found in the press release and supplemental schedules on our website. And, finally, a reminder that statements regarding future performance of the company made during this call are forward-looking and are therefore subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from historical, expected or projected results due to a variety of factors. Please refer to Bemis company\u2019s regular SEC filings, including the most recently filed Form 10-K, to review these risk factors. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill. William Austen : Thank you, Erin and good morning, everyone. We are disappointed with our results this quarter, which were driven by both external and internal factors impacting our U.S. Packaging business. Specifically, lower than expected unit volumes and core operational execution. We are focused on increasing efficiency and accountability across our organization and are targeting specific areas that we know we can improve. We are confident that our efforts and actions will address our challenges and enable Bemis to deliver enhanced value over the long-term. Let me start by describing what\u2019s happened, and then I\u2019ll move to the more important topic of what we\u2019re doing to course correct. There are two key issues we\u2019re facing in the U.S.; volume call downs from several core customers as a result of softness in their businesses and disappointing operational execution. Some perspective on the volume call downs. Heading into 2017, we added manufacturing costs and resources predicated on forecasts provided to us by our core big CPG customer base. During March, our customers started calling down their volume outlooks for the balance of the year as their business volumes continued to decline. We had ramped up our work force and resources for these customers and it is us who bears the impact of a call down in customer volume. To avoid this repeating in the future, I have decided that our U.S. Packaging team will adjust our footprint and cost structure to align with flat-to-down volume outlook instead of a positive outlook. Next, some perspective on our disappointing operational execution in our U.S. business. Coming into 2017, we planned an aggressive manufacturing cost takeout program. These incremental takeouts focused on elements of cost such as waste reductions, productivity and material usage and substitutions. We have struggled to deliver on these plans. Waste is high in certain areas. We have pockets of unplanned downtime and we didn\u2019t gain traction on the material usage and substitutions to the degree we had planned. The impact of these two issues on the P&L is considerable as reflected in our new adjusted EPS guidance range of $2.50 to $2.60 for the full year. This call down considers lower volume and the associated operational impact as well as a realistic assessment of our U.S. operational and cost takeout abilities in the near term.  Turning next to what we\u2019re doing to course correct our U.S. business. First, new leadership. While we didn\u2019t expect the current quarter miss, we did begin to recognize last year that our U.S. business wasn\u2019t changing at the pace we needed it to. During 2016, we started a search for a new President of our U.S. Packaging business and in late February, Fred Stephan joined Bemis Company. Fred is an outstanding addition to our leadership team and I\u2019m already impressed with his fresh insights, his drive for results and his practical approach. Within just a few weeks, Fred has begun to simplify our U.S. business and start aggressively working on basic operational blocking and tackling. With Fred\u2019s oversight, we have launched plant profit teams at each of our facilities in U.S. to foster sound, cross-functional business decisions to drive action and improved profitability. Fred is a change agent and we are working closely together to get our U.S. business back on track.  Next, human capital. We continue to carefully assess the talent and capabilities across our U.S. organization to ensure that we have the right people and skill sets in place to meet the demands of our business. We are taking the appropriate actions responsibly and respectfully. Earlier this week, we streamlined the reporting structure of our sales force in the U.S. which will now report directly to Fred. By eliminating an additional layer in the reporting hierarchy, Fred will have direct oversight over those who most closely and directly interface with our U.S. customers. We are confident this will enable to more quickly recognize, understand and rectify any deficiencies in our sales organization. We are intently focused on increasing accountability and accelerating decision making as we drive change through the entire U.S. organization.  Lastly, cost structure. We are assessing all options to align our business to the current environment to position Bemis for long-term success and to improve earnings. We are evaluating manufacturing and capacity, footprint rationalization, SG&A reductions, R&D spend and effectiveness and direct and indirect manufacturing spend. Any activity across any function that is deemed non-value add, will be discontinued. The scope of our review is broad. No stone will be left unturned. We have already started taking action. Hourly labor that was ramped up based on forecast from our customers has been removed. Discretionary spend has been stopped. Hiring freezes have been enacted. These three actions have been considered in our guidance. You can anticipate upcoming announces on our plant and capacity rationalizations that will benefit 2018. We are committed to establishing a cost structure that\u2019s reflective of the U.S. environment we operate in today.  I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike now to cover performance in our Global Packaging segment and details on the financials, and then I\u2019ll come back to wrap up. Michael Clauer : Thanks, Bill. We recognize our current performance is not acceptable. Our sense of urgency and intensity is at the highest level I have experienced in my time at Bemis. We\u2019re using this disappointment as a catalyst to accelerate the change necessary at our company. I will start today by discussing the financial details of our U.S. business, followed by commentary on our global business, total company metrics and then the outlook. U.S. Packaging compared to the prior year, first quarter revenue was down 1.8%, unit volumes were down 1% and the remaining decline was driven by contractually negotiated price decreases on high technology products, partially offset by higher input cost that we pass along to our customers.  U.S. Packaging operating profit of $83.5 million this quarter was down from $101.7 million last year, primarily due to the impact of contractually negotiated prices on high technology products, unit volume declines and the associated operational cost structure. Compared to our first quarter plan, two-thirds of the miss relates to volume and associated inefficiencies, one-third of the miss relates to the cost takeouts and operating performance. Here is my perspective; the way our 2017 U.S. plan was built, it assumed that we could overcome price headwinds related to negotiations with our process protein customers through various initiatives. It was the right decision to protect high margin business for the long-term through these negotiations and those negotiations also included incremental business wins that will start in the back half of \u201817. When the miss started to enter the [indiscernible] on existing buy-ins with our current customer base. We do as well as our customers do. If they don\u2019t sell products, we don\u2019t sell packaging for that product.  Our customers have faced volume challenges for a long while and it\u2019s time that we recognize that and take actions to align our business with this environment in U.S. We did the opposite coming into \u201817. We ramped up our operating structure based on forecast provided to us by our customers. However, those volumes did not materialize and that hurt our profits. On top of this, we are simply not delivering cost takeouts to plan levels to offset headwinds. It is on us to take action. We\u2019ve enacted hiring and discretionary spending freezes and we have reduced hourly labor that was ramped up in anticipation of our customers\u2019 original forecast. We will aggressively continue to pursue options to align our business to the current environment.  Moving to Global Packaging. Compared to the prior year, first quarter sales were up 12.7%, approximately half this increase was driven by the SteriPack acquisition that we closed April 30 of last year. Currency increased sales by 4.2%. Remaining organic sales growth in Global Packaging of 2.4% was driven by unit volume growth of 3% over the prior year, partially offset by mix. Looking at unit volumes compared to the prior year from a regional perspective, units in our Latin America business was flat on track with our expectations given the economic environment, units in both our European business and our Global Healthcare Packaging business were down low single digits and units in our Asia-Pacific business were up double-digits, in line with our growth plans for high technology packaging in the region. Global Packaging operating profit increased to $27.2 million over last year\u2019s $16.3 million. Currency increased operating profits by $1.2 million over the prior first quarter. A lot of details building the remaining improvement, but the key points are : operational fixes in Latin America over first quarter of last year, efficiency improvements at our Oshkosh healthcare packaging facility and the initial impact of expected benefits from our restructuring program in Latin America. Summarizing the results of our global packaging segment this quarter; we are improving and overall results were in line with our expectations. Of note, we actually performed above our expectations at our Oshkosh healthcare facility in the quarter. Operations at that facility are running to our efficiency expectations. Now on to consolidated Bemis results. Total SG&A expense for the first quarter was $94.6 million down from $99.4 million last year. This reduction was due primarily to our pay-for-performance practices and continued strong cost controls. Operating cash flow for the first quarter totaled $94.5 million compared to $52.6 million last year. Approximately half the improvement of this was driven by continued efforts to extend accounts payable terms which we expected during 2017. Working capital as a percentage of sales was 15% at March 31, a solid improvement from 16.7% one year ago. During the first quarter, we repurchased $1 million for $48.9 million. We remain committed to returning free cash flow to our shareholders over the long-term through dividends and share repurchases.  Turning to guidance. We are lowering our adjusted EPS range to $2.50 to $2.60 from the previous $2.85 to $3 fully unaccounted for U.S. business. Before purging this, I will discuss the volume assumptions in our new guidance range. You will recall that for the full year we had originally anticipated between 1% and 2% unit volume increases in the U.S. during 2017. As Bill mentioned, we are resetting expectations and we will start to run our U.S. business for the balance of 2017 with the internal assumptions that our volumes will be down 1% to 2%. We value our base of large CPG food customers but we will not stop our plans for growth given that our customers have called down volume in conjunction with continued declines in processed foods.  Next to bridge our previous EPS guidance range to our new range of $2.50 to $2.60 for the full year \u201817. About two-thirds of the decrease in EPS guidance reflects our new volume outlook for U.S. Packaging. Beyond the base margin dollars associated with lower volume, we have also considered the inefficiencies directly associated with the volume call down as it is challenging to take out manufacturing conversion cost short-term, prior to completing a plant equipment rationalization. The remaining one-third of the decrease in EPS guidance relates to operational execution in the U.S. We have reassessed the pace of our original cost takeout plan for 2017, reflecting current performance and upcoming challenges.  For example, one of the challenges we\u2019re facing is the ERP system implementation at three of our largest facilities in Wisconsin during April and the coming months. As background, coming into 2017 we have had a great track record of successful ERP implementations at over half our U.S. facilities. We knew the implementation of this three plant network will be challenging and we planned for that. However, as we begun implementation in April, we\u2019re finding it even more challenging than anticipated. Our new full year guidance assumes we will incur $5 million to $8 million impact from the implementation as we crawl out during the second quarter. To be clear, the ERP implementation did not affect our first quarter results. Regarding the balance of 2017, we anticipate that our profit performance in the U.S. will get worse before it gets better sequentially as a result of these incremental impacts from our ERP implementation. As we head into the second half of the year, we expect profit margins to improvement sequentially as we get better traction in operations. Outlook provided does include the hiring and discretionary spending freezes as well as the reduction of the hourly labor that was ramped up in anticipations of our customers\u2019 original forecast. The outlook provided does not include any cost or benefits associated with the cost reduction program that we will finalize and announce during the second quarter. Turning to cash flow guidance. Our new guidance range of $415 million to $455 million reflects our revised earnings expectations. We still anticipate working capital to show improvement for the full year 2017 and where we perform within the guidance range will depend on timing and further traction of various working capital initiatives. Our current financial performance in our U.S. segment is completely unacceptable. We will use this platform to drive real change in the way our company acts and operates. We will create a lean, nimble U.S. business to match the demand of the packaged food environment and position us for long-term success. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Bill for wrap up. William Austen : Thanks, Mike. We encountered some significant challenges in our U.S. business this quarter, but have identified three key areas; leadership, human capital and cost structure where we can drive change across our organization. The entire management team and I are committed to transforming our U.S. operations and positioning Bemis to deliver enhanced value to our shareholders. Our path is clear. I remain extremely confident in the long-term success of Bemis. What gives me that confidence? I\u2019ve already seen the change start to permeate through parts of our company.  Healthcare packaging and Latin America are prime examples. We brought in new leadership [indiscernible] and Carlos Santa Cruz and they and their teams are driving change, fostering new ways of thinking, taking accountability to new levels, bringing in new people and changing the financial performance of these businesses. We will continue to drive this across the entire organization. The way we think, the way we act, the way we perform more than ever, we have urgency and intensity to improve. We continue to move our high-end technologies around the world to create growth and develop new markets, specifically in Latin America and Asia. We have the technologies, products, and capabilities to drive this effort further and faster in the long-term and we continue to look for opportunities in new markets that will provide long-term growth for Bemis.  With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll take our first question from Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Kyle White : Hi, it\u2019s Kyle, I\u2019m actually filling in for Debbie. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to talk about the operational institutes, it sounds like you said one-third of the miss was due to performance, two-thirds was due to volumes, so I just want to confirm that. And what exactly was occurred this quarter, you talked a little bit about ERP but that sounds like that\u2019s more forward-looking? Michael Clauer : Yes, I did say that about two-thirds of the miss in Q1 is directly related to volume and the associated inefficiencies in manufacturing and one-third was \u2013 meaning our cost takeout objectives. Kyle White : And so the one-third, can you give a little bit more detail the one third related to operational, what specifically \u2013 and what you\u2019re going to do to kind of fix that going forward? William Austen : Sure. As we came into the year, the U.S. business had put in place aggressive cost takeout projects, goals and objectives, whether it had to do with waste material substitutions, material down-gauging, product redesigns, very aggressive plan and they didn\u2019t get traction within the first quarter. That\u2019s just simply put, they did not get traction on those goals and objectives and it was also a function of the volume coming down because some of those cost takeout programs are also associated with an increase in ramp-up in volume. So, just poor traction in the operation to get cost takeout projects put in place. Operator : Thank you. And we move on to our next question Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. On CapEx, it sounds like you\u2019re keeping the CapEx view unchanged for the year. At the Analyst Day, you had given kind of 2018-2019 projections for CapEx that I think were around $200 million with the vast majority of that being discretionary. If you\u2019re now kind of recalibrating your footprint and readjusting expectations for flat to down volumes, would you reconsider that CapEx guide, especially in the out years, how does this kind of change in the view of the marketplace change the capital that you\u2019re going to spend this year and maybe in the next couple of years? William Austen : Yeah, good question, Anthony. As both Mike and I said in our prepared remarks, our total focus right now is on fixing the U.S. Packaging business. And as I said in my remarks, everything is under evaluation. Everything is under evaluation including CapEx going forward as we go out into the 2018 and 2019 timeframe. But right now our focus and our intention is on fixing the U.S. and we\u2019ll address the go-forward CapEx plan as we get closer to 2018. Anthony Pettinari : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just in terms of the large customers changing or reducing their production plans, I understand you may be limited in what you can say, but is there a certain number of customers you\u2019re talking about or are there specific food categories that were significantly worse than expected. I\u2019m just asking because the Nielson data and some of these volumes have been fairly poor for a number of years. So I\u2019m just wondering what it was around the quarter or what you\u2019re seeing in the marketplace that was really different this quarter than what we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years? William Austen : Yes, good question again, Anthony. You\u2019ve all read and seen a lot of the articles recently in the past week to two weeks in a lot of the trade journals and/or some of the newspapers about how the large CPG branded companies in the U.S. were surprised and/or disappointed and at unexpected volume declines that were not anticipated in the Q1 period of this year. It\u2019s across the entire big CPG branded category base that we have seen volume call downs and volume\u2019s not at the levels that we were told we would get forecast for in Q1, it\u2019s across health, hygiene, personal care, confection, just the protein, every category of all the big CPGs that we serve whether it\u2019s infant care to feminine care to carbonated soft drinks, it was across the spectrum and as you\u2019ve read and seen, our customers were surprised and they unexpectedly saw their volumes down in the U.S. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now move on to our next question from Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Please go ahead. Scott Gaffner : Thanks. Good morning. Bill, if I look back I think it was 2013 going into 2014 you completed a relatively large facility consolidation and savings program in the U.S. Is there anything when you look back at that today that maybe limited your flexibility to deal with the volume declines here or maybe something that wasn\u2019t done at that point in time, can you just sort of give us some details on that? William Austen : Yeah, Scott I don\u2019t see anything that we would have done differently back then that it\u2019s impacting things today. We made the right moves several years ago with that facility consolidation effort post the Alcan acquisition and no nothing we would have done today would be any different. Scott Gaffner : Okay. And if I look at the volume shortfall, I assume it sounded like from your commentary it was from some of your largest customers or maybe your preferred supplier. Is there anything that you can work into the contracts so that you get more of a heads-up as to when they\u2019re going to slowing down their volume needs in the future part of the contracts? William Austen : Scott, it\u2019s a good question. Could we work something into the contracts? I think it has to do with the fact that we need to get better commercially, not necessarily from a contract perspective, but from a communications perspective and intensity perspective and get to the right individuals in the customers\u2019 organization that knows where their volumes are headed. Operator : We will now take our next question from Jason Freuchtel with SunTrust. Jason Freuchtel : Hey, good morning. William Austen : Good morning. Jason Freuchtel : Yeah I believe you mentioned that Fred Stephan has a simple and practical approach to the U.S. Packaging business. Can you provide a little bit more detail on terms of what he\u2019s already done to execute in the business that\u2019s different and maybe how and why your business operated differently in the past? William Austen : Yeah. Fred\u2019s approach is quite simple. He came in and just looked at all of the initiatives, all of the things that were taking place within the U.S. Packaging organization and boiled it down to three things. There are three things we\u2019re going to work on and that\u2019s it. Let\u2019s forget about all of the noise around the fringe and work on these three things and that\u2019s the approach he\u2019s taken to the organization, that\u2019s the approach he\u2019s going to take forward and that\u2019s what he and I are going to work on jointly as we turn the U.S. business around; simplification and getting the right resources in the right place. Jason Freuchtel : Okay, great. And then I think you also referenced that you\u2019re going to continue to potentially look for acquisitions but in the near term your focus is really on fixing U.S. Packaging business. Does that imply that maybe acquisitions are on the backburner in the near term and maybe that\u2019s something for the end of \u201817 or \u201818? Michael Clauer : Jason, nothing\u2019s really changed from an M&A perspective. Clearly at the moment, I support of Bill and \u2013 had a lot of time being invested in supporting the turnaround of the U.S. operations. We\u2019ve said before that our primary focus has been global and as you\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years, we did an acquisition in Brazil on the healthcare space. So we will always take a look at things, but clearly from a U.S. perspective at this point in time, we\u2019ve got to focus on getting the U.S. business turn around. If something interesting presents itself that makes a lot of sense to Bemis and to be run as a standalone for a period of time, we\u2019d consider it but, at this point, we\u2019re all focused on fixing U.S. Packaging. Operator : Thank you. We now move on to our next question from Mark Wilde with BMO Capital. Mark Wilde : Good morning, Bill, Mike, Erin. Erin Winters : Good morning. William Austen : Good morning. Michael Clauer : Good morning. Mark Wilde : I wonder if we could come back to this, you mentioned that you made a pricing kind of concession at some of the high value products. You\u2019ve been talking about this for at least a couple of quarters now. Was there anything incremental in the first quarter on that count? William Austen : Nothing incremental in Q1, Mark. Mark Wilde : Okay. And do you think Bill, just kind of related to this, is this really just the function of the overall market demand being lower, are you losing share? I know that there\u2019s at least one competitor just up north of you who\u2019s been adding capacity. So I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how much of this is just the market and how much of this is kind of competitive dynamics within the market? William Austen : It\u2019s the market, Mark, we haven\u2019t seen any significant loss of share that took place in Q1 or Q4 of last year for that matter. So it\u2019s a market call down for us. Mark Wilde : Okay, very good. I\u2019ll turn it over. William Austen : Thanks, Mark. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now take our next question from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Ghansham Panjabi : Hey guys. Good morning. So Bill, it seems like your customers are finally starting to capitulate volume weakness persisting on what seems inevitable is that they\u2019ll have to strip out even more cost along the supply chain. You guys are trying to take out cost by your own optimization plan, but without incremental consolidation of your own, do you think that you\u2019ll be able to actually keep those savings with that dynamic in mind? William Austen : Yes, yes, I do Ghansham. Again, we\u2019ve got lot of talented people that figure out how to redesign, remanufacture, take cost out lightly down-gauge. We might have to rebalance our effort and when that rebalancing what I\u2019m talking about is our rebalancing in our R&D organization where we have got let\u2019s say overweight toward the development of new products for customers that may or may not get traction versus the rebalance toward how do we take cost out, how do we improve our processes and use those technical resources to do that versus the heavily waiting toward new product development. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay. And then in terms of the optimization efforts and I\u2019m sorry if I missed this, but did you call it any sort of parameters to think about cash cost and also what the timeline would be implementing these initiatives both in terms of actually shutting down plans and then also the cash outflows? Thanks so much. Michael Clauer : Ghansham, what we called out in the press release and in our comments are we are committed to complete that evaluation in Q2 and report it externally. So at this point, we have not given a cost or a benefit outlook. Operator : We will now take our next question from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Adam Josephson : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Bill, just back to the volume issue, the company\u2019s not had any volume growth for quite a long time. Your customers have not had volume growth for quite a long time. This was the case under Henry\u2019s leadership, it\u2019s the case under your leadership, your customers have been seeing it for eons seemingly. I just don\u2019t understand why you would have been expecting 1% to 2% volume growth this year given what you\u2019ve seen over the last 5 to 10 years and I appreciate that your customers were saying they were going to see some inflexion, but why would you have thought that? William Austen : Adam, we\u2019re going to face reality right now, our customers aren\u2019t going to grow, that they continue to struggle. We have been given forecast from them about growth. We have been given product specifications that they were going to grow with and it never materialized. So we\u2019re telling the U.S. organization to stop, we\u2019re not going to face into that any longer. We\u2019re going to size the business from flat to down and that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to do this going forward. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re telling them to do, regardless of what our customers are saying that they\u2019re going to bring in. Our customers have been focused on cost out, plant consolidations, plant shutdowns and we\u2019re now going to get real with all that and bring our volume and our capacities and our utilizations down. Adam Josephson : Okay. Just a related question Bill, I think late last year, you talked about having hired consultant, I think earlier on the call you talked about looking for a new Head of U.S. Packaging last fall, last winter whatever it was. And it seems like these things were happening simultaneously around the same time, so can you just help us understand what exactly was going on with the consultant and looking for a new head, it\u2019s just a bit confusing, I\u2019m just trying to understand what exactly has been going on there? William Austen : Yeah, Adam if you recall, we brought in the consultant to help us with our commercialization effort, it was a quick six week, seven week program. We got that finished and moved on. We started the search for the Head of U.S. Packaging at the June timeframe of last year because it takes that long to find someone to come in and run a business like that. So it takes six months and it took us six months to do that. The two are completely not related. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now take our next question from Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo. Chris Manuel : Good morning, gentlemen and thank you Bill for the candor in this process, to be candid. Wanted to understand what\u2019s so different with the scope of what you\u2019re doing now is centered on the U.S. operations. What\u2019s so different with the international operations? You\u2019re still putting a new ERP system there, other than the \u2013 I mean the only thing that I can see that\u2019s markedly different is the fact that the volume\u2019s still are growing there. So, aside from the volume growth issue, what\u2019s managed so differently internationally versus domestically? William Austen : You know Chris, we changed some leadership in our international business over the course of the last 12 to 18 months. And when you do that, it immediately changes the culture. It changes the way the organization thinks, we brought in people from outside the industry to come in and help run those businesses, it changes the way they look at the business, they way they approach the customers, they way that they look at our ways to add value and they get those business\u2019s cultures moving in the direction that we need them to move.  That\u2019s the \u2013 the short of it is that we put in some new leadership, they brought in some new talent, brought in some new ways of thinking, they brought in some new ideas and they energized the organization, both in healthcare and both in our Latin America business. And in Asia-Pacific, that\u2019s a growing organization and that\u2019s all new blood and new ways of doing things right from the get-go. So, Asia\u2019s got great traction on culture change, Latin America\u2019s got great traction on culture change and our healthcare business has got great traction on culture change. With Fred coming in, we\u2019re going to drive that culture change in North America much faster and get out of our legacy ways of doing things and thinking about things. Chris Manuel : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. My follow up question is new product development, things of that nature. So, I get that the whole pond that we\u2019re swimming in maybe slowly shrinking, but the component of adding new products and doing new work with customers, customer activity still good i.e. I\u2019m going to make up an example. I mean maybe it\u2019s smoked turkey, hot dogs that\u2019s not going to add to a category, it\u2019s just going to change out of existing hot dogs that are sold smaller. But are you still doing new activity, can you maybe somehow characterize to us what new business and other activity is? Are you still picking up new business? It\u2019s just the existing business that\u2019s shrinking or should we think about that? William Austen : That is exactly the situation, Chris. When we - we continue to use the innovation center for customer innovations and customer ideations. It\u2019s continuing to be leveraged by our customer base. We are attracting smaller customers as we talked about in the big middle, these smaller upstart customers are coming, we\u2019re working with them, we\u2019re developing new products for them. But let\u2019s face it, when you start up a new product with a small customer, it\u2019s a small order, $1 million, $2 million, $1.5 million and when you get a call down from one of the big branded accounts, it\u2019s a multi-million dollar call down. So the new business does not offset entirely the call down that you get, but you\u2019re continuing to develop new products, we continue to have the innovation engine moving forward, but we\u2019re going to rebalance some of that right now as we go forward. We\u2019re going to rebalance more towards helping take cost out within the U.S. packaging organization, but we won\u2019t stop innovating on the other side. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now move on to our next question from George Staphos with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. George Staphos : Hi, everyone. Good morning. Bill, again thanks for all of the detail and the commentary. I guess I had to top down types of questions, first of all, if the call down effort from your customers began, it sounded like an earnest in March which then triggered all of the internal activity occurring at Bemis. Do you think you really have enough time to get all of your review and analysis and study of cost and benefits and actions done by the end of the quarter that we\u2019re currently in? And the reason I say that is, this is an important move by the company ultimately to get right.  The related question which I\u2019ll get to and kind of drives this first one is since 2015, and recognized, it\u2019s a tough environment, you all have a much tougher job than we have here just moving numbers around on a spreadsheet. But it\u2019s been a narrative where things don\u2019t quite go as well as you would have expected. The volume wasn\u2019t necessarily there in \u201815, Brazil surprised you last year, you had to bring a consultant on to commercialize the new products. So, what, if we look at that has been sort of the overarching theme, the culture you\u2019re trying to change to make more responsive, what\u2019s been driving that narrative? And therefore, do you have enough time to get it all done by the end of the quarter? Thank you guys and good luck in the quarter. William Austen : Yeah, thanks for your question George. You hit the nail on the head, it\u2019s the culture. We\u2019re steeped in tradition and it\u2019s hard to move the culture. And as I explained in an earlier answer, we moved it in Latin America, we moved it in Asia Pacific, we moved it in healthcare, we\u2019re now going to move it -- we\u2019re using this Q1 issue and the reality of our large CPG and brand customers calling -- continuing to call volume down to drive that culture change in North America whereas before it was just legacy. That\u2019s at the heart at what we\u2019re changing as we go forward. It\u2019s to change the culture to create the urgency, it\u2019s not that this too will pass, we are using this as our opportunity to get embedded with our U.S. Packaging teammates and drive culture change that really gets focused on the intensity of how quickly we can move the organization and how quickly we can take the cost out. Now to that point on the question, we started this work already, we started this work in April, starting to look at okay, how can we start to bring down the cost structure. We feel we get vast majority of it don\u2019t in Q2 and we\u2019ll be able to report out on what our plans are going to be as we leave Q2. George Staphos : Okay. Thank you. Good luck. William Austen : Thank you, George. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Phil Ng with Jefferies. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning, Bill, Mike and Erin. This is [indiscernible] for Phil. Erin Winters : Good morning. Unidentified Analyst : Morning. So your focus has shifted significantly over the past couple of years, initially being more focused on mix improvement technology, then recap and now apparently took to more cost cutting. With the value of hindsight, can you talk about where your prior strategies fell short of your expectation? Whether there\u2019s still some benefit to be added from things like recap and what gives you confidence that you\u2019ll be able to execute better on the restructuring phase of the business rather than the growth initiatives - William Austen : Yes, the recap strategy is still an excellent point in our strategy. We continue to execute on that and that continues to bring us value and our shareholders\u2019 value. Innovation, pushing innovation around the world, that\u2019s how we\u2019re growing our higher margin products in both Asia and in Latin America. We move those technologies from North America and from Europe into those emerging worlds where those technologies don\u2019t exist and that\u2019s at the core of what we\u2019re doing to improve profitability in both Asia and in Latin America. The next piece comes to cost reductions, completely driven by volume call downs in the U.S. and a footprint that we have some assets that are over 90% to 95% utilized from a capacity perspective and some that are down at the 70% range. So we need to consolidate some of those assets that are in the lower part of the capacity utilization range. It\u2019s just the ongoing evolution of how the business is going to run. We need to be quick and we need to get on it and start to get that work done. We\u2019re not going to sit on our hands. We\u2019re going to get these things done. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you. And then can you talk a bit about Fred\u2019s background as a manager in the installation business, his experience as a cost cutter or change agent. What led you to the decision that he was the right person to turn around U.S. Packaging, and especially considering prior business was more of a growth business where it seems like you can come to the conclusion that U.S. Packaging is not so much of a volume grower? And also, his prior business U.S. installation, they recently had some share gains through adding capacity, and can you talk about that impacted? William Austen : Yeah, Fred actually has a 20 year career with General Electric where he ran several businesses at General Electric that were say in the more of the commodity space and he grew the top-line, grew the bottom-line in those businesses, went to Johns Manville and did the exact same thing in the face of the housing downturn in the late-2000s, grew the top-line, grew the bottom-line in all of the businesses that he has been in. It\u2019s about being simple, taking out the clutter and moving the business toward the goal of both growth and profitability improvement and he\u2019s done that time in and time out. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now take our next question from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks. I guess just a little bit more of a longer term strategy question, I appreciate that you guys are really positioning the business towards flat to down volumes in U.S. Packaging. How should we think about the earnings power of the business in that scenario? I guess prior years you\u2019ve been able to achieve 10% earnings growth by increasing exposure to Latin America and some other growing markets, healthcare and whatnot and also deploying capital towards buyback. So, how should we look at your business from a longer term perspective, understanding that you\u2019re going to take some charges in \u201817 on restructuring, you expect earnings growth in future years to come through? Thanks. Michael Clauer : Arun, at this point in time we\u2019re really focused on just getting the U.S. fixed. We\u2019re not looking at \u201818 yet at this point in time. Clearly, we\u2019re still committed to grow this business over the long-term and we will continue to use our free cash flow as we always have to pay a dividend and buyback stock. As I mentioned earlier, acquisition growth is still important to us and primarily in our global business, but at this point in time, we\u2019re really going to try to \u2013 focused on getting the U.S. fixed, get it back on the track and then we\u2019ll come back later in the year and talk about the future. Arun Viswanathan : Okay, thanks. And so on that note then, are there other I guess tactics you can use to increase your exposure to growing markets? Are you looking at increasing acquisitions in Asia or Latin America or other areas you mentioned healthcare in the past? How large can they grow in your business and potentially offsets some of this structural weakness? Michael Clauer : Arun, as you guys know, we don\u2019t typically comment on acquisition activity but I\u2019ll just reiterate again that we at this point in time, we still feel it\u2019s really important to be an investment grade company. We look at acquisitions in a point that we could absorb it without putting that at risk and we do, as most of you know, we did bring very talented individual in last year in the first quarter to kind of really get us a lot more focused, a lot more discipline and rigor around what\u2019s in the market, what\u2019s come in the market or what we should actually own. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll now take our next question from Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. This is actually [indiscernible] sitting in for Brian. I guess the first question I had is piggybacking off an earlier question on the asset recapitalization program. I\u2019m wondering if you think that the program had any impact on some of the current recent issues just in terms of how you\u2019re aligned with your customers. And if you have any kind of preliminary thoughts on how much of a focus asset recapitalization be going forward that\u2019ll be helpful? William Austen : Yeah, the current asset recapitalization program didn\u2019t have any effect on this current call down. It was not affected by any of that. Those assets that we put into recapitalize older pieces of equipment are some of those pieces that are now in the 90 plus percent utilization range because we had the volume already to run across them. And we will continue to focus on taking out older pieces of equipment and recapitalizing where we can gain productivity, efficiency and drive margins. We\u2019re going to continue to do that, that will not stop. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks. And then just a quick second one, I can appreciate that you\u2019re very early on in the process, but do you have any sense of how much capacity you think will need to come out of the U.S. Packaging business going forward? William Austen : That\u2019s not something that we would comment on at this time. We will do that in Q2. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes the question-and-answer session for today\u2019s call. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Erin Winters for any additional or closing remarks. Erin Winters : Great. Thank you. Thank you everyone for joining us today. This concludes our conference call. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for your participation.",

Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Thank you, Erin, and good morning everyone. Our earnings this quarter were less than expected, fully on account of the sharp contraction in the Brazilian marketplace. I'll discuss this in a bit, but first, I'll step back and provide my perspective on where we are in our long-term journey. A couple of years ago, we set out to change Bemis Company to accelerate it from a company with great technology, customers and position to one that also performs well operationally and financially. We made progress on many financial metrics. Along the way, there have been bumps in the road, some of them self-inflicted and some due to external factors. We have focused on fixing the things within our control and in some cases that meant bringing in new talent to lead within our organization and towards the next level. Externally-driven challenges such as volume levels with our U.S. CPG customers and the recent incremental impact of the economic environment in Latin America take more than 90 days or 180 days to turn around, but we are absolutely committed to work through these challenges and position the company for long-term success. To say that we are disappointed in our financial results this year would be an understatement. But the challenges we are facing and the determination to overcome them have become the catalyst to make tough, smart decisions that will ultimately benefit the business in the long-term. Next I'll describe the situation in Brazil, then my perspective on our U.S. business, followed by Mike who will cover financials, and then I'll wrap up. We have a great business in Latin America, 15 plants across Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. We have a strong position serving local and multinational customers with the flexible and rigid plastic packaging for food, beverage, personal care, oral care, household cleaning and health care needs. Long-term, this region is ripe for our technology as we have the unique ability to leverage our global know-how to increase the sophistication of packaging on store shelves to provide quality, safety, shelf life extension and consumer appeal for a wide range of products, which ultimately helps our customers succeed. Shorter-term, with Brazil in recession the last few years, consumers and therefore our customers have felt some pain. Our business has fared better than others in the region, given that we provide packaging for the things that people need and use every day. Coming into 2017, the environment started to stabilize and economists were predicting GDP growth. We saw and felt that stability from our customers and therefore anticipated volumes in our business to be flat in 2017. First quarter proved just that for us, stability and flat volumes, which was a good sign as compared to the last couple of years, where we saw volumes down low single-digit. During May, the latest political uncertainty started to incrementally affect the country. Unemployment has reached astounding levels, and we have started to see a significant reduction in pull from our customers. During Q2, unit volumes in our Latin America business were down 10%, a level of decline we have never seen. We also continued to see our customers respond to consumer choices for lower mix product. Yogurt is a prime example. As consumers' wallets are stretched even further in this economic environment, they are choosing simpler, cheaper options in the grocery store. While we make both the simple style package for yogurt as well as the high-end pre-made cups, our margin profile of the simple style package is far less. This concept of mixing down is even more prevalent with today's economic pressures in Brazil. As we began sorting through the trajectory of the impact of the Brazilian economy, it has now become clear that the balance of 2017 will also be challenging. We are working as aggressively as possible to take out incremental variable and fixed costs from our business, but it is difficult to meet our original profit plans in this region in the face of the extreme declines and lower mix of products driven by the economic environment. Our customers in the region have made it clear that they are just trying to bridge to better days ahead in 2018. Although the current economy in Brazil is tough, we will continue to be well-positioned when the environment improves. We have the right market position, products, asset and customers in this region. Turning to my perspective on the progress in our U.S. business. While our earnings profile is not currently what we would like it to be, our results this quarter were in line with our expectations coming into the second quarter. During the last quarter, our teams have put much time, energy and effort into analyzing options and formulating plans to take fixed costs out of the business in order to align with the demands of our U.S. CPG customer base. Our teams in the U.S. are working to simplify the business, but there is still much work to be done. Through this effort, we will create an efficient, agile business that is positioned for long-term success. I'll turn things over to Mike now and then I'll come back to wrap up. Michael B. Clauer - Bemis Co., Inc.: Thanks, Bill, and good morning. Today, I will start by discussing the financial details of our segments and total company metrics, followed by a review of our recently announced cost savings plan, and finally I will wrap up with the outlook. U.S. Packaging segment, compared to the prior year, second quarter revenue was down 1.4%. Unit volumes were up 1% primarily in the big middle categories. The net sales decline was driven by mix of products sold and contractual selling price reductions previously negotiated with some customers to secure business for the long-term. U.S. Packaging operating profit of $80.1 million this quarter was down from $103.5 million last year due to the mix of products sold, the impact of previously negotiated contractual selling price reductions, and the inefficiencies related to a challenging ERP implementation at one of our plants in Wisconsin. Regarding that facility, it is now stabilized on the new ERP system. During the second quarter, we worked hard to meet customer requests, although as anticipated, we expended $5 million on expedited freight and inefficient run sizes and sequencing to get there. With the go-live issues of the new system now behind us, the plant is doing a good job of working down the backlog of open orders and is also concentrating on more efficiently managing the production schedule and optimizing production runs. While we are not happy with profit levels in the U.S. Packaging, our results this quarter were in line with our lowered expectations discussed during our April earnings call. Turning to Global Packaging, compared to the prior year, second quarter sales were flat. The SteriPack acquisition that was closed April 30 of 2016 drove an increase of 1.6%. The currency impact was nominal. The remaining bridge to total sales was driven by a 3% decrease in unit volumes, partially offset by selling price and mix. Regarding unit volumes, our business in Latin America saw a 10% decline, partially offset by net growth in Asia, Europe and health care. Global Packaging operating profit was $17.7 million this quarter compared to last year's $28.1 million. Currencies decreased operating profits by $600,000. Three quarters of the remaining operating profit this quarter was the result of unit volumes being down in Latin America and the rest related to mix of products sold. Now onto consolidated Bemis results. Total company SG&A expense for the second quarter was $97.6 million, down from $100.4 million last year. The reduction was due primarily to our pay-for-performance practice and continued strong cost controls. Operating cash flow was strong again at $106 million during the quarter as compared to $100.4 million last year. Looking at the first half of this year, cash from ops was up almost $50 million, driven by continued efforts to extend accounts payable terms. Primary working capital as a percentage of sales was 14.3% at June 30, the lowest in years and solid improvement from the 17.4% one year ago. Turning to details on our cost savings plans. During June, we announced a plan targeted at $55 million to $60 million of annual run rate savings when fully implemented. As expected, none of this benefit is in our current quarter results. We anticipate 5% to 10% of savings in the back-half of 2017, 50% to 60% of the savings in 2018, and the remainder in 2019. In our June announcement, we defined approximately $30 million as the total savings from two plant closures and the reduction of 300 administrative positions. We will define the remainder of the savings externally during our October earnings call at which time our comprehensive review will be complete as related to the 2017 cost savings plan. Related to the plant closures, one will begin this year and the other will begin in 2018. Work performed at these two plants will be transferred to other Bemis locations. Clearly, the goal of these closures is to take out fixed cost. We continue to analyze additional opportunities to rationalize our footprint and will complete this work by October earnings. Related to the 300 administrative positions, from a geographic perspective, approximately two-thirds of the positions are in the U.S. and the remaining are primarily in Latin America. Our targeted plan assumes that these reductions will take place over the next few years. Related to the $30 million in savings from the cost savings plan that we have shared thus far, there will be a $35 million of restructuring expense, of which $24 million is cash. About two-thirds of that restructuring expense was recorded in the second quarter. The remainder will be recorded in future quarters. As for the cash, less than $5 million will impact 2017, about $15 million will impact 2018, and the small remainder will flow into 2019. We will consider these amounts in our cash flow guidance and call out the amounts for clarity as we move forward. As I mentioned, we will define the remainder of the savings that build towards the total $55 million to $60 million target externally during our October earnings call. But some simple categories by which to think about the remaining opportunities are, plant footprint. As mentioned in June, we continue to evaluate opportunities to consolidate additional facilities to reduce overall fixed operating expenses and process efficiencies and continued diligence and overhead costs. We are reviewing fixed costs at all levels of the organization. In some cases, such as our global business services or shared services effort, we are pulling forward plants to accelerate to benefits of streamlining back-office activities. In other cases, process and efficiencies simply means changing the way we operate. For example, warehousing and transportation. There are ways to streamline our cost structure yet still provide the right level of timing and services and deliveries. We're assessing all options to align our business to the current environment to improve earnings and to position Bemis for long-term success. Turning to guidance, we are lowering our adjusted EPS range to $2.35 to $2.50 from a previous $2.50 to $2.60 as a result of the recent market contractions in Brazil. But looking at the full year, approximately three quarters of the guidance decrease relates to the impact of unit volume declines in Latin America, and the remainder relates to the impact of mix, as Bill mentioned. We anticipate that our third and fourth quarters will see some of the same volume challenges as the second quarter, but from a profit perspective, we will improve sequentially as our efforts to reduce variable costs in Latin America start to take hold. Also, a reminder that the fourth quarter is the start of Brazilian summer and our busier season in the region. Where we perform within this guidance will depend primarily on consumption in Brazil and our ability to reduce variable costs. Our outlook does include the initial benefits associated with the restructuring and cost savings plans. Turning to cash flow guidance, our new guidance range of $400 million to $425 million reflects our lowered earnings expectations, partly offset by improvements to date in working capital. We still anticipate working capital to show improvements for the full year 2017, and where we perform within the cash flow guidance range will depend on earnings performance the balance of the year. Turning to CapEx guidance, we anticipate 2017 spend of $185 million to $200 million, down from our original plan of $200 million. In our business, asset purchases tend to have a 12-month to 18-month lead time, so much of our spending is in flight for 2017. However, we are critically analyzing all capital spend and are targeting to trim to the extent possible as compared to our prior plans. We also continue to evaluate future spending levels as part of our comprehensive business review. In summary, we are more than disappointed with our current earnings profile and performance. We are taking actions through our restructuring and cost savings plan to align our business to the environment we are operating in to create a lean, nimble business that is positioned for long-term success. We will continue to use this platform to drive real change in the way our company acts and operates. With that, I will turn the call back to Bill for wrap up. William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Thanks, Mike. We have encountered some significant challenges in our U.S. and Latin American businesses this year, but we are using this as an opportunity to drive change across our organization. As Mike outlined, we are taking actions to improve our cost structure. Beyond these near-term activities, there are two additional areas we are focused on to help drive the long-term success of Bemis Company. One, our culture. We've been working on transitioning ourselves to a results-oriented organization. My view is that we have made progress. However, when it comes to the pace of change proliferating through our organization, I am admittedly impatient because I know we can move faster. It doesn't mean we aren't moving, we just need to step up the pace with increased consistency and accountability. Two, our go-to-market efforts. In the U.S., we will continue to serve and highly value our large CPG customers. Beyond that, we need to pursue the pockets of growth that are available in the U.S. market, whether that be small to midsize customers, non-food categories or trends such as organic or fresh. We have recognized this need in the past. The difference today is that we are analyzing options that would further allow us to deliberately organize our resources to pursue these pockets of growth. We have invested in the right equipment through our asset recapitalization program that provides new quick-change printing presses and splitters to serve small runs well. But we also need the business mindset that recognizes the value of hunting, winning and serving smaller size customers and orders. We are approaching this work in a very thoughtful manner and I anticipate that we will define a path forward as we come into 2018. The entire management team and I are confident that our efforts and actions will address our challenges. We have the determination and the intensity to improve and are committed to transforming our business and positioning Bemis to deliver enhanced value to our shareholders over the long term. With that, I'll turn the call over to questions. Operator : And we'll take our first question from Scott Gaffner from Barclays. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Good morning, Scott. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: My first question is really around the June 30 announcement. When I look back at it, I mean, obviously, you mentioned Brazil as being a little bit of a weaker spot at that point in time. But why not go ahead and preannounce at that point in time, given the weakness that you were saying? William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Scott, we had a nice first quarter in Brazil, okay, all of Latin America. We saw a stable environment. We saw volumes stable. We had hit our expectations through Q1. We saw weakness in the very tail end of June, and you have to think through how our customers react in \u2013 our customers that react with retail. They have to figure out what the heck is going on. So, we didn't necessarily see these call downs or this future call down going forward into the third and fourth quarter until we were through the month of June. I actually went to Brazil in the last week of June and met with several local and multinational customers to try to understand what they were seeing. And at that time, not that they all use the same words, but they all pointed in the same direction, we have got to bridge to 2018. So, actually had some large customers apologize for the fact that their back-half of the year was going to be weaker than the front-half of the year. So we were not in a position at that time. We saw weakness in some pull from customers, but at that point, we didn't have visibility to what the back-half of the year was going to look like. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And just a follow up on CapEx. When I look at the 2017 CapEx figure, it came down slightly. But if I go back to the first \u2013 the beginning of the year, I mean, you said $140 million of growth CapEx at the beginning of the year. So, I guess, I would have expected a little bit more of a pullback on CapEx, given the growth isn't coming through as expected in 2017. And then maybe you could take that a little bit forward. What are your thoughts on the go forward CapEx? You mentioned a couple of times in some releases that you were going to evaluate that. What does that mean exactly? William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Hey, Scott, first of all the $140 million that we referred to was growth and recap. So, I just want to remind you that there was a lot of recapitalization in there, which we still \u2013 it would generally give us the type of returns, if not better than we expect. As far as go forward, we're still working through that. But clearly with our performance, we are going to look for every possible way in the future to lower our spending. But we're not at a point to make \u2013 have an opinion yet on what we'd like to tell people. Operator : And we will take our next question from Brian Maguire from Goldman Sachs. Kia Pourkiani - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning. This is actually Kia Pourkiani filling in for Brian. I had a question on the cash from operations guidance. I know you called out the $5 million of restructuring, but am I right in assuming that the rest of that was just driven by the lower earnings outlook? Michael B. Clauer - Bemis Co., Inc.: That is correct. Kia Pourkiani - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And then just on Brazil as a whole, I guess I'm a little bit surprised by the magnitude and the sharpness of the demand drop-off. Could you give us any kind of incremental color on what type of customers or if there were any specific product categories where the demand declines were significant? William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Yes. This is Bill. We have very large positions in Brazil across both flexibles and rigid packaging. The large call downs of the consumption drop came across some of the more luxury items, if you will. And when I talk luxury items, I'm talking about ice cream, high-end yogurt, things of those nature. Flexibles business did not see the same type of consumption drop as we saw across some of those other categories, primarily in ice cream and in yogurt. Operator : And we will take our next question from Anojja Shah from BMO Capital Markets. Anojja Shah - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Good morning. Staying with this Brazil theme, I know there was recently a restructuring there where you closed four plants. Has this \u2013 what happened in the second quarter, has it made you revisit your thoughts there about further restructuring? And then also along those lines, what makes you confident that in 2018 volumes might go back to prior levels? William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Yes. The restructuring was all about productivity, taking fixed costs down. And, where we are right now is, we have a very sound and solid footprint of manufacturing across Brazil. We have it where we want it. And the cost reductions now will be more in the variable side of things as we get through this bump in the road that the Brazilian economy, the lack of consumption in some of those higher-end products. Again, as we said in my comment, there's also a mixed variation here so that, as some of the brand \u2013 not brands, but categories value down to a lower margin mixed product, we have got to continue to serve those markets. As I said, we have very large positions across the Brazil marketplace. And we don't see further plant consolidations, but we will obviously look for other ways to bring down variable costs and fixed cost in those areas where it's doable. Anojja Shah - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Thanks. And I just wanted to talk about health care for a second. Maybe that was a bright spot in the quarter. Can you just give a little color on how that performed? William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Health care is performing well. The issues that we had in 2016 are completely behind us. Our service levels are at all-time highs. Our quality is extremely \u2013 doing extremely well. Our output is actually very well. Health care is back on track and doing well within the business. And we will continue to invest and push that business to increase their profitability, increase their productivity and move that business ahead. And the SteriPack acquisition that we made has completely been integrated, and that is doing very well as well. Operator : And we will take our next question from Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Good morning, Ghansham. Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Good morning, Bill and Mike and everybody else. Can you first give us specifically the cadence of volumes during the quarter in Brazil for the last three months? And then what about thus far in July? And given your previous restructuring in the region, Bill, I think you announced that plan in 2Q of 2016 where you shut four plants down. Did that have any impact on your sales or was that not the case? William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: No. That was not the case, Ghansham, the latter part of that question. The back-half of the year, we see that volumes, as Mike mentioned, will be similar to the front-half of the year for Brazil. We don't see where that \u2013 we'll see it ramp through \u2013 begin to ramp up at the tail end of Q3 and continue to ramp through Q4 because, as Mike said, that's the start of the Brazilian summer, and we are hearing from customers that they are going to be pushing promotions and doing things to try to drive that volume back up again. But we'll see slight demand as we go through Q3 and then we'll see demand come back up in Q4. Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Sorry, Bill, just to clarify. I wanted the monthly cadence for 2Q specifically in Brazil. William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Oh. I don't currently have that, but it was pretty much flat through the quarter, and as we got to the tail end of the quarter, we saw huge \u2013 we saw orders drop, consumption drop significantly. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Phil Ng from Jefferies. Alexander Gerhard Hutter - Jefferies LLC : Good morning, guys. This is Alex Hutter on for Phil. I guess just dovetailing on Ghansham's question. Do you think you saw an impact of some destocking in Brazil as well with your customers' volumes down 10%? Was there potentially some share loss or is 10% kind of a normalized number? William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: I would tell you that there was destocking that took place. If you talk to the customer base, you understand how they push product into the market. There was probably some destocking that is taking place, and it was not an issue of share loss for us within the quarter in Brazil. Alexander Gerhard Hutter - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thank you. And then, can you just give a little bit more color on how you plan to source the remaining unidentified portion of the cost savings plan? I know you're going to give more color in October, but is it more towards \u2013 geared towards plant savings or more towards SG&A? And then how should we think about the SG&A savings from a segment perspective? Do they fall in the segments or on the corporate line? Thanks. William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: First of all, I would think of them more falling into the various segments. And I want to be really clear, when we announced $55 million to $60 million, we already had the projects identified. We only announce the ones we are comfortable, that we have finalized the execution and implementation plan. So we do have those projects identified, and all we're going to be doing over the next few months is finalizing the implementation plans. I don't want you to leave thinking that if something is already done, we're not doing it. We just kind of made a decision to kind of button everything up. And then as we come into the Q3 earnings cycle, we'll be able to finish the restructuring, give you a lot more color on the cost savings and how to think about it. Operator : And we will take our next question from Edlain Rodriguez from UBS. Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Good morning, guys. Bill, one quick one. So last quarter, the issue was in the U.S. This quarter, it's in Brazil. But how confident are you that there isn't another shoe to drop someplace else unexpectedly? William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: It's a very good question. And I can tell you that we have \u2013 and I say we, my leadership team, including the Presidents and P&L leaders within this company, have been over this back-half forecast once, twice, three times, four times. And we have a high degree of confidence that those things that are within our control, we have under control. But again, I don't control the Brazilian economy, I don't control consumption anywhere across Latin America. So, those things that are within our control, we're on top of. Those things that are outside our control, we will continue to deal with as quickly as possible. Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Another one on share buyback. I guess there was none this quarter. What should we be expecting going forward? And how committed are you to another 4 million shares a year unless there's M&A and so forth? Michael B. Clauer - Bemis Co., Inc.: Nothing has changed with our capital allocation process. The reason there was no repurchases in Q2 was because we were busy evaluating and finalizing some of our restructuring and how much would be used for cash. Our investment grade rating and our leverage target of 2.5 is important to us. That's why it didn't happen in Q2. But to reiterate, if there are no acquisitions imminent and we can stay comfortable within our leverage profile, we would return those shares \u2013 that money to shareholders via dividend and repurchases. Operator : And we will take our next question from Arun Viswanathan from RBC. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great, thanks. Good morning. Understanding there's some uncertainty out there, maybe you can just update us on maybe kind of a medium-term look on volume growth expectations in both U.S. Packaging and Global Packaging. Are you still looking at U.S. as kind of flat or should it be higher, given that you've locked in some volume commitments? And then for Global, do you expect to see positive growth over the next, say, 12 months to 24 months? Thanks. William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Yes. Back-half of 2017, we'll see some slight increases in volumes in the U.S. And in the Global business, we'll see a back-half of the year that's similar to the first-half on volumes. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And any thoughts on kind of stabilization beyond that? Michael B. Clauer - Bemis Co., Inc.: We're focused right now on cost takeouts. We'll be putting a lot of thought and effort into Latin America this quarter as we kind of really understand what the economic outlook is for the region. But, we're not in a point yet to really talk about 2018 and beyond. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Kyle White from Deutsche Bank. Kyle White - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I want to focus on U.S. Packaging. Volumes up 1%, it's a pretty good positive there. And then also the ERP implementation sounds like it went well. I think you called it out as a $5 million headwind relative to a $5 million to $8 million guidance headwind. So I'm kind of curious why that quarter wasn't better than your expectations? William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Yes. The issue around Q1 was volume in U.S. Packaging up 1%. You expect profit to be better related to mix. We're seeing nice volume gains in the big middle, which is what our strategy has been, to bring in business in the big middle, which is outside of the CPGs, and to go after smaller, shorter runs from customers. And that has to do with their whole recapitalization program that we've put in place. So, we are starting to get wins in that area, and we still have that headwind that we had to overcome in \u2013 with the ERP implementation. That is behind us now, as Mike said in his remarks. We \u2013 the plant has done a nice job getting the issues behind us. Now they have to deal with working their backlog down as we go through Q3 and Q4. Kyle White - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks for that. And then just to clarify, in the ERP, any other returns or savings you're expecting from that, are they in your sort of cost reduction $55 million to $60 million target, or is it a separate kind of a bucket? Michael B. Clauer - Bemis Co., Inc.: When \u2013 yes, when we are complete with the implementation, which we still have a handful of plants to go that will be completed kind of Q2, Q3 of next year, there would be some cost takeouts associated with that when it's complete. And it would be in our program management office that we're targeting to take out SG&A. Operator : And we will take our next question from George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Victoria Madsen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hello. This is actually Victoria Madsen filling in for George. Thank you for taking my question. So first of all going back to U.S. Packaging, in regards to the roughly $20 million drop in EBIT, how much of that was due to pricing or the impact of contractual renegotiation? Erin M. Winters - Bemis Co., Inc.: We haven't called that number out, Victoria. But I can tell you from a bucket perspective the way to think on a year-over-year basis, U.S. Packaging for Q2, the decline in profit, you have the SAP expenditures that we noted related to expedited freights and inefficiencies. You also have mix. Those are kind of the two other bigger items that helped make up that decline. Victoria Madsen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then going back to the restructuring program, why are you only targeting $5 million in cash outlays for the year? And does that suggest anything regarding the process of restructuring and kind of the future cadence of benefits? Michael B. Clauer - Bemis Co., Inc.: I think, at this point, we're just \u2013 in the way we look at these projects flowing, we would use about $5 million at this point in time. Clearly, a plant closure is going to be heavier on non-cash type activities other than severances and the workforce. I think it's just really, today, it's the way we \u2013 it's flowing. And one comment I will make, to the extent we can accelerate anything, we'll accelerate it. And as I made the comment on cash flow is, as we do that, we'll be as transparent as possible to highlight the changes being made to our outlook on cash flow for that. Operator : And we will take our next question from Jason Freuchtel from SunTrust. Jason A. Freuchtel - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hey, good morning. I believe, last year, you indicated your Brazilian operations were a little slow to react to some margin demand shift. Was there a slow reaction to the demand decline in Brazil during second quarter? William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: No, not at all. Jason A. Freuchtel - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Perfect. And can you expand on the options you're analyzing to capture a larger share of the small niche consumer products volume growth? When could you see some action on these options? And fundamentally, how is the interaction between those customers different relative to the large consumer product companies? William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Yeah. Jason, we're doing this work right now and I'm not in a position to announce what it is or give a lot of color around what it is the teams are looking at, but it's about speed, okay? It's about quoting quicker, responding quicker. They are shorter runs so you don't have a long run of a campaign on equipment, so you need assets focused at being able to get orders on and off of the equipment quicker. That has been a lot of what our recapitalization efforts have focused on, but we need to have the organizational alignment and people wrapped around it so that we can attack those markets in the marketplace, bring the business in and get it out the door. That's part of the big middle that we've talked about for the last few years, and we've seen wins in those areas now. So, it's just putting some more organizational horsepower behind it to get it moving, and we'll be in a position to talk about that more in 2018. Operator : We'll take our next one from Chip Dillon from Vertical. Salvator Tiano - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hi. This is Salvator Tiano filling in for Chip. I have a couple of questions. Firstly, a little bit on the cash flow. Yeah, we saw that working capital is actually benefiting you this first half of the year. So firstly, how sustainable is this? How should we see that playing out for the remaining of the year? And also, did you take into account any changes in working capital expectations when you revised the free cash \u2013 the operating cash flow guidance for 2017? Michael B. Clauer - Bemis Co., Inc.: I think, yes, to a lot of your questions. We do, when we look at cash flow, we look at the working capital requirements of the business. Number two, we made a lot of progress last year and well, actually, we've made a lot of progress in 2015, 2016 continuing in this year. I think the biggest driver first half of 2017 has been continued DPO, days payable outstanding, increasing those. I think we're probably at a point now where we've achieved our objectives and we're going to hold those going forward. I look at AR and I think we've done a great job with accounts receivable, and don't see as DSO changing at all. And then our big area of continued focus in the future is going to be inventory. We've not made \u2013 we candidly have not made a lot of progress globally on inventory, but a lot of that reduction is going to be tied to the completion of implementing our common ERP platform, including supply chain management, et cetera, which we really think, as we get into 2018 and 2019, are some nice additional opportunities. Salvator Tiano - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. It makes sense. Just clarify on the working \u2013 on the operating cash flow, did you take into account any changes in working capital on the guidance? Michael B. Clauer - Bemis Co., Inc.: Yes, absolutely. Our business normally \u2013 our softest quarter is generally Q4, so we tend to always see some nice operating cash coming out of working capital because it's just a slowdown \u2013 the seasonality and the slowdown of the business, primarily in the U.S. Operator : And we will take our next question from Tom Narayan from RBC. Tom Narayan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. Sorry. This is actually a follow-up on Victoria's question on U.S. Packaging volumes \u2013 sorry, pricing. I was wondering, when you think about the pricing, how much of that targeting of kind of lower price items that previously were ignored, how much of that is pushing the volumes in U.S. Packaging? I know there's SAP cost in there, you guys called \u2013 Erin called that out, but just thinking about what's happening industry-wide, what you guys called out last quarter in U.S. Packaging volumes, how much of a benefit are you seeing there from the kind of lower pricing in there from focusing on different types of products? Michael B. Clauer - Bemis Co., Inc.: I think I will answer it the best way. When we use the term mix, some of our protein packaging has some of the higher margins it's because of the shelf life. As we move into the big middle, those are still attractive margin profiles. However, we historically looked at it as low margin, but when Bill took over as CEO and he really focused the organization on the recap, we started seeing improved margin in those areas. But I'll go back to say that, if you sell one thing of bacon and two things of baby food, that would have a negative mix even though it's positive on EBITDA dollars. Does that help you? Tom Narayan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah, yeah. I guess, you guys called out before the kind of 15% margins long term in the U.S. and higher in global. Do you know when you think you could \u2013 that could potentially happen? Is that still the target for you guys? William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Right now, our focus is on getting the cost structure right in U.S. Packaging, so we haven't put pen to paper on that in recent history. In Global, I will tell you that the 10-plus-percent goal absolutely continues to be doable and achievable. So, a bump in the road right now in Brazil is external. It is all about consumption. When consumption comes back, and it will, our business is extremely strong in that region. It will continue to be strong in that region and what we're doing just makes it even stronger, and it helps leverage margins even greater. So, 10-plus-percent in Global is absolutely achievable and doable. Operator : And it appears there are no further questions at this time. Erin M. Winters - Bemis Co., Inc.: Thank you everyone for joining us today. This concludes our conference call.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Erin Winters, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. Erin Winters : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2017 conference call. Today is October 26, 2017. After today's call, a replay will be available on our website, bemis.com, under the Investor Relations section. Joining me for this call today are Bemis Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Austen; our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Clauer; and our Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer, Jerry Krempa. Following Bill and Mike's comments on our business and outlook, we will answer any questions you have. However, in order to allow everyone the opportunity to participate, we do ask that you limit yourself to one question at a time with a related follow-up and then fall back into the queue for any additional question. At this time, I'll direct you to our website, bemis.com, under the Investor Relations tab, where you'll find our press release and supplemental schedules. On today's call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures as we talk about our performance. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures that we consider most comparable can be found in the press release and supplemental schedules on our website. And finally a reminder that statements regarding future performance of the company made during this call are forward-looking and are therefore subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from historical, expected or projected results due to a variety of factors. Please refer to Bemis Company's regular SEC filings, including the most recently filed Form 10-K, to review these factors. Now, I'll turn the call over to Bill. William Austen : Thank you, Erin, and good morning everyone. Our earnings this quarter improved sequentially primarily on account improving operational performance in our U.S. business and variable cost reductions in Brazil. Mike will review the financials in more detail, but I will start by discussing the progress we are making to align our business and cost structure for long-term success, during September we announced the final details of our $65 million restructuring and cost savings plan. We are executing this plan to align our fixed manufacturing and administrative cost structures to the current environment and to position our business well for the long-term. Our comprehensive and through review of the business led to a decision to close four plants, reduce 500 administrative positions, consolidate office spaces and reduce a variety of other operational and administrative expenses. We have established and staffed an enterprise project management office, which reports to me to enhance accountability and ensure results are delivered on time, our restructuring and cost savings plan is front and center and we're focused on delivering its benefit, in addition to the actions we're taking to align our cost structure, we're also deeply involved in works to position our resources for the long-term strength and growth, internally we call this all-encompassing work, agility, I will turn it over to Mike to cover financials now and I will come back to share my perspective on how agility is moving Bemis forward. Michael Clauer : Thanks, Bill, and good morning. Today I will start by discussing the financial details of the quarter followed by a review of our cost savings plan and then I will close with outlook. U.S. Packaging segment, compared to the prior year, third quarter revenue was up 2.2% driven by unit volume increases of 2%, primarily as a big middle category. The U.S. Packaging operating profit of $99.6 million this quarter was down from $108 million last year, due in part to the impact of previously negotiated contractual selling price reductions and partially offset by manufacturing efficiencies and the benefits of increased unit volumes. Our U.S. operations remained well during the third quarter with low waste and high throughput which was particularly beneficial given the nice volume growth that we pushed through our plants this quarter. As compared to the second quarter increased profits in the third quarter were due to strong operational, manufacturing efficiencies during the current quarter, stabilization at one of our facilities in Wisconsin and where we had ERP go live struggles during the second quarter and lower business incentives related to the customers unable to meet their commitments to new business volume. Turning to Global Packaging, compared to the prior year, third quarter sales were down 2.3%, currency impact was nominal until volumes were flat and mix continue to trend down to less expensive packaging alternatives in Latin America, regarding unit volumes, our business in Latin America saw a 7% decline in line with our expectations given the economic environment partially offset by net growth in Asia, Europe in healthcare. Global packaging operating profit of 24.6 million this quarter compared to last year's $36.2 million. Lower profit was driven by the continued challenging economic environment in Brazil that is putting pressure on unit volumes and mix of products sold. As compared to the second quarter, profits improved in global packaging as expected due primarily to the variable cost reduction and active in Brazil in response to economic environment. Now on to the consolidated Bemis results, operating cash flow was slightly less than my expectations during the third quarter at $99 million. As anticipated restructuring of small use of cash during the quarter about $3 million for the 2017 plan and another $3 million for the 2016 plan as we close out the final plants in Latin-America that we were initially over last year. Primarily working capital as a percentage of sales is 15.2% at September 30, slightly improved from 15.5% one year ago. During the third quarter we repurchased $1.2 million shares for a total of $54.9 million. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning free cash flow to our shareholders. Briefly turning to our restructuring and cost savings plan, during September we announced final details of our 2017 plan and increased our targeted free tax savings to $65 million when fully implemented. We are a variety of projects underway; we are closing both plans for savings of approximately $17 million. We would perform at these facilities will be transferred to other Bemis locations. We are consolidating certain administrative offices in the U.S. and Latin America for savings of approximately $5 million. We are reducing a total of 500 administrative positions for savings of approximately $35 million. From a geographic perspective approximately three quarters to these positions are in the U.S. and remaining are primarily in Latin America. And finally, we are reducing other fixed operational administrative cost for savings of approximately $8 million. Examples include optimizing cost related to travel and external warehouses. Related to the 2017 plan, total pretax cost will be between 100 and 125 million of which $70 million to $80 million is cash. As to the cash approximately $10 million will impact 2017 about $40 million will impact 18 and reminder will fall into 2019. Turning to guidance, we are reducing the top end of our adjusted EPS range $2.35 to $2.40 from a previous $2.35 to $2.50 primarily an account of lower unit volumes in the U.S. and also on account of hurricane within its impact. As to the U.S. volumes during the fourth quarter, which make up about two-thirds of our guidance change. We have aligned ourselves to our cash flows expectations and their ability to scale up new business. As for the hurricane which makes up about one third of our guidance change. The primary impact of our U.S. of us related to global increases in raw material prices to be clear as we expect to establish past two mechanisms in the U.S. to work as normal and third quarter limit to volatility and earnings. However, in Latin America, specifically we will experience a raw material headwind during the fourth quarter due to the current economic environment, which has made past improve the increased input cost more challenging. And to a lesser degree on the hurricane impact, we anticipate fourth quarter earnings will be hurt by small amount from long production levels at our healthcare packaging facility in Puerto Rico due to the aftermath of the storms. While we are able to run production from generators that are planned. Our business downtown facility is in line with our customers from the region. So anticipate that the fourth quarter production levels at our Puerto Rico facility will be low. While our customer start through our own local needs. Our outlook does include the initial benefits associated with the restructuring and cost savings as well as minor benefits from the acquisition of Vadex that we plan to completed during the first quarter  Turning to cash flow guidance, we are maintaining our guidance range of $400 million to $425 million and still anticipate working capital show improvement for the full year 2017. This outlook concludes approximately $30 million of cash expenditures relating to the restructuring plants, $20 million of this was for the 2016 plan to close four plants in Latin America and the remaining $10 million for initial steps taken in 2017 plan. Turning to CapEx guidance, we anticipate 2017 spend of $185 million to $200 million. We continue to evaluate further spending levels as part of our comprehensive business review. In summary, we made progress during the third quarter, we continue to take actions through restructuring and cost savings plan to align our business to the environment we are operating in to create a lean, nimble business that is well positioned for long-term. We will continue to use this platform to drive real change in the way our company acts and operates. With that, I will turn the call back to Bill. William Austen : Thanks Mike. Agility, it involves moving quickly and easily. I would view it as a mindset. During the last couple of months, we've spent time analyzing and urgently pursuing all options for improvement. For the properly considered many perspectives, our financial results well profitable and strong cash flow, they are not satisfactory nor do they meet our expectations. Our customers, they have told us that we are an innovation leader and problem solver. We provide them with value-added products to help them succeed and they support the steps that we are taking to enhance our quality and service and provide them more fit-for-purpose solutions. Our employees and leaders, they recently completed an employee engagement survey. The result, they want to win, they want to be more competitive, they want to serve our customers better and most significant in my mind employees overwhelming indicated that they are willing to give extra effort to help our company succeed. I applaud our employees for being engaged and taking actions. We recognize that our business model requires enhancement and change. We have stated that prolong approach to agility thus strengthen and grow. High level, fix involves near term profitability improvements and strengthening growth creates the foundation for continued success of the company specifically with regard to fixing our business, our cost savings plan clearly defines a fast forward in terms of appropriately aligning our cost structure. We are executing on this plan with clear direction and speed. With regard to strengthening our business, our approach involves simplifying and better managing our product portfolio and organizational structure rebalancing our R&D efforts to focus on manufacturing improvements such as waste reduction and leveraging the investments we've made in new converting equipment. With regard to growing our business, we are developing plans to more deliberately pursue the pockets of growth in our market such as small to midsize customers and consumer and industrial applications to be clear, we highly value our existing base of large CPG customers, which creates the backbone for our business. These customers provide us large volumes and will always be part of our mix. However, as consumer preferences are shifted, the work we are doing to deliberately align portions of our production asset base and our people around small to midsize customers and non-food applications will allow us to more deeply penetrate some pockets of growth that historically our business model has not focused on. I don't anticipate growth from this overnight, but the plan we are developing positioned Bemis very well for the long-term. As I reflect over the last couple of years, we've driven change and made progress. We take out more than $125 million or working capital and implemented the right processes to hold it. We've established the framework to return free cash flow to shareholders resulting in over $700 million of value return through dividends and share repurchase. We completed and implanted two strategic acquisitions [indiscernible] and we welcome new leaders to our Latin American healthcare and U.S. businesses we've driven change and we will continue to drive change in the future. We are taking actions to improve our cost structure and align our business strategically to be successful in a changing environment. The entire management team and I are confident that our efforts and actions will provide improvement. We have great people, great customers and great products from which they build future success. We determine in a sense and committed to transforming our business and positioning Bemis to provide a sound investment for our shareholders over the long-term. With that, I'll turn the call over for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Brian Maguire : Hi, Good morning, guys. William Austen : Hi, Brian. Brian Maguire : A couple of questions on favorite topic Latin America, we were a little surprised on the comments about not being able to pass through some of the resin movements. And as I thought most of that was kind of contractually driven. Just wondering if that's not the case, and maybe it's more market-driven and less contractual than I thought, or is it a case where you're actually just having trouble enforcing the contracts due to the environment down there? William Austen : Yes, Brian, a good question. Just to give you an overview of LATAM. Volume down 10%, Q2 down 7%, Q3 which was in line with what we had expected and anticipated and we had planned for, hurricane impact, very significant in early October, particularly in resin -- one material that we use for our rigid business where we have a very high share content of customers' portfolio. It's a very strange, if you will, resin environment there on this particular resin in that there is primarily one supplier only. They push through a very large increase. And while we do have contractual pass-throughs, it's the amount of increase in an environment, yes, where there is inflation, but the inflation rate has come down significantly. And the market demand, the consumer pull for products, as you can see, is down, but still better than it was in Q2. So there's just a huge pushback from the customer base in taking this large increase in raw material. We and the team down there are every day in front of the customers pushing forward on this price increase, and these price increases. But it's particularly regarding one resin that used in our rigid business. But the environment has not changed. Inflation is -- yes, it has come down some, so it makes it that much more difficult to push that through. Brian Maguire : And so it sounds like this might be a little different than the normal sort of just lagged impact that you have which would maybe a one-quarter impact that's going to extend into 2018 if this particular resin price stays at these levels, and you continue to get customer pushback? Or are you maybe expecting the resin -- this particular resin price to fall in end of this year or early '18? Michael Clauer : Hi, Brian, this is Mike. Well about half of our contracts in Latin America are on contractual pass-throughs, the other aren't. What we're attempting to do is not only pass through early on contracts as an exception, and once it recovers we would give them back that price. And then on the rest of the business we are going after price increases. It's just, as Bill mentioned, it's just a little bit more challenging. But I think it's important to remember that we are also trying to get price increases outside of the normal pass-through. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Scott Gaffner : Thanks. Good morning Bill, good morning Mike. William Austen : Good morning. Scott Gaffner : I just wanted to -- Mike, you said something in your prepared remarks, and I just want to make sure I heard it correctly. And I thought it had something to do with U.S. volumes and the contribution margin from the volume -- or the volume leverage in the quarter. Obviously the margins are still down. And a lot of that is because of pricing, I think, from the actions you took at the beginning of the year. So if I look at EBITDA margins in U.S. Packaging it looks like they were down about 60 BIPS year-over-year. What's the year-over-year impact of pricing, and did I hear that right on the volume leverage? Michael Clauer : The volume leverage was a comment, Scott, more having to do with manufacturing. That as they start operating better and they get the volume in, we just see enhanced profits in the business. But your comment is absolutely correct that we still have some pressures year-over-year from the contractual reduction in selling price. Scott Gaffner : Okay. When you lower those prices you did your pricing analysis. I think part of it was to generate some new business as well. And Bill, you mentioned some of that having come through. Is that -- are those two related or are they just similar comments that you mentioned today? William Austen : Yes, Scott. As Mike mentioned in his remarks, we had 2% volume growth in Q3. Some of that was from the contractual commitments that we received from customers. And if you look at what -- the drop in volume in Q4, it's because some of those customers that contractually committed to volume increases are not able to get that business to us in Q4, so our volume is down in Q4 for that reason. As well as the seasonality of a normal Q4 is always lower, where volumes are softer and weaker. And it also has to do with -- we're talking and aligning with our customers around what their Q4 volumes are going to look like. And that's all a function of where the holidays fall, what plants they're going to shut down, what plants they're going to run. So we don't get some of that contractual commitment in Q4 that we had anticipated. So some of it is just customers realigning their production schedules, others are we have not received some of the contractual commitments of volume that they had committed to. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo. Chris Manuel : Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to back up a little bit to cover the restructuring and the different elements, the plans to help me calibrate some stuff. What's a base we start from? So I appreciate that you're going to have --you talk about $65 million of EBITDA. When I look -- I'm sorry, $65 million of profit improvement. And kind of if I start from -- start from EBITDA or Op income, when I look at 2016, you did about $600 million of EBITDA. If I look at trailing three quarters from when you started the process, 1Q or 2Q of '16 through 1Q it's about $600 million. I'm guessing that's the base. But could you maybe kind of give me a sense, Bill, Mike, where we're starting from. Michael Clauer : Look, Scott, what we did is we kind of took a hard look at Q1 of '17 and annualized it, which we're probably in the zip code of what you just commented on. Chris Manuel : Okay, so 130 -- it's Chris, by the way. That kind of puts me about $550 million as the base if I annualize 1Q -- I mean, I'm just -- I'm not trying to be difficult, but it's an important element to understand success that we have a sense of where we start finish from. Michael Clauer : It'd put you at 550\u2026 Chris Manuel : Okay, so $550 million is the basis. Okay, thank you. Second question is, it looks like -- and you talked about some of the softness and things in Brazil some of the regions down there, but you commented other regions were up, Europe, Asia, I'm guessing Mexico as well, and even did an acquisition over in Europe. Can you maybe give us a sense of what you are seeing in other regions, is the issues that you're having don't seem to be related within those regions, and performance there seems to be good. Maybe can you give us as sense as to how customer adoption volumes and things are tracking in some of the other regions, even anecdotally? William Austen : Sure, Chris. This is Bill. But let's start with the healthcare business. Healthcare is performing well. The issue that we're having in healthcare right now is the Puerto Rico environment. And if you're not familiar with our business in Puerto Rico it's a three-building site that one of the third buildings, which is a thermoforming facility, was completely destroyed. The other two buildings are fine. The employees came back to work. Fortunately all of our employees are in good shape. They immediately started showing up. We can run those other two buildings on generator, which we are doing. We are providing November, December volumes to customers in Puerto Rico that are giving us demand triggers. So healthcare continues to perform well, they've performed well through this downturn. And we have moved the thermoforming equipments already out of Puerto Rico back to the United States, but can fulfill orders to customers with that equipment from the U.S., so doing well in the healthcare business. Bemis Europe; though economic environment, okay, there is some growth. But there has been raw material increases particularly in nylon that impacts -- that's the high content in our product base -- in our product mix in Europe. So we're pushing through the nylon increases as fast as we can, and in a stable environment, but it is extremely competitive in Europe. We're seeing nice growth in the U.K., Spain, and Italy. And we've gotten some new wins in high barrier materials as well as high barrier shrink films. If you look at the CapEx that we've put into Europe over the past 12 to 18 months, we've installed a new press, that new press is up and running in one of our facilities in the U.K., very nice improvement coming out of that asset. If you move on to Asia Pacific third quarter revenue was up mid high single-digits, good growth in China, Malaysia and Australia and Z1 launched some new products into the electronics market for new projection films in Asia Pacific. We talked about Latin America and we primarily talked about Brazil, but if we talk about some of the other areas like Argentina and Mexico, Mexico had got probably the most stable environment right now and we are doing well in transforming the business from what would be commodity type products to more higher value products be it one of the seven layer assets we installed in Mexico over the last 12 months. If you go to Argentina, Argentina's economy is now doing better than it has been in the past. Inflation is still high, the CapEx investments that we made a few years ago 12 to 18 months ago in Argentina are now starting to drive productivity and as you look at that economy now becoming open, we made the right moves by putting in newer more productive assets in that region taking out the older assets when it was a close market, we were able to serve customers with very old asset but now that is an open market, competition comes in from everywhere and we product kind of got ahead of that with the asset recapitalization program we put into Argentina. We talked about Brazil already, from a - if you just think back on where Brazil was let's say two years ago through plant consolidation efforts that we put into Brazil, we used to have four rigid facilities in Brazil, we now have three and we can crack that volume through those three facilities, so as the economy starts to turn and we see volume increases, we will be very well positioned to generate improving profitability in that region with a rigid business. If you look at one of our film businesses down there primarily shrink films, we used to have two facilities manufacturing shrink film, we now have one. The second facility will be completely closed out by the end of December of this year, so as the economy begins to turn we will be very well positioned from a productivity perspective to increase our margins in that region because we taken that fixed cost out. So that's kind of a walk around the world Chris. That's where we are, things a moving ahead but the company is totally focused on this agility project and how we are taking cost out in the near term and how we are positioning ourselves for the long-term. Operator : We will take our next question from Mark Wilde with BMO Capital. Mark Wilde : Good morning, Bill. Good morning Mike. William Austen : Good morning Mark. Michael Clauer : Hi, Mark. Mark Wilde : Well, I just want to come back to this fourth quarter volume weakness in North America. As I listen to you guys over the last year or so, it sounded like you made that tradeoff late last year early this year, where you gave up some price to pickup incremental volume for some of those customers. We don't like we were seeing some of that in the third quarter. Now you are seeing we are going to be flat to negative in the fourth quarter. You view this as like a one quarter event, is there still these volume commitments rolling in and it's just the matter of timing or if some of this business just not going to materialize? William Austen : Mark, these contracts are in place. Okay, we anticipate receiving this volume but some customers have not been able to let's say transition out or whatever reason that might exist from some of their existing supplier. We are receiving some of the volumes. We are not transitioning all of it yet across all the customer base but we -- these contracts are in place and it's going to roll forward. Mark Wilde : Can you help us just think about sort of what we should expect Bill as we move through next year in terms of cadencing on this because I think a lot of us had assumed that we start to see some momentum here in the second half of the year and is that momentum would actually pickup as we move through next year? William Austen : Mark, we will be talking about that on January call as we give '18 guidance. Operator : And we will take our next question from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Brian Maguire : Hi, this is actually Brian Maguire speaking in for Anthony. I was thinking over the last five years Bemis anticipated slowly the progress on the corporate expense line and that Bemis explore up once again today. I was just wondering, if you have any thoughts on that trajectory to begin the model 2018, a little more detail and as you are restructuring a program certificate? Michael Clauer : This is Michael. Agility and the class take also not only going to affect U.S. in global, but they will have impact on the corporate and allocated line that you are making reference to. So I would expect to hold the ramp and to see continued decline. Brian Maguire : Thanks. That is helpful. And then, in terms of 4Q with U.S. packaging margins, margins hold up pretty well in the quarter and then 4Q you are going to have lower volumes but you are going to have restructuring savings, do you have any primary thoughts on how margins could shape up the fourth quarter with a segment. Michael Clauer : As Bill mentioned earlier, Q4 is one of our - it's probably our lowest volume quarter. So kind of year-over-year perspective margins we will just naturally decline. I think some of the improvements we saw in the quarter related to manufacturing efficiencies will hold however, you have to think through sequentially the volume down. We will take out cooling labor as we normally do to respond to that but we still have a big fix class that just gets under observed during that quarter in tradition. Operator : We will take our next question from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Ghansham Panjabi : Hi, guys good morning. William Austen : Good morning Ghansham. Ghansham Panjabi : Good morning Bill. So first off Bill on your comments you also target smaller full customer and also some of the non-food categories. How are you specifically changing your manufacturing footprints to be able to adopt towards this in light of the bank closures that you are observing at current? William Austen : Yes, Ghansham. We talked over the last couple of years about the investments that we put into this north American and know the businesses as well, most recently Europe to recapitalize some of the older presses, laminators with us that we have in the business that don't necessarily, did not have the ability for quick change, shorter run, higher speed, lower waste tied to that as though that what we've been putting into the business over the last few years with our asset recapitalization program, it now making the deliberate move, the deliberate shift in the way and what business we schedule and plan on most pieces of equipment. So as we move to the smaller and shorter, smaller to midsize customers, their volumes are not necessarily as large and as long of a run or a campaign or a press or on a laminator. So we need to deliberately move the shorter run business from these smaller to midsize customers on for that equipment. We have $0.5 billion of this business today already. Okay, we have $500 million of what we would call shorter run quicker change type of business from smaller customers. So it's not that we don't do this already, the key here is it's a deliberate shift in not just how you run the asset but in how you staff it, plan it and crew it and get the mindset of the both to actually run that business. Just think about getting in and getting it off quickly. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay. Then as a follow-up if you kind of step back and think about the supply chain and customer consolidation that we have seen over the years in food and consumer products. How do you sort of feel about your scale at current relative to that dynamic, do you see the need for further consolidation and flexible patching and also how do you think about your capabilities at currently to be able to drive some of that consolidation? Thanks so much. Michael Clauer : Ghansham, this is Mike. We are evaluating as we do this shift because Bill mentioned, it's not a shift in how we operate the shift and how we go to market and as Bill mentioned we got $0.5 billion of business already. We are going to be a lot more deliberate and changing to go-to-market side and this switch is a simplified product offering a sales force that approach its customers a lot differently and I would say that we would not - I would not ignore the fact that we might need to acquire some of these capabilities in the U.S. Operator : We will take our next question from Edlain Rodriguez with UBS. Edlain Rodriguez : Thank you. Good morning guys. Just one follow-up on that trying to penetrate the smaller customers, is the sales force I mean does it need to be incentivized differently from what's going on right now and also like how long do you think this process will take? Are we talking about that one year, two years or longer than that? William Austen : Yes, good question. We have thought about this and we have brought on some of these different type of sales people and yes the incentive plans are different and they are differently than someone who might be on national account. So yes, that is true. And as we looked at it you know it's a 12 to 18 month process to bring people in and start to see progress. We've already brought people in we've already seen progress in these amongst these accounts, these small to mid-size accounts which we would call our regional type accounts. And you may not sell directly through the account but you sell it through a third party which is a co-packer channel and we have quite a bit of good business coming through the co-packer channel already and quite a few SKUs within this co-packer channel which will be private label and that's where a lot of the small to mid-size accounts reside. So it is a different philosophy it is a different approach and we are already in motion on it. Edlain Rodriguez : Okay, thank you. Operator : We take our next question from Arun Vishwanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Vishwanathan : The question on US packaging to start off, you know the improvement that you saw sequentially was that -- would you say that any of that is related to any stabilization and center of the aisle or do you think -- deteriorating? William Austen : I don't have any data to support whether it's being on the aisle but it is -- we saw volume increases in what we recall the big middle part of the portfolio which some of it would be the [technical difficulty]. Arun Vishwanathan : I'm sorry. So then on the margin side there was a nice recovery in US packaging as well. I think earlier you had said that it would take a little bit longer to get back to that 15% level. So to understand what you guys think if margins are stabilized back here in the normal levels and is that kind of what you're expecting for next year and then similarly on global you're below your targets there so how does that play out in the future? Thanks. William Austen : As I said a little earlier just as it relates to Q4 sequentially with the volume way down margins will decline from Q3 sequentially but should continue to show some improvements over the prior years adjusted for some of them we talked about with the pricing decisions that were made last year. I think the 65 million cost take out is going to show a continued improvements in our margin profiles in both US packaging and global as we go into next year. Operator : Let's take our next question from Debbie Jones with Duetsche Bank. Kyle White : Hi, thanks for taking the questions. This is actually Kyle White going in for Debbie. I wanted to go back to Latin America sounded like bonds got a little better considering last quarter has a large drop off at the end, just want to know if that's true is it and are you seeing any type of increase in optimism in terms of economic environment there as we're heading into 2018. William Austen : Yes, good call out. Q2 volumes there were down 10, Q3 was down 7 but that was in line with what we had expected. So yes, we did see a little bit of an improvement there. Is there optimism in Brazil is your question; there is some optimism around the fact that business leaders down there are believing that the politics and the economy are becoming bifurcated where they used to be tied they now feel that they see a separation of the two, which is good. They don't see a large pick up as they go into 2018, they see stability and they see probably more so in 2019, things improving as the election of the new president takes place in October of 2018. But they do see that there is some stabilization there isn't a lot of growth. But there is a breath of stability. But I wouldn't necessarily say people are jumping up and down with optimism. Kyle White : Thank you for that and then next question is just on -- understanding that you guys probably don't comment on the market speculation, but I'm just curious your thoughts on the concept of potentially merging with another large packaging company in terms of the strategic opportunity for Bemis or do you think that's more of a distraction from your cost reduction efforts and the EBITDA statement you can generate from that? William Austen : Yes, we wouldn't speculate on whatever rumors might be out there as no one else would either, but as we said and I said in my prepared remarks, agility is front and center for Bemis Company. We are focused down through the organization on executing this cost out plans and driving profitable growth and profitability improvements through this effort. Operator : We'll take our next question from Adam Josephson with Keybanc. Adam Josephson : Mike, good morning. Michael Clauer : Hey, Adam. Adam Josephson : Mike, just one for you and then one for Bill might be you bought stock and [indiscernible] you're not in 2Q the average share price wasn't much different in 3Q versus 2Q so just wanted to know about why the time of these buy backs? Michael Clauer : Well to be honest with you part of the Q2 was the fact that we were working through the restructuring program and I was trying to get my arms around what my potential cash needs were going to be. Once we kind of finalized that it put me in a position to put another repurchase plan in place. Adam Josephson : Okay and Bill, just one of the savings programs I know if you go back to last year obviously you've announced restructuring program in Latin America you were going to get annualized savings of $16 million from that I think by 2018 and just give me the down turn in Brazil it's been hard to see those savings this year. And then similarly if you go back to the beginning of 2012 the company announced a major restructuring program it was hard to see the savings from that because of volume, pressure, price pressure, rise in inflation etcetera so -- how would you have us assess the success of lack thereof of this latest program given that with the previous two programs we have not seen any EBITDA improvement from those savings efforts? William Austen : Right, let's look at Latin America. Latin America we received we did what we were going to do on the synergies we did what we said we were going to do with plans closures on time actually pulled some over my head as that economy turns and consumption moves back into the market place again and market demand is there we will get increased benefits out of Latin America. Let's talk about what we're doing in US pack in the United States and across the entire company with agility, what difference as we've actually put in an organizational structure around an enterprise wide project management offers. We have work streams down through the company across the globe that is tracked weekly. We measure them, we monitor them, we get -- we have project management offices in each of the P&Ls that will respond back. We have leaders in charge, we have teams in place and we measure and monitor it as on a go forward basis that's a much different approach than we have ever had at Bemis Company before. We're trying to put in the rigor and the intensity so that we will get these savings. Operator : We'll take our next question from Laura Talbot with Credit Suisse. Laura Talbot : I just wanted to come back to the smaller mid size -- to reconcile that what seems to be slightly more complex organization in terms of same force production etcetera with a downsizing a lot and streamlining of capacity. You can put some color on how can you sort of combine the two be it more complex and yet it got to be simpler? William Austen : Actually, Laura it's a good question. but if you look at the -- we have a very good cross section of a product portfolio that we don't have to apply different steps we don't have to apply technology leaders, we don't have to create something new. We can take a step we have and bring it to a small to mid-size customer to provide them with a packaging solution. So it's less complex from that perspective. We do this today across the US landscape, we have regional accounts we have small accounts we sell to co-packers already. We have product going into Amazon, Whole Foods, Joe's, all the great value target brands all of these -- what we would think of as private labels we sell into that today using the spec portfolios that we have created for the larger CPG customers. So it's not as complex as you might think its selling what you have and using a stiff purpose solution to attack a small to midsize customer and solve their problem with a fit-for-purpose solution. Laura Talbot : Okay. So if we think about the plug outs, it's going to be somewhat lower margins there -- business if you can confirm that. And then second point, how big of your wallet is today, and what you're thinking about this probably three years out? How big an exposure would you take small to midsize customers? William Austen : The profile of -- we have half-a-billion dollars roughly in this space today, Laura, in North America. And we margin profile is higher than it would be for some of the larger accounts. So it's good business. Our model in the past has not really focused on it because we wanted these long runners, large volumes to run across the asset base. This is good business. We're going after it. We're going to attack it. So we'll take a good 12 to 18 months to start to gain more traction. But there's a lot of work being done behind it. And it's a function of getting more sales people on the street, and brining the business in. Operator : We'll take our next question from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. George Staphos : Hi, everyone, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Bill, I want to ask a question around the contracts in North America. And look, we all know there's no such thing really as a take-or-pay contract in the packaging business. But on the one hand you have these contractual commitments, that's how you termed it, that supposedly your customers would have abided by. And I'm still not clear what it was that has not allowed them to hold up their end of the bargain. Doesn't sound like it's just their own volume at retail, it sounds like they're not able to extract themselves from their contracts. And if you could provide some color there that'd be great. And then I had a follow-on, and then I've got a couple of other questions, want to cut back in queue as well. Michael Clauer : George. George Staphos : Hi, Mike. How are you? Michael Clauer : Good. When a lot of these contracts were renewed last year part of the pricing would've tied to delivering new good. And the new goods were very specifically designed -- they're not innovation, it's nothing new, it sits with other suppliers. And we had laid out timelines with our customers. Our customers in some cases just underestimated how quickly they could do the ship. They did tie the contracts expiring with other suppliers. So I'm just going to leave you with that -- this is not that they're not trying and they're not reneging on their agreements. It's just that the pace of how quickly it's shipping to us. Another way to think about it is real simple, I have example. This year they're supposed to give us one, next year two, and then the third year three. They just are struggling getting one, but the contract still holds to next year is two. George Staphos : Okay, fair enough. Now the other question I had, it was my interpretation, maybe incorrectly so, that the new contracts and the pricing resets were all around more high barrier product. If that was true, maybe I'm off in terms of the premise of that part of the question. I'm curious why the volume pickup that you saw in the third quarter was seemingly more in the big middle as opposed to some of the higher end. Has the higher end volume been showing up as you would've expected, maybe aside from these contractual issues? Thank you. William Austen : George, this is Bill. It's for a cross section of products, some high barrier, some big middle. Some of the high barrier has shifted. Some of the big middle has shifted over to us. It's a mixed bag across the portfolio. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jason Freuchtel with SunTrust. Jason Freuchtel : Hi, good morning. William Austen : Hi, Jason. Jason Freuchtel : What is the primary change in the competitive environment the last couple of quarters that have motivated Bemis to really attempt to expand in the smaller niche consumer product companies segment? Has it been driven by a view that the large consumer product companies are languishing and may not recover or is it that you're just now becoming more opportunistic for growth? William Austen : Jason, this is Bill. It's a combination of both. Some of it larger CPG companies are losing share to some of these smaller to midsize companies. We've done a lot of work on this. And if you look at over the last few years, the share that has shifted from -- I would say, large CPGs to the middle to small price customers, about $21 billion, and that's business that we have fit-for-purpose solutions for; we have to go get it. And it's really nothing around the competitive nature of our business. Our business is competitive. It will always be competitive. But there's pockets of growth that exist for solutions we already have in the portfolio that we need to go and get. Jason Freuchtel : Okay. And then I guess my second question. Have you experienced any initial reactions from your current customer base in regards to restructuring initiatives? Have they expressed any concerns about the production or delivery of their products as you consolidate your footprint? William Austen : No, we have not. Operator : We'll take our next question from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. Salvator Tiano : Hi, guys. This is Salvator Tiano filling in for Chip. How are you? William Austen : Good. How are you? Salvator Tiano : Great. So just clarify a couple of things on the Brazilian and U.S. contracts. So, firstly in the U.S., you're giving these price concessions. And as you said, some of the customers have trouble shifting volumes in Q4. So how should we think about the pricing, first of all, specifically, both in Q4 for them, and going forward, every time they fail to shift the required volumes, should we see kind of potentially lower volumes and an uptick in price versus our existing assumptions? William Austen : I think the way to look about it, and this is not a general statement about all new goods. Some of the price downs were tied not to the total portfolio, but however to get a portion of it they had to deliver the new goods. Salvator Tiano : Yes. William Austen : So that's how you think about it. But once you remember next -- as we come into '18 those contracts are still in place, and as they deliver the new goods, which I fully expect them to do it, those same incentives will go back into play to benefit the customers, but we do get the new volume. Salvator Tiano : Okay. So it's based on new volume to be allocated to you. So I'm guessing that if you don't get it eventually you will essentially assign higher prices, right next year? William Austen : That is correct. Salvator Tiano : Okay. To clarify also the situation in Brazil with the contractual pass-throughs, you mentioned you have the contracts in place but it's kind of little bit hard to actually enforce the price increases. And one of the main reasons was that inflation in the country is going down. And just help us understand a little bit why -- resin inflation is kind of a very discrete item especially in packaging, and Brazil has a very high labor inflation, for example. So how or why are you getting push-backs by inflation in Brazil generally moving lower when you have a very specific item affecting plastic packaging companies that is increasing your cost? Shouldn't that be essentially -- your prices should go up regardless of what happens to other inflation items in the country? William Austen : The short of this is that our customer base doesn't see that they can push it on to the consumer any longer because inflation is coming down. When inflation was at higher levels it was easier for our customer base to push inflation plus through to the marketplace. We have about 50% of the business under contract in Brazil, and we are pushing these price increases to contracted customers as well as non-contracted customers across the customer base. So it's just getting harder and harder. There's a point of fatigue within the customer base. So, inflation fatigue, if you will and pushing price increases upon them. So it's just getting harder and harder. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mark Wilde with BMO Capital. Mark Wilde : Yes. Bill, I'd like to just kind of come back on sort of potential avenues for growth here in North America. One would be kind of the topic of pouches, how big your pouch business is, and how much growth you see there. And then the other would be just as we're seeing kind of more of the grocery market move to direct-to-the-consumer marketing, what's your suite of products or the play into that? William Austen : Yes, great question, Mark. We would look at - there is a pouch, the pouches are in different area actually get dry goods and you've got liquid goods. So in liquid, our business is really growing quite nicely and that's all primarily wrapped around pouches that's doing very well and that is not just on social, but that's through the ecommerce channel as well because -- and George don't necessarily make it easy to ship the ecommerce. So the pouch business, the liquid business is doing well. If you look at our portfolio of what start to call it private label kinds of things business that has come up just within the last 12 months or so, we've got a very broad number of SKUs that are going to Amazon, Joe's all the -- as I said earlier Target -- and this we work with Amazon, we've been working with their packaging engineers to help them see ways to do business differently via ecommerce and what the packaging solution needs to be, liquid detergent, dry goods, you are talking about Renola, powdered detergent. There is a shift taking place in Latin America going away from the low molded bottles and cardboard boxes to standup pouches for powered detergent, it does play to one of our strength and that's part of this whole evolution towards middle to small size customers where we can help them get into a pouch or into a flexible I should say quicker because we already have the fit-for-purpose solution. They are the big guys; we can bring it to the small guys. Mark Wilde : And how big is that business for you right now and how rapidly you see that overall pouch business growing for you? William Austen : Mark, I don't have the specific around, specifically pouches, I don't have that data for you. Jerry Krempa : We shall mostly will stock and then\u2026 William Austen : It gets converted to a pouch. Operator : We will take our next question from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. George Staphos : Hi, thanks for my follow-up. Well, I want to talk about the new customer opportunity the smaller mid size customers you are saying are $0.5 billion so in size right now and I forget one of the other, I almost asked a similar question. I just want to dig into a little bit more typically if you are offering more of a standardized product portfolio, it sounds like you are offering fewer SKUs, you are selling to co-packers that's typically given our experience tougher not more margin accretive business. So if you could help me understand why you think that's the case especially since you have to optimize some of your production to fit that quicker change over more frequently changed over business and when you answer. When we think about the margin that really it's higher margin, but there will be higher margin when you ultimately do the retooling Bill. And then, I have a follow-up? William Austen : No, Ghansham, it's still Mark. Sorry, sorry. George Staphos : No worries. William Austen : Answered many names, so - it's higher margin today. Okay, its good features that higher margins in our portfolio today. So that's the extrapolation that we take as we go forward. George Staphos : Okay. And the other question and not to be honest same issue if we think about the pricing reset and the volume that you ultimately will win that has been coming in, in 2017. Have we more or less seen the negative effect of the pricing reset as we sit here today recognizing there will be perhaps some further just from what we would see on this side of the phone, lower margins as that volume comes in or is there a potential for pricing to further just lower even beyond the contractual triggers if you will? Thank you guys and good luck in the quarter. William Austen : George, we've so first of all I think what happened in 2016 was an unusual year and I think we proactively protected a lot of business but in return we got some new business. We always are going to see pricing pressures in the market and we have historically offset that with productivity initiatives, of course take out initiatives and packaging and et cetera. So I'm hopeful that the big risk that we saw coming into this year, was that normal and what we will see is the improvements going forward. Operator : There are no further questions. Ms. Winters, I would like to turn the call back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Erin Winters : Thank you. Thank you everyone for joining us today. This concludes conference call.

Joining me for this call today are Bemis Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Austen; our vice -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Clauer; and our Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer, Jerry Krempa. Following Bill and Mike's comments on our business and outlook, we will answer any questions you have. However in order to allow everyone the opportunity to participate we ask that you limit yourself to one question at a time with the related follow-up and then fall into the queue for any additional questions. At this time, I'll direct you to our website, bemis.com, under the Investor Relations tab, where you will find our press release and supplemental schedules. On today's call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures as we talk about our performance. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures that we consider most comparable can be found in the press release and supplemental schedules on our website. And finally, a reminder that statements regarding future performance of the company made during this call are forward-looking and therefore subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from historical, expected or projected results due to a variety of factors. Please refer to Bemis Company's regular SEC filings, including the most recently filed Form 10-K, to review these factors. Now I'll turn the call over to Bill. Bill Austen : Thank you, Erin, and good morning, everyone. 2017 was a pivot year for us as we implemented Agility. We are enacting change that positions Bemis Company for enduring success. We are making progress as reflected in adjusted operating profit that was up nearly $35 million in the second half of 2017 as compared to the first half of the year. Our fourth quarter results were at the high end of our most recent guidance, and we are confident that we will continue to deliver our planned improvements in 2018. During 2017, we launched Agility to fix, strengthen and grow our business. Our approach was comprehensive as we engaged respected partners, we considered a wide variety of alternatives, we set a high bar of expectations, we implemented our project management office to ensure the highest level of discipline and accountability for long-term success, and our team is engaged and committed to delivering improvement. Before discussing that further, I'll turn the call over to Mike to discuss details of our 2017 financial performance and 2018 guidance. Mike? Mike Clauer : Thanks, Bill, and good morning. Today, I will start by discussing the financial details of 2017, and then I will close with 2018 outlook. Full year 2017 adjusted earnings per share at $2.39 was at the high end of our most recent guidance. While the fourth quarter tends to be seasonally slower, our plants operated well and we controlled cost. Before discussing segment and total company results, I will discuss a few unique items that we recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017. First, the goodwill impairment. We previously disclosed that we were conducting an interim impairment analysis of our Latin America business, and during the fourth quarter, we recorded a noncash charge of $196.6 million pretax related to goodwill in Latin America. This reflects a full impairment of goodwill in Latin America and was driven by our lower profit performance due to decline in the economic environment in Brazil in 2017 and the related forecasted slower economic recovery in our point-in-time analysis. To be clear, while the current economic environment in the region is challenging, we have confidence in our business, our market position and the long-term opportunities for Bemis Latin America.  Second, the pension settlement. In 2017, we initiated a program to offer certain retired participants in frozen U.S. retirement plans the opportunity to receive their benefits early as a lump sum. As a result, during the fourth quarter, we recorded a noncash pension settlement charge of $10.1 million pretax. This program offering was prudent as it helps reduce plan risk and future cost of insurance paid for by the plan. Our pension plan remains well funded. Third, the impact of U.S. tax reform. During the fourth quarter, we've recorded a noncash tax benefit of $67.2 million as a result of the recent U.S. tax reform passed in December. The majority of this benefit related to the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities under the new law. Also, in the fourth quarter, we realigned our reportable segments, moving from two segments in U.S. Packaging and Global Packaging into three segments in U.S., Latin America and rest of world. U.S. Packaging remains unchanged. Latin America Packaging includes all of our food and nonfood packaging operations located in Mexico, Argentina and Brazil. Rest of World Packaging includes all of our food and nonfood packing operations in Europe and Asia as well as our medical packaging operations in the U.S., Europe and Asia. This new reporting structure complies with technical accounting rules for segment reporting and also provides a more detailed look at what we previously called our global business segment. For comparative purposes, historical sales and operating profit for the three segments is available in the press release. Further detail is also on Pages 10 and 11 of the supplemental schedules on our website. Moving to operational results for 2017. U.S. Packaging segment. Specific to the fourth quarter, our U.S. business performed well. Unit volumes were flat as compared to the prior fourth quarter, which was better than we had planned. Our operations ran well, and we managed cost appropriately. Looking at full year 2017 net sales, dollars were flat as compared to prior year, which reflects unit volumes up nearly 1%, offset by mix of products sold, which were driven by continued success of the big middle category. U.S. Packaging operating profits of $352.5 million in 2017 was down from $400 million last year, reflecting mix of products sold, the impact of previously negotiated contractual selling price reductions and inefficiencies related to the ERP system implementation at one of our plants during the second quarter. Turning to Latin America Packaging. Fourth quarter sales were down 0.6% as compared to the prior year, most of which related to currency impact. Unit volumes were flat compared to the fourth quarter, prices were up and mix continued to trend down to less expensive packaging alternatives. For the full year 2017, sales were up 1.2% as compared to the prior year. This was driven by the benefit of currencies and increased prices, partially offset by mix of products sold and a 4% decrease in unit volumes, which were primarily driven by the economic conditions in Brazil. Latin America operating profit trended down during the fourth quarter and full year as compared to last year, driven by the continued challenging economic environment in Brazil that is putting pressure on unit volumes and mix of products sold. Fourth quarter profit performance in our Latin America business was in line with our expectations. We have reduced both variable and fixed costs in our Latin America business, which has driven profit improvements since the low point during the second quarter of 2017. Conditions are stabilizing in Brazil, and we expect improving profitability in '18 and beyond from the actions we have taken. Turning to the Rest of the World Packaging. Fourth quarter sales were up 3% as compared to the prior year. Currency was up 4%, the acquisition of Evadix added 0.5%, unit volumes were up 8% and prices were up, all partially offset by mix of products sold driven by the strength of sales in Asia. For the full year 2017, sales were up 4.2% as compared to the prior year. Currency resulted in a 1.7% decrease for the full year. Unit volumes were up 6%, and selling prices were also up. The acquisitions of SteriPack and Evadix contributed a 3.7% increase in sales for the full year 2017 as compared to the prior year. All this was partially offset by a decrease in mix driven by the strength of sales in Asia. Rest of world operating profit trended down during the fourth quarter and full year as compared to last year, driven primarily by rising raw material input prices in Europe and mix of products sold. Now on to consolidated Bemis results. Total Bemis Company SG&A expense for the year was $380 million, down from $392 million last year. The reduction was due primarily to our pay-for-performance practices and strong cost controls. Operating cash flow of $379 million in 2017 compared to $437 million in the prior year. Adjusted for restructuring-related cash costs, operating cash flow was $404 million in '17 compared to $446 million in the prior year. Working capital increased cash flow by $15.5 million this year, and the remaining difference was driven by lower profits in 2017.  Specific to the fourth quarter, cash flow was less than expected by approximately $30 million as a result of not reducing inventories to the degree we anticipated during the quarter. The two primary drivers were an inventory build in our health care business to get ahead of a planned equipment shutdown in the first quarter and an inventory build related to onboarding a sizable new fresh red meat customer in the U.S. Primary working capital as a percentage of sales was $14.6 million at December 31st, an improvement from 15.8% 1 year ago and within our targeted range of 14% to 16%. Capital expenditures for 2017 totaled $189 million, in line with our expectations. During 2017, we repurchased 2.2 million shares for a total of $103.8 million. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning free cash flow to our shareholders. Turning to 2018 guidance. We have established an adjusted EPS range for 2018 of $2.75 to $2.90, which includes a $0.31 benefit at the midpoint related to the U.S. tax reform. Next, I will discuss some assumptions that have -- we have considered in our earning guidance. First, our guidance includes $35 million benefit from Agility. This is primarily driven by the actions we have taken through the restructuring program. We anticipate the majority of this benefit to be reflected in the second through the fourth quarters.  Second, our guidance assumes a 24% tax rate in 2018, which is the result of the recently passed U.S. tax reform.  Third, our guidance assumes our customers deliver their forecasted levels of new business to earn their optimal business incentive. A reminder of the background on this topic. Coming into 2017, we locked up multiyear agreements with a variety of our customers. One of our large customers did not deliver the anticipated levels of new business per this agreement during 2017, so appropriately, the associated rebate was not earned in 2017. The contract is still in place so our customer will have the opportunity to earn the full business incentive this year if they deliver the new bids they committed to transition to us. If the optimal level of incentive is reached, this will create a year-over-year delta of approximately $20 million.  Fourth, our guidance assumes normal execution of our capital allocation policy. We will continue to return free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, assuming an acquisition is not imminent. Fifth, our guidance accounts for normal inflation in 2018. Specifically, on SG&A, you should anticipate a modest increase. While we have some Agility savings here, clearly, we have inflation at 2% to 3% globally, and we are reinstating a pay-for-performance level reflective of improving profits in 2018. Sixth, interest expense. Our EPS guide includes an increase of $7 million, resulting primarily from generally higher interest rates following the forward curve. And last, our guidance accounts for business wins and losses known as a result of the long-term nature of our customer agreements. Coming into 2018, there is a specific meaningful piece of business in the big middle that we were unable to contractually resecure in the U.S. The business relates to infant care packaging produced at our Shelbyville, Tennessee facility. Our customer, whose end market is an ultracompetitive space, is embarking on several plant closures within their network and has decided to transition this business away from our facility. Our analysis showed that our assets at this facility could not be redeployed and deliver a meaningful return. We are therefore closing our facility in Shelbyville, Tennessee in 2018. The base profit related to this infant care business was approximately $6 million annually, and we will under-absorb fixed costs during the fourth quarter as we ramp down production in advance of the full closure of the facility this summer. To be clear, this facility is not one of the four we had announced this past September. Our 2018 plan includes a variety of contractual wins that offset the profit impact of this loss. These wins [indiscernible] are smaller in size and range across all of our end markets, with particular strength in liquid and protein applications. Bill will discuss these when I turn the call back to him. As to unit volumes in 2018, for our U.S. business, we are not providing specific guidance due to the unique nature of the business loss I just discussed. This piece of business in the big middle contributes greater unit volume than it does sales dollars or profit. As we move throughout the year and report units on a quarterly basis as required, you will see that our U.S. unit volumes will print down but the weight of that number is not a good indicator of revenue or profit dollars. In Latin America, our view is that 2018 volumes will be relatively flat as compared to the full year 2017 as the economic environment is stabilizing but still not recovering to the degree that is expected in the future. In the rest of world, our view is that 2018 volumes will be up single digits for the full year, with strength in health care in Europe and some decline in Asia driven by a customer who wants a second source of supply. Turning to capital expenditure guidance for 2018. We expect to spend between $150 million and $160 million. Of this, about $55 million is for the environmental, health and safety at our plants around the world and approximately $100 million is targeted for select growth projects and asset recapitalization projects that meet or exceed our 15% ROIC hurdle. And finally, we have established 2018 guidance for cash from operations in the range of $420 million to $440 million. This includes approximately $50 million of restructuring and related cash costs in 2018. Regarding working capital, we are targeting $20 million to $40 million of working capital improvement in 2018, primarily from inventory improvement. As part of our Agility initiative, we have established specific inventory goals in the U.S., with quarterly metrics and actions to achieve the planned results. I anticipate normal seasonality in cash flow throughout the year, with cash from operations later in the first quarter and then building from there. Where we are in our EPS range of $2.75 to $2.90 will depend on further movement of currencies, onboarding of new business awards, the pace of Agility growth initiatives and how our customers' end markets perform. As to earnings cadence through 2018, I anticipate the first quarter to be the lightest as seasonality plays in. On a year-over-year basis, also recall that the further decline in the economic environment in Brazil did not occur until Q2 last year but the business incentive I mentioned earlier will be a comp and that we will not absorb fixed costs as well in our U.S. business during the first quarter as we shut down our facility in Shelbyville, Tennessee. It is logical to think about the total company first quarter earnings in line with the first quarter of '17. As to remainder of the year, similar to our normal pattern, the third quarter of 2018 is planned as our strongest quarter of the year, in part to seasonality and in part to the traction we are making through Agility. As to the segment review of 2018 plan as compared to 2017, U.S. Packaging, we have planned for profit dollars and margin percents to be roughly in line with full year 2017. Latin America Packaging, we have planned for increased profit dollars and margin increases of more than 100 basis points in this segment as the net benefit of Agility fixed cost reduction and variable cost improvements flow through. In the rest of the world, we have planned for increased profit dollars and margins in the high single digits, with the opportunity to cross into double digits, primarily driven by growth in our health care business. In summary, we have made progress throughout the second half of 2017. We continue to take action to align our business to the environment we are operating in to create a lean, nimble business that is well positioned for the long term. As we head into 2018, we are focused on executing our plan to create long-term shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call back to Bill. Bill Austen : Thanks, Mike. During the last couple of years, we've made progress in positioning Bemis for continued success. We've established new leadership in our Latin American, health care and U.S. businesses who are driving the change in the people and processes to improve profitability. We've taken out $140 million of working capital and implemented the right processes to hold it. We've invested in our asset recapitalization program that allows us to pursue markets that are growing. We've established a framework to return free cash flow to shareholders, resulting in over $700 million of value returned through dividends and share repurchase. We've added Emplal, SteriPack and Evadix to our global portfolio, each positioning us well for the long term in their respective markets. And through Agility, we are creating a cost-effective and more disciplined structure that is positioned to capture growth. Looking at 2018. We will deliver the financial improvement plan we've laid out, but equally as important, we are also setting the stage for a profitable growing company in the years to come. Agility, fix, strengthen and grow is what drives that. High-level fix involves near-term profitability improvement, and strengthen and grow create the foundation for continued success. At its core, Agility is about working differently to quickly and confidently respond to changes in the market and make the internal changes needed to drive growth for Bemis. There are a variety of work streams underway that lay the foundation for growth and long-term value creation. First, I'll start by discussing the framework we have established. We have identified 10 areas of focus. The range -- these range in topic from best-in-class quality and service that exceeds our customers' expectations to managing our product portfolio and organizational structure, to targeting growth through short-run business. Each of these key areas has a fully vetted work stream that defines the deliverable and lays out the road map for success. Each work stream is owned by a specific leader within our business who has a full support team assigned to the area of focus. As to accountability framework, our project management office reports to me and is responsible for ensuring each milestone is delivered on time and on budget. We have made real progress within many of these work streams. With regard to fix, we are executing our cost reduction plans, and we will see a $35 million benefit in 2018 from optimizing manufacturing capacity and from reducing our SG&A cost structure through actions such as consolidating office space, reducing 262 administrative positions and eliminating our aviation cost center. With regard to supporting the strengthen aspect of Agility, we have bolstered our North American operations by bringing in new talent in the last six months for over a dozen critical roles in operations, supply chain, capacity planning and quality. With regard to grow, we are laying a foundation in our U.S. business to deliberately pursue pockets of growth through the creation of what we call \"agile lane\", which aligns our people, processes and assets to excel in short-run business that exists at large customers, small customers and medium-sized customers. We have established customer service representatives to support this business. We are actively in the market with a streamlined set of specifications or what we call core specs. We have a quick quoting procedure in place, and we have established certain manufacturing assets as dedicated to servicing short-sized runs. As we become simpler, quicker and easier to work with, we are able to more deeply penetrate pockets of growth such as short run business and nonfood applications that historically our U.S. business model had not focused on. Through Agility, we are taking actions to improve our cost structure and align our business strategically to be successful in a changing environment and for the long term. As we come into 2018, we are focused on delivering the opportunities in front of us. While we do have some headwinds, as Mike mentioned, we have also won some great pieces of business that we -- will help offset. A few examples of the new business we brought in for 2018 : $10 million award for individual-size creamer cup, $25 million award for fresh red meat packaging, a $20 million award for consumer and industrial packaging, a $9 million award for laminated cosmetic tubes in Latin America and a $10 million award won with core specs at a large customer. We continue to innovate, and we continue to press on new business. Our business has a solid foundation to build from, a world-class customer base, a dedicated workforce that is committed to improving, a comprehensive and innovative product portfolio and a good position in the markets we serve. During 2018, we are taking actions to build on the strong foundation to create value for our shareholders over the long term. We are committed and determined to improve and to regain credibility. We will execute this plan in 2018. With that, I'll turn the call over for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And first, from Baird, we have Ghansham Panjabi. Ghansham Panjabi : So, it sounds like, obviously, there's several puts and takes on volumes for U.S. Packaging in '18. Is -- just to clarify, is the business loss in infant care a function of the customer consolidating suppliers or just sort of realigning their own footprint that, that impacted a dedicated plant on your end? Bill Austen : A combination of both, Ghansham. They're consolidating suppliers due to the fact that they're shrinking the size of their footprint. Ghansham Panjabi : So, did you -- were you able to rebid for that business that you just lost out on? Or... Mike Clauer : We couldn't be competitive enough, Ghansham, so... Ghansham Panjabi : And then just a second question. Bill, you had mentioned the pilot that you have for your short-run businesses. Can you sort of expand on that? Do you envision each of your plants, over time, to build those capabilities? And also, is the short-run process something that you should think about for some of the international businesses that you have as well? Bill Austen : Yes. Ghansham, we will be looking to -- as we get through this pilot in this one -- in two segments that we're in right now, we'll look to put it into other segments, and that may cascade to other plants. And if you look at some of the international businesses that we have, it is short-run business already. They don't have necessarily the large campaigns that the North American business has had over the years. But to answer the question on the front end, yes, we will look to put pilots and agile lanes across the plants if it's appropriate. Operator : And moving on, our next question comes from Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Connor Robbins : This is actually Connor Robbins sitting in for Brian Maguire. I just had two questions, if I could, the first one relating to just kind of pursuing various pockets of growth. I know you guys mentioned this a few times in the press release and on the call. I was wondering if I could get a little more color on where exactly those pockets of growth are, if they're in certain end markets or just nonfood categories. Bill Austen : Yes, good question. So, if you were to look at large food and beverage customers, large food and beverage customers have short-run business. Our model over the years has always been to go after the long-run business there and not necessarily be focused on the short run. If you do the analytics of large food and bev customers, there's about a $2.2 billion opportunity for short-run types of business at large food and bev customers. If you bring that down to small- to medium-sized customers, the opportunity exists for about $3.2 billion of market, if you will, that exists at the middle to small-sized customers for short run. So, the analytics we've done, we've peeled that back and said, okay, where do we play? We play across those segments with those customers. But to really focus on short runs, we wanted to shrink down the spec portfolio because you can't have a wide cross-section of specs to focus on short runs. That's why we got to the core spec. So, we've dialed our large spec portfolio down. The core specs -- those core specs focus on short-run business that -- which are the pockets of growth. And then one further spot is the nonfood, which we might call commercial and industrial. The market opportunity there would be about a $1.1 billion size, and again, it's using those core set of specifications that we have inside of our larger spec book. Connor Robbins : And then one more, if I could. Just looking at kind of your CapEx guidance, a little bit lower from the 2017 year. And I was just kind of wondering if I could get a little more color on that as well. I think you guys were trying to do some more asset recapitalization. And given the [coded] depreciation that -- benefit that you should get from the new tax law, I guess, could you help me understand why that might be a little bit lower than 2017's? Bill Austen : Yes. We've put in some healthy capital investments over the last few years, and we're going to absorb those growth -- those pieces of growth capital that we've put in as we go through '18 and '19. We're going to continue on the recapitalization aspect of our CapEx program, but it's really just dialing back on the growth because we've put in growth assets that we now have to absorb. Operator : Our next question will come from Scott Gaffner with Barclays. John Dunigan : Hi good morning, this is actually John Dunigan on for Scott. Just to build on that CapEx question. Would you consider the $150 million to $160 million a more normalized rate going forward or just that you're absorbing those -- that CapEx spend from prior years that we could see that increasing going forward? Bill Austen : I think you can think about the $150 million to $160 million in the near term and then stretching it out a little further, maybe $150 million to $180 million. John Dunigan : And then I heard that the -- I think it was Mike saying that the volumes in Brazil are expected to be flat in 2018 and up single digits in the restructuring of world. But I missed the -- I guess, either the U.S. expectation on demand in 2018, and I don't think it was mentioned kind of where demand was in January across the segments. Mike Clauer : I made the comment specifically to the U.S., was that -- because of the loss of the infant care product that was a lot of units of volume but it's very light on revenue, it's not the right barometer of how we look at it. So, what we'd said is, as we proceed through the year, we'll -- and we're required to report volumes, we will discuss that specifically adjusting for infant care. But I would think about revenue kind of flattish in U.S. Packaging. Operator : Moving on, from Citi, we have Anthony Pettinari. Bryan Burgmeier : This is actually Bryan Burgmeier sitting in for Anthony. Looking at the old Global Packaging segment, and you have a long-term target, it was 10% EBIT margins. Understanding there's still some work to be done with the two new segments, do you expect them to kind of approach the same level of 10% longer term? Or have expectations been recalibrated a little bit? Mike Clauer : I think the way I look at it is the 10% is -- getting to the 10% and exceeding it is still the right way to think about it. As I mentioned, rest of world at the midpoint of our guidance is going to be high single digits, with the possibility of popping over 10% this year. And then in Latin America, I made the comment that -- think about at least 100 basis point improvement in that region. Bryan Burgmeier : And then you talked about some of the new business wins. I was wondering if you can characterize the margin profile. Are those mostly in the big middle that you guys are trying to go after? Are those kind of in line with Bemis' margins currently? Bill Austen : Yes. Some of those wins are in the big middle, and some of the wins are in -- would be in the top of the triangle in the higher-margin protein. Obviously, the fresh red meat, the creamer cup award is for a proprietary material called Evolution, which has got higher margin profiles. And the cosmetic tubes in Latin America would have a higher margin profile. Operator : Our next question is from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : Maybe I can just get an idea of how you're looking at that agile lane opportunity. How much of your business do you think you can kind of move into that area? And what's the timing on kind of the cadence of how that flows through? Bill Austen : Right now, we're running a pilot, right? So, we're being very measured on this pilot. We're making sure that we can execute on it and that we can deliver. And we'll run another pilot as we go into the second quarter in another segment. So, we're being very measured and thoughtful on that right now. We have not mapped out the cadence to what that's going to look like. Arun Viswanathan : And you also mentioned that you are considering M&A or you would only return capital if there are no M&A opportunities. What are you seeing on that side? And again, is there any kind of timing that you'd expect to consummate any transactions? Mike Clauer : You're aware we don't really comment on anything specific. But we are very active as far as evaluating -- exploring areas for growth, as Bill talked about. These small run -- short-run businesses, if something interesting comes along that's particularly good at that, we would look at an asset like that as a way to accelerate our initiatives. Operator : Moving on, we have Kyle White with Deutsche Bank. Kyle White : I'm just curious about your thoughts on the pricing environment in the U.S. in the post-tax reform world. And maybe we've already seen a little evidence of this with the infant care customer you called out. But are you seeing it become more competitive, with some companies potentially using savings to kind of invest in price and lower pricing? Bill Austen : I can't specifically address that relative to the tax environment. But we're in a very competitive environment in packaging, and it's going to continue to stay that way, whether we have tax reform or not. Kyle White : That's right. I was just curious if you've seen it kind of increase. I also wanted to do a double check. I'm not sure if Mike said this in the prepared remarks, but for U.S. Packaging, did you say that profit dollars are expected to be flat year-over-year in 2018? Just wanted to make sure I didn't hear that wrong. And if that's the case, can we get some of the puts and takes? Because I would imagine that most of the restructuring savings would flow through this segment, but some color on that. Mike Clauer : My comment was that you should be thinking margin percents would be flat '17 to '18 for U.S. Packaging. And then just kind of further on, I mean, I think your assumption is -- yes, I would think about approximately 70% of the Agility savings are in our U.S. business, which would also -- would include corporate, and the remainder is primarily in Latin America. Operator : Our next question is from Edlain Rodriguez with UBS. Edlain Rodriguez : A quick one on Brazil. Maybe you said it and I missed it. Like what was volume in 4Q? Because volume was down 10% in second quarter, 7% in 3Q. Like what was it in 4Q? And also, can you remind us like how big is Brazil in the Latin American segment? Mike Clauer : I didn't hear your second question, but let me answer your first question real quick. Unit volumes were flat in Q4 in Latin America, and for the year, they were down 4%. And if you could repeat your second part of that question. Edlain Rodriguez : Yes. If you could remind us again like how big is Brazil in the Latin American segment now. Mike Clauer : Well, it's probably, what, well over half, probably 60%. Operator : And next, from KeyBanc, we have Adam Josephson. Michael Leblanc : This is actually Michael Leblanc sitting in for Adam. With regard to your cash flow guidance, can you just talk about what you expect in terms of that cash tax benefit in 2018 and, relatedly, what your cash tax rate will be in 2018 versus where you were in '17? Mike Clauer : Yes, I could talk. If you just kind of think about it, reform in and of itself is about a $30 million savings. However, we have improved profitability in our 2018 guide, so the actual year-over-year cash savings -- dollar savings is about $10 million. Operator : Next, from SunTrust, we have Jason Freuchtel. Jason Freuchtel : I believe, in the past, you indicated that through your asset recapitalization efforts, they allowed for quicker changeovers and shorter runs. What percentage of your assets would you characterize currently have those capabilities that could support smaller to midsized customers? And where are the greatest opportunities? Bill Austen : Yes. Jason, I'm going to make an estimate here for you. It's probably 10% to 20% of our assets would be in the quicker changeover, shorter runs, and the opportunity there is really on the printing side. That's where the opportunity exists to drive that productivity. Jason Freuchtel : And I guess, just following up on that one. What -- I guess, relatively speaking, what percent of your total assets are currently dedicated to the printing space? Bill Austen : Jason, I wouldn't even wager a guess on that. Probably somewhere around 40% if you look at what we've got from a filmmaking perspective around the world. I'm trying to give you a global number here, so it's probably somewhere in the 40% range. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo Securities. Gabrial Hajde : This is actually Gabe Hajde sitting in for Chris. Two quick ones, I'm hoping. One is, Mike, can you clarify the volume rebate discussion? It sounded like, if I heard you right, that they did not hit in 2017 but you do anticipate that they hit the volume requirement in '18. And if that, in fact, does happen, that would result in a $20 million headwind. Again, I'm assuming that's a volume rebate. Mike Clauer : That is correct. And just to kind of think about it, the rebate's over the entire business, not just -- but it's earned as a result of delivering the new business. So, the way we've guided and the way we've developed our plan is that we will get the new business and we will pay the award, which didn't happen in 2017. But going into '18, that's how we've planned. So, you're correct. Gabrial Hajde : So, if I take the 70% of the $35 million in savings, those are sort of offset, and then the other varying factors for the year would be how volumes perform, manufacturing and stuff like that, inflation. Would those kind of be the different buckets for what profit would do? Okay. And then if you can provide a little bit of clarity, maybe try to size up for us the business, I think you mentioned, in Asia. Was that related to the Foshan acquisition, that customer dual sourcing? And again, how big that might be? Mike Clauer : It's one large customer that we've had -- we've done 100% of their requirements, and they have made the decision they need a secondary supplier for a small percentage of their business. But I'm not going to really comment on the size at all. The comment is really it kind of probably offset. So, if you think about Asia, the GDP is 6%-ish and we'll probably be flat in the region to give you some color. Operator : Next, from Vertical Research, we have Chip Dillon. Salvator Tiano : This is Salvator Tiano filling in for Chip. So, a couple of questions. The first one is in rest of the world, in organic growth. I've seen your slides that volumes were up 8%. Selling price were up. Yet, mix led to a 1.5% decline. So, I was wondering, can you give me some color as to what happened? What were these big downgrades that essentially offset probably what was single-digit selling and volume growth? Mike Clauer : I think -- the way to think about it is, in Asia, the margin profile is still -- is very different than it would be in Europe or in healthcare because food safety standards are emerging in that region of the world. So, if Asia is growing faster than healthcare and Europe, it would have negative mix on our business. Salvator Tiano : And the other thing I want to ask is -- Q3, you essentially bought back quite a few shares, and Q4, my understanding is you didn't purchase any back. Just wondering, what was your thought process in making that decision? Mike Clauer : Our thought process was really we're very cognizant of our investment-grade rating. And -- but we are starting to use cash for some restructuring and just felt that we didn't want to go above the 2.5 to 2.7 times. Operator : Our next question comes from Anojja Shah with BMO Capital Markets. Anojja Shah : I wanted to go back to Brazil. We're seeing signs of pickup in other packaging markets in Brazil. Like I think the cardboard box volumes came out today. They were up 4% to 5%. Why do you think your experience there is different and you haven't seen a pickup yet? Bill Austen : What we're saying is we're seeing stable volumes in Latin America. Our customers are -- we're stable with our customers, and our rigid business is in good shape. Our flexibles business is in good shape. We have a good position in both. We have high shares with those customers. And we are just being steady as she goes with Brazil. Anojja Shah : And then switching over to share repurchases. Any thoughts on the future cadence of that 20 million authorizations? I think you probably have about 18 million shares left. How should we think about that? Mike Clauer : Well, how I would think about it like for '18 specifically, our capital allocation policy says we will return free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. If you think about the midpoint of our guide next year, free cash flow after dividends would be about $160 million to $170 million of cash. That would be used to repurchase shares if there was no acquisition imminent. But to reiterate, we are -- our philosophy is not to lever up but accelerate that buyback. We'll return it as the year progresses. Operator : Moving on, from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, we have George Staphos. Molly Baum : So, this is Molly Baum sitting in for George. I know you had mentioned a bit about mix, and we noticed that it was down in the U.S. as well. Could you give a little bit more color just on the negative mix in U.S. Packaging and what was going on there? Mike Clauer : The way we think about it is as we grow what we call the big middle categories, their margin profile, although it be good, is not the same margin profile as our protein packaging. So, it's -- the inverse side of it is still EBITDA dollar growth, which is what's important to us. Operator : Next, from Barclays, we'll move back to the line of Scott Gaffner. John Dunigan : It's still John Dunigan. I just -- I had two questions. One, in the guidance, there was the $50 million of cash restructuring. But is this the remainder of the $75 million to $85 million? Or should we expect more of the cash restructuring cost in 2019? Mike Clauer : It's a pretty good chunk of it, but there will still be some additional in '19. John Dunigan : And then thinking about some of the headwinds in 2018, a lot of packaging companies have talked about freight inflation being a particular concern. Could you give the breakout between truck and rail transportation costs, if you expect to see kind of a large headwind going into 2018 with those and if any of those get contractually passed through? Mike Clauer : First of all, I think in -- I'll talk in the U.S. Very little of our shipments to our customers is done by rail. It's primarily by truck, and that has been -- the increase in rates has been contemplated in our guidance. And as you're fully aware, most of our raw materials come in on rail. So, we've contemplated that in our guidance. Operator : Next, we'll move to a follow-up from Edlain Rodriguez with UBS. Edlain Rodriguez : A quick one on raw materials. I mean, I think, last quarter, you've mentioned like the challenges you had in Brazil in passing through higher costs. Like are you seeing the same issue? Like has that abated somewhat, given that volume is picking up somewhat? Bill Austen : Yes. We haven't seen a recent issue with raw materials in Brazil. It was the hurricane-related issue back in late third or early Q4 where raw materials spiked in Brazil. Edlain Rodriguez : And similarly, in Europe, I mean, I think you kind of mentioned that there was some rise in prices there, in rest of the world. But are you able to automatically pass all those costs? Or is there something else going on there? Mike Clauer : The European market's very -- is not the same as the U.S. market. So over there, you really have very few passthrough mechanisms, by definition. And in our particular case, in 2017, it was a pretty big run up in nylon, which is something we use in our film, and it's just something -- it was hard to recover it. We've recovered some of it as the year progressed, but we're not able to get all of it recovered. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Freuchtel with SunTrust. Jason Freuchtel : First, it looked like your R&D expense declined slightly in the fourth quarter. Do you plan on dialing back on your R&D efforts as you work through your restructuring efforts? Or could you actually increase your R&D efforts to support and win additional higher-margin business? Bill Austen : Yes. Jason, what we've done with R&D is we've done some rebalancing with -- of our R&D resources and applied some of those R&D engineers into the operation to help drive some of the Agility charters that relate to productivity and cost out. And we continue to have a very robust product pipeline of new products and new applications for customers that are being rolled out. Jason Freuchtel : And then secondarily, what drove the higher other income in 4Q '17? And do you expect that to persist into 2018? Erin Winters : Jason, that was primarily by a sale of a piece of property. So, in 2018, you can think about that line in total being roughly the average of the last couple of years. Operator : Moving on, from Vertical Research, we'll hear from the line of Chip Dillon again. Salvator Tiano : So just wanted to ask a little bit of a bigger picture. Excluding the tax rate, the EPS guidance implies some growth, in the low $2.50s from almost $2.40 right now. But essentially, everything is from the restructuring savings. So how are you thinking longer term, in 2019 or even 2020, about operating profitability increasing through growth again? Because, 2018, there is growth even net of tax but it is solely due to restructuring savings. Bill Austen : Yes. Right now, we are focused on the 10 work streams in Agility, of which there are growth charters. That is what we call them. Work stream is -- would be a charter and they are -- that are focused on growth, as I mentioned earlier, in the short-run business, that large food and bev, medium and small food and bev, and commercial and industrial. And they gain traction as we go through '18, and we start to see more of that growth as we get into '19 and beyond. Salvator Tiano : And just a minor item here on foreign earnings. Is there any guidance you can provide if you will pay any cash tax for the repatriation? And what would be the schedule over the next few years? Mike Clauer : It's about $10 million over the next few years. Salvator Tiano : $10 million per year or $10 million in total? Mike Clauer : Total, total. And that's been contemplated in the tax rate. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we have no further questions from the audience. I would like to turn the floor back to Erin Winters for just any additional or closing remarks. Erin Winters : Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. This concludes our conference call. Operator : Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's program. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Thank you, Erin, and good morning, everyone. We delivered a solid start to 2018. Our financial performance exceeded our internal plan for the quarter, driven by Agility savings and improving operations. Through Agility, changes taking place. We are driving new levels of discipline and rigor into our business and we are holding ourselves accountable through our project management office. The Agility mindset to fix, strengthen and grow Bemis is becoming part of our everyday actions. We are meeting the milestones we set for all Agility work streams. Two of the four plant consolidations are now complete and the associated business has been absorbed at other facilities. We have implemented travel related cost reductions, including the elimination of our aviation cost center. We have reduced more than 300 administrative positions. We are exiting leased office spaces and utilizing existing facilities and we are implementing a variety of other cost reductions to align our business with the environment we are in and to position our business well for the long run. Our teams are stepping up to the challenge to improve our business in accelerated ways. For example, we delivered ahead of our first quarter Agility savings plan by moving up the timeline for the elimination of certain administrative positions. Our teams are energized and taking action to drive value for the long-term. We continue to expect $35 million of Agility related savings in 2018 that contribute to the total plan savings of $65 million by the end of 2019. Turning to financial performance in our segments. Our U.S. business delivered a solid quarter. Compared to last year, operating profit increased nearly $4 million, a step in the right direction. Agility is improving operations provided net benefit to the bottom line. Our plants ran well again this quarter. Costs were managed well at our Shelbyville, Tennessee facility during the initial ramp down of production of the infant care business. We also did a great job of managing our capacity in Shelbyville by temporarily balancing another plants production need. A great example of how our teams in the U.S. are embodying the Agility mindset of working differently to quickly and confidently respond to changes. Our Latin America business delivered on plan for the quarter. Compared to last year, sales and profits were down, a result of the incrementally challenging economic environment in Brazil that started during the second quarter of last year. We continue to view the environment for our business in Brazil as stabilizing. We are executing our planned cost reductions in the region, and our business will be well-positioned as the economic environment improves. Our Rest of World business delivered a strong quarter. Compared to last year, operating profit increased approximately $3 million, driven by performance in our global healthcare business. We saw strong organic growth in our healthcare business, and we leveraged that volume operationally to deliver high quality and service to our customers and to benefit our bottom line. I'll turn the call over to Mike now to review our financials and then I'll come back for a wrap up. Michael B. Clauer - Bemis Co., Inc.: Thanks, Bill, and good morning. Today I will discuss the financial details of our segments in total company, followed by comments on the balance of 2018. U.S. Packaging segment. During the first quarter, our U.S. business performed well and delivered improvement compared to one year ago. Sales dollars were up 2.6% compared to the prior year, reflecting higher selling prices partially offset by unit volume decline of 1%, directionally in line with our expectations. Excluding the impact of the initial ramp down of our Shelbyville, Tennessee facility, unit volumes for the U.S. segment would have been flat. U.S. Packaging operating profit of $87.2 million increased from $83.5 million last year, driven by the benefits of Agility and improving operations, partially offset by volume freight costs and incentives committed to our customers. Our operations ran well and we managed cost appropriately. Turning to Latin America Packaging. First quarter sales were down 4.8% as compared to the prior year, almost entirely from the currency impact. Selling prices were up high-single-digits, offset by unit volumes down 8%, driven by economic conditions in Brazil as we had anticipated. Recall that the incremental decline in the economy started during the second quarter of 2017. So, our current quarter compares to a much different environment last year. Latin America operating profit was down during the first quarter compared to last year as a result of lower volumes driven by the challenging economic environment in Brazil. First quarter profits improved sequentially versus the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of the variable cost actions we have taken in the region. First quarter performance was in line with our expectations and on pace to achieve our full-year improvement targets in the region. Turning to Rest of the World Packaging. First quarter sales were up 13.9% compared to the prior year. Currency impacted at 8.8%. The acquisition of Evadix added 1.1%, leaving organic growth at 4%. Unit volumes were up 12% with volume growth in Europe and Asia and global healthcare businesses. Volume benefit was partially offset by price and mix given particular strength of sales in Asia. Rest of World Packaging operating profit increased to $16.5 million as compared to $13.6 million in the prior first quarter. This improvement was driven by our healthcare packaging business where volumes grew and operations ran well. Now onto consolidated Bemis results. Total company SG&A expense for the first quarter was $96.9 million as compared to $96 million in the prior first quarter. Excluding the impact of currency, SG&A expense was down slightly compared to last year. You should continue to anticipate full year 2018 SG&A expense to increase modestly. While we have Agility savings here, we also have inflation of 2% to 3% globally, as well as the impact of exceeding annual pay for performance targets in our 2018 plan. Total company research and development expense was $10 million compared to $12.5 million in the prior year. The decrease was driven by certain administrative positions that were eliminated through Agility, some rebalancing of resources to operations and the timing of projects. We anticipate full year 2018 R&D to be in line with last year. Interest expense was $18.9 million compared to $16 million last year, a result of increased rates. Income taxes for the first quarter was 23.8% as compared to 31.2% the prior year, driven primarily by lower rates due to the U.S. tax reform. Operating cash flow of $54.3 million this quarter compared to $94.5 million the prior year. Restructuring and related cash costs were $9 million this quarter and $6 million one year ago. The primary change in operating cash flow versus one year ago relates to the benefit of extended payable terms during the first quarter of last year. You may recall that we aggressively went after improving DPO in 2015 and the last round of improvement came through in 2017. I'm pleased that we have maintained these terms with suppliers. We did see inventory days come down slightly since year-end, directionally in line with our plans for 2018. Primary working capital as a percentage of sales was 15.7% in March 31, within our target range of 14% to 16%. Capital expenditures for the first quarter totaled $46.2 million. We continue to anticipate full year CapEx between $150 million to $160 million. During the first quarter, we did not repurchase any shares, we are cognizant of our leverage metrics and we will not delever \u2013 we will not lever up to buy shares. We will continue to return free cash flow to our shareholders in line with our capital allocation policy. Turning to comments on 2018 guidance, we maintain our adjusted EPS range for 2018 of $2.75 to $2.90. We had a good start to 2018 as compared to our internal plan, but we do have incremental headwinds of interest expense as rates on variable debt have risen between 20 and 50 basis points since our original planning period. For the full year, we continue to expect $45 million of Agility savings at both the bottom and top end of our EPS range. We also maintain our full year cash from operations guidance in the range of $420 million to $440 million. As a reminder, this includes approximately $50 million of restructuring and related cash costs in 2018. We continue to expect working capital improvement of $20 million to $40 million in 2018 primarily related to improvements in inventory. In summary, we are making progress through Agility. We continue to take actions to align our business in environment we are operating in to create a lean number of business that is well positioned for the long-term. I will now turn the call back to Bill. William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: In summary, our first quarter performance demonstrates progress. I'm encouraged by our actions and results. We improved operational. We advanced Agility. We maintained pace with our new business awards and most importantly, we delivered on our commitments. With respect to Agility, our progress goes beyond creating an effective cost structure. I am particularly encouraged by the actions and the efforts related to the fix, and \u2013 to the strengthen and grow aspects of Agility that position our business strategically to be successful. The actions we are taking today bolster our foundation to deliver higher levels of quality and service and to capture growth, particularly in short run business at large, medium and small sized customers. Our pilot of agile lane is underway with our people, assets, processes and products aligned to service short run business. Turning to guidance. As Mike mentioned, we are maintaining our 2018 guide. We delivered a good start to our 2018 plan and have positive actions underway. But we are also taking into account headwinds from recent interest rate increases and we will closely monitor currency and freight rates throughout the remainder of the year. We continue to enact change that positions Bemis for enduring success. We are building on our strong foundation of a world-class customer base, a dedicated workforce, a comprehensive and innovative product portfolio and good positions in the markets we serve to be successful. We are confident that we will continue to deliver our planned improvements in 2018 that creates value for shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over for questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question will come from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research : Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for the details and for taking my questions. I had kind of a shorter term question to start and then a longer term bigger picture question. In terms of the volume growth, clearly, we understand that Shelbyville was an effect on volume for U.S. Packaging. Bill, I was wondering when should we expect to see the benefits to strengthen and grow from Agility actually to better volume overall for this segment? I know it's hard to parse this to a day or week or month, but should we start to see this benefit your volumes in the second half and the second quarter in 2019? How would you have us think about that? That's question one. Question two is more on return on capital and the business and how you manage capital structure over time to get a higher return on equity. Over the last decade plus, returns have been relatively flat. Despite M&A, both divestitures and acquisitions that you've employed, EBITDA has been very stable. Does that not suggest perhaps using capital structure more aggressively to try to get a higher return ultimately to your shareholders? Thank you. William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Yes. George, on the first part of your question, the strengthen and grow piece, as we said on the last call, we started the pilot \u2013 the short run agile lane in early Q1 and we piloted it in the meat segment. We just started the second pilot a week or two ago in the cheese segment. And what we've put in our plan for this year as we've said was $25 million of new business in short runs at the high-end of our guide for 2018. So what we've put into the plan is the initial piloting, how do we ramp it through the business, and then how do we ramp it up externally. So we've got $25 million of new business in our plan for 2018 at the high-end of the guide. Michael B. Clauer - Bemis Co., Inc.: As to your question on accelerated return on capital, George, I think that's always been our intent. I think the progress we're making on Agility is fully intended to enhance and create shareholder value at a quicker pace. We are not walking away from M&A. We're looking at anything that would accelerate our ability to do what Bill mentioned as the short runs and we're going to continue very disciplined CapEx expectations of our business units. Operator : And our next question will come from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Bryan Burgmeier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. This is actually Bryan Burgmeier sitting in for Anthony. During the quarter, you guys announced a creation of the Finance and Strategy Committee. Just wondering if you can provide any color in terms of the scope or the timing or really what kind of activities the Committee will be tasked with? William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Yes. The Committee is really put in place to formalize the activities that have been conducted at the full board level, not unlike why you have an Audit Committee or a Compensation Committee. It's to more specifically then look at corporate finance, development and M&A. Bryan Burgmeier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. Got it. Yeah. That's helpful. And then in terms of inflation in the quarter, can you guys quantify the impact of freight, aluminum or labor, and are you still anticipating kind of 2% to 3% range globally that you highlighted on the last call? Michael B. Clauer - Bemis Co., Inc.: Inflation during the quarter, it's \u2013 I mean globally, it's probably 2% to 3%. And I think \u2013 our objectives and I think you see it the way we ran our business this quarter as we were able to offset that with productivity initiatives and the improvement in our EBITDA and OP has really driven by Agility cost outs. Operator : And we will now move to Edlain Rodriguez with UBS. Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Good morning, guys. Just one quick one. Can you talk about the dynamics of pricing, because we keep reading in the papers how many of your customers are not able to pass through cost to the own customers? Is this making for lack (00:18:14) of difficult conversation with your customers? Like how are you approaching pricing? William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Right. Well, we have contracts in place with the vast majority of our customers. So that business is under contract. It's not priced daily, weekly, monthly, on that kind of a basis. In North America, the lion's share of the business, 80-plus percent, is under contract. So we don't see that impacts on a short-term basis. Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC : So even longer term, I mean, is there a lack of risk your customers could try to change the terms of the contract? Because if they're having trouble passing it through, they're going to get squeezed and I would assume they'll try to squeeze the suppliers, but any concerns there at all? Michael B. Clauer - Bemis Co., Inc.: We've \u2013 clearly, last year, part of our performance was the fact that we had given some concessions and we weren't able to offset it with other cost-outs. That's a normal part of our business. Processes, as contracts come up for renewal, customers are expecting lower input and that's part of our strategy, is we are constantly working on lightweighting, downgauging and other initiatives, recognizing that that's an expectation of their customers. Operator : And our next question will come from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys, good morning. I guess back to U.S. Packaging and volume decline of 1% during the first quarter, did that fully reflect the loss share in infant care or will that loss be more pronounced on a quarterly basis as the year unfolds? Michael B. Clauer - Bemis Co., Inc.: It will be more pronounced this year unfolds, Ghansham. William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: It ramped down in Q1. Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: It ramped down in Q1. Okay. Thank you. And then last quarter, you noted that conditions in Brazil were stabilizing with profitability set to improve in 2018. Can you update us on that view? I mean, volumes were down 8% in the first quarter, basically flat in 4Q. Is that a comp issue, loss of share? What's going on there? Thank you. William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Yeah, Ghansham, that's a comp issue. We are right on track with what our internal plan was for Brazil in Q1. And as we said, we would sequentially get better from a profitability perspective and that also is right on pace with our internal plan. Operator : And we will now hear from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thanks. Good morning. So, question on the margins. Looks like you've made some decent progress through Agility in U.S. Packaging. Are more of the gains \u2013 should we expect continued gains in U.S. Packaging as we go forward? And if not, what kind of impact on global margins should we expect? William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: You will see continued gains in margins as Agility continues to gain more and more speed throughout the business. You'll see that both in the U.S. Packaging and on the Global Packaging side of the business. Michael B. Clauer - Bemis Co., Inc.: And Latin America. William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: And Latin America as well. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Is there like a rough split, sorry, on the cost savings between the segments that you've disclosed with? William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: The majority of the cost savings and Agility efforts are in North America. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks. Operator : We will now move to Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. Salvator Tiano - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hi, guys. This is Salvator Tiano filling in for Chip. How are you? William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Good. Salvator Tiano - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Great. Firstly \u2013 first question would be, can you just break down in Latin America the volume growth that you saw in Brazil versus the remaining countries? I think Brazil should be the majority, but not everything over there. So I guess it was worse than the 8% you saw in the region? William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Brazil is the majority of what is contained in Latin America and we won't break volumes down sub-regionally within Latin America. Salvator Tiano - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. Understood. And my follow-up is, in Rest of the World, can you give us some more color about volume growth specifically? What you saw in healthcare and what you saw in Asia Pacific? I think you mentioned that the majority was in healthcare. But the sales \u2013 the price and the mix drag was very pronounced, implying I think that a lot of the volume growth actually came from low priced Asia products. William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: The majority of the Rest of World would be healthcare. And we had volume growth in healthcare and healthcare is global, so healthcare is part of the Asia Pacific piece. So you've got growth in healthcare, you've got growth in Europe and you have growth in Asia Pacific as well. Michael B. Clauer - Bemis Co., Inc.: I think our comment regarding margin is you're correct, it would have been stronger growth in food and specialty packaged applications in Asia which just carry lower margins. Operator : And we will now move to Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo Securities. Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, gentlemen. I'm going to try to tie together a couple of comments that you guys have made thus far. Mike, you made reference to customer dialog, customer conversations being a little bit difficult and then sort of coming in the table expecting a little bit of price or a way to keep their costs flat, your customers, meaning. I know you guys are working on Agility right now, but is there a plan in place or some sort of thought process around embedding an ongoing continuous improvement program that delivers some level of cost savings on an annual basis to offset that if you do have to sort of give back price on a go forward basis? William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Yes. Maybe it didn't come across or it hasn't been quite explained to the detail that you need, Gabe. We put a project management office in place. We have \u2013 Agility is kind of the all umbrella on fix, strengthen and grow and then there's work streams underneath that umbrella, one of which is lean and productivity. And when Mike said we rebalanced some of our R&D costs into operations, we've actually rebalanced the effort of R&D somewhat back into operations, so that we are continuously driving process improvement as well as cost-outs as well as lightweighting as well as redefining and relooking at specifications to continually take cost out of the operation. So, yes, it's well underway and that's part of what we saw in Q1, Q3, Q1 \u2013 Q4, I should say, of 2017 was gains in productivity from lean, gains in fixed cost down from Agility, and that's now being embedded into every region's operating rhythm. Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And then one \u2013 I don't want to necessarily get into the accounting of it, but, Mike, did I understand you correctly that \u2013 well, two-part question. How are things progressing, I guess, with some of your key customers in terms of volumes and more specifically tracking towards rebates? And I think I heard you say you're sort of accruing for that assuming that they're going to hit that bar or threshold sometime during the year. Can you confirm that? Michael B. Clauer - Bemis Co., Inc.: That would be a correct statement that we accrue or we expense these rebates or incentives based upon the full-year plan and what the customers' commitments are. And at this point, everything's on target for them to achieve the full-year growth objectives for us. Operator : We will now move to Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Anojja Shah - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Good morning. It's Anojja Shah for Mark. I just wanted to go back to Brazil for a second. We're getting some mixed signals from a lot of the packaging companies this quarter. We had one company that had volumes up 30%, we had some other companies that are seeing strength. What do you think it is about your specific product or market segment that is making you have such a different experience in Brazil? William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Yes. For us, it's the consumer and the consumer demand. I don't know what other packaging folks have said, but our product goes directly into the hands of the consumers. And until consumption begins to pick up, and that's really driven by unemployment, if you will, that's how we view it, as unemployment comes down, people go back to work, they have more money to spend on products at the grocery store. Our consumption goes up of our products. So we have very high customer shares in Brazil. So, as their business begins to ramp up, we will ramp up with them. But we're seeing exactly what we had thought we would see, a stable environment going forward in Brazil, increasing profitability going forward throughout Brazil. Anojja Shah - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And just to clarify, you have sequential improvement built in for the rest of 2018 in Brazil? William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: We do. Operator : And our next question will come from Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Mike, I wanted to ask you. You made some comments about not repurchasing shares, being mindful of leverage. I realized we're in a rising rate environment here. But your leverage really isn't that high compared to a lot of your peers. So I just wanted to see if you have any updated thoughts on how you want to manage your leverage over the next couple of years and anything incremental on share repurchase as we should expect them to resume at some point. Michael B. Clauer - Bemis Co., Inc.: Our capital allocation policy and philosophy still intends to maintain an investment grade which says 2 5 times is probably where you want to be. You can push that with the right acquisition and then delever quickly. So, the philosophy is still not to kind of change the balance sheet. I'm mindful of leverage. If you look at Q1 between operating cash flow and CapEx, there just really wasn't any cash really left to meaningfully buy back stock. But as we progress through the year, our cash flows get stronger seasonally. And if there's not an acquisition, we will use our free cash flow to the shareholders. Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then we talked a lot about pluses and minuses of volumes the last couple of quarters. But would you be able to speak to \u2013 what are you most optimistic about within your portfolio, driving volume growth for Bemis over the next year or two? William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Yeah. It's really the piece of Agility that's about growth. It's the short run business and the agile lane. We've \u2013 very early into that process, but we're starting to see what that might frame up as as we go forward. And it's very encouraging. We're hiring more salespeople. We're hiring some inside people so that we can really go after this over the course of the next several quarters and years because that's where we see the growth. And it's not just in customers that we don't currently have in our portfolio, but it's from customers that we have in the portfolio that have got short run business and the agile lane is perfectly situated to attack that. Debbie A. Jones - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. I'll turn it over. Operator : We will now go to a follow-up from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Molly Baum - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. This is actually Molly Baum sitting in for George. He had to drop off for another earnings call. Just one quick follow-up and just going back to Brazil. So you had mentioned sequential improvement in volumes and if I recall in 4Q, you had mentioned your volume expectation for the full year was flat. So are you expecting volume or positive volumes 2Q through 4Q? If you can just provide a little more color on that, that would be great. Thank you. William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Yes. That's correct. Molly Baum - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: We see volumes flat for 2018, okay, versus 2017. So we're down in Q1 but it's a four quarter game, right? You just can't look at Q1 and say, okay, it's going to be like that for the rest of the year. Our plan is laid out so that we will have flat volumes throughout 2018. Molly Baum - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Thank you. Operator : And your next question will come from Scott Gaffner with Barclays. John Andrew Dunigan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. This is John on for Scott. How are you doing, Mike, Bill? William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Doing well. John Andrew Dunigan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Great. So I know you talked about Agility a lot already. I was actually kind of surprised with the $8 million of savings this quarter and that might be partially driven by what \u2013 Bill, you had mentioned in the beginning of the call about the moving up and timing of some of the elimination of administrative positions. But how should we think of the progress in savings throughout the rest of the year and maybe broken out by the U.S. and by LatAm as one a little bit later in 2018 or has been moved up and with the $8 million already generated in 1Q could that $35 million of savings be a little bit conservative or maybe just a pull through from some of the savings you'd expect in 2019? William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Well as we said, is that \u2013 John, is that we accelerated, we pulled forward to get more into Q1. So, we're \u2013 as we said, $35 million at the low end and the high end of our guide. We are tracking to that pace. We're going to continue to push and drive hard. The teams are all doing that. The majority of that savings is in North America and we'll continue to run this through the project management office and drive that rigor back down into the organization. John Andrew Dunigan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. I appreciate that. And since the closing of the two facilities that are now complete, what is the capacity utilization being with these facilities look like now and has there been any change to how you're thinking of improving the utilization rate across the business? William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Yeah, the latter half of that is, it's all about this whole effort around productivity and this whole effort around lean. It opens up capacity coupled with the recapitalized assets that we've put in place over the last few years continues to drive productivity and gains and upsides to capacities. So we have the ability to grow, we have the ability to continue to drive productivity and that's what Agility and the lean work stream is all about. Operator : And with no further questions in the queue, I'd like to turn the call back over to management for any additional or closing remarks. Erin M. Winters - Bemis Co., Inc.: Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. This concludes our conference call. Operator : And once again, that does conclude our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Thank you, Erin, and good morning, everyone. We delivered a strong second quarter in line with our expectations. Earnings per share increased more than 40% versus one year ago, and we saw a strong operating profit improvement in all of our reportable segments totaling $20 million. Our teams are advancing Agility according to plan and are finding ways to continuously improve all areas of our business including operations, planning and back office work. The Agility mindset to fix, strengthen and grow Bemis is continuing to permeate our thinking and actions. Before walking around the globe on financial performance, I'll take a minute to talk about one of Bemis' most valuable assets, our people. Over the past few years, we have driven and experienced much change. We have new leadership in our U.S., Latin American and healthcare businesses, and those leaders are bolstering their teams by infusing new talent were needed and by providing new opportunities for high performing employees to expand influence, and all of this while driving out costs and laying the foundation for long-term growth. Change of this magnitude and breadth can be taxing on an organization and its people, but our employees have risen to the challenge. And not just with actions, but also with positivity and pride in their work. Bemis was recently named one of Forbes' Best Large Employers in America. This honor is awarded to companies whose anonymously surveyed employees would recommend their employer to family and friends. So what makes Bemis one of the best employers in America? Our people, who are making the right decisions and are contributing to our improvement both in the near-term and long-term. Specifically throughout the past year, our organization has made decisions in taking out cost that many companies would describe as difficult. But those decisions have been thoughtful and have been carried out with the utmost respect in line with our core values. Having been through much change recently to receive this honor from Forbes now is a true indication of the strong sense of loyalty, dedication, energy and pride our employees have in Bemis and I thank them. Turning to performance in our segment this quarter. Our U.S. business delivered strong improvement with operating profit up nearly $10 million compared to last year. Agility and improving operations benefited the bottom line. In Latin America, we improved operating profit by $6 million compared to last year, in light of headwinds from currency translation and the nationwide truck driver strike in Brazil. Regarding the strike, we did feel pressure on sales during May. During the strike, our teams did an outstanding job of managing our business. Cross-functional meetings were held twice daily to manage raw material availability, costs, and production schedules, in line with our customers' request. In some cases, we temporarily shut down machines or plants. And in other cases, we were able to keep critical lines running, a massive amount of coordination, time, and effort on behalf of our team in Brazil. To get through those challenges with nearly a $0.01 hurt to EPS demonstrates how nimble, accountable, and resourceful our teams have become. During June, demand returned and we continue to view the environment for our business in Brazil as stabilizing. We will continue to deliver our variable and fixed cost reductions that we initiated a year ago given the economic environment in Brazil, and our business will be well-positioned as the economic environment improves. Our Rest of World business delivered another strong quarter. Compared to last year, operating profit increased nearly $4 million, driven by healthcare packaging. We again saw strong organic growth in healthcare and leveraged that volume operationally to deliver high-quality service to our customers and to the benefit of the bottom line. I'll turn the call over to Mike now for a review of the financials and I'll come back to wrap up. Michael B. Clauer - Bemis Co., Inc.: Thanks, Bill, and good morning. Today, I will discuss the financial details of our segments and total company followed by comments on the balance of 2018. U.S. Packaging segment. During the second quarter, our U.S. business performed well and delivered improvement compared to one year ago. Sales dollars were up 3.4% compared to the prior year, reflecting higher sales prices, partially offset by unit volume decline of 1%, directionally in line with our expectations. Excluding the impact of the infant care business at our Shelbyville, Tennessee facility, unit volumes for the U.S. segment would have been flat. U.S. Packaging operating profit of $89.9 million increased from $80.1 million last year, driven by the benefits of Agility, improving operations, including improvement related to the plant that struggled with an ERP system implementation one year ago, partially offset by freight cost. Volume did not have an impact on profits during the quarter, as we were able to offset the infant care business at Shelbyville, Tennessee with new business wins at good margin levels. Our operations ran well and we managed cost appropriately. Turning to Latin America. Second quarter sales were down 7.3%, as compared to the prior year, driven by a 16.1% decrease from currency translation as the Brazil real and the Argentine peso devalued. Remaining organic growth of 8.8% was driven by increased selling prices and mix versus one year ago, partially offset by unit volumes down 2%, driven by the impact of the truck driver strike in Brazil. Without this impact, volumes in Latin America Packaging would have been up low-single digits. Latin America operating profit of $9 million increased from $2.9 million last year. Currency translation hurt profits by $1.5 million, leaving an operational improvement of $7.6 million during the quarter, which was driven by the planned variable and fixed cost reductions implemented due to the challenging economic environment in Brazil, partially offset by the volume and absorption impact of the nationwide truck driver strike. Turning to the Rest of the World. Second quarter sales were up 6.3% compared to the prior year. Currency translation increased sales 4.8%. The acquisition of Evadix added 1%, leaving organic growth just under 1%. Unit volumes were up 1% with volume growth in our global healthcare business and in Asia, offset by volume declines in Europe due to timing of customer shipments. Rest of World operating profits increased to $18.7 million as compared to $14.8 million the prior second quarter. This improvement was driven by our healthcare packaging business where volumes grew and operations ran well. Now onto consolidated Bemis results. Total company SG&A expense of $96.8 million for the second quarter increased approximately $2 million compared to the prior year. While we have some Agility savings here, we also have inflation of 2.3% globally, as well as the impact of achieving any of the pay for performance targets in our 2018 plan. Total company research and development expense was $9.4 million, compared to $11.1 million in the prior year. This decrease is driven by certain administrative positions that were eliminated through Agility, some rebalancing of resources to operations, and the timing of projects. We anticipate full year 2018 R&D to be in line with last year. Interest expense was $18.7 million, compared to $16 million last year, due to increased rates. Income tax for the second quarter was 23.1%, as compared to 31.9% the prior year, driven primarily by lower rates due to the U.S. tax reform. Operating cash flow of $106.5 million this quarter was in line with the prior year. Restructuring and related cash costs were $14 million this quarter, and $4 million one year ago. Primary working capital as a percentage of sales was 14.9% at June 30, within our targeted range of 14% to 16%. Turning to comments on 2018 guidance. We reduced the high end of our adjusted EPS range for 2018 by $0.05 reflecting the impact of currency translation in Brazil and Argentina. We've assumed current rates remain throughout the balance of the year. Our new guidance range of $2.75 to $2.85 contains many of the same assumptions we shared at the beginning of the year. We continue to expect both Latin America and Rest of World segment to deliver 100 basis points of profit improvement for the full year. We continue to expect Agility benefits at $35 million at both the top and bottom of our range. We continue to expect headwinds for reinstating pay for performance and customer incentives. As shared last quarter, interest expense has entered as a headwind for the year that is accounted for in our guidance range. Where we are within the range will depend on a few factors. Number one, currency and the macroeconomic environment in Brazil and Argentina; number two, share repurchase; number three, input costs such as freight labor and utilities and our ability to offset them; number four, the transition of unique piece of business in Brazil. Specifically, during the 2005 acquisition of Dixie Toga, we gained a folding box business for packaging laundry detergent in Brazil. This business is run on fully depreciated equipment that was highly efficient given the 30-plus years our team spent perfecting both the product and the process. Our customer has decided to transition their format away from boxes to flexible pouches, typically transitioning to flexible benefits us as given that we don't have the incumbent format. However, in this case, the impact of our customer moving to our flexible pouch format actually hurts us both on the revenue and profit lines through the mix versus the box format. This may impact earnings up to $0.03 per share in the second half of the year depending on how quickly our customer starts pulling run rate levels of new flexible pouches. We are revising our full year cash flow from operations guidance to the range of $410 million to $430 million, a $15 million reduction at the midpoint when comparing to our previous range of $420 million to $450 million. This reduction reflects the impact of currency and lower outlook for working capital improvements as the pace of inventory reductions have been revised versus expectations coming into 2018. The revised cash flow guidance assumes working capital improvement attended $30 million compared to our original expectations of $20 million to $40 million in 2018. Expected restructuring and related cash cost are included in our guidance shall remain unchanged for 2018 at $50 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures in the range of $150 million to $160 million for 2018. We updated our general accepted accounting principle tax rate guidance to approximately 23% for 2018. I will mention that for the purpose of giving guidance, we provide a tax rate whole numbers, but in our forecast detail, the actual change is closer to 0.5% which I view as minimal. There are no particular topics that drive the small change rather than just details that have been refined as the year is now half over. As we head to the back half of 2018, we are focused on delivering our operating plans and finding ways to continuously improve and drive value while we're creating lean nimble business is well-positioned for the long-term. I will now turn the call back to Bill. William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Thanks, Mike. In summary, our second quarter and first half performance demonstrate progress. I continue to be encouraged by our actions to improve operationally, to lay the foundation for long-term growth, and to deliver our earnings commitments. Regarding Agility, our progress goes beyond creating an effective cost structure to strengthen and grow aspects of Agility, position our business strategically to drive value for the long-term. We continue to focus on delivering higher levels of quality and service across our entire business, and we continue to lay the foundation to penetrate short run business at large, medium and small-sized customers through agile lane, which aligns our people, assets, processes, and products to serve the pockets of growth in North America. As of July, we've hired 14 new sales reps. These hunters are incentivized to pursue and win the new business targets we have developed. We have received positive feedback on our core spec product portfolio from our initial customer outreach. We have received positive feedback on our ability to service this new business and also to be a partner to these customers. And we have won a handful of awards for short run packaging at both, new and existing customers, and are on track to reaching our target of $25 million in revenue during 2018. In summary, we are making progress to improve Bemis today and for the future. Our improving financials are an indication that we are on the right path. We are serving our customers better through improved quality and service. We are extending our sales reach to more short run business through agile lane. We are finding ways to continuously improve operational effectiveness and efficiency. And through all of this, we are laying a strong foundation for long-term net growth. We have a dedicated workforce, a world-class customer base, a comprehensive and innovative product portfolio, and good positions in the markets we serve. And we are confident that we will continue to deliver our planned improvements in 2018 that create value for shareholders and that position our business for the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to questions. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go first to Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, Bill. Good morning, Mike. William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Hey, Scott. Michael B. Clauer - Bemis Co., Inc.: Good morning. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: When we look at the U.S. Packaging business, margins there were better than we expected, so was operating profit, but didn't sound like from your comments. I mean, it sounded strong and you're making a lot of progress on Agility, but it didn't necessarily sound as if it was ahead of your expectation. Can you talk a little bit about that? I know you don't give quarterly guidance, but how did 2Q in U.S. Packaging sort of compare to what you expected, what you thought coming into the quarter? William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Yeah. Scott, right on track. We've identified $35 million of benefit from Agility in 2018, and we are right on path to do that. All the work streams are on track. They're on pace. They're doing just what they had anticipated they would do. And we feel good about the progress that we're making there in Agility. Our volumes were a bit better in Q2 than we had thought going in, because we are getting some traction from the short-run business that we're bringing in, primarily at existing customer base, right. As we've talked in the past, it's easier to get business from customers you already have. So, we're targeting share of wallet gains on the short run side of the operation. So, made some good progress there in the quarter, as well as with these 14 new people that we brought onboard, they're out there making progress, albeit they haven't been onboard long. Some of them come from other companies that have connections and contacts at what would be some of the smaller-sized customers. So, we've been able to open the door to some of these smaller customers and actually through the Agile Lane process get product in their hands quickly, trial it quickly, and then get some fairly quick wins on the short side of business from new customers. So, that was a help in Q2 that we did not anticipate. Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Bill. And, Mike, one quick one on the working capital improvement. Are you saying is it interest rates going up that's causing a little bit of the slowdown in the planned inventory reductions or is there something else going on with the customer base or higher resin prices? Michael B. Clauer - Bemis Co., Inc.: No. No. It's really more \u2013 we have developed specific actions to go after primarily work in progress. And I feel really good that we've developed strong plans and actions. We know what we've got to get done. It's just the pace is a little bit slower than we're anticipating. I want to be clear, we're not giving up at all on the total objective of the program. It's just how much we'll see in 2018 versus in 2019. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Bryan Burgmeier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. This is actually Bryan Burgmeier sitting in for Anthony. Rising freight costs have been a bit of a theme in 2Q earnings so far. What impact did that have on your U.S. Packaging results? And do you have any costs left to recover in the back half of the year? Michael B. Clauer - Bemis Co., Inc.: As far as your question on freight, primarily in the U.S., it was a couple million dollars headwind that we faced and we will continue to see that as we go through the remainder of the year. But be certain that's included in our guidance. Bryan Burgmeier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. Thanks. And then in terms of Latin America, it seems like it's been a little bit better down there. How would you characterize mix as we get into the back half of the year? Do you find customers are still trading down for cheaper alternatives or is that largely played out now? William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: That's largely played out. Our mix will be consistent in the back half of the year to what it's traditionally been. Michael B. Clauer - Bemis Co., Inc.: Excluding the folding box. William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Yeah. Operator : We'll go next to George Staphos of Bank of America. Molly Baum - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. This is actually Molly Baum sitting in for George. So, just kind of going back to Agility. My first question is, can you just quickly review how the sources of the Agility gains are going to change over the next few quarters? Thanks. William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: There would be no change to the sources of the Agility gains. The work streams are all in place and running and we'll continue to get gains out of those work streams as we go across. And maybe there'll be a little bit more coming from the global side of the business as the work streams offshore kick in. But it's all the same work streams. We're not changing that. Molly Baum - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, great. And my second question, we have said in past research that it's typically easier to fix than it is to grow. While, you saw some nice progress in the short runs, at what point do you think you can kind of safely project the sustained moderate growth for Bemis? William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Well, I think you've got to step back and look at the customer base that we serve. We serve 27 of the top global CPGs primarily in North America. If you look at where those CPGs have been over the last few years, down three \u2013 down low-single digits to down mid-single digits, our volumes have maintained in and around the zero line if you will, maybe down one, up one, zero down one, up one, up one. So, if you go through that, we've continuing to find growth at the CPG because this year we're up at 19 of our top 25 CPG accounts we have flosses on, which tells us that we're finding the growth in the pockets where their SKUs are growing, not necessarily the headlines that you read about some of these CPGs. So, we're finding those pockets of growth with technologies that we've deployed, with some of the new sales tools and core products that we've deployed. We're finding growth in those areas. So, we're outpacing our customers' growth rate. So, we're just going to continue down that road and on that path. Operator : We'll go next to Ghansham Panjabi with Robert Baird. Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning and congrats on the initial progress that you're seeing. It's nice to see that. Michael B. Clauer - Bemis Co., Inc.: Thank you. Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: I guess first off on U.S. Packaging, just to clarify did the second quarter fully encapsulate the full extent of the volume loss in infant care? And can you just sort of update us with your view on volumes for the segment during the back half of 2018, in context of the new volume that you secured? Michael B. Clauer - Bemis Co., Inc.: Yeah. Ghansham, the second quarter fully reflected the loss of the infant care business. So, as Bill mentioned, our volumes in general were a little better than we had anticipated to end up flattish. Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: And is that a consequence of the end markets themselves having improved, or is that a consequence of the new business that you gained? William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Ghansham, we look at it and say it's a function of the new business pickups that we've gained in the short run side of the business and primarily from existing customers as I said. So, we're getting traction there. Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Got it. And then, Bill, just your thoughts on the current war on plastics and the media et cetera, what are your customers coming back to you with in terms of their requirements, whether it's using recycled content of resin, or decontenting resin as it is. Just your perspective there, maybe some of the opportunities that you see that could actually benefit you with your capabilities et cetera. Thank you. William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Yeah. Ghansham, it's a great question. So, we've just launched in Q2 of product line that we call Encore. Encore is a recyclable material, monomaterial if you will, that can be used for flexible standup pouches. We're getting a lot of inquiries and a lot of draw, if you will, pull from customers about that product line and the capabilities of that material. A little bit further out, it would be Gen2 of that material that we have not launched yet. We still have some work to do there. But, we are getting a lot inquiries for it. We're getting a lot of thoughts of how can you deploy this, how can we use this within our product portfolio. From the stand standpoint of the single use plastics some of the things that we do and now I'm going to talk switch gears here to Europe for a second. We're very heavily weighted in the high barrier packaging in Europe for protein and that has not yet come. The single use plastic has not been an attack on the protein side of the equation yet because you need barrier properties to maintain the shelf life of that material. But in Europe, we do have a product line that is couples up with a fiberboard box to create barrier properties for takeaway type foods and cook at home foods. So, there is a lot of push. There's a lot of pull and our R&D guys are continuing to invest time there to develop the next generation films. Operator : We'll go next to Edlain Rodriguez with UBS. Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Good morning, guys. Just one quick one on the... William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Good morning. Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC : ...on the resins. I mean again you've been aggressive anyways in prices. Have you finally been able to catch up with costs there and what does the price cost gap look like now have you completely closed that yet? Michael B. Clauer - Bemis Co., Inc.: As you know the way we think about it on average, we have a 90-day pass through. And then when you take into contemplate inventory levels, we don't believe this is a bigger hurt when resins is going up. We're a big help when it's going down. So, resins' been relatively stable for the last few months. So, I would surmise that we've kind of \u2013 we're getting close to being everything pass through. Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. It makes sense. And my other question is on the share repurchase, like what should we expect in the second half of the year because in the first half you didn't get to do any share buyback? So what does the second half look like and what does it depend on? Michael B. Clauer - Bemis Co., Inc.: I'll just read \u2013 I'll just restate kind of our philosophy that we return free cash flow to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. And you need to contemplate also cash being spent for restructuring. And our desire to stay investment grade is really important to us. So, we're kind of cognizant of our leverage res levels when we look at things. Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thanks. Just a quick question on the second half guidance. So, as far as I understand the tax implications, so it looks like there maybe a couple pennies benefit versus your prior outlook. And then, I guess, Agility also helps you with that. Would you say \u2013 I know you went through the swing factors so that was helpful. But I guess, would you kind of characterize overall performance as benefiting more from the cost saves or more of your volume growth in both U.S. Packaging outside of Shelbyville and healthcare, maybe just give us an overview aspects? Michael B. Clauer - Bemis Co., Inc.: Yeah. I'll start with the tax rate. As I try to get across, we do things in halves when we guide. We do in wholes when we guide. It's about $0.01 if even that the rest of the year the change in our tax rate. As far as the kind of first half of the year, I think that more of the improvements have come out of the Agility cost outs. But also we've seen some pretty significant improvement in plant operations, specifically in North America that have done a really good job of offsetting other types of headwinds, freight, utility costs going up, just labor rates are going up, benefit costs et cetera. So things are going really well is the way I think about it. I would consider the second half is going to be so much the same. We're going to continue to benefit from what is another $18 million of Agility savings. And we would expect the productivity gains and momentum going on in the U.S. will continue. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thanks. And then as a quick follow-up, if you look out over time, will Agility and this current restructuring program address your footprint overall, or do you think you'd have to take further measures there to address the different types of growth within your business? Thanks. Michael B. Clauer - Bemis Co., Inc.: I think at this point, the way we are looking at Agility will continue in this organization. It's not just a fix. It's a, strengthen, and grow, it's become a mindset. It's becoming our way of doing business. And I think for the foreseeable future, we believe we have the right assets in place to meet the upcoming demands of what we hope is a very successful growth in the short run business category. Operator : We'll go next to Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. Salvator Tiano - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hey, guys. This is Salvator Tiano, fill in for Chip. How are you? William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Good. Salvator Tiano - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Great. So, my first question is on the Rest of the World business. I think the volumes decelerated quite sharply and it seems from the mix impact that's from Asia. So, can you give us a little bit some more color on what is going on in that part of the business? Erin M. Winters - Bemis Co., Inc.: Sure. Salvator, when we look at the Q1 you're referencing, we had some pretty high volumes in Asia, double-digit, which we've called out of the ordinary and those returned to single-digit type levels in Q2. So, I think on the whole, our Q2 performance in Rest of World was roughly on par with what we'd expect. What did continue in Rest of World was strong growth in our healthcare business. So, that's both on the revenue line and, obviously, there's great operating profit help there as well. Salvator Tiano - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay, great. And my second question is on CapEx, as we are kind of past the midpoint of the year, what are kind of your expectations directionally for CapEx, especially since you seem to be winning some more short-run business? So, could we see a slight pickup in that as you try to accommodate new business? William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Salvator, no, we're right on track to spend what we had guided to spend. We're not going to go beyond that. We've put in some capital over the last few years, if you recall, for the recap program. We're now absorbing that new capital into our portfolio. So, no, we don't see any increase in our CapEx guidance. Salvator Tiano - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. Perfect. Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Daniel Rizzo with Jefferies. Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC : Hi, guys. How are you? William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Good. Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC : Just a quick question on Agility. As you kind of implement that and change things, is that leading to or has it led to a high employee turnover and is that kind of slowing things down at all? William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: No, not at all. Obviously, we have had some reductions in our employee base, and just the fact that we were awarded from Forbes, The Best Large Employer in America award this year just kind of tell us that leadership's doing the right thing. The leadership is engaged. The employees are engaged. They're leveraging that. People are doing the right thing. So, the messaging that our leadership has out in the business right now is really clear that Agility is not just about fix, it's about, strengthen and grow. And that's where we have to have people head is towards strengthen and grow. And that's what we're starting to see come through in the business. Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC : And then, healthcare seems to be \u2013 is a growth area for you guys. Is there a way you can kind of position yourself better where you can kind of capitalize on the opportunity there that hasn't been really addressed yet or something you can do? William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: The piece there that \u2013 we look constantly for acquisitions, okay, outside of the normal pipeline and we have a very robust pipeline, because if you think about how this business layers in, there's somewhere between a 24 to a 36 month validation period for new devices or new pieces of medical business to come home to roost, if you will. So, you've got to have a strong pipeline that layers in over the course of multiple years. We're seeing the benefits of a strong pipeline and we look for acquisitions in this space, but quite frankly, they're very hard to find because they're usually embedded inside of another large packaging company and they are not readily carvable, if you will. You can't pull them out to try to acquire them. So, I think we really rely on a strong pipeline. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go next to Anojja Shah with BMO Capital Markets. Anojja Shah - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to go back to the U.S. volumes or the North America volumes, I know you said flat, part of your Shelbyville issue, flat volumes were within your expectations. But we're looking at how plastic packaging is growing. You're gaining more short-run business. We probably would have expected a little higher than flat, so what are we missing there? Is there some sort of lag when you get the short-run business? Just some more color there would be great. Michael B. Clauer - Bemis Co., Inc.: Well, yeah, first of all, there is a lag. When you secure new business, there is some qualifications depending on the customer, not dissimilar from medical, but not quite as long, but there is shelf life, tests, et cetera. So, I think our revenue was really in line with what we're expecting and, Bill, I don't know if you have anything to add. Anojja Shah - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I guess, to put another way... William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Yeah. We're up with 14 of the \u2013 19 of the top 25 customers in the U.S., our volumes are up with them. The commercialization period does take a little while. Onboarding takes a little while. We feel good about where we are and the fact that we've added 14 new commercial people in the field to go attack the pockets of growth that exist at new customers, feel good about what we're doing. The team in North America is doing a nice job there. Anojja Shah - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Thank you. And then along those lines, then can you give us an idea of your expectation for volumes in the rest of this year in the U.S.? Michael B. Clauer - Bemis Co., Inc.: I would consider \u2013 for the U.S., I would consider pacing what we've seen in Q1 and Q2. We still have the Shelbyville, Tennessee volumes for the rest of the year leaving and... William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Yeah. Operator : We'll go next to Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Connor Robbins - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys. This is actually Connor Robbins sitting in for Brian Maguire. I just wanted to come back to the freight environment and some of the resin input costs you guys are seeing. I wondered if you could provide a little bit more color on how your contractual mechanisms work. Obviously, you guys pass through your resin costs pretty well, was there \u2013 to what extent can you pass through those input costs through contracts or is that mostly just on you guys to try to recover those? Michael B. Clauer - Bemis Co., Inc.: Well, our contracts primarily pass through the raw materials, i.e., the different types of resins, et cetera. So, what we would attempt to do in the contract renewals is see if we can get something going on with freight. Not in all cases do we pay the freight. It's kind of a mixed bag across the board of who pays the freight and our pricing. But I think that answers your question. We would not normally pass through freight or labor increases. That would \u2013 we try to attack that with other productivity initiatives. Connor Robbins - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Got you. That's helpful. And then another note with kind of the FX environment. Obviously, in your Latin America segment, I mean, there was a pretty big headwind. I think it was 16% or so. I just wondered if you could give any sort of sensitivity analysis for the movements in that environment. Erin M. Winters - Bemis Co., Inc.: They'll move about Connor, I think the thing that we did call out is that for the full year roughly a $0.05 impact on the EPS and that's primarily from the REITs from Latin America both the real and the Argentinian peso. Michael B. Clauer - Bemis Co., Inc.: Those are translation rates. It doesn't get \u2013 the business on itself at local currency is doing what they said they would do. So it's just a matter of translation. William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Translation. Not a transaction. Connor Robbins - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Right. Thank you. Operator : And we'll go back to George Staphos with Bank of America. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, everyone. Good morning. Sorry, joined the call late, so, you might have answered these questions previously, apologies in advance, if you did. I guess the first question I had, when we look at the implied guidance for the back half of the year using the midpoint of your range in the release, it would imply earnings roughly around a $1.50 for the second half, which is pretty much I think where consensus is. Would we expect because of Agility and the fact that you're still gaining momentum there, I mean, that the fourth quarter is a little bit heavier than the third quarter proportionally? Traditionally, third quarter is a heavier quarter. How would you have us think about that and some of the key factors that ultimately drive your end result over 3Q and 4Q? That's question number one. Question number two. There has been changes at the board level of the company over the last six months. Has \u2013 Bill, the day-to-day running of the business changed at all, or is it pretty much the same? How has the input from the board impacted the way the company is proceeding on a going forward basis? And by the way, congratulations on the quarter as well. I forgot to mention that earlier. William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Thanks. Thanks, George. Yeah. The back half of the question first. The day-to-day running of the company is the same, okay. Where everyone is aligned. We want to continue to improve operationally. We want to continue to improve our operations globally and we want to continue to do what's in the best interest of shareholders. So everyone is completely aligned and that's how we run the company. That's how we ran it before, that's how we run it today. So there's really been no change there. On your other part of the question, Q3, Q4. Traditionally, seasonality, Q3 is always larger than Q4. And that's how the plan rolls out in the back half of this year. Q3 is again our seasonally highest quarter. Traditionally, our highest quarter and it is higher this year as it has been in all the past years. Michael B. Clauer - Bemis Co., Inc.: Would be. William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Yeah. Operator : And we'll go back to George Staphos. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : One last one from me. I didn't want to overdo it with the two question limit. Bill again, you've been in the seat for a few years now. Maybe this has come up earlier in the call., if it has, again apologies in advance. How is the culture within the organization changed, would you say in terms of accomplishing what you and Mike kind of set out as the course for the organization? And I know the standard response for coming will be, it's fine and getting better. But if you could give some particular instances where the culture is now really driving performance for instance it would be helpful there. Good luck in the quarter. William F. Austen - Bemis Co., Inc.: Thanks. Thanks, George. Yeah. The culture change, the culture drum never stops right. And we embarked on this to change the culture of Bemis some years ago to create a high performing culture. And I think we're starting to get a really good traction there now. It took a lot of hard work, but it also took \u2013 we had to change out some of the leadership to get there. And when \u2013 as that leadership changes out, they bring in new leaders and they bring people from the bottom of the organization or the high performers. They bring them up into the organization and that's what takes a little while. And once it gets started, I don't want to say it snowballs, but it continues to feed upon itself and move forward and move the company forward which we've been able to do. And I think we're seeing that now with Agility. We're also seeing that with the fact that Forbes named us as one of the Best Large Employers in America this past year. So, I think we're doing a really good job in that area. The leadership is completely engaged around that and continuing to push and drive our results and our performance. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Operator : And there are no further questions in queue. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Winters for any additional or closing remarks. Erin M. Winters - Bemis Co., Inc.: Great, thanks. Thanks everyone for joining us today. This concludes our conference call. Operator : And that does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Bill Austen : Thank you, Erin, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another strong earnings quarter in line with our expectations. Our teams did an excellent job of delivering our plan despite headwinds from currency and freight, year-to-date adjusted earnings per share have increased 18% compared to last year and adjusted operating profit is up $20 million. I continue to be encouraged by our actions to improve operationally, to lay the foundation for long-term growth and to deliver our earning's commitments. The Agility mindset to fix, strengthen and grow Bemis continues to permeate our thinking and actions. Our progress goes beyond creating an effective cost structure through the strength and grow aspects of Agility. We're building a strong foundation to position our business strategically to penetrate short run opportunities and drive value for the long-term. During 2018 we have hired new sales reps who are incentivized to pursue and win our new business targets. Established our core spec offering, to ensure we quickly and appropriately leverage our existing innovative product portfolio, completed robust customer account review to focus our sales efforts and uncover growth opportunities and develop and implement a broad range of operational and sales process improvements such as a simplified application process for new customers, a quick quoting procedure, a faster sample role delivery process and a shorter lead time offering. Simply put, our approach aligns our people, assets, processes and products to serve the pockets of growth available in North America. Early customer feedback has been positive and we continue on pace to reach our target of $25 million of incremental short run business during 2018. Over the long-term we'll continue to serve our solid base of long run business while adding in these identified short run opportunities. I'll turn the call over to Mike now to review the financials and then I'll come back to discuss our planned combination with Amcor. Mike Clauer : Thanks Bill and good morning. Today I'll discuss the financial details of our segments in total company followed by comments on the balance of 2018. US packaging segment during the third quarter our US business performed in line with our expectations. Sales dollars of $688.4 million were up, 2.4% compared to prior year reflecting higher selling prices partially offset by unit volume decline of 2%. Approximately half this volume decline related to the infant care business at our Shelbyville, Tennessee facility that we exited this year and the remainder is simply a function of timing and a stronger than normal third quarter last year. US packaging sales are within our expectations and include the pace toward our full year target of $25 million of incremental short run business. US packaging operating profit of $93.4 million was lower than the $99.6 million last year. You will recall that during the third quarter last year profits benefited $4 million from the reversal [ph] expenses related to specific customers under an incentive. US profits this third quarter reflects the benefits Agility and improving operations partially offset by freight cost, current year customer incentives and the impact of strong four year results on employee [indiscernible] performance again all within our expectations. Turning to Latin America packaging, third quarter sales of $148.3 million were down 19.3% as compared to the prior year driven by a 23.7% decrease in currency. Remaining organic growth of 4.4% was driven by increased selling prices in mix versus one year ago, offset by unit volumes down 15% driven primarily by the impact of some laundry detergent packaging volume in Brazil that is converting to another format. To a lesser extent, unit volumes were impacted by one customer's conversion to a smaller size packaging format which impact volumes but not profit. And also by some fine tuning portfolio at a couple plants where he had some high-mix, low margin products that we decided to exit. Latin America operating profit of $8 million increased from $7.3 million last year. Currency translation hurt profits by $1.7 million and the implementation of high inflation accounting in our business in Argentina hurt profits by another $1.4 million leaving an operational improvement of $3.8 million during the third quarter which was driven by planned variable and fixed cost reductions implemented into the challenging economic environment in Brazil. Partially offset by the volume impact, market impact of our customer is converting laundry detergent to another packaging format. We'd continue to focus on what we can control in this region. The environment for our business in Brazil stay wise [ph] and we'll continue to deliver our planned cost reductions initiated one year ago, given the economic environment in Brazil. Our business will be well positioned as the economic improves. Turning to the rest of the world packaging. Our rest of world business delivered another strong quarter. Third quarter sales of $189.7 million were up 6% compared to the prior year. Currency translation decrease sales by 0.8%, the acquisition of Evadix increased sales 1.2%. Organic growth of 5.6% reflects increased unit volumes of 4% and increased pricing mix. [Indiscernible] global healthcare packaging business continued. Rest of world packaging operating profit increased to $22.2 million compared to $17.3 million prior to third quarter. This improvement was driven primarily by the impact of strong volumes in healthcare packaging and solid operating performance throughout the segment. Now onto consolidated Bemis results. Total company SG&A expense of $90.9 million for the third quarter decreased $5 million compared to the prior year. Reflecting Agility savings and strong cost controls, partially offset by inflation in the impact of achieving annual performance targets in 2018 plan. Total company research and development expense was $9.3 million down slightly from the prior year and in line with our expectations. Other operating income was $4.4 million down from $7.8 million last year. During the prior year there was some unique items dragging benefits such as the trueup of accruals related to a prior divestiture. Current year results are in line with a more normal trends in this category. Interest expense was $18.9 million compared to $16.7 million last year due primarily to increased rates. Income tax for the third quarter was 23% as compared to 32.2% for the year driven primarily by lower rates due to US tax reform. Operating cash flow $142 million this quarter increased from $99 million to prior year. Restructuring and other transaction cash cost were $16 million this year and $6 million one year ago. Primary working capital as a percentage of sales was 14.6% at September 30th improved from 15.2% one year ago and within our target range of 14% to 16%. Total company net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.4 times at September 30, 2018. Turning to 2018 guidance, we maintained a midpoint of 280 was shared with our updated 2018 adjusted EPS range of $2.77 to $2.82 as compared to our guidance in June, we do have headwinds from currencies in Brazil and Argentina. The [indiscernible] business is Brazil that is now confirmed as transitioned to the new format for the entire second half of the year and the impact of [indiscernible] share repurchase has limited by the pending merger with Amcor. However we did, a good job of upcoming new segments in Q3 and expect to continue with strong operational performance particularly in the US as we have plans on way to strongly [indiscernible] control cost during outage shutdowns. Our current guidance range contains many of the same assumptions we share at the beginning of the year, we continue to expect both Latin America and Rest of the World packaging to deliver 100 basis points profit improvement for the year. We continue to expect Agility benefits of $35 million in both top and bottom of our range and we continue to expect headwinds from reinstating paper performance in customer incentives. Where we are in the range will depend in few factors. Currency in the macroeconomic environment in Brazil and Argentina. Input cost set straight and our ability to offset them and our ability to tightly manage cost and operational performance during the seasonally slow fourth quarter. Turning to cash flow, we're maintaining a full year cash from operations guidance in the range of $410 million to $430 million. Total expected restructuring and other transaction cost included in our 2018 guidance are $60 million of which approximately $12 million is related to the announced merger of Amcor. Our teams are doing a great job of pushing [indiscernible] cash flow during the fourth quarter which will help us overcome otherwise would have been cash flow headwind versus our July guidance. We continue to expect capital expenditures in the range of $150 million to $160 million for 2018. We continue to expect our GAAP tax rate at approximately 23% for 2018. As we head into the fourth quarter we're focused on delivering our operating plan and continuing to find ways to drive value and position our business successfully for the long-term. I will now turn the call back to Bill. Bill Austen : Thanks Mike. We had a good quarter in line with expectations. In early August, we announced to plan to combine with Amcor to create the global leader in consumer packaging which I will speak to next. But first, with that announcement as the backdrop I would sincerely like to thank our global leadership team for its diligence in keeping our regional and functional teams focused on the objectives required to deliver our operating plan. Great job by leadership and great job by all of the teams around the world. Let's remain focused on delivering the year. Turning to the combination. These two organizations will drive significant value for shareholders. Employees, customers and the environment over the long-term. Bemis shareholders will have the opportunity to benefits from a significantly increased dividend and the value creation driven from not only the $180 million of cost synergies identified as part of the transaction but also additional potential revenue synergies. All internal work stream supporting regulatory filings and integration planning are on pace to our expectations and we remain on track for the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2019 after regulatory and shareholder approvals are received. For Bemis this is the next exciting chapter in our evolution and our employees will carry forward the Bemis legacy as they showcase their skill and passion for providing inspired packaging solutions as part of the global leader and consumer packaging that is being created through this transaction. Until the transaction closes we will continue to operate as an independent company and will remain focused on serving our customers and delivering our operating plans. We are making progress to improve Bemis today and for the future. We are delivering our plans, which include 100 basis point improvement in operating profit in both Latin America and healthcare packaging. We are finding ways to continuously improve operating effectiveness and efficiency in our factories, in our administrative functions. We're serving our customers better through improved quality and service and we're laying a strong foundation for long-term net growth bolstered by Agility efforts to penetrate short run opportunities. I'm proud of our business. We have an outstanding customer base of committed and talented workforce, a comprehensive and innovative product portfolio, a strong asset base and good positions in the markets we serve. We're confident and focused as we position our business for the future. With that I'll turn the call over for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] and our first question comes from Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Erin Winters : Operator, we can't hear anything. Operator : Mr. Panjabi, your line is now live. Unidentified Analyst : This is Matt [indiscernible] sitting in for Ghansham, how are you doing today? Bill Austen : We're doing well Matt, how are you? Unidentified Analyst : Good, so what end markets are growing within your US packaging business and which end markets could represent a potential headwind in the years to come and then, can you elaborate on what specific factors are driving growth or maybe some of the headwinds that you could expect? Bill Austen : Okay let's talk first about what's driving growth right now. You recall our whole Agility program that we put in place on the strengthening grow portion of Agility. The fixed portion of it helps us get our fixed and variable cost down and it has aided us in doing that significantly but now when we looked at the growth portion, we focused on short run business and that was primarily business that in the past we had not attacked because it was at smaller to middle sized customers. We weren't set up for it, we're now set up for it through some of the recapitalization efforts we've gone through and we've just this year when we undertook this work stream through Agility we've on boarded 26 new customers in the small to mid-sized category, we established a target at the beginning of the year to achieve $25 million of growth in 2018 through this category of small to mid-sized customers and we're on track to achieve that right now. And it's in the categories where we have leadership positions. So let's talk about me, talk about cheese [ph], talk about liquid. Those are the categories where we're really focused and have a right to win and we've brought business in those categories as well as some non-food customers and non-food categories that we in the past had not traditionally played in. Unidentified Analyst : Great, that's helpful. And then maybe one quick question on the cost side. How do you feel that Bemis's position to operate within a cost environment that appears biased to the upside and what actions have to take to counter some of the persistent inflation that we're seeing both in terms of raw materials and then also other costs freight, labor etc. Bill Austen : We look at the rising raw materials as that's part of our normal pass through to customers. So we don't necessarily focus on what happens with rising raw materials, we focus on how our PAFs, Price Adjustment Formulas pass that rising raw materials through to the customer base. Your question is really focus more so on the productivity efficiency effectiveness side of the equation and through Agility as I mentioned already, we worked hard to get our fixed and variable cost down, which is really lean efforts, quality efforts, service efforts and also plan consolidation efforts that was allowed to, we allowed to get ourselves there through the recapitalization of older assets to new equipment. So it's day-to-day blocking and tackling that allows us to stay ahead of this rising cost environment and that's what we've seen all throughout this year. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from Debbie Jones of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Debbie Jones : Two questions from m, and first though actually you did actually [indiscernible] on Agility, [indiscernible] in line with, I think what we were expecting. I just got a little confused by the laundry decline. I understood it to be more of a shift to another format that in some way you would see a bit of benefit from, can you just clarify what that is? Bill Austen : Yes sure Deb. We measured that category in tons, the format that we were in prior is a much heavier weighted by weight, pounds or kilogram how do you want to look at it, then the format that has been shifted to, so when we measure in tons. Obviously the same amount of packaging in a lot less weight, so volume by ton goes down. The other piece there on the volume in Latin America. Due to the economic situation in Latin America one of our large customers moved away from a large format ice cream container through a smaller format ice cream container. Ice cream is still selling, but we also measure that in tons. So going from a larger to a smaller you obviously lose tons in the calculation and lastly, a piece there as Mike mentioned in his script was we exited some very high mix extremely low margin business and when you actually calculated it through production it was breakeven at best. It was actually candy trays, if you think about Valentine's Day, inside of a candy box. So you get all different shapes and sizes and high mix, low margin in a rigid factory is not something that is suitable for manufacturers. So we walked away from some of that business, but on expectation in total for the volume that we - thinking about in Latin America and we're more so focused on profit and how do we make profit in that region because it is a region of very high inflation. Our teams are diligently pushing inflation through so that we're not left holding the inflation within our P&L. through Agility we've created a tremendous amount of leverage in that operating model in Latin America and we push volume through and push inflation through we are focused on profit. Debbie Jones : Okay, thanks for that clarification. Second question on the sustainability subject. This is nothing new, but the two things that I feel like we're hearing a lot about is, CPG's wanting to use more recycled material number one and then also wanting to have a package that is recycled off and one thing that's confusing to me is, it doesn't seem to me that there is enough infrastructure to actually provide a lot of recycled material in the plastic side, can you comment on that? And I mean more so, if this were to increase going forward and then two; where is Bemis in terms of being able to help customers to use virgin material that then could be recycled. Bill Austen : Sure, let me - let's talk to the first part of that. First the actual collection process. So if you just compare US with Europe. Europe is very much further ahead in that area. If you go to communities in Europe you will see bins where people take different pieces and components of plastic packaging and or paper packaging and or glass and or anything else for that matter and the communities are behind it. In the United States, we don't have that drive and that push just yet, it will take a while. But we have created a material that is being trialed at many CPG's today that we call Encore and it is a completely recyclable plastic material that we created ourselves through certain types of processing. This is now a completely recyclable package. On it, is how to recycle code and if you were to go to that website, how to recycle, you would be able to in your area for instance if you put in your zip code. It would tell you where you could take that material to be - to get into the recycle stream, that's one aspect. The other aspect some of the things that we're doing in our factories to recycle in-process waste, so that we can reuse is back into our virgin materials and combine that with multi-layer structures, is what we're doing internally. Externally again we have a lot of customers that are asking us to trial and look at, they're asking to trial our Encore material as well as where could they use Encore as part of their portfolio. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Molly Baum : Hi, this is actually Molly Baum sitting in for George. First question on just the rest of the world segment. You cited growth in healthcare packaging, but could you by chance kind of breakdown what you performance was in that segment by geography and where you were seeing growth and where you potentially saw some slowdown relative to either expectations or to what we saw in 2Q. Thank you. Bill Austen : Yes, sure. So we look at rest of the world, we look at Asia, Europe and healthcare packaging. So Asia and Europe are quite small winding our portfolio and in Asia, we were flat. But recall last year our third quarter in Asia was significant, we had double-digit growth in Asia 3Q last year. Europe, low single-digit growth in Q3. In our healthcare we had mid single-digit growth in our healthcare business and that's really been created hats off to the healthcare guys, they have a very robust new product pipeline which you need to have in that business because it's a three to five-year incubation period for a customer to take a new package through validation and qualification. So you need to have a very long pipeline of new projects coming to the market and our global team in healthcare has got that robust pipeline that allows them to grow at better than market rates. The market for our type of healthcare packaging is growing in about 4% and we're exceeding that rate because of the pipeline. Molly Baum : Okay, thank you that's very helpful and then my second question, just a follow-up on Matt's question about the US packaging segment. Last quarter you talked about how 19 out of the top 25 CPG accounts that you're working with you had seen positive growth with them. Can you talk about kind of what the trends were for the larger run businesses in the CPG accounts that you were seeing 3Q? Thank you. That's it from me. Bill Austen : Yes, I'll just break it down a little bit into segment. So in the protein segment and I'm talking meat and dairy if you will. We saw nice growth in both of those categories as well as in the liquid category. We continue see good growth because several years ago, we put in some assets to get focused on that and we have a team that is truly out there driving growth in liquid. And where we would see the categories weakness would be, let's call it the center of the store kinds of categories, what we call, general consumer, grocery consumer and industrial. However on the industrial side through the some of the new sales team that we brought on board to attack small and mid-sized customers. We're on boarding some new industrial type customers and non-food customers which we're helping in that category. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from Edlain Rodriguez of UBS. Please go ahead. Edlain Rodriguez : Bill, one quick question and then for 2018, you have that goal of achieving $25 million in short run businesses and you're on track for that. As we look forward into like 2019, 2020 like does that number increase significantly like leaps and bounds or is it going to be like at a more moderate pace. Bill Austen : We're not going to share at this point any 2019 targets. But if you just think through it though, the role forward of that business that will continue to grow and we're not stopping. I mean we've hired these sales people to go out and attack that segment of the market and they're going to continue do that and we've incentivized them to do that as well. So as they get further on board, if they continue to gain more momentum. They figure out how best to - we get finer at what are the good targets to go after, we're going to see that category continue to grow. Edlain Rodriguez : Okay and one quick one on Latin America. As you fine tune those low margin products, you're walking away from them. Like how much of that is left to be done? Bill Austen : We're in a pretty good place right now. This piece that we got rid of, which is just really high-mix, low margin, you're changing dyes out, you're changing resins over. It just didn't make sense. So we just exited and but we're in a really good place when we look at the portfolio of customers, the portfolio of products and what we're continuing to sell going forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Salvator Tiano from Analyst. Please go ahead. Salvator Tiano : Hi guys Salvator from Vertical Research. So my first question would be on the US packaging volumes. We did see some volumes declined in [indiscernible] and we've talked about everything that's going well in the US. But this 1% I guess decline that was not [indiscernible] business where did it come from, was it some customer losses, just lower volumes and existing customers and what kind of end markets were here to be aimed. Bill Austen : We don't look at anyone quarter as being a trend let's call it, right. Last year's Q3 we were up 2%, so from the perspective of US CPG landscape that's quite significant volume increase. So year-over-year basis down one, I'm not that doesn't excite or get us excited. What we're really looking at, we've hired 14 new people, we've added capabilities in our commercial area to how do we get \u201cquicker\u201d. The account reviews that we've put in place to identify where we can go and attack the market. A quick turn sample role process that has gone from many, many weeks down to five days. A core spec program that allows the new sales team to go out with a good, better, best specification to sell to the client base and we've on boarded 25 new customers in this middle to short run type of business. So I look at and say the process is on track, it's moving the business forward and we're going to exceed the $25 million of target that we set for ourselves at the beginning of the year in this category. I don't necessary look at the one down and say okay, something's gone wrong. Salvator Tiano : Sure. And just my second question, you noted that some of the margin softness in US was due to some paper performance and some customer incentives in Q3. So firstly is it possible to quantify by same manner usage $4 million a year ago where [indiscernible] what was the impact in 3Q first of all. And secondly can you elaborate on the way these accruals work in terms of was it for new businesses generated in 3Q or was it for successes that you had in 1Q and 3Q and judge the accrue the results right now. Mike Clauer : First of all, I'll talk about incentive for customer first. Basically at the beginning of the year you've got a program put in place and based on how they're performing you accrue the incentive throughout the year and so it's year-to-date, so as an example every quarter is going to have some incentive in it based on how, the business is trending. So last year, we reversed that for one specific customer that had been accrued through the second quarter that reversed in third quarter. The one would assume that, those accruals are now in place. They're in place every quarter this year for that specific customer. As for Playford performance again it's an annual target. Last year with their performance essentially we had very little Playford performance expense to the accrual as we went through the year. So this year targets were reset. I think we achieved our full year internal objectives. People who earned short-term incentive. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Rizzo of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Daniel Rizzo : You mentioned $25 million the small to mid-cap sales are coming from the new sales folks. I was wondering if it's all coming from them or view like kind of repositioned, your existing sales team to kind of focus on this market as well or is it just addition, which is it? Bill Austen : No, it's a combination of both Dan. Its combination of new folks that we've on boarded but it's now the fact that we've set up the processes internal, so that some of this shorter run business comes from our existing accounts as well. So it's not just coming from the new guys, it's coming new people I should say. It's coming from the entire sales force. But the focus of the new sales force is to go after these regional smaller accounts. Daniel Rizzo : Will you be hiring more new sales force to do the same? Bill Austen : We're feeling good about what we've got onboard right now and depending on how we continue to be successful and at that rate. You know we'll determine whether we need more. Operator : [Operator Instructions] and our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Arun Viswanathan : Just wanted to ask about medical packaging. It seems like you had some strong success there. What's your outlook for that business kind of going into next year and are there any possibilities to get larger? There I know you're going to Amcor transaction, but thoughts on expansion in that market. Bill Austen : We have a very good healthcare business globally. We run it globally for the reason of being effective, working with customers more closely, driving specification around the world for that type of package through that single source of customer. We continue to see this as a very nice space for us and it will be a good space for us for years to come. It droves better than GDP and we focus on it with innovation and technology, so that we create as I mentioned earlier that strong robust pipeline. Arun Viswanathan : And on Latin America, I guess obviously - you've discussed the trade down into different products in the past and now you're seeing that conversion. Do you expect sales would moderate and are at least flat now I guess next year or you think headwinds will continue from a volume perspective? Thanks. Bill Austen : The customer we talk to, all think that things will moderate or stabilize that's probably better way to put it, once they get through this election, this coming weekend. Obviously there will be some volatility post-election. But as the new government comes into place they feel that things will stabilize within that region. We again as I've said many times through Agility we have taken our fixed and variable cost down in that region significantly and created tremendous amount of leverage in our P&L, so that as volumes come back and continue to, as would continue to increase. We will continue to leverage the P&L and get fall through. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Please go ahead. Bryan Burgmeier : Hi, this is actually Bryan Burgmeier sitting in for Anthony. On the $12 million in cash cost related to Amcor that you called out. Could you clarify what offsets you're able to find in order to maintain guidance from cash operations? Sorry about this [indiscernible]. Mike Clauer : Our Q3 was a little better than we expected and we're very focused on delivering and generating cash flow in Q4. I wouldn't say there is any specific thing that offsets it. Bryan Burgmeier : Okay understood. And then on Latin America, is it possible to say what volumes would have been if you exclude the customer shifts that you pulled out? Bill Austen : I don't have that number on top of my head, sorry. Bryan Burgmeier : Okay, thanks. Erin Winters : One way to think about it Brian is that, the minus 15 let's 10 is related to folding box and then the remainder is related to the mix, topic Bill talked about as well as the customer changing format. So that explains the full 15, which would get you to flat. Operator : Thank you. And it appears we have no additional questions at this time. Erin Winters : Thank you. This concludes our conference call. Operator : Thank you all for your attention. This concludes our conference call. All participants can now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Erin Winters, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Erin Winters : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2018 conference call. Today is January 31, 2019. After today\u2019s call, a replay will be available on our website, bemis.com, under the Investor Relations section. Joining me for this call today are Bemis Company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Austen; our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Clauer; and our Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer, Jerry Krempa. Following Bill and Mike\u2019s prepared comments, Mike\u2019s prepared comments, we\u2019ll answer your questions related to our core business. We ask that you refrain from questions related to the pending merger with Amcor or our specific 2019 financial guidance. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I\u2019ll direct you to our website, bemis.com, under the Investor Relations tab, where you\u2019ll find our press release and supplemental schedules. On today\u2019s call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures as we talk about our performance. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures that we consider most comparable can be found in the press release and supplemental schedules on our website. And finally, a reminder that statements regarding future performance of the company made during this call are forward-looking and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from historical, expected or projected results due to a variety of factors. Please refer to Bemis Company\u2019s regular SEC filings, including the most recently filed Form 10-K to review these risk factors. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill. Bill Austen : Thank you, Erin, and good morning, everyone. 2018 was a year of great progress for Bemis. Our financial performance improved, and we continued to enact change to position our business for long-term success. As compared to last year, many financial metrics moved in the right direction. Adjusted earnings per share increased 17%, driven by solid year-on-year improvement across all business units and U.S. tax reform. Adjusted operating profit increased more than $25 million, driven by our Agility plan and improvements across all operating segments. Cash from operations increased more than $80 million, reflecting the discipline and accountability that continues to permeate throughout our organization. And adjusted return on invested capital increased over 100 basis points to 11.7%. Our teams across the globe have done a great job of executing Agility : fix through near-term profitability improvements and strengthen and grow through laying the foundation for long-term growth. I am proud of our teams and the focus, determination and drive they have demonstrated, particularly during the fourth quarter. Thank you to our leaders and colleagues across the globe who did not let our pending merger with Amcor be a distraction in 2018. You worked safely, served our customers well and delivered on financial commitments, and you should feel proud of the improvements you continue to deliver. I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike now to discuss the financials, and then I\u2019ll come back to wrap up with a summary of our progress on the pending merger with Amcor as well as my view on how our core business is positioned for the future. We will then take your questions. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll understand, we will only take questions related to 2018 performance and will not provide further comment related to the pending merger. Mike? Mike Clauer : Thanks, Bill, and good morning. We delivered solid fourth quarter and full year results, in line with our most recent expectations. I will start by discussing the performance of our segments for the full year 2018. U.S. Packaging; both sales and profit performance were in line with our expectations for the full year 2018. Sales were up 2.7% compared to the prior year, reflecting increased price and mix, partially offset by lower unit volume of 1%, which was related to the planned exit of infant care business at our Shelbyville, Tennessee facility. We more than met our target of an incremental $25 million of revenue from short-run business during 2018 and are well positioned to continue to penetrate the business in the future. U.S. Packaging profit margins were in line with our expectations of being flattish compared to prior year. Operating profit dollars rose almost $8 million, reflecting the benefits of Agility and improved operations, partially offset by the impact of freight costs, customer incentives and employee pay-for-performance, a good rebuilding year in U.S. Packaging, in line with our expectations. Turning to Latin America Packaging. Sales and profits were in line with our revised expectations for 2018. Organic sales, which exclude the impact of currency, were up 4.5% in 2018, reflecting increased price and mix, partially offset by unit volume decline of 9%, which was primarily driven by the laundry detergent packaging volume in Brazil that is converting to another packaging format. Latin America\u2019s Packaging operating profit increased $9.8 million, excluding the impact of currency. We delivered 100 basis points of margin expansion, in line with the plan for the year. Nice net profit improvement driven by variable and fixed cost reductions implemented due to the challenging economic environment in Brazil. We will continue to focus on what we can control in this region, and we will be well positioned when the economy improves. Turning to the Rest of World Packaging. We delivered a strong 2018. Organic sales were up 4.3% compared to the prior year, reflecting increased unit volumes of 3% and increased price and mix. Unit volumes were up quite strong in our health care packaging business and modest in our businesses in Asia and Europe during 2018. Excluding the impact of currency, Rest of World Packaging operating profit increased $18.9 million compared to last year. We delivered 200 basis points of margin expansion, driven primarily by the impact of strong volumes in health care packaging, which have good margins, and solid operational performance throughout the segment. Turning to the rest of our P&L and consolidated results. Total company SG&A and R&D expenses were down compared to prior year, which is better than our expectations coming into 2018. We did a great job of maintaining strong cost controls throughout the year to help overcome the impact of headwinds such as rising interest rates, which drove interest expense up $10.3 million compared to 2017 and approximately $3 million more than our original expectations coming into 2019. Our income tax rate in 2018 was in line with our most recent expectations of 23% when excluding the fourth quarter benefit related to the final refinements of the U.S. tax reform. Compared to the prior year, our 2018 income tax rate was lower due to the impact of lower U.S. tax rate tied to our earnings. Operating cash flow was $461.5 million in 2018, an increase of $82 million compared to last year. Cash flow results would have been even higher were it not for restructuring-related costs, cash costs of $39 million in 2018 as compared to $24 million in 2017. Additionally, we used $12 million in 2018 of cash related to the pending merger with Amcor. Even as reported, a nice improvement in cash flow, which includes the benefit of more profit and working capital improvements. Specifically on working capital, payables improved as we did a great job of ensuring we optimize various terms allowed in our contracts, good discipline by our teams. Primary working capital as a percentage of sales was 13.4% at year-end 2018, improved from 14.6% one year ago and better than our target range of 14% to 16%. Total company net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 2.2. times at year-end 2018, down from our targeted range on account of no share repurchases due to the pending combination with Amcor. As we begin 2019, we are focused on delivering our internal operating plan and continue to find ways to drive value for the long term. We are continuing to see improving operational effectiveness in our factories and our administrative functions. We are serving our customers better through improved quality and service, and we are leveraging the strong foundation we have built for long-term net growth bolstered by our Agility efforts to penetrate short-run opportunities in the U.S. I will now turn the call back to Bill. Bill Austen : Thanks, Mike. As you all are aware, in August, we announced plans to merge with Amcor to create the global leader in consumer packaging. We believe combining these two companies will drive significant value for shareholders, create opportunities for employees and help us better serve our customers over the long term. For shareholders, the benefits are clear : value creation from the $180 million of identified cost synergies that neither company could achieve on a stand-alone basis; additional potential revenue synergies from leveraging our respective products to each other\u2019s networks; and for Bemis shareholders, a dividend that will nearly double in the first year post close as compared to Bemis\u2019 historically strong dividend. Since the announcement in August, we have made progress in all work streams related to the combination. Our integration planning teams comprised of leaders from both Bemis and Amcor are well underway, developing the plans to bring together the best of both companies. The global integration planning team has made great progress in developing a playbook, which established global time lines and key integration steps to be executed post closing by the regional teams. The regional teams kicked off during December and continue to refine their execution plans. All involved are focused on ensuring that once the transaction closes, the integration is as seamless as possible and that the new company is well positioned to deliver its financial commitments. Our regulatory work stream has also made great progress, of note, with the exception of the United States, where we announced last week that the government shutdown slightly delayed our time line. All of the jurisdictions are on pace to the range of our original time line and outcome expectations. We received approvals in several regions to date, including China, and the remaining jurisdictions are progressing. As shared last week, we anticipate the transaction to close during the second quarter of 2019. Until the transaction closes, we will continue to operate as an independent company and remain focused on working safely, serving our customers and delivering our operating plans. We remain excited for the next chapter in our evolution. Turning to the outlook related to the core business. While we are not giving explicit guidance for 2019, there are several areas where we can reaffirm our views for the future. Agility remains a key driver. From a fix perspective, our teams remain committed to delivering the remaining $26 million of cost savings as part of our original $65 million plan. It is important to remember that $180 million of synergy related to the merger with Amcor is above and beyond the programs that either company previously had underway. From an Agility strengthen and grow perspective, we continue to expect long-term benefit from our work toward penetrating short-run business in the U.S. Taking a look around the globe. In our U.S. business, we anticipate modest top line growth and bottom line growth in 2019 as the benefits of Agility continue to flow. In our Latin America business, we anticipate 2019 organic revenue and profit to be roughly in line with 2018. We will hold the gains we made from the myriad of cost-outs in 2018, and we have assumed an economic environment that does not meaningfully change in the coming year. In the Rest of World business, we anticipate top line and bottom line growth to continue, driven primarily by our global health care packaging business. Although keep in mind that we will begin \u2013 we will be up against some tough comps given that 2018 was so strong. In closing, I\u2019m proud of our people that have performed and positioned the business for continued success. Through Agility and the hard work of our teams across the globe, we are well positioned for the future. We will continue to build on our strong foundation of an outstanding customer base, a committed and talented workforce, a comprehensive and innovative product portfolio, a strong asset base and good positions in the markets we serve. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to questions. Please respect that we intend to answer questions on our base business, not those related to the pending merger with Amcor or our specific 2019 financial plans. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Kyle White : This is Kyle White filling in for Debbie. I believe you said you expect a modest top line growth in U.S. Packaging. I wasn\u2019t sure if you expect a modest volume growth in that segment as well. And if you could just provide some trends there by end market such as protein and liquids versus some of the more consumer-oriented center-of-the-store products, that\u2019d be helpful. Bill Austen : Yes, sure. Yes, we would expect modest top line volume as well \u2013 from the top line growth that corresponds to volume as well. And if you look at where we finished up on trends in 2018, we had \u2013 we continue to see high single-digit growth rates in liquid in 2018. Now that may not continue at high single-digit growth rates into 2019. That might be a bit more modest. But we had low single-digit growth in protein. We\u2019ll continue to see that with some of the new product launches that we\u2019ve had. And we\u2019ve had the same low single-digit growth rates in the center-of-the-store categories, as you described them, and we\u2019ll continue to see that as we go forward. A lot of this is being driven from sustainability and new packaging formats that our R&D teams continue to launch and trial with customers from a recyclability and a sustainability perspective. So there\u2019s a lot in the queue in those areas, and that will drive those modest low-single to mid-single-digit growth rates in 2019. Kyle White : Yes. And then on the sustainability, I was just wondering if we could get an update on the Encore film. How far away are we from the Generation 2 that you alluded to earlier? What has been the response from some of the CPG customers that are trialing it? And then what about consumers as well? How receptive are they to using kind of the How2Recycle program? Bill Austen : Yes. What we\u2019re seeing is that the number of CPGs that are now trialing that material has increased significantly, and Gen 2 is not that far away. There\u2019s some in trial here at the Innovation Center that we\u2019re working through. But it\u2019s been well received. And I can\u2019t answer the question relative to consumers. I haven\u2019t had any direct consumer contacts to get their feedback on the How2Recycle label. Operator : And our next question comes from Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Connor Robbins : Hey, good morning. This is actually Connor Robbins sitting in for Brian. I just want to come back to the Rest of the World segment, some pretty performance, at least on a year-over-year basis there. I was hoping if you could provide a little more color on maybe the trends you\u2019re seeing there and maybe specifically with kind of the health care segment that you\u2019re seeing. Bill Austen : Yes. When we look at our global health care business, it had an extremely strong 2018. If you recall several years back, we made a large investment in that business to double the size of a plant here in North America and put in the largest converting clean room for medical device packaging in the U.S. That facility has come onstream extremely well. The team there has executed at that facility extremely well. Our business in Europe has done quite well this past year with some modifications that we\u2019ve made to equipment in one of our coating facilities there. We are growing that business in excess of industry growth rate, which is mid-single digits. So we\u2019re growing ahead of that. And through Agility, we\u2019ve created a good level of leverage in the P&L. So as new business comes in, we get a little bit of an extra bump because of the leverage that we\u2019ve created in the P&L. And I will also say that the team in health care has created a very strong pipeline of new projects and new products that \u2013 it\u2019s a very \u2013 it\u2019s a robust pipeline, but it\u2019s also a very well thought-out pipeline. So they\u2019re doing a good job there, and we\u2019re very excited about what that team has done. Connor Robbins : Okay, great. And then just following up with another question. Mike, you mentioned getting or at least meeting your short-run business tracks that you had planned for 2018. I was just hoping to get a little more color on what you\u2019re seeing here and maybe if you feel that your asset base is now properly set up to kind of support this going forward. Bill Austen : Yes. We put a target of short-run business at $25 million in 2018, and we have exited the year in excess of that $25 million rate. So the team in North America has done a great job there. They\u2019ve hired \u2013 they\u2019ve onboarded a bunch of new salespeople, roughly a little bit over a dozen new sales and commercial people to go attack that short-run small to midsize customer base. We\u2019ve gotten good traction on it. The asset base will continue to be refined as the company goes forward with the recapitalization program. But it has been successful, and it will continue to be successful because it\u2019s in a new business. Operator : And our next question comes from Salvator Tiano with Vertical Research. Salvator Tiano : Hi, guys. So firstly, I wanted to ask a little bit about the CapEx. It seems to be a little bit lighter than expected this year, and I wanted to understand a little bit. Was there any \u2013 were there any projects that were delayed or anything else going on there? And is there kind of any indication of where CapEx is expected to go in 2019? Bill Austen : Yes, Salvator, we were right on target with where we expected to be with our CapEx plans in 2018. We didn\u2019t delay any major projects. If you go back 2015, 2016, 2017, we brought in a lot of new capital, so 2018, we slowed a little bit because we wanted to absorb that capital that we had put in. And as we go forward, you should continue to think about the capital plans here as \u2013 at D&A, one time D&A. So we\u2019re talking somewhere between the $150 million to $180 million level of CapEx as you go forward. Salvator Tiano : Perfect. That\u2019s very helpful. And the other thing would be the overall operating cash flow. If I remember correctly, we\u2019re still looking at $410 million to $430 million last quarter and obviously delivered over $460 million. And I was wondering if you can discuss a little bit what made that variance to that amount, things like cash taxes, perhaps, or a bit better working capital, things like that. Mike Clauer : We were very focused in Q4 around the globe on maximizing operating cash flow. And we looked everywhere, payables, cash taxes, accounts receivable and customers that might be perpetually slow payers. And I can tell you, when we guided, the internal forecast is $430 million, and we just did \u2013 we did better than that. Operator : And our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : Hi, guys, sorry about that. I hope you\u2019re doing well. Just a quick question on the business here. I guess we\u2019ve seen some destocking, I guess, in the chain on plastic resins. Are you experiencing that? Maybe could you characterize where you think your inventory levels are and if there\u2019s any concerns amongst your customers on not purchasing given the reduction in oil? Thanks. Bill Austen : Yes. Where inventory levels are where they should be for this time of year and how our business ramps up through Q1, Q2. And we haven\u2019t seen what you\u2019re describing there, slowdown from customers\u2019 take, because of where oil is at or anything to that nature. We haven\u2019t seen that. Arun Viswanathan : And just as a follow-up, could you give us maybe a rundown across the geographies? Again, similarly, we\u2019ve noticed there has been a little bit of a pullback maybe in Asia and Europe. Did you see any of that? And maybe can you also comment on Latin America? Thanks. Bill Austen : Yes, sure. Yes, I\u2019ll walk you through the geographies. If you look to Bemis Asia Pacific, they had a very \u2013 they had a good year, driven through Agility, cost-outs in both the variable and the fixed side, created leverage in the P&L. They had much better mix in 2018 than 2017. They\u2019re very deliberate about creating that better mix. And as we got through the year and headed into 2019, we have a good, strong pipeline of innovation and new projects that are going to be coming forward. I think the question is more focused around China and has there been a slowdown in China. And yes, there absolutely has been a slowdown in the general packaging sector within China. We are focused on the high barrier types of materials, retort packaging types of materials. And we\u2019ve been introducing new specifications there that are helping us in that market segment. In Latin America, it\u2019s similar story. Agility, we created a good portion of leverage in the P&L, both on the SG&A side and the variable side. The real drive in Latin America for us in 2018, and it has been for a very long time, is to stay ahead of inflation. And as inflation continued to ramp up, we were ahead of inflation. We created positive mix in that geography via new segments that we launched projects into in back half of 2017 and 2018, and that has created a really nice business in Latin America. If you look at our profits in local currencies, all in the double-digit growth category, if you will, in 2018 because we\u2019re staying ahead of inflation. In Europe, we had low single-digit growth in Europe in 2018. And we, again, it\u2019s the same story, created leverage in the P&L via Agility, primarily on the SG&A side. We have had some variable cost reductions as well, and we had a nice 30-plus percent profit improvement in Europe in 2018 versus 2017. U.S. Packaging, Agility, same story, lowering our fixed and variable costs, creating leverage in the P&L, lowering our conversion costs versus on a year-over-year basis. Revenue was ahead of expectation in several market segments like liquid, protein, center of the store, GCI, as we call it. And our small to midsize customers short-run type of business exceeded our expectations, and we\u2019re going to see that continue to flow forward into 2019. And, yes, I\u2019ve already talked about the health care business, a strong year for our global health care business. I can\u2019t say enough about what that team has done. And the results were driven by that strong new product pipeline and leverage that they had created in the P&L, so we get great bottom line improvement in that business. And we\u2019ll continue \u2013 that team will continue to do that in 2019. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Anojja Shah with BMO Capital Markets. Anojja Shah : Hi, good morning. I just want to thank you for that run around the world. I just want to follow up on Brazil, actually. Another packager with earnings out this morning mentioned that since the presidential election, demand \u2013 at least for their product, demand has been much better than expected. Are you not seeing that? Or is it too early to tell for you? Bill Austen : We have long-term contracts with our customers. You\u2019ve got to separate the two, all right, separate the presidential election from where they are in the year, okay? They\u2019re going into their summer. So the normal uptake in volume always comes seasonally as you get into the summer months. So I\u2019m going to separate those two and say our volumes typically go up this time of year anyway, and I\u2019m not going to associate that with the presidential election. Anojja Shah : Right. Okay, that\u2019s fair. And sticking with Brazil, you mentioned this\u2026 Bill Austen : That\u2019s true. Anojja Shah : Pardon me. Bill Austen : I said that\u2019s true. That\u2019s what happened. Anojja Shah : Right, right. Sticking with Brazil, you mentioned the tax litigation situation in the release. And just to get a better understanding, I know the release says that it will be excluded when you finally do evaluate and will be excluded for adjusted earnings. But I assume it will be included in cash flow or \u2013 and can you give any sense of size yet or just general sense. Jerry Krempa : Sure. This is Jerry Krempa. We did receive a favorable decision, as we indicated. However, the decision just said we won based on the merits of our argument. There was no quantification of what price we will receive, and we\u2019re currently going through that calculation right now with the help of some outside consultants. We need to look back at prior years, obtain a lot of tax documents. So it\u2019s really, at this point, it\u2019s kind of uncertain in terms of the quantity and also how we\u2019re going to be claiming this credit going forward. We\u2019re trying to get some clarification on that right now. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our next question from Daniel Rizzo with Jefferies. Daniel Rizzo : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So things are generally doing well, but is there any area or end market that\u2019s kind of, at this point in time, kind of sluggish that you expect to rebound? Bill Austen : We don\u2019t see that, Daniel. We\u2019re pretty much on our expectations of where we should be at this time of year. We \u2013 as I\u2019ve mentioned already, China is probably a little bit slower in the general economy, so to speak, but we\u2019re targeting certain end market segments there where we can introduce new products. Daniel Rizzo : And then \u2013 so the short-run sales seemed to be progressing. As we look out going forward, I mean, is the growth going to be linear? Or is it going to be fits and starts? How should we think about it? Bill Austen : I think that growth would be linear. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a sawtooth if that\u2019s what you mean by fits and starts. We have a deliberate approach to how we go after that with what we call the agile lane process, where we use a set of core specifications of good, better, best in specs that we have on shelf. The sales team that we brought in, the commercial organization that\u2019s focused on that, has got a playbook that they run on how to sell those core specifications and to what kind of customer are they targeting. So I think that as we continue to gain more and more traction and experience in that arena, it will be a linear approach to how those sales come in. Daniel Rizzo : Okay. And then just one more quick one. Just in terms of resin costs and input costs, particularly freight, are you still seeing \u2013 what are you seeing in terms of \u2013 and what you expect for 2019? Bill Austen : Yes, we see freight costs continue to rise. As we talked about in our third quarter call, we have targeted programs, working with customers to try to be much more collaborative as to how we can mitigate their freight costs, our freight costs and just work together to figure out how do we bring it down. But freight costs will continue to rise in 2019. That\u2019s our \u2013 how we see it. Operator : And there are no additional questions in the queue. I\u2019ll turn the call back to our presenters for additional or closing remarks. Erin Winters : Excellent. Thank you all for joining us today. This concludes our conference call. Bill Austen : Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, again, this does conclude today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Ron Delia : Okay. Good morning. Thanks everyone for joining us. I\u2019m Ron Delia here to present Amcor's first half results for the 2019 financial year. And with me here today is Michael Casamento Amcor\u2019s CFO. As we do with all meetings at Amcor, we will start with safety and safety as you would've heard us talk about before, is our top priority at Amcor. We have one goal when it comes to safety and that\u2019s no injuries. We\u2019re not at no injuries yet but our safety performance was the highlight of the first half for our employees around the world. Through their commitment and passion for keeping each other safe, we were able to reduce the number of recordable injuries across Amcor by 20% compared to the first six months of fiscal 2018. And we are especially proud of this performance given we were able to stay focused and vigilant at a time when the risk of distraction was arguably higher and we know we won\u2019t see reductions at this level every six months -- in every six month period. But we're determined to continue to drive improvements across the company until we reach that goal of no injuries.  Turning to Slide 6, and a summary of the first half. Our financial performance was in line with our expectations for the half. We had sales growth across the business and especially with multinational customers and healthcare packaging globally. And earnings growth was balanced across the Flexibles and Rigid Plastics segments with strong earnings growth in emerging markets of 9%. Operating cash flow was also strong and 27% higher than last year. And with this good first half result, we are on track to deliver against the full year outlook we provided in August which we are reconfirming today. It's clear that our value proposition is resonating with customers, large and small.  In the first half, we opened a new plant in India to supply Unilever. We extended our already long-term partnership with Nespresso and we again saw growth with regional beverage customers in North America. And consumers and customers around the world are increasingly seeking sustainable packaging options and this is a great growth opportunity for Amcor.  As the industry leader we have a differentiated value proposition when it comes to sustainability and we are making real progress on a number of dimensions which I'll come back to later.  And finally, we\u2019ve made significant progress over the last six months towards closing the Bemis transaction. We expect the deal to close in the second quarter of the 2019 calendar year and we're excited about the substantial opportunities this combination creates for Amcor and for our shareholders and I'll come back again on this topic later in the presentation. Slide 7 shows the key financial metrics for the half. Sales were up across all of our businesses and 4.3% higher overall. And approximately 2% of that sales increase came from recoveries of higher raw material costs. And excluding the impact of those higher raw materials, margins for the company were in line with last year. EPS growth of 3.4% came from recently acquired businesses, organic sales growth, restructuring benefits and strong cost performance. And strong cash flow was supported by excellent performance on working capital and the balance sheet remains strong with leverage at 2.8 times. We\u2019re very comfortable with our financial position and that will strengthen even further following the Bemis acquisition.  With these results and our confidence in the outlook for the business, the Board increased the interim dividend to 21.5 US cents per share.  Moving on to the Flexibles segment on Slide 8, Flexibles PBIT was modestly higher than the prior year in constant currency terms and in line with expectations. The PBIT growth reflects contributions from both recent acquisitions and organic growth. And operating cost performance was strong across the Group as was sales growth in our healthcare business. Earnings growth in emerging markets was also higher than last year. These benefits were partly offset by the adverse impact from the normal time lag in recovering higher raw material costs Now to the Flexibles outlook for the 2019 financial year on Slide 9. The Outlook has not changed from the guidance we provided in August 2018. In constant currency terms we're expecting the Flexibles segment to deliver solid PBIT growth in the 2019 financial year compared with PBIT of $835 million achieved in 2018. And this takes into account the following factors. First, modest organic growth, which assumes no earnings impact related to movements in raw material costs. So this means we expect the adverse impact in H1 to reverse in H2. Second, net benefit from prior period acquisitions of approximately $10 million after deducting cost to integrate and achieve synergies. And lastly, incremental and final restructuring benefits related to initiatives announced in June 2016 of approximately $10 million.  Moving to Rigid Plastics on Slide 10. PBIT was 5.6% higher than the prior year in constant currency terms and the business benefited from volume growth in beverage end markets and a favorable product mix. There was a modest contribution from a good start to our restructuring initiatives and earnings from acquired businesses also increased benefiting from lower integration costs in the first half, which will now be incurred in the June half year.  In the North American beverage business overall volumes returned to growth and mix was strong. And in Latin America volumes were 1% higher than last year inclusive of lower volumes in Argentina where economic conditions have adversely impacted consumer demand. Excluding Argentina volumes were 6% higher than last year. In terms of the outlook for Rigid Plastics on Slide 11. There is no change to our guidance, which we provided in August 2018 and we continue to expect the Rigid Plastics business to deliver solid PBIT growth in 2019 compared with the $312 million achieved in 2018 and this also takes into account a few factors.  First, modest organic growth. Second, net benefit from prior period acquisitions of approximately $5 million to $10 million after deducting costs to integrate and achieve synergies and approximately $5 million to $10 million of benefit from the restructuring initiatives.  With that, I'll hand it over to Michael to talk about the cash flow and balance sheet. Michael Casamento : Thanks, Ron. Good morning. So operating cash flow for the period was strong at a 115 million and up 27% on prior year. This is after deducting spend of around US$28 million of integration and restructuring related costs which have been included in underlying PBITDA. Cash interest was 90 million with the increase mainly reflecting the impacts of higher debt costs in the USA. During the second half of the year we started to benefit from maturities of some relatively high cost fixed rate debt and expect interest costs to be lower in the second half relative to this first half.  As Ron mentioned, working capital performance was a highlight across all businesses. This has been a particular area of focus and we're very happy to see the benefits being realized.  Our average working capital to sales ratio reduced to 10% from 10.4% last year and from 10.6% at June 2018. The improvements were in a range of areas including payables and receivables. Spend on restructuring initiatives relates to larger-scale programs we've announced in prior years. And in line with our guidance from August, we expect full year free cash flow after capital expenditure and dividends to be in the range of 200 million to 300 million.  Looking at the balance sheet and debt profile, the key point on Slide 13 is that Amcor's balance sheet remains strong. Our primary objective for the balance sheet is to maintain an investment grade credit rating. To achieve this we consider a wide range of ratios with two of the main ones being leverage and interest cover. These two initiatives remain at robust levels and are in line with where we anticipated them to be at period end at 2.8 times and 6.8 times, respectively.  In terms of financing costs we expect net interest for the 2019 financial year to be in the range of 200 million to 210 million in constant currency terms with interest cost in the second half lower than the first half as I mentioned earlier.  We continue to be in a very comfortable position in relation to our debt profile with access to a diverse range of funding sources and a non-current debt maturity of five years, an appropriate combination of fixed and floating debt with a well balanced mix of currencies.  We are well advanced in our work to ensure funding arrangements for a larger combined company in place prior to the close of the Bemis transaction and this also takes into account Amcor\u2019s next sizeable refinancings which are EUR550 million bond and USD750 million syndicated facility, both due in April 2019. So in summary, the key message from me this morning's is that Amcor remains very well positioned with strong cash generation and balance sheet capacity for growth. With that, I'll hand back over to Ron. Ron Delia : Thanks, Michael. For the next few minutes as I would normally do on these calls I will quickly recap on Amcor\u2019s strategy and talk about the longer term growth potential we see for the company. And I'll start with Slide 15 which provides a recap of our strategy, which includes three elements : Starting with a focused portfolio of businesses; a set of differentiated capabilities; and our aspiration to be the leading global packaging company and winning for all of our key stakeholders.  The first element is our portfolio. We\u2019ve chosen to play in segments, which share some important characteristics. First of all a focus on primary packaging for fast moving consumer products, good industry structure and an attractive relative growth outlook. And those criteria have led us to a focused portfolio today in four product segments : Flexible packaging, rigid containers, specialty cartons and closures. And we have leadership positions in most of these segments and multiple paths to winning by have another scale advantage or something unique to offer in the market. The second element of our strategy is the Amcor way, which is how we describe the differentiated capabilities we drive in a consistent way across Amcor. And these are the capabilities that we believe are the keys to winning in the packaging industry and developing them in a consistent way across our businesses is how we get leverage across our portfolio. And from this portfolio of businesses instead of differentiated capabilities we generate strong cash flow which we look to deploy in order to win for our shareholders.  And Slide 16 is a good way of depicting how we think about deploying that cash flow, it's essentially our capital allocation framework, which we\u2019ve called our shareholder value creation model and it hasn't changed for a number years. And through paying dividends, growing the business organically, pursuing acquisitions or returning residual cash to shareholders, over time value creation has been consistent and remains strong and defensive. Turning to Slide 17 and an update on our sustainability agenda which is quite extensive. One of the biggest opportunities we see for Amcor going forward comes from the increasing consumer interest around the world in more sustainable and environmentally-friendly packaging. And we believe packaging; especially primary packaging will always have a critical role in protecting and delivering food and healthcare products in a convenient and functional way. And there is a great opportunity for Amcor with our scale and innovation capabilities to create differentiated products to meet those consumer needs in an environmentally-friendly manner.  And one year ago, we became the first global packaging company to pledge to develop all of our packaging to be recyclable or reusable by 2025, to significantly increase our use of recycle materials and to work with others to drive greater recycling of packing around the world. And in October we took this commitment a step further by joining 250 other companies and governments and becoming a signatory to the new plastics economy global commitment and this puts us in a lockstep with even more of our existing and potential customers to achieve waste and pollution targets based on shared definitions and to report on progress annually. And over the last 12 months in general around sustainability our momentum has been building. We\u2019ve recently decided to allocate some resources and establish a sustainability center of excellence in Europe to advance our flexible packaging R&D efforts with dedicated technical and engineering resources, and we plan on doubling those staffing levels and adding innovation lab in the coming months.  A great deal of our efforts so far has been focused on product development, and we've introduced over the last several months a couple of new flexible packaging products called HeatFlex and Genesis which are fully recyclable. And with promising results we\u2019re also trialing films with higher and higher levels of postconsumer recycled content. You can expect us to continue to be active on the product development front. The demand for fully recyclable packaging is greater than ever, and we are partnering with our customers to fast-track commercialization of these innovations, and in some cases, looking into opportunities to co-invest in dedicated assets. And through our partnerships we are working towards industry wide standards for recyclability, supporting trials for curbside recycling of flexible packaging and contributing to public investments and community programs for recycling infrastructure.  It's a very exciting time in our sustainability journey. And as the industry leader, we see sustainable packaging as a unique opportunity to drive meaningful growth going forward, and we will take another significant step forward in this journey by combining with Bemis which brings together the two R&D leaders in our industry, and I'll provide now a quick update on that transaction.  To quickly recap, we announced the all-stock transaction in August 2018, and we said at the time and we believe today that Amcor is a very strong company and a leader in its own right. But by combining with Bemis, we take a big step toward being the leading player in consumer packaging at a moment in time when the opportunities for a leading company have never been greater.  Putting the two companies together results in footprint, scale, talent and capability advantages to offer the most compelling value proposition to our customers and employees, and to deliver the most sustainable innovations for the environment.  From a strategic perspective, we believe the combination is highly compelling and feedback from a range of stakeholders indicates they would agree. The combined company will have the most comprehensive global footprint for flexible packaging and will have greater scale and resources in each key region around the world.  Our portfolio will benefit from increased exposure to attractive end markets and product segments, which can be transferred across regions and leveraged across that global footprint and there's the opportunity to merge the capabilities and talents from both companies to create the industry's best team and one that will be focused on delivering for our customers around the world. The financial rationale is equally compelling with strong transaction metrics, a stronger financial profile for Amcor going forward, greater liquidity for investors and an all-stock structure, which is cash and tax-free for shareholders.  The transaction itself will deliver double-digit pro forma EPS accretion and returns well above Amcor's weighted average cost of capital by unlocking $180 million of cost synergies that would not have been available to either company independently. The teams from Amcor and Bemis continue to work together to further develop the cost synergy opportunities across general and administration costs, manufacturing footprint and procurement. And the synergies are expected to be delivered relatively evenly over the three-year period post close. And will drive significant earnings growth in the near term over and above normal organic growth. And any revenue synergies would represent additional upside to these metrics.  Amcor has had a great track record in delivering acquisition synergies and of course we aspire to outperform this target. And as we get closer and closer to the Bemis colleagues and business we see real opportunities to do just that.  Moving to Slide 22, Amcor's financial profile is strengthened going forward. Shareholders own an interest in a very well-positioned differentiated business generating $2.2 billion of EBITDA annually with higher margins through the delivery of the cost synergies and the potential to grow at higher rates given a stronger customer value proposition, complementary capabilities and increased exposure to attractive segments. And Amcor will maintain an investment grade balance sheet with annual free cash flow exceeding $1 billion and will continue to pay a compelling and competitive dividend which will increase over time. Importantly, there will be immediate balance sheet capacity for further investment or share buybacks.  The transaction structure results in the stock being listed on two major exchanges, which creates a unique and advantaged outcome in terms of index participation. Given that Amcor\u2019s shareholders will own 71% of the combined company and taking into account the geographic mix and the investment mandates of Amcor's shareholder base, the Australian listed shares will continue to be included in the S&P 200 Index with no significant change expected to our current index weighting.  We also expect the total market cap of the combined company to qualify for inclusion in the US S&P 500 Index. And this would mean the combined company would be well within the top 300 in that index which is the largest in the world. And as a result of the all-stock structure the transaction will close without the need for any shareholders to contribute cash and the share for share exchange will be tax-free.  Since the transaction was announced, we made significant progress towards closure, including setting up an integration management office to drive planning efforts leading up to the close of the transaction and oversee integration and synergy execution in the post closing period. This IMO has been staffed with about 20 full-time team members from both Amcor and Bemis and supported by several external advisors and joint development of detailed plans designed to enable a fast start to integration, including the delivery of synergy benefits is well underway.  And the process of securing required antitrust clearances and regulatory consents has been completed or is progressing in line with expectations. Clearance has been secured in all jurisdictions which are conditional to closure with the exception of Europe, the US and Brazil and in each of these regions discussions are at an advanced stage. In fact, we expect a decision to be announced by the European Commission in the coming days.  We continue to anticipate the deal will close in the second quarter of the 2019 calendar year and we look forward to building a strong future together with our new Bemis colleagues and customers.  In closing, we had a good start to the 2019 financial year. Our financial performance was in line with expectations and we are on track to deliver against an unchanged full year outlook. We are also winning with customers in advancing our sustainability agenda every day and we\u2019ve made significant progress towards closing the Bemis acquisition, all of which sets us up for a very promising future.  We're excited about the opportunities we see ahead and we believe the growth potential of Amcor remains substantial.  With that, I'm happy to take questions. Q - Niraj Shah : Hi Ron, Neeraj Shah here from Morgan Stanley. Could you maybe give us an update on price trends you're seeing across key input cost categories, in particular liquids which are harder for us to track? Ron Delia : Yes. Thanks, Niraj. The raw material front, which is most relevant for our Flexible Packaging segment we continue to see a modest headwind in the first half, so we had about a $5 million adverse PBIT impact. Now raw materials were flatter in the first quarter, started to decline late in the second quarter, in November, December and so we expected that negative $5 million impact was saw in the first half will be reversed in the second, so for the full year the income statement impact will be nil.  But your question about material trends, we did see oil obviously come off towards the end of calendar \u201818 and the resins and polymers come off as well, in some cases quite substantially. I would point out though that in some regions you also had an inverse currency movement which sort of neutralizes the benefits as you translate the costs, which are typically recorded in US dollars back to local currencies. Looking forward, it\u2019s always difficult to say we see signs that indexes are ticking up in the mid-single-digit across many the commodities, liquids would be no different, but not enough for us to change our outlook for the year, which is again no income statement impact. David? David Toth : Ron, can I ask two questions, the first question, you said 9% growth for emerging markets. I mean that\u2019s a pretty top-down statement. Can you going to a bit of detail as to which areas are going well, which areas are still lagging? And probably the second question is on Slide 43. This is probably to Michael. It was a big uplift in contribution from rebates. Is that part of your working, I think is that $18 million contribution to earnings that was on that slide, is that a big part of you driving the customers harder, driving titles? Can you go through that as well too close? Ron Delia : Yes. Let me start with the emerging markets question. We had 9% EBIT growth in the emerging markets as you pointed out. That starting point, David would be that we had profit growth in all of them, so the big regions are Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, obviously, and we had proper growth in each of them. I would say the standout was Asia, we also had good sales growth in all three of those regions, but Asia has good sales growth, excellent cost performance in general. And similarly in Eastern Europe rate of growth was a little bit lower. Latin America grew as well. Now in Latin America, we have a business that spans across nine or 10 different countries, you always have some fits and starts across different individual markets. But generally we had growth in both Flexibles, rigid containers and specialty cartons business. So it really was pretty much across the board. I would say that Asian business was probably the highlight. Unidentified Analyst : [Inaudible] Ron Delia : Yes, look in some of those markets as I referred to in the answer to Niraj\u2019s question, you had raw materials come off but you had currency depreciate quite extensively as well. So we didn't necessarily see the benefit in the emerging markets from lower raws at the end of the second quarter that we may have seen elsewhere. Look we'll see going forward. We don't see anything that leads to change our outlook for the year. Michael Casamento : On the rebates point, so you\u2019re referring to Slide 43, thanks for that. Included in that line is actually the net settlement -- the legal claim net settlement, including in that line which we then back out from an [SI] perspective. So that\u2019s really the key movement in that line and that relates to a legal settlement that we had.  So you back that out and from an other income perspective, then the net line, usually 58 versus the 47 in the prior year so in total we saw about 10 million increase in other income excluding the one-off. But offsetting that obviously below that we have got increased restructuring and integration costs during the period of about 10 million. So the net of those two I think was a minor gain of about $1 million. Unidentified Analyst : Ron, just if we look at cash flow for the period, just sort of can you run through exactly what's the key drivers of that very strong performance, generally would expect a weaker first half performance there on the cash flow side? So are there any sort of key drivers of that? And then secondly just on sustainability, just where do you think you are currently at relative to your competitors in the packaging side? And not sort of look at more broadly than just we think Flexibles and Rigid Plastics, looking at other substrates and just where you\u2019re positioned with key customers there? Ron Delia : Let me take that one first and then we can come back on the cash flow question. Look sustainability is just gaining steam externally but the momentum inside Amcor can't be understated. I mean it\u2019s just -- it\u2019s a great opportunity and we are leaning into it with our full weight. In terms of where we\u2019re positioned the starting point for me is our customers, and there is not a senior-level of customer discussion that's taken place anywhere at Amcor that doesn't revolve around this topic or at least have it as a primary point of discussion. And it's very much in the spirit of partnership. Our customers realize that society and consumers are looking for better answers. And they also know that Amcor is likely to be able to have those solutions, right? So from a positioning expense in terms of the prominence that we have in the eyes of our customers as being able to help them, I couldn't say more for where we are at. We are in an excellent position. I've had numbers seen amuse myself for this is the predominant discussion. And you are seeing customers as I alluded to earlier, being much more open and willing and eager to commercialize things and to work through the product development and qualification process faster to get products to market because the consumer need and demand is there. So I think within our sphere we are as well positioned and I would argue better positioned than anybody because we are seeing is the company that has a capability and the technology and the answers to help customers. If we go beyond our immediate sphere and think about packaging more broadly, we still see plastics taking share from other formats. In beverage last year in the United States, we still see plastic growth by units and we still see plastic take share in units versus metal and glass, and that trend has been continuing for many, many years. And I think the consumer recognizes the recyclability of a plastic container, part of the challenge is getting the consumer to actually recycle that container. But from a technical perspective, the product characteristics are such that it's fully recyclable and they enjoy all the other convenience that they are used to which is the receivability and the light weight. So we think that we are well-placed relative to our immediate peers and we would suggest relative to the whole packaging space and these substitutes that might be out there that the plastic containers and flexible packaging we make is really well-positioned. I mean we can talk more about specific actions we are taking, new product developments which we highlighted this morning and partnerships on recyclability, I would state that if there is a follow-up on the topic. The cash flow question? Michael Casamento : Yes look in terms of the cash flow I mean it was -- we had really pleasing results in our working capital to sales ratio over the period and so we have got sustained improvements. So in that scenario we have been focused on. Obviously we have seen some increase in that area over the last couple of years with the acquisitions. We are now starting to see some benefits flow through there. And it was in -- across the board really that we certainly saw some improvement in managing our over dues on the receivable side and also on the payables since we\u2019ve got some benefit there which is sustainable over the period and we continue to focus in this area and we\u2019d hope that we can see some further improvement as we progress forwards. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks, Ron. I am just wondering if you can talk us through the volume and mix performance in the Flexibles business. We saw a strong improvement in the Rigid Plastics business, but if you can talk us through your expectations going forward and the performance in the first half of volume and mix in the Flexibles division? Ron Delia : While I'd say the performance going forward will be consistent with the performance in the first half, so we continue to guide to modest organic growth in both segments. Specifically as it relates to mix in Flexibles in the first half, we had very good growth in healthcare segments. Healthcare for us is both medical packaging and pharmaceutical packaging. We had good growth in the emerging markets, as I mentioned, and in some of the food categories, where the weakness in mix came about which we referenced particularly in Europe is just in some of the higher value-added categories, ready meals being one, culinary applications. These are not major, major segments, but the mix contribution that they made in the first half was negative. Unidentified Analyst : Just a second question from me in terms of the Alusa\u2019s performance, can you break that out or give some color in terms of how that performed in the half? Ron Delia : Look right on track that business has performed the way we expected it to this year. It certainly doesn't have the raw material headwinds that it had over the last 12, 15 months and I was saying in the comment before about the currency depreciation offsetting the decline in raw materials. It's certainly not wearing the same headwind. The underlying market in South America, it's a mixed bag. I wouldn't say they\u2019ve generally improved all that much and that business has an exposure in Argentina, which is particularly depressed. But generally we\u2019re happy with that business. We continue to win business from big multinational customers in particular on the ability to supply in South America and that's had benefits for us, not just in that region but also in Europe and in Asia, and in North America to some extent. So we\u2019re happy with where that\u2019s at.  Might take one from the phone here. We have Brook Campbell-Crawford from JP Morgan. Brook Campbell-Crawford: Firstly just on I believe there was some cost incurred in the first half to achieve synergies relating to recent acquisition. Generally would you help quantify what cost and where in the first half for this region and also what the expectation is in the second half '19? Ron Delia : Yes, Michael can provide the numbers there. But generally it's around $30 million of cost to achieve synergies and integration, which is on the slide on Page 43 that Michael went through before, that's first half experience, that\u2019ll a bit more in the second half particularly in Rigid Plastics, but it started within the order of magnitude that we would expect on the back of the bolt-on deals that we've done recently. Brook Campbell-Crawford: And then also just on Bemis talks a lot about going after short run business particularly in North America. Just interested during this time if you thought of more today similar opportunity for Amcor in Europe or elsewhere across the globe? And if so, what sort of investments need to be made to drive it? Ron Delia : Yes, look, absolutely, that's a trend that's pervasive in all of the segments that we\u2019re in which is shorter run work for our larger customers who are proliferating SKUs and launching new products at a rapid rate. And then also they tap into the smaller customer part of the market, that's a requirement. In the Flexibles business we're doing a lot of the same things, Bemis is doing. We have some business process changes we\u2019ve made to be able to respond quicker. From an asset perspective, we've got some short run printing presses in Europe, some digital printing assets. None of these are really material and you'd know from this business that the incremental productive asset is just a several million dollars, it's not a big capital cost. So as we roll forward and refresh the asset base, increasingly the asset investments go towards machines that are geared towards that part of the market. I think that's the Flexibles side. The Rigid Plastics business we alluded to in the release today continues to see really, really strong growth in the regional beverage side of the market. So the smaller customers that are participating in maybe one part of the US market or one product category continue to grow quite well. We're winning with them, I think plastic is winning with them to the question we had earlier about format preferences. And so, we expect to see that going forward to continue. Brook Campbell-Crawford: Thanks, Ron. Just one more from me. I just wanted to revisit a comment made by the team last year just talking about the acquisition, allying for higher barrier films to be shipped sort of between countries. Just wondering if you could highlight which countries Amcor and Bemis currently manufactures these higher barrier films and if any benefit from this is included in the synergies area? Ron Delia : Yes. It\u2019s a good question. Look I think first the easiest part is that there is no revenue synergy benefits included in any of the acquisition metrics that we\u2019ve quoted today or previously, so that's potential source of upside. Look generally, our footprint -- our footprints are quite complementary, they\u2019re the leader in North America and Brazil. We would be the leader in the other large regions in the world and both of us are seen as technology players with unique products, in Bemis' case high barrier films. We also are pretty well-regarded for higher films but we do a lot of foil-based packaging as well. And so the opportunity is to take the higher barrier films let's say that Bemis might be winning in North America, take those to Europe and Asia, and the rest of Latin America and similarly the products that we have in Europe that Bemis maybe doesn't have, the opportunities for us to take those from Europe to North America and to Brazil. So it's really a swap, it'll go both ways, but I think the key is that none of that potential opportunity is included in the deal metrics. John Purtell : Hi, John Purtell from Macquarie, just had a couple of questions. Just sort of I think in a general sense, I mean this sort of feels like a rise of the headwinds that you\u2019ve faced for the last 12 months in particular is starting to abate. Are there any -- and we're talking about the base business, are there any sort of additional headwinds or tailwinds that are sort of giving you particular focus at the moment? Ron Delia : No, I think -- look I think we talked enough about some of the issues that have kind of manifested themselves in the 12 month period. There were industry issues, whether it was raw material increases or volumes, right? I mean I think that we weren't immune to those industry issues, they\u2019ve started to abate. I would say we talked about raw materials. We haven't seen is a real turn yet, we saw leveling off I would say and the $5 million dollar adverse impact in fact. In the first half we expect to get that back but not more at this stage. In the beverage space, look we had a return to volume growth. I think some of that was cycling inventory destocking last year, I'm not sure the market has generally gotten all that much more robust, but I think the business has demonstrated it can generate growth particularly with the smaller customers that I referred to earlier.  So nothing on the horizon John, I think the business continues to be pretty resilient and defensive and once in a while you have a period like we had last year where there was a few things hitting the industry at once and you\u2019re aware of it but we\u2019re just focused on what we can control and we feel pretty good about the half and the outlook for the second half. John Purtell : Just an add-on to that, just in terms of Latin American rigid so you\u2019ve sort of mentioned volumes were up percent, what about in terms of EBIT sort of constant currency, other comment on, did that move in positive direction? Ron Delia : Yes. It was positive. It grew modestly and I think volume growth was 6% ex-Argentina and the business benefited from that, benefited from mix and benefited from good cost performance, so the earnings of that. David Walker : David Walker from Clime Capital. Hanging back to previous acquisitions, can you give us any summary metrics for the revenue synergies which were achieved and will it cost more to make and supply recyclable packaging? Ron Delia : Look the revenue synergies that have come I would describe qualitatively, I think the Alusa example is the best one where we\u2019ve picked up a number of big -- first of all we don\u2019t factor the revenue synergies into our return metrics. So Alusa is a best example, where prior to the Alusa acquisition, we were very much a healthcare focused flexible packaging business in the Americas. And we\u2019ve talked about aspirations to do more and to be a broader player in that region. And I think that was well received but we weren\u2019t really able to act on it. Once we closed that deal in Latin America it opened up a whole range of discussions with all of the usual suspects in terms of the large customers and you see the benefits indirectly. In some of the things that we announced today, so we opened a greenfield plan in India for Unilever. We've extended our partnership with Nespresso, and I wouldn't pin either of those developments specifically to Alusa but I would say that that deal reinforced the view in the eyes of those two customers that we are very compelling global partner. And I\u2019m not sure that those two events happened without that deal I\u2019m not sure but I think certainly there are global supply agreements we\u2019ve put in place that have splendored on supply in South America, but provide benefits back in Europe and Asia to our legacy business. So that\u2019s the kind of thing that we expect to see going forward with Bemis as well. I don\u2019t quantify it because I think that we don't give ourselves a lot of credit for that in the transaction metrics anyway, but we know that the benefits are occurring. And sorry your second question? Unidentified Analyst : [Indiscernible] Ron Delia : Look, I think at the end of the day it's going to cost what it would cost in the consumer world demand that that's a solution and scale benefits will accrue over time. At the moment recycled content tends to be more expensive but that's partially a function of the scale through the value chain or the supply chain. There's no technical reason why processing recycled input should cost more than processing virgin resin pellet, it's more the security of supply and the -- just the lack of capacity or lack of supply that\u2019s out there which has held the economics back but the production processes should not be different. Richard Johnson : Richard Johnson from CLSA. Ron I\u2019ve got one but that\u2019s easy, so to give you an opportunity to just continue with that. But when I think about the way the CPG companies that are addressing, say sort of seeing through these two elements still, one is recyclability which you\u2019ve addressed; the two, they very clearly find the regions going out plastics, where they can. So I was just wondering, I mean in fact almost every day you see a product, which is being moved away or a company announcing their products being moved away from plastics. So to what extent or how much work have you done looking your portfolio that might be risk to that process? Ron Delia : Yes, it\u2019s a good question. I mean first of all our efforts on the product development front are expansive. So recyclability we think and our customers would say is the likely best outcome for almost every category and every format. But our customers and Amcor in fact or Amcor like our customers are exploring a full range of solutions including compostability and biodegradability, bio-based materials and alike. We also talk to some of them from time-to-time about more fiber-based laminates. I think the reality Richard as you would understand I mean the barrier requirements that some of these products now demand, particularly if the functionality is to be preserved, are not going to be easily addressed by an alternative. And I think the customers know that, I think they have some very high-profile examples that they may see to point too. But I think generally speaking, the categories that we are supplying into are best served by plastics in most cases. Richard Johnson : Do we make the some comments for Bemis as well? Because I know they\u2019ve got a large beverage wrap business which are a lot of fiber-based as of now. Ron Delia : Yes, that\u2019s an overwrap business. I would say if you think about the core of Bemis they have got some very high value-add films and structures for meat and proteins liquids which is very much like our high-performance business in Europe. Those are the areas where it's difficult to see substitutes in near term, particularly anything close to attractive cost. Richard Johnson : And just a couple of for Mike if I may. Can you just run me through the drop in D&A please? Michael Casamento : Yes, sure. I think the drop overall, that half of the drop is actually currency. So the net move was about 6 million, and that's really on the back of the restructuring programs we have dove over the last sort of while. There have been some cash and non-cash components to that. So part of that is a reduction in D&A. Richard Johnson : How much sort of about roughly? I was just trying to understand, 7 million currency, that would be 7 of the 17 is in D&A which is kind of hard to understand? Michael Casamento : The movement in D&A is 12. Richard Johnson : And then movement on the constant currency basis? Michael Casamento : 6. Richard Johnson : Yes, so half of that is currency, so net currency impact 6 or 7, your total currency impact was 17. So I am trying to understand why there is\u2026? Michael Casamento : In PBITDA it\u2019s higher. Richard Johnson : Okay. I\u2019ll switch there. And then just on your Slide 43, which is incredibly helpful, can I just run through the large categories, so that\u2019s asset sales, not the rebates, we'll come back to that, other and your restructuring costs. If I look at down the two years, can you just give me a feel for which divisions those offset? Michael Casamento : It\u2019s a mix across the board. Yes, I mean\u2026 Richard Johnson : So sustainably that\u2019s asset sales all in Flexibles, is that right? Michael Casamento : There will be some in rigid. Richard Johnson : And then just finally on next slide, when I think about how you are going to report your numbers under US GAAP, will those asset sales be from [civil] and if they\u2019re not what would they be? Ron Delia : Say that again? Richard Johnson : So could you book those asset sales under US GAAP? Michael Casamento : Look there is a number of differences in US GAAP, I mean we are working our way through that obviously where we are restating history and what I can say is there are puts and takes in the US GAAP differences to IFRS but on a go forward basis we aren\u2019t seeing any material impact to the underlying earnings of the business on a go forward basis from the conversion to US GAAP. Richard Johnson : And then on the rebate number which you\u2019ve partly addressed, can I just confirm that that\u2019s a net number? Does that include the monies you have retained from Alusa or is that a net number? So what's the gross number, what's the gross rebate or gross settlement that you have got from settling these out? Michael Casamento : The net sale component of that is 15.5 million. Richard Johnson : And that includes the amount that you hadn\u2019t paid out in the first place? You previously you said you had retained some funds \u2026 Ron Delia : Yes, net of the Alusa settlement and a number of other things, we are not disclosing the gross because it's confidential matter, just settlement with the private party. Richard Johnson : And then just finally on Rigid Plastics and in North American beverages, can you just give me a feel for the run rate of growth goals that you exited the half please? Ron Delia : Yes. The growth has slowed for sure in the second quarter, we did have growth in the second quarter, but less than we had in the first quarter and that's primarily because the first quarter last year we had -- and this is in North America beverage that I'm referring to. The first quarter last year we had a really pronounced and rapid destocking particularly with one of our major customers. And so the growth rate or the decline rate last year was not indicative of the market and the growth rate this year benefited from cycling that destocking. I think the second quarter was more normalized from inventory perspective on we had modest growth, which I guess you could say is the exit run rate, which is why our outlook for the year hasn\u2019t changed. We expect modest organic volume growth in that business for the year for the remainder of year. Scott Ryall : Thank you. Scott Ryall from Rimor Equity Research. I was hoping to just touch on the sustainability angles as well. Could you -- just in terms of looking at recycle products in 5 to 10 years going forward how do you make sure that having you\u2019re protected from an intellectual property perspective and I know your patents and those sorts of the things but can you just read about the contents in that recycled materially simpler and therefore the various trends that goes down? Ron Delia : Oh yes, that\u2019s \u2026 Scott Ryall : And I guess within that, could you just talk to sort of co-investments that you are making as well? Ron Delia : Yes, so I think it's a really good question. I mean intellectual property is going to be really important here precisely because it's not necessarily simpler, in fact it's actually harder you got to develop the material to do all the things that it does today for the consumer, which is preserve shelf life for a long period of time, provide ease of opening, provide the ability in many cases to cook the product in the package, provide aesthetically pleasing graphics, all of those things that the consumer has come to expect and demand, you need to then provide in a recyclable format which makes the technical challenge quite substantial and more IP intensive I would say. We've announced two products in the last couple of months which are good illustrations of that where we've taken in one case we've got a material called HeatFlex, which takes multi-layers in a traditional laminate down to one based film that provides the same sort of barriers with a similar look and feel. And it allows the product -- it allows for retort packaging so this is where the product is cooked inside the package at very high temperatures, it's quite demanding of the packaging material, and it is quite a bit of technology to get to a single layer material to substitute the qualities that have been previously provided by multiple layers, including foil, including metal. That would be one example we announced another one last week called Genesis, which is in all polyethylene formulation, again to substitute laminates made for multi-materials and both of those products that I mentioned are fully recyclable. So the technology requirement there is quite extensive and while the material mix might be \u201csimpler\u201d the technology in the science in the development of those products is actually quite a bit more intense.  While the co-investments -- look just in the event that we have an opportunity to supply at a very high volume any of these new innovations and a customer particularly benefits from that and like we've done over the years, there's an opportunity to co-invest where it's good for them to help ensure that we get the capacity in place and de-risk the investments for us, and it's a win-win, it's a best way for us to cement the partnership. Scott Ryall : Does that include the [feedstock], as you've mentioned that's one of the cost effective way \u2026? Ron Delia : Yes, there're other -- so the co-investments or potential co-investments I refer to are more in the converting assets, but we are investing and you could say co-investing in recycling partnerships in different parts of the world that our customers are also contributing to, among others. So we have a couple of partnerships in the US for curbside recycling both for rigid plastics but also flexible packaging and Amcor along with a number of others including our customers and governments and NGOs are contributing to some of those partnerships and you could then characterize that as a co-investment as well.  We have a question from Larry Gandler on the line. Larry Gandler : Hi Ron, most of my questions asked but two remaining, one was on that curbside recycling, it sounds like it's a joint venture of some kind. I was wondering if you can talk about the scope of it and put some color behind that. Ron Delia : There's two Larry that we're referring to. One is the recycling partnership, which has been around for four or five years it's primarily rigids focused, it's essentially nonprofit, which brings together Amcor -- not just Amcor but converters, brand owners and alike to fund recycling infrastructure it's focused on some pilot cities in the United States now. The other one is around curbside recycling for flexible packaging and it's a organization -- the acronym is MRFF and basically it's trialing curbside recycling of Flexibles and helping invest in optical sorting at Murph\u2019s to enable the recycling of flexible products through the same recycling streams as other -- as the other recyclables. Larry Gandler : And my other question was on tobacco, it looks like you had sales growth in both USD and Euro exchange-rates, so I was wondering what's driving that, is it some of those new non-tobacco products and specialty cartons that are driving sales? Ron Delia : Yes, so couple of things Larry, it is the mix towards more of the heat not burn products, in some of the regions. Those are the alternative products that Phillip Morris and others have introduced, but also we\u2019ve picked up some business in Asia and our customers performed pretty well in Asia as well as in Eastern Europe. Larry Gandler : And what I meant by non-tobacco, I also meant really maybe non-tobacco like maybe toothpaste or? Ron Delia : Yes there's a little bit of that but that wouldn't have been a material driver of the increase, there's a modest increase from that. Larry Gandler : Thanks. Ron Delia : Okay, thanks Larry. There are a couple of more on the phone here, Owen Birrell from Goldman. Owen Birrell : Thanks Ron, just a quick one on the rigids performance, I noted that you talked to sort of good progress on initiatives and benefits of beverages, but we know that the margin is contracting. And you've only delivered I think somewhere around 5 million in terms of PBIT increase, I'm just wondering where are the trouble spots within that business that are pulling that backwards and what can be done about rectifying those? Ron Delia : Actually we're pretty pleased with the margin performance in that business, the raw materials went up quite substantially which inflates the revenue line and then to the detriment of the percentage margin, the percentage margin gets distorted quite a bit by that sales movement excluding that impact the margins expanded 20 basis points. And when we look at on a per 1,000 basis, which is how we run the business, you see good expansion of the average margin per 1,000. So we\u2019re pretty pleased with where that business is that the mix improved with good hot-fill sales which is more value-added end of the beverage space and then, especially container business continued to grow as well. So we\u2019re pretty happy with that business right. Owen Birrell : And I just noticed that you spend around 40 million on restructuring activity within rigid, in a sense what are your payback period on that investment is and what sort of opportunity we\u2019re seeing in terms investment going forward on the back of that? Ron Delia : Yes. The number that\u2019s in the accounts is the accounting number, the cash that we\u2019re going to invest is about 40 million to 45 million and the return we expect is about 40%, so it\u2019s just a bit over two years of payback and it\u2019s a combination of footprint work and overhead reductions that you'll see start to accelerate in the second half. We had a modest benefit in first half, we will see 5 million to 10 million for the full year as the initiatives pick up in the second half. Owen Birrell : And just a second question for you, Michael on the working capital, very good performance 10% from the 10.4% in the pcp. Over the last decade it\u2019s a bottomed out about 8.3% three years back, I\u2019m just wondering is there any structural reason why kind of get back to those level or what do you say could be optimal level of working capital? Michael Casamento : You are right. We were kind tracking in that 8.5% to 9% range for several years and then we did a couple of sizable acquisition the Alusa acquisition and Sonoco which were running a much higher working capital. So that's why you have seen the increase over the last couple of years. Now we are starting to get on top of that and starting to the working capital come down as we certainly are being pretty focused on it. So you\u2019ve got to expect that we should be able to get back down to 9% over time. That clearly I think takes time right way through and we\u2019re working really hard on that space. Ron Delia : We will go backwards with the Bemis transaction before we go forward as well. So we have two more on the phone, we have Grant Slade from Morningstar. Grant Slade : Just one from me, in Flexible you noted obviously strong growth in Asian volumes, which would I guess then imply that volumes into Europe and Americas were flat the perhaps negative. Just wondered if you could speak to why flexible volume is struggling so much in developed market? Thanks. Ron Delia : Yes, look I think that the developed markets volumes were more or less like flat, we talked about mix earlier. We had really good growth in the healthcare space in North America and Europe. We had good growth in a number the food categories but we also had softness in yogurt and ready meals and some of the other things that I referred to earlier. So I think that our growth mirrors the market, these are particularly in food, healthcare aside, but in food and personal care, you see market growth of 1% or 2% and that's typically what we see, typically we would be picking up share and winning business, but also sharing business at the same time, and so that nets out to low single-digit growth in any given period, there\u2019s nothing really out of the ordinary about the last six months.  Okay we have more from Keith Chau, Evans and Partners. Keith Chau : Good afternoon Ron, I just want to circle back on the question around input cost. I think last June, I think the headwind last year was $43 million in FY '18 and in the first half of '19 of $5 million. So theoretically speaking even if input costs elevated Amcor should be able to cover the entire loss. Now the expectation going in the second half is only $5 million reversal. So maybe just a couple of questions. One is, does Amcor still expect to recover the entire $48 million headwind? And secondly, if that is the case what is the timing? Looking at some of the input costs and where that tracks over the past call it three to four months, thought that the tailwind should actually be greater than the headwind that was incurred in FY'18 and 1H '19? Ron Delia : Yes. It\u2019s a good question, I mean the short answer is we will get all the $48 million back. Our guidance assumes that $5 million comes back in the second half. It is entirely dependent on the slope of the input costs and the price changes in the commodities and the inventory movements through our supply chain. If we look back six months we saw raw materials relatively flat for the first four months of this year. We saw polymer-based raw materials decline in November and December. And what we see going forward is a mixed bag. We see generally resin indices up between 3%, 4%, 5% across our portfolio and that's driven by a number of things including a number of planned and announced outages in the polyethylene space. So it\u2019s difficult to forecast, but the starting point is that the business passes through all of the changes up and down. So we will get the remainder of the $48 million back beyond the second half if we don't get release from the commodity industries. Keith Chau : And then Ron may be if I -- the outlook for cost is up mid single-digits I'm assuming that\u2019s on quite a low base that is after what is being quite a steep decline in the key costs including resin and aluminum. Is that correct? Ron Delia : Sorry steep -- I didn\u2019t hear the -- after you said steep what was the question? Keith Chau : Yes, so what I'm assuming is that when you are talking about a mid single-digits increase in input cost, is that off the troughs levels of your input costs given how you steep the fall was being for both aluminum and resin? Ron Delia : Yes, off of current -- from the current point in time forward we look forward across the different published indices. You see mid single-digit increases from the end of first half. Ron Delia : I think if there are no further questions, we will close the call. Thank you.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Josh and I will be conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Amcor Full-Year 2019 Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you, Tracey Whitehead, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, please go ahead. Tracey Whitehead : Thanks Josh and welcome to Amcor\u2019s 2019 year-end earnings call. This is our first call as a newly listed company following the Bemis transaction. So good evening to those of you in the U.S. and good morning to those in Australia. Joining me today in Australia is Ron Delia, Chief Executive Officer and Michael Casamento, Chief Financial Officer. At this time, I'll direct you to our website amcor.com under the investor section where you'll find our press release and presentation, which will be discussed on this call. We've also discussed non-GAAP financial measures as we talk about performance. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures that we consider most comparable can be found in the press release and presentation on our website. I would also remind you that statements regarding future performance of the company made during this call are forward-looking and therefore subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from historical expected or predicted results due to a variety of factors. Please refer to Amcor\u2019s SEC filings including a statement on Form S-4 to review these factors. With that, I'll hand over to Ron. Ron Delia : Thanks, Tracey and good morning and good evening. We've got a lot to cover here today. So we'll get right into it. And we'll start where we always start with meetings in Amcor which is with safety. And refer to the slides as we go through here, we've got slide set on the webcast, and I'm referring to slide 3 here. Safety is a core value at Amcor and we have one goal which is no injuries. And we're not there yet. But our safety performance over the last 12 months has been a real highlight, with reductions in lost-time injuries and recordable injuries of 29% and 25% respectively. And this is a great outcome. And it's a testament to our leadership teams and all of our employees around the world who\u2019re able to stay focused on what matters most, when there was a potential for lots of distractions during a very busy year. Again, the only thing that matters to us is getting to zero injuries. But just a quick word on these metrics, when we acquire businesses, they typically have a higher number of injuries than we're used to at Amcor and as a result, these metrics end-up increasing for a period of time and that happened a couple of years ago. And you'll see that happen again during fiscal 2020 when we include the legacy Bemis in these numbers. But that said, our new colleagues are just as focused on safety. And pretty soon, we'll see fewer total injuries again as we march towards our goal of no injuries. Moving to the four key messages we have for today, first 2019 from a number of different dimensions was a historic year for Amcor. We completed the Bemis acquisition. We added a listing on the New York Stock Exchange and we continue to progress our sustainability agenda. At the same time, the base business has been performing well and that's the second key message. The Legacy Amcor business delivered results in line with expectations and momentum is building as we head into the 2020 financial year. Third, when we look out into fiscal 2020, and the next couple of years beyond, we have visibility to multiple sources of EPS growth. Our base business is defensive and will continue to grow organically. There are $180 million of synergies from the Bemis acquisition and that integration is off to a good start. And then because our balance sheet and cash flow outlook are strong, we have the confidence to redeploy divestment proceeds and a $500 million share buyback. So as uncertainty and macroeconomic risk around the world seem to increase by the day, we have a clear path forward for the next few years to create value for shareholders. And lastly, and the fourth key message today, we're extremely excited at Amcor because we're uniquely positioned for the long-term. We've got leadership positions in each of our businesses, differentiated capabilities, scale and global reach that we can put together to generate growth into the future and a big part of that future will be Amcor\u2019s continued leadership on sustainability. And today, we've announced at least $50 million of additional investments to accelerate that sustainability agenda. Now before turning to the financial results for the year, just a word on the numbers that you'll see in the materials we released today. So the basis for all the financial information, I'll remind you, again is U.S. GAAP. But we'll focus on adjusted or non-GAAP metrics, which we believe is the best way to understand the operating performance of the business. And then later when we describe our guidance for FY 2020, we\u2019ll refer to a pro forma set of financials, so we can compare apples-to-apples as if we own Bemis for all of FY 2019. So moving on to slide 6, full-year adjusted financials, sales are up 5.5% in constant currency terms, or 3.2% if you exclude the added sales from the Bemis business. EBIT was up 5.7%, again in constant currency, with both the Flexibles and Rigid Packaging segments contributing to organic sales growth, strong cost performance, benefits from acquisitions that we completed earlier, and restructuring benefits. We continued our track record of consistent margin expansion with EBIT margins up 10 basis points, or 20 basis points up when excluding the sales impact of the higher raw materials we passed through in the rigid packaging business and net income was up 9% in constant currency terms. And excluding the Bemis earnings, the Legacy Amcor business delivered solid growth of 7%, which was in line with our expectations. Cash flow was strong more than $200 million for the legacy Amcor business and the balance sheet is also strong, so we increased the annual dividend to $0.455 per share and in addition, as I mentioned, we did use to initiate a $500 million share buyback today to further enhance shareholder returns. In the Flexibles segment, sales grew by 5.4% in constant currency terms or 2.1%, excluding sales from legacy Bemis with good growth in global healthcare and across emerging markets. EBIT grew by 6.7% in constant currency and margins expanded by 10 basis points. In addition to sales growth, organic profit growth also benefited from strong cost performance, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region and within the specialty carton plants. In the European region, overall operating costs were higher as a result of higher than expected demand in our healthcare plans. Also driving profit were the final benefits from restructuring initiatives which we started in 2016, and a small benefit from the normal time lag in recovering higher raw material costs, which was a little better than we\u2019re expecting six months ago. And lastly, we had profit growth from businesses we acquired in prior periods which was in line with our expectations. Now as we highlighted in our news release in the June quarter, the legacy Bemis business demonstrated similar financial performance to the previous three quarters, with the exception of the business in Latin America, which delivered a marginal loss in the June quarter. Turning to Rigid Packaging on slide 8, sales grew 5.4% and constant currency terms again includes the 3.7% favorable impact from passing through higher raw materials, and EBIT grew 4.8% given by a combination of higher volumes and favorable product mix, and benefits from restructuring initiatives. In North America, total beverage volumes were up 1% and hot fill container volumes are up 7%. So overall sales growth within the regional beverage unit, which focuses on smaller customers and brands continues to track at double-digit rates. Acquisition benefits in specialty containers were offset by disappointing cost performance in two class and the closures business was negatively impacted by startup costs at the recently commissioned plant in Mexico. Latin America volumes are up 3% versus last year excluding Argentina volumes are up 10% reflecting strong growth in Colombia, Mexico and Brazil. Returns were almost 17% in Rigid Plastics and overall we were pleased with the performance this year, and we believe the business is well positioned for the future. With that, I'll hand over to Michael to talk about the cash flow and balance sheet. Michael Casamento : Thanks, Ron. I\u2019m on Slide 9 now and in terms of cash flow, one of the highlights for the year was our working capital performance. The legacy Amcor business reduced the working capital sales ratio from 10.6% last year to 9% this year with improvements in a range of areas including payables and receivables days which in turn reduce our average debt levels during the year and net interest expense in the P&L. We expect the working capital sales ratio will increase following the acquisition of the Bemis business but will then become a source of cash as we work the ratio back down over time. Capital expenditure was also lower than last year, we would typically expect capital expenditure to track in line with depreciation. And this year our spend was little lower as we focused on the integration activities. Capital expenditure is also likely to be slightly lower than depreciation mid-2020 financial year as we work through the integration. Adjusting for Bemis related transaction costs and an expert pro rata dividend paid in May, cash flow after dividends was $193 million or $207 million for the legacy Amcor business only which was in line with our guidance range for the year. Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 10. As Ron mentioned earlier, Amcor\u2019s balance sheet and financial profile remain strong. Net debt of USD 5.5 billion at the 30th of June has increased compared to last year mainly driven by the addition of the Bemis debt facilities. Leverage measured as net debt over combined EBITDA was 2.7 times after adjusting for the impact of the divested businesses. In the last several months, our Treasury team has successfully refinanced and restructured a significant amount of debt that was carried by both legacy businesses. We continue to be in a very comfortable position in relation to our debt profile, with access to a diverse range of funding sources, and appropriate combination of fixed and floating debt and with a well balanced mix of currencies, and no significant maturities in the next 12 months, demand for Amcor credit has been strong, and the outcome will benefit net interest costs in future periods. We expect the net finance costs will be within a range of $230 million to $250 million in our 2020 financial year, which is approximately $20 million lower than the combined net finance costs for 2019. So in summary, Amcor continues to generate strong cash flow, and has balance sheet capacity to fund the buyback announced today, while retaining the ability to invest in growth and maintain investment grade credit metrics moving forward. So with that, I'll hand back to Ron. Ron Delia : Thanks Michael. I will just take a few minutes here to talk about the longer term growth potential that we see for the company. And if I refer to Slide 12, any discussion on growth for the future needs to start with corporate strategy. And the message here on Slide 12 is that nothing has changed. I won't walk through this slide, again today it's been out there for a while. And that's really the point that the strategy has not changed at all. Our approach to capital allocation and deploying our cash flow has also not changed, that's on Slide 13. This is essentially our capital allocation framework. And it provides some perspective on how we think about allocating cash for the benefit of shareholders over the long-term. The numbers have increased a bit given when our bigger company but otherwise there's not been any changes this framework today nor has been for many years now. Through paying dividends and growing the base business organically in a defensive set of end markets, pursuing acquisitions or returning cash to shareholders. Over time value creation has been strong and consistent. And a big source of that value creation in the near-term is of course the Bemis acquisition, turning to Slide 14 just for a quick recap on the strategic rationale. The combined company is the only player now in Flexible packaging with a comprehensive global footprint and in addition to being truly global, we also have a scale and resource advantage in each key region around the world. Our customer and product portfolio now benefits from increased exposure to attract event market and product segments. And these differentiated solutions can now be transferred across regions and leveraged across that global footprint. And we\u2019ve merged the capabilities and talent from both companies to create the industry's best team who are focused on delivering for our customers around the world. So we believe and continue to believe the strategic rationale, it's highly compelling. And we also see the potential to generate significant value for shareholders as a result. The starting point for the shareholder value that will be created with the Bemis acquisition is the cost synergy opportunity, which is recapped on Slide 15 here. And firstly, I would say we're pleased with how the integration has started. We've had the fast start that we planned for, and we can confidently reconfirm our expectations for the synergies this year, as well as the phasing of those synergy benefits over the next three years. In terms of procurement, we're taking a coordinated regional and global approach and quick wins are being actioned across both direct and indirect spend categories. G&A synergies are largely associated with reductions in headcount. And we wanted to start that exercise quickly so we can put it behind us and get people focused on moving the company forward to date, head count as been reduced by several hundred people and that number will increase further. And as it relates to footprint, those projects tend to take a little longer. So generally, the financial impact will be more towards years, two and three. But we've already gotten moving on that as well. And we've announced the closure of three sites so far with some others to follow shortly. So we feel really good about where the teams are in terms of the integration and the business, and the position of the business that we acquired. As you'll be aware, we were required to divest some plants in order to secure antitrust approval for the overall Bemis acquisition. And those divestments are now complete. And since Amcor is in a strong financial position, we\u2019re able to fully redeploy the proceeds from those divestments to create value for shareholders now, but also into the future. Slide 16 outlines how we\u2019re redeploying those proceeds, first, in terms of the $500 million share buyback that we've mentioned, when that's completed, we will reduce the number of shares outstanding by around 3%, enhancing future EPS for the remaining shareholders. We intend to start repurchasing shares in the coming weeks. And we will repurchase shares on both the New York Stock Exchange and the ASX in the same proportion as the number of shares, currently on issue on each exchange. And then secondly, looking more towards the future. We've also committed to make incremental investments of at least $50 million in strategic projects to accelerate our sustainability agenda. In fact, moving to Slide 17, one of the most important organic growth opportunities for Amcor comes from the increasing consumer demand for more sustainable or environmentally friendly packaging. And we see this as an opportunity because we start from the premise that there will always be a role for primary consumer packaging for food and healthcare products. That primary packaging, the packaging that touches and holds the product is what Amcor does today. And our packaging helps protect food and medicine, preserves and extend shelf life and helps brand owners promote and differentiate their products. And over the years, consumers have come to expect packaging that works first of all and is also lightweight and convenient, easy to use, cost effective, and great looking. Now all of us have an additional expectation. And that is for the packaging to have a responsible end-of-life solution that doesn't result in more waste, or doesn't end up in landfill or doesn't end up in erosion. So we believe the way to address those growing requirements, particularly around waste is through responsible packaging, and Amcor is uniquely positioned to lead the way and be part of the solution. As the industry leader, we have the scale and resources to innovate and develop new products, we\u2019re seen as the partner of choice for collaborating with customers and other stakeholders. And we have the technical expertise to help inform the debate and educate consumers particularly around topics like recycling. This is an exciting time in our sustainability journey and looking at Slide 18, it's been a really busy year and 2018 quickly to recap, we became the first global packaging company, pledging to develop all of our packaging to be recyclable or reusable by 2025, to significantly increase our use of recycled materials and to work with others to drive greater recycling of packaging. In 2019, we signed The New Plastics Economy Global Commitment, we established a sustainability Center of Excellence in Europe, introduced several new products with more sustainable properties and used more recycled content in our products in both Rigid Packaging and Flexible packaging. And then of course, we took a significant step forward by bringing together the two R&D leaders in our industry which extends our capabilities and reach globally. Just turning for a minute to product development. Our approach includes a broad range of alternatives. In terms of our raw materials, we're using increasing amounts of recycled content and in our Rigid Packaging business, PCR content post consumer recycled content is approaching 10% and more and more products, including beverage containers are reaching 100% recycled content. In Flexibles, we've made good progress as well, and we're testing films with up to 50% recycled material. In addition, we've commercialized products, which use bio-based plastics derived from renewable sources. And each year, our products use less and less material in the first place. In Amcor\u2019s success in light weighting has been a strong point of differentiation for a long time and this year alone, our light weighting efforts have reduced the amount of virgin resin we've used by 37 million pounds. Add to that our total use of recycled resin and our consumption of virgin material has reduced by more than 5%. And then as far as reducing waste, we're making good progress as well. We now have a broader range of recycled products and commercialization trials are underway with more than 20 customers. We're evaluating a variety of compostable materials which we've had in the market for some time, and our sales of reusable and refillable PET containers in markets where refill programs exist have doubled in the last two years. By 2025, our pledge commitments will have been met. And we will have done our part to ensure consumers and the environment benefit from responsible sustainable packaging and that Amcor is continuing to grow and thrive. Before wrapping up, let me summarize on Page 19 here our outlook for the 2020 financial year and what you can expect from Amcor in what will be a transition year as we integrate the Bemis business and move to U.S. GAAP. In terms of our outlook for fiscal 2020, we\u2019re guiding to an adjusted EPS growth range of 5% to 10% in constant currency terms. Using 2019 financial year average exchange rates, this implies a range of $0.61 to $0.64 per share. This is inclusive of $65 million of pre-tax synergy benefits, it takes into account a marginal decline in the average shares outstanding through the buyback. Integration and transaction costs related to the Bemis acquisition and other items impacting comparability are excluded from our adjusted EPS guidance assumptions. We expect cash flow after dividends to be in a range of $200 million to $300 million. And this is after deducting cash integration costs of approximately $100 million. Consistent with most companies in our industry, we intend to provide annual EPS and cash flow guidance each year. But we recognize that during a transition year like this one, additional metrics may be helpful. So we've provided those on the slides. You'll note that our guidance is related to the full-year and not by quarter. This is aligned with how we run the business and as we progress through the year, our discussion and narrative will focus on the year-to-date performance as much as possible. Of course there will be investor communications each quarter and consistent with past practice we\u2019ll provide a comprehensive management briefing each half year. Finally, moving to the last slide. In summary, FY 2019 was a transformative year for Amcor, the underlying business performed well delivering solid earnings growth and building momentum across multiple areas as we enter fiscal 2020, capitalizing on the value of potential that comes with the Bemis acquisition is one of our top priorities, and the integration is going well. And we're delivering incremental synergy benefits every day. At a time, when there's arguably a higher degree of uncertainty in the world, this gives us clear visibility to near-term earnings growth, and we've enhanced the value delivered to shareholders today by increasing our dividend and announcing a $500 million share buyback. We feel good about that. But we're even more excited about the opportunities we have to use our differentiated positions, to drive long-term growth and maximize shareholder value. That concludes our opening remarks and we would be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Salvator Tiano with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Salvator Tiano : Hi guys. Hi, Ron, Michael, hi and congratulations on closing the acquisition. So firstly, just like to touch basically little bit on the cash synergies I think you have floated out the number if I remember correctly $300 million in CapEx and working capital synergies and I'd like to check first of all, if this is on track and kind of what does this mean for working capital and CapEx for fiscal 2020? Ron Delia : I\u2019ll let Michael speak to 2020 but the short answer on the first question is absolutely on track. We had a great year in working capital performance last year at Amcor and we expect to apply the same disciplines and degree of focus to the Bemis business. And we know going through an integration like this, there'll be less capital that gets spent in the ordinary course. And so we'll see those benefits as well. But Michael, maybe you can just speak to the 2020 aspect of the question. Michael Casamento : Yes, sure. I think, as you saw our working capital for the Amcor legacy business improved significantly in 2019, but obviously will see an increase there because the Bemis, the Bemis business kind of tracks around at 12.5% to 13% working capital sales. So that's an opportunity for us, but clearly, that takes some time to get down and we expect to see some benefit over the next couple of years. So bringing that down over time. And then on CapEx front as Ron said, I think typically, we'd be around that in line with depreciation this year, I'd expect we're probably going to be slightly behind that. So this is again, there'll be some benefiting the cash flow as a result of multiplying that level. Salvator Tiano : Great. And just a different question here obviously, in your rigid packaging PET bottles, you had very good year especially for the hot fill containers, but we have been hearing and I'm sure you have as well by a lot of the beverage can companies, how they\u2019re gaining market share, how there's a lot of substitution and people are shifting and companies to beverage cans away from plastics, obviously, and you do have a slide about your very limited exposure to water bottles, but as we think about your broader exposure, including carbonated soft drinks and juices, energy drinks, what is kind of the volume outlook right now, can you sustain this growth in the hot fill business or perhaps the growth will be creamed, is there any  chance that you actually can see this business contract in the next few years gradually? Or are you confident that these growth rates can be sustained? Thank you very much. Ron Delia : Yes, it's a really good question. Look, the short answer is we feel really good about this business and how it's positioned for the long-term. If we stand back, the business is participating across all of the liquid refreshment beverage categories in North America and in Latin America as well. And it also is supplying containers into food and personal care and pharmaceuticals, so it's broadly exposed, it gets more and more diversified with each year. Within beverages, there's no question we've seen some slow down in the water market. But again, as you pointed out, only about 2% of our margin comes from water in the rigid plastics segment. So it's really not a -- it's just not an important segment for us now or nor will be in the future. Beyond that, we continue to see 2% growth, at least across all of the other categories in beverage, in plastic and yes, there's obviously a role for alternative substrates in different sub-segments, sparkling water is one where there's been a good growth in cans but also been exceptional growth in plastic and sparkling water. I think that's more of a consumer shift to that product format than a packaging issue. But going forward, we continue to see growth that looks like the growth we've seen historically in the segments we're playing in, which has generally been around 2% for a number of years. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Scott with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Andrew Scott : Good morning or good evening, guys. Thanks. Just one from me, Ron, I just wondered if you could talk about the guidance for the corporate line there. I think $130 million was the base were coming off. I would expect that that's probably one area where you might have had synergy opportunities as you collapse sort of two head offices into one, so interested in the growth for that to actually the outlook for that to actually growing year-on-year? Michael Casamento : Andrew, it's Michael here, probably just to give you a bit of flavor there, as you said, the starting point is kind of $135 million and we're expecting kind of $20 million, $25 million to $30 million increase there. Part of that is to do, this year, we had quite low insurance claims. So at this stage we're guiding to a more normalized view on that front. And in addition to that, we're also looking to take the opportunity here, we think it's a great opportunity to double down invest, put some investment into our commercial, further commercial capabilities around Value Plus and Procure Plus and the like, and really take advantage of some of that across the whole of our business. So that's why you're seeing some increase there in the corporate costs. Andrew Scott : And, Michael, would you think that that's the sort of level that we should be looking at to the next few years? Michael Casamento : Yes, look, I think that's a reasonable place to sit in. Andrew Scott : Okay, thank you. Ron Delia : To be clear Andrew on the synergy aspect to your question there, absolutely our synergies in corporate. But as we've said all along, we're not going to be looking for synergies in the commercial part of the company, which is sales and research and development, certainly in the first instance. And so we want to double down there and make sure, we capture the marketplace benefits of this deal as well. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Brian Maguire : Hey, good morning. Good afternoon, guys and congrats again on getting the deal through. Just a couple questions on the guidance. Just wanted to clarify a couple of things, just the EPS guide, I appreciate the $0.61 to $0.64, I can set in assuming constant currency. So the fiscal year 2019 average currency rates just wondered if you could give a little bit of color on what impact, current FX rates might have on that $0.61 to $0.64? Michael Casamento : Brian, you have to do the math. I think about half of the currency in fact is related to the Euro. The other half is a really broad mix of currencies across probably 15 or so that would each be about 2% or 3% of the impact. I think last year, the impact is pretty clear in terms of, Brian what does it Slide 30 in the backup might be the best guide to look at. Brian Maguire : Okay, let's take a look at that. And maybe on the cash flow guidance, I guess $200 million to $300 million after dividends, so I\u2019m wondering if you could provide some components within that, just wondering what you're assuming for working capital of its meaningful source of cash and do you include the proceeds from divestments of $395 million-ish or cash in the healthcare sales. And I couldn't tell if you give a CapEx number other than just saying it was going to be a little bit less than D&A. But if there's a specific CapEx number, you're thinking about, would appreciate that? Michael Casamento : Yes, look I will take that one. The range we put out there is $200 million to $300 million. And that is after cash integration costs of around $100 million. So we don't typically break down the components within that. But as I said the guide from guidance earlier around CapEx is typically around depreciation, you expect it. So going to be slightly lower than that, this coming year, in terms of working capital, as we said we see opportunity, particularly as the Bemis business comes into Amcor, so we'd expect to see some working capital improvement, although that does take time to flow through. So I think and in terms of your question around divestment, that's not included in the cash flow number as part of that. Ron Delia : So you can think about it as $300 million to $400 million before the integration costs, which is a step up from where Amcor has been historically. Operator : Your next question comes from John Purtell with Macquarie. Your line is open. John Purtell : Good morning, guys. How are you? Ron Delia : Hey, John. John Purtell : Just had a couple of questions. Just in terms of the guidance, just wanted to confirm that the guidance assumes some base business growth there. And what you see is the key drivers of that? Ron Delia : Yes, absolutely, absolutely. Their base businesses is going well, as we said, FY 2019 we finished with some good momentum and had a good second half. So we absolutely expect it to grow into FY 2020. On top of which then we have $65 million of pre-tax synergies. So it's really coming from both, in terms of the organic growth in the business, it's the things that you would expect, we expect a modest level of top line growth in the business, more in emerging markets, which we're seeing less though in developed markets. We expect continued margin improvement as we evolve the mix. Generally each year, we've got some legacy, or let's say prior period acquisitions, which will add benefits in 2020 and some restructuring benefits in their Rigid Plastic segment, which will add value as well. So we have multiple levers with which to generate growth on the base and then the $65 million, again on EBIT synergies through the Bemis acquisition although that\u2019s in the guide. John Purtell : Thank you. Just the second question. And you touched on some elements of it earlier Ron, but just as far as some of the new product initiatives, supposed particularly in Flexibles, you've introduced this Amcor product and Bemis obviously has been pretty excited about their Amcor products. So just what you see is the opportunities there and how that\u2019s changing things. Ron Delia : Look, John, that is really exciting. I mean, the level of interest among customers for these products is just unprecedented. The  nature of the dialog with the customers in terms of the breadth with which we're engaging, and across those organizations, and the importance that they're placing on getting some of these materials, tested and in trials has been great. Now, we also have come to learn over the years that nothing moves quickly in this space with regards to new product development, shelf life, in most of the food categories, shelf life testing can be six to 12 months, just before you even can think about commercializing. So these things take time but the leading indicators are positive and the leading indicators we're looking at is the customer inquiries, I should say, the trials and testing that are being done and just the general level of interest which is quite high. So look, what we would say that those products and in particular, and others will generate top line growth, two to three years from now, but there's no time like the present to start process. John Purtell : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Larry Gandler with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Larry Gandler : Thanks, Ron, thanks, Mike. Question on Rigids if I can. Looking at the volume performance in the mix, very good considering what some of the data we\u2019re showing. But it doesn't seem like the EBIT growth sort of reflects much operating leverage. So I'm just wondering if there's any impedance to that, you also had cost savings coming through, so maybe it should magnify the EBIT growth? Ron Delia : Well, look, Larry. I think first of all in the volumes, there is mixed data out there. Our business is more geared towards the segments that continue to grow as we touched on earlier, we're pretty pleased with the performance, we had 5% growth in constant currency terms. And if you look across the portfolio, we had basically flat volumes in beverage across the board with positive mix, good growth in Latin America. But then Argentina was a bit of a drag overall. So 3% growth in total. So you got 1% and 3% in two big businesses, leverage to beverage converting to profit. And then in our Specialty Containers business, we flag we had two plants that really didn't perform well for brief periods of time throughout the year and we lost some money on the table there. So generally speaking, we're pleased with the year 5% constant currency growth with relatively low overall volumes and a couple of plants that didn't help us out for a couple of periods there, a couple of months, I think, we're pretty happy with the results overall. Larry Gandler : And with the Specialty products, plants, remind me which ones they were again, or what was the issue? Ron Delia : There are two legacy plants we've had for a very long period of time that have been good earners for us and just had some operational issues and I won't get into the details, it happens we've got 150 plants and every once in a while a couple of them aren\u2019t going so well. Larry Gandler : Yes, now understood. All right. And on the sustainability investment moving topics is the $50 million all CapEx or will some of that be OpEx? Ron Delia : No, this would be mostly capital and the like. So, specifically, I'm glad you asked, because we can put a little more color to that investment that we flagged today. Look, it'll be in a few areas. We know we can add some R&D infrastructure around the world. We've got a world-class facility in Rigid Packaging, we got a world-class facility now in Wisconsin that comes from Bemis in Flexibles. We don't necessarily have the same level of infrastructure in Asia and in Europe. And so that's an area where we'll spend some money. To be some capital equipment, that will be helpful for us as we process more recycled content and as we roll out some of the new products like AmLite, HeatFlex and Shetron referred to earlier. And, we also know we don't have all the best ideas in the world. So open innovation, corporate venturing are things that we're doing more and more of. And then lastly, we're pretty active in terms of our partnership network, you would know about the recycling partnership in the U.S. and some others, and so we\u2019ll allocate a little bit more to those initiatives as well. So it's really those three or four areas, most of that is essentially capital, I guess you could say. Larry Gandler : Okay, and Ron can I just ask one more last question on Rigids. That's interesting, and I definitely want to explore that later with you but with Rigids, I noticed that Pepsi probably has a greater reliance on plastic containers than Coke in terms of overall beverage. I don't know if that's an observation you've made, it looks quite stark. I'm just wondering if that's your observation as well and whether that can change over time? Ron Delia : Larry I got to admit, I'm not sure that I made that observation that that Coke is in the cold fill space operates through a different business model. They have Co-Op network that supplies most of their cold fill products. So there's less visibility generally, I would say in the market to that side, I would have thought it was very comparable. I know that our dialog with all the customers in the beverage space is quite similar in terms of their drive to smaller portions and smaller pack size in Rigid Plastics, as a primary source of growth for their various products. So I really wouldn't comment beyond that. I'm not sure I could really say with much conviction. Larry Gandler : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Owen Birrell, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Owen Birrell : Hi, Ron, Michael. Thanks for giving us the opportunity to ask a couple of questions on this. Just wanted to delve into your pledge to be 100% of your products being recyclable, reusable by 2025. Just firstly, do you include compostable products within that pledge? And secondly, what percentage of your products are currently recyclable or reusable today? Ron Delia : Yes, good question. Look compostable products are part of our mix in Flexibles, it's a very small percentage. We have a couple of products that we've or a couple of structures I should say under brand name called Nature Plus, Plus in Europe, that have been around for a while. We have some hesitation around that because compostable doesn't necessarily mean recyclable. In fact, quite often, consumers get confused in compostable or biodegradable structures, in some cases actually can lead to more waste and can also corrupt or pollute the recycling stream. So those products are not necessarily recyclable, but they are compostable in the right environment. In terms of the other part of the question about where we're at today, look I think it's clear on Rigid Plastics, 97% plus of our products are recyclable, in Flexibles, it's difficult to give you a number because technically speaking, a good deal of our product mix is recyclable. But that's the technical answer, and you need to have access to the right infrastructure. And so our role will be first and foremost, to make sure that all our products are technically recyclable. And we make good progress on that front every year, including some of the new developments that I referenced earlier. We also have a role to play in ensuring the infrastructure is in place to be able to actually recycle the products after they're used. And there's work to do there and that's not Amcor\u2019s job alone, but we certainly have a part to play. So look, it's hard to give a specific number on Flexibles other than to say that the product development that I highlighted earlier and that we're heavily engaged with our customers on is getting us to a higher and higher level of technically recyclable products. And then we also have to help just the broader landscape to make sure the infrastructure is in place to actually be able to recycle. Owen Birrell : Maybe I'll ask the question a different way. Which of your products do you think face the greatest challenges? I mean, are there particular products that actually just don't have a solution at the moment? Whether it's barrier films or certain patches and so forth? Ron Delia : I don't think as we look across our mix, there's anything that we see that is insurmountable. It's just a question of time and development, there will be a solution for pretty much everything we make. It'll just take some product development and some time. So I would say the short answer is no, there's nothing that we see is an imminent issue that can't be solved. Owen Birrell : Is five years enough time? Ron Delia : Absolutely. For the technical part it is, whether society and the markets around the world have the recycling infrastructure in place in five years. That's a bigger question. I'm not sure, we have an answer to that one. But we will have done our part by 2025. Owen Birrell : All right, excellent. Operator : Your next question comes from Daniel Kang with Citigroup. Your line is open. Daniel Kang : Good morning, everyone. Just a couple of questions from me on the raw materials. Ron, can you just talk about your outlook for raw materials? Is it becoming a headwind? In the past few reporting releases you did call out resin headwinds. I think it totaled over $15 million. Have you recovered all of that at this point? Is it more to come into FY 2020? And the second point I just wanted to second question on the strategic $15 million investments. I just wanted to confirm whether that was over and above the group's R&D spend of $100 million, I think combined for the company? Ron Delia : Look the second question is a shorter is your answer that that is that $50 million is above and beyond what we spend each year. But as I think I responded to another question earlier, that's essentially going to be capital that gets spent over the next couple of years. So it's not operating expense. It'll be more investments and CapEx. In terms of raw materials, look I think as we highlighted, we had a modest benefit this year of about $5 million, if we went back six months ago, we had a modest headwind. And then we clawed that back in the second half a little bit, and then some. And yes, I'd say the short answer is we're out there recovering, you can see this sales line is reflecting the fact that prices have gone up to recover raw material increases. The outlook from here is mixed, we see which is typically what we say it's almost, it's highly unusual that we see all the materials around the world moving up in the same direction at the same time, we've only seen that a couple of times in the last decade. Right now what we see is a mixed picture. Even within regions, you see some commodities going up and others going down. And so that says to us that it's not likely to be a material driver of our profit movement from FY 2019 into FY 2020. Daniel Kang : Okay, thanks. Ron Delia : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Brian Maguire : Hi, thanks for taking my follow-on question. Jus the legacy Bemis business seemed like it was a little bit weaker there in the quarter, I think you caught out some issues in Latin America. I just wondered if you could expand a little bit more on how it performed not so much just the three weeks that you owned, but just the quarter overall and then just as you look at that business in fiscal 2020 outside of the synergy capture, what sort of the outlook for growth in that business? Ron Delia : Yes, look I think what I would say is that the Bemis business has performed well, it's been tracking as it had through 2018 and or through the first three quarters of the equivalent financial year for Amcor. And the fourth quarter in Amcor financial calendar or second quarter of the calendar year, the business in North America and the overseas businesses and the healthcare business perform well. So they I would say that the businesses is doing well, and it's got good momentum. And it continues to progress period over period. Latin American business didn't have a good quarter, as we call that made a marginal loss, I think it's just look at, they were lot week volumes, and no cost flexing, and all of which is fixable over time. But it's a complicated portfolio. And it probably needs to be streamlined a bit. So we're on that already. The business made money in July. It'll get back on track over time, but it did not have a good fourth quarter, beyond Latin America, the rest of the legacy Bemis perimeter performed very well. Brian Maguire : Okay, and then just last one from me, just back to the sustainability conversation. I appreciate all the efforts you guys are making around recyclability. I guess as you like, think about consumer preferences and the whole debate, how much do you think is solvable through science and how much of it do you think requires really just re-educating the consumer and changing, winning over hearts and minds when it comes to people's perceptions about plastic? And is there anything you can kind of do from a marketing approach, or through your partners on a marketing approach to really change the sort of consumer perception around plastic? Ron Delia : Yes, look it's a good question. I mean, first of all, I think on the product side, as I answered earlier, I think that the science will allow us to come up with solutions for all the products that we make, so that they\u2019re recyclable, or compostable or reusable. That's, our part. And we can manage that. And we will over the next few years. So that part, I think is more straightforward. I think then with the education is required, it's just on the recycling end, which is where most of these products rightly should end up from an end-of-life perspective. I think there'll be a role for reusable and there'll be a role for compostable. But it's unlikely that there'll be lots of industrial composting centers built for that people will install residential composting equipment at a large scale. So I think ultimately, the answer here is largely going to be through recycling and there is some educating the consumer that's required. I mean, we have even in the U.S., only 30% of PET containers recycled at the moment. It's highly recyclable. It's a product that you can, you can reuse, for all practical purposes indefinitely, and yet the consumer doesn't recycle. So there's a bit of educating to be done. There's also a bit of infrastructure development required, which we have a role in. But not Amcor alone, we need to work with others on that part. As far as the perception goes, we continue to see growth in all of our segments in plastic. We continue to see new product introductions, we continue to see new upstart brands, look to plastic packaging. So there doesn't seem to be other than the headlines around certain categories like water doesn't seem to be any shift that\u2019s substantive in terms of where these products or how these products should be packaged. And you have to bear in mind that consumer has a broad suite of needs. They want products that are convenient, that are functional, that are lighter weight. And most of that gets delivered most efficiently through some sort of a plastic format. That's why the industry has evolved towards plastics over the last several decades. So the answer now is to just do that in a way that is responsible, and that doesn't contribute to waste. And we think, we have a big role to play in making that happen. Brian Maguire : Okay, thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Nathan Reilly with UBS. Your line is open. Nathan Reilly : Good morning, or good afternoon. Just a quick question on the Bemis integration and the process around that. I imagine the bulk of the efforts are currently being directed at driving the cost synergies and keeping the focus on customer service levels. But I'm just curious to understand at what point did those efforts start to shift the driving some of the revenue synergies that are potentially there and leveraging a broader flexibles technology offering globally? Ron Delia : It's a great question. Look, you're absolutely right, the effort now is on largely focused on bringing out the cost synergies, those tend to be more discrete projects. So you have a factory to close or you have procurement efforts to run and then it's behind you and the synergies are bank. So that's where most of the effort is. But I would tell you, in parallel, the commercial organization is always thinking about growth. And now they have a few more tools to deploy, as they think about how to do that. So I would say it would be understanding the effort commercially to give the impression that the thinking in that area hasn't started yet. But I will tell you, as I also said few minutes ago, the ability to generate growth in these businesses takes time, particularly if it's technology oriented or based off new product development, it typically will take a couple of years before you can begin a conversation and actually see products on the shelf. And so no time like the present. And the teams are starting to get on it. Nathan Reilly : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Brook Campbell-Crawford with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Brook Campbell-Crawford: Yes, thanks for that. I just had a question on working capital. And what was the ending working capital balance for the legacy Amcor business? Ron Delia : Yes, look Brook we\u2019re going to have to follow-up with you on that. I mean, we've closed the books on the combined basis, as you can imagine, so we have to untangle what was legacy Bemis and what was legacy Amcor particularly from a balance sheet perspective. So we might have big follow-up with you on that one. Brook Campbell-Crawford: That's fine, I guess then a question on Sonoco and Alusa and can you just talk about how these two businesses are tracking relative to targets you talked about at the time of acquisition as of FY 2019? And then can you quantify what sort of further benefits you\u2019re expecting in FY 2020? Michael Casamento : Yes, so we got benefits from both in FY 2019 in case of Alusa, that was a big driver of the acquisition related profit uplift that we refer to today in FY 2019, we\u2019ll get more value next year. As we said, probably a year-ago, that business will be a little bit behind from an absolute profit perspective, the returns are getting close to what we originally announced. But the absolute profit is going to be a little longer to realize because there's just been no top line growth. In Latin America, the business is exposed to some economies that are particularly challenged, including Argentina. And we just haven't really seen any top line growth. But we feel pretty good about that. In fact, we've gotten revenue synergies out of that, that we haven't quantified, but have manifested themselves in a number of global customer contracts. And I think some of the growth you see in the Flexibles top line comes from some of those global deals. In the case of Sonoco, that one also has delivered value, it delivered value in 2019. It will deliver more in FY 2020. I think from an overall North American Rigid Packaging business perspective, we've expanded the restructuring, you might notice today, and we've taken a bit more holistic look at the footprint and we're actually doing more specialty container production in legacy beverage plants. So the egg is a bit scrambled at this stage, but that one also will deliver benefits in FY 2020. Brook Campbell-Crawford: Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Larry Gandler with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, your line is open. Again, your next question comes from the line of Gary -- Larry Gandler with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Larry Gandler : Thanks, Ron, for the follow-up question. With regard to the specialty cartons business, it seemed to again defy trends, particularly in Americas cigarette volumes have been really weak, but you guys are calling out higher volumes in the Americas. Just wondering if that is indeed tobacco packaging or perhaps other forms of specialty cartons? How is the growth being achieved? Ron Delia : Yes, it's a good question. Look, it is a business that you need to peel the onion on because the conventional wisdom would be would lead you to think something other than what the reality is, the business does a great job every year of improving its mix, capturing incremental share where it can and yes in some case is diversifying a bit into specialty folding cartons for other end markets, as well as capturing growth now and not so much in the Americas but in Europe and Asia from the growth of alternative reduced risk products. So look in the Americas, it was a combination of some of those factors. I wouldn't want to parse it too finally but the business does have growth leavers at its disposal, and we had a great year in that business last year in general. Larry Gandler : Okay, great. Thanks. Ron Delia : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Salvator Tiano. Please go ahead. You're with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Salvator Tiano : Yes, hi guys. Thanks for taking my follow-up questions. Firstly, just a little bit going back to Bemis. You mentioned strong performance in North America, rest of the world. I was just wondering specifically, when it comes to volumes and the company's restructuring program. I think the company was trying to attract and have achieved positive volume growth over the past couple of quarters with a lot of short run businesses. Can you tell us a little bit how this is going? Is it going as a previous management expected? And what is the outlook on volumes and benefits from this, is Amcor going to stick with that strategy or change it? Just what is your outlook on that? Ron Delia : Yes, it's a good question. And it's interesting. First of all, you might have been referring to Agility, which is the Bemis restructuring program, those benefits have been realized. And that program is behind them. So that's good to see they've executed well, on that in terms of top line growth, the business grows them in a similar way to the way the Amcor business grows in Europe. It's going to be 1% to 2%, sort of top line story. The focus on smaller customers to run business is, we think absolutely the right approach, the right strategy, it's an approach that we've had in several parts of our business, as well. So there's an opportunity to learn from each other there. And that won\u2019t change. I think that's where a lot of the growth is in these end markets that we're servicing. So we're pretty excited about that that approach. Salvator Tiano : Perfect. And just, obviously with this acquisition, you're greatly increasing your footprint in North America. And I think more than doubling your footprint in South America in Flexibles. So I was just wondering, are there any areas of now having this expanded database, and obviously, all the capital with your moderately levered balance sheet that you could try to invest and you know new lines of business, you could enter in Flexible packaging in these areas, in these regions? Ron Delia : Well, from a strategic perspective, we're really happy with the portfolio we have. So we're operating now in four product categories, four product segments. And if you look back over 15 years at Amcor, we've been narrowing that focus and we're quite happy with the four categories we're now. So we won't be adding any new products beyond Flexibles, Rigids, closures and cartons. But then within those parameters, within Flexibles, there's areas that we would like to do a double down in and we were trying to improve the mix each year. Healthcare packaging is an outstanding market for us, there's more we can do there. So I think it'd be more incremental within the four product segments that we're currently participating in as opposed to anything very profound and fundamental across the whole portfolio. Salvator Tiano : Thank you very much. Operator : This concludes the allotted time for our Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. Ron Delia : Okay, operator and thank you to everyone who participated in the call this morning. Thank you for your questions. We will end the call there. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Tracey Whitehead. Please go ahead. Tracey Whitehead : Thank you, and welcome to Amcor's 2020 First Quarter Earnings Call. Good evening to those of you in the U.S., and good morning to those in Australia. Joining me on the call today is Ron Delia, Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Casamento, Chief Financial Officer. At this time, I'll direct you to our website, amcor.com under the Investors section, where you'll find our press release and presentation which will be discussed on this call. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures as we talk about performance against combined comparative information. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures can be found on the press release and presentation on our website. Also, a reminder that statements regarding future performance of the company made during this call are forward-looking and subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ from historical, expected or predicted results due to a variety of factors. Please refer to Amcor's SEC filings, including our statement on Form 10-K, to review these factors. With that, I'll hand over to Ron. Ron Delia : Thanks, Tracey, and thanks, everyone, for joining us to discuss Amcor's first quarter results for the 2020 financial year. As Tracey mentioned, with me here today is Michael Casamento, Amcor's Chief Financial Officer, and we'll begin with some brief prepared remarks and then open the line for Q&A. I'll move on to Slide 3 in the presentation pack. And everything we do at Amcor starts and ends with safety, which is our first and foremost value. And so we begin these calls with safety, like we begin every meeting at Amcor with safety. And fiscal 2020 is a busy year for our leadership teams and employees as we seek to simultaneously grow the underlying business and also integrate the legacy Bemis sites while making progress against our goal of no injuries. And while we're not at no injuries yet, we are working from a position of strength, with more than half of our sites around the world injury-free for the last 12 months and an overall recordable case frequency rate of 3.6 per million man-hours worked. You may recall that the recordable case frequency rate for the legacy Amcor business last year was 2.1. And we know from past experience that acquired businesses typically have higher numbers of injuries than we're accustomed to at Amcor and this is no different with Bemis. So our primary focus this year is on aligning the Bemis sites with Amcor's safety practices, and our approach has been embraced with enthusiasm by our new colleagues. So we look forward to providing updates on our progress throughout the year as we make strides towards eliminating all injuries from our facilities. We move on to Slide 4, to the 4 key messages we have for today : first, we've had a solid start to the fiscal year, in line with our expectations for EBIT growth, driven both by organic growth and synergies; second, the Bemis integration is right on track and delivering, cost synergies made an impact in Q1 and will build through the financial year; third, we're gaining momentum on sustainability, in particular with our key customers, with whom we share the same objectives and similar perspectives on how to achieve them; and fourth, we're on track for the balance of fiscal 2020, and we're reaffirming our outlook for 5% to 10% EPS growth for the full year. Now on Slide 5, we've got a summary of the first quarter results. And before I get to those numbers, just a word on the financials that we're presenting today. The prior year numbers have been prepared on a pro forma basis as if Amcor had owned Bemis since July 1, 2018. And the key message here in relation to these results is that we delivered strong earnings growth in line with our expectations, and therefore, keeping us on track to meet our FY '20 outlook. And we're encouraged by the momentum in the base business particularly. Sales revenue for the period was in line with the prior year in constant currency terms and excluding a negative impact related to the pass-through of raw material costs. We saw growth in our larger businesses, including the core Flexibles Packaging businesses in Europe and North America and the Rigid Packaging business in North America, and this was offset by sales declines in Latin America and the Specialty Cartons business in Europe. Total EBIT was up 10% in constant currency terms with organic EBIT growth in both segments and synergy benefits of approximately $10 million in the quarter. Net income and EPS increased by 15% in constant currency terms, and the Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.115 per share. And lastly, we started a $500 million share buyback which we announced in August, and we purchased nearly 6 million shares in the first quarter. I'll hand over now to Michael to provide some more color on the financial performance of the quarter and our outlook for 2020, and then I'll come back to talk about some of Amcor's longer-term growth opportunities. Michael Casamento : Thanks, Ron. I'll start on Slide 6 with a brief recap of the results for each of our 2 segments, which both delivered organic EBIT growth in Q1. In the Flexibles segment, adjusted EBIT was up 9% in constant currency terms, and margins expanded by 110 basis points, which reflects a combination of synergy benefits, strong operating cost performance across the businesses and further benefits from the normal time lag in recovering raw material costs. Sales are broadly in line with the prior year in constant currency terms. This reflects higher sales and volumes in the core Flexibles businesses in North America and Europe, which was offset by customer inventory destocking in the Specialty Cartons business in Europe and lower volumes in Latin America. We had previously highlighted a very weak June quarter in the legacy Bemis business in Latin America. And although continuing to track at levels below the same period last year, the business has improved sales and earnings considerably compared with the June quarter. In the Rigid Packaging segment, adjusted EBIT was up over 3%, mainly reflecting the higher volumes and strong operating cost performance, although this was partly offset by unfavorable mix in Latin America. Constant currency sales were also broadly in line with last year, excluding the 1% unfavorable impact to revenue from passing on lower raw material costs. Across North America, volumes were higher, with mix favorable and volumes in Latin America were in line with last year. However, mix was unfavorable. Turning to Slide 7. As Ron mentioned, we are pleased with the progress we are making on the Bemis acquisition overall. First of all, the actual integration of the 2 businesses is progressing very well. As we reported in August, we achieved the quick start we had planned for, and we have 2 legacy companies functioning as 1 with no issues around systems or business processes. Everything works, and if you were to walk through any of the facilities around the world, it would be hard to tell we've just brought together 2 different companies. We are not taking the good start for granted, but so far, we have been able to keep the focus on moving the company forward. In terms of synergies, we delivered $10 million in the first quarter. And at the current run rate, we feel very confident about delivering our guidance of $65 million for the current fiscal year and $180 million by the end of the third financial year post transaction, which will be fiscal 2022. To date, the synergies have mainly come from overhead reductions within the Flexibles business and corporate functions. During the first quarter, we continued to reduce G&A headcount and took some of the actions necessary to accelerate procurement synergies. We also announced the start of consultations for 2 additional plant closures in Europe, which means we have now announced plans to close 4 plants in total to date. The key takeaway is that we feel very good about where we are in terms of the integration, and synergies will represent a significant driver of EBIT growth for Amcor over the next 3 years, including an increased contribution through the remainder of fiscal 2020. Moving to our outlook on Slide 8. First quarter performance was in line with our expectations, and as a result, we are reaffirming the 2020 guidance we shared with you in August. We continue to expect adjusted EPS growth of 5% to 10% in constant currency terms. Using current exchange rates, we would expect minimal FX impact from translation. So this guidance continues to imply a constant currency range of $0.61 to $0.64 per share. This is inclusive of $65 million of pretax synergy benefits. There will be very little impact in the fiscal year 2020 from the share buyback, given we will only see a marginal decline in the average shares outstanding for the full year. Corporate costs, interest, tax and cash flow were all roughly in line with our expectations for the quarter. And as a result, we have reconfirmed full year guidance for each of these metrics as well. Looking forward, it's worth mentioning briefly here that sales in Rigid Packaging in fiscal Q2 last year were particularly strong on the back of favorable product mix in the North American beverage business, and especially so, given the second quarter in that business is typically the seasonal low point of our fiscal year. So given the unusually strong comparison, we expect Rigids to assume a more normal seasonal pattern this year, and earnings in the second quarter will be lower than Q2 last year. Most importantly, our full year guidance had already incorporated this phasing and remains unchanged. So with that, I'll hand back over to Ron. Ron Delia : Yes. Thanks, Michael. Before we turn it over for your questions, we're going to lift out of the details a bit to focus on the longer term for a few minutes. And Slide 9 recaps Amcor's strategy, which has not changed and which we've described publicly many times. We've actively managed our way now to a focused portfolio of businesses in 4 product segments. Each of those businesses benefits from a small number of differentiated capabilities, which we call The Amcor Way, and which provide real competitive advantage. And our aspiration is to win for core key stakeholders. And for investors specifically, the strong cash flow that Amcor generates gets deployed in several ways to generate value, which I'll describe on the next slide. Amcor's capital allocation framework is on Slide 10 and provides some perspective for how we think about creating value from our cash flow for shareholders over time. Now over the last 6 years, the outcome of this combination of shareholder value drivers has averaged about 12% per year. And looking forward over the next few years, at a time when uncertainty and volatility are high around the world, we have clear visibility to controllable sources of shareholder value through continued organic growth and $180 million of cost synergies from the Bemis acquisition, plus strong cash flow to enable a growing and compelling dividend and the $500 million share buyback we announced in August. Moving to Slide 11 and sustainability. As we've highlighted many times previously, the single most exciting organic growth opportunity for Amcor comes from the increasing consumer demand for more sustainable and environmentally-friendly packaging. And on the topic of sustainable packaging, we have some particular points of view that I want to spend a few minutes walking through now and which are summarized on Slide 11. First, let's remember that Amcor is a consumer packaging company and we make primary packaging. By primary packaging, I'm referring to the package that actually touches and holds food or medicine or other consumer products. The fact that we make primary packaging for food and health care is important because we have a strong point of view that there will always be a role for that type of packaging. In fact, several roles, including preserving food and health care products, protecting products through increasingly demanding supply chains and helping our customers promote and differentiate their brands. And we know, for example, that properly engineered food packaging can extend the shelf life of many basic food items and help to reduce food waste, which is around 30% globally. And packaging that helps reduce that number not only provides more food for more people around the world but also helps reduce the environmental impact of food waste, which accounts for roughly 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. And to put that in perspective, if food waste was a country, it would rank third behind only China and the U.S. in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. So feeding the world's growing population and protecting the planet from climate change are 2 of the defining challenges of our time, and there will always be a role for properly-designed packaging that can help address both. Next, turning to Slide 13. We have to acknowledge that the requirements and expectations consumers around the world have for packaging continue to increase. We know that consumers have come to expect packaging that works well, is lightweight, convenient, easy to use, cost-effective and great looking. And now they have an additional expectation, and that's for packaging to have a responsible end-of-life solution that doesn't result in more waste or more packaging ending up in landfills or the ocean. Now we see no end in sight for consumers looking for increased convenience generally, including from the packaging they interact with daily. We see sales of single-serve products or products with functional packaging continuing to rise, for example, and at the same time, consumers have been buying more environmentally-friendly products and also expressing a willingness to pay more for them. And how much more do they really have to pay? Not much, actually. In the case of most rigid plastic containers, we are switching to 100% recycled resin as many of our customers are doing currently. Even if that recycled resin carries a 20% cost premium would lead to a retail price increase of less than $0.01 or less than 0.5%. So we believe the way to address the growing consumer concerns around waste is through responsible packaging. And we also believe that responsible packaging requires a total system solution with 3 parts : first, the right package design; second, efficient and accessible waste management infrastructure; and third, active consumer participation. It's clear we need to continue to design packaging to be recyclable, reusable or compostable. We need to continue to design packaging made from recycled materials. And of course, we need to continue to design lighter-weight packaging using the least amount of material in the first place. But equally important for responsible packaging is the right waste management infrastructure, whether that's recycling capacity or composting facilities or equipment to support returnable systems. And even when that infrastructure is in place, we still need consumers to actually use it and to properly dispose of packaging in an appropriate way in order to reduce waste. Now we also believe that Slide 14 indicates responsible packaging does not mean no plastic. And we know that greenhouse gases and climate change are important consumer concerns. And on those dimensions, plastic's clearly advantaged versus other materials and just as recyclable. So in addition to all the great functionality plastic packaging provides consumers, there's no environmental trade-off so long as the package is properly disposed of, which is also true for any type of package, no matter what material it's made from. And our customers are crystal clear on this point, as evidenced by recent comments they've made publicly, a couple of which are on the slide here, and by their continued commitment to plastic packaging generally. So we believe there will always be a role for packaging. Consumers expect more and more from it, including less waste, and the answer is responsible packaging. And so finally, we also believe that Amcor is uniquely positioned to lead the way in finding solutions. As the industry leader, we have the scale and resources to innovate and develop new products. We're seen as the partner of choice for collaborating with customers and other stakeholders, and we have the technical expertise to help inform the debate and educate consumers, particularly around topics like recycling. So we're increasing our support for key partnerships, particularly those focused on waste management, and we'll be increasing and accelerating our external engagement generally. We're core partners with The Recycling Partnership, which recently joined with the leading beverage companies in the U.S. to launch the Every Bottle Back initiative, as well as the Materials Recovery for the Future project, which also kicked off the first curbside recycling program in the U.S. to accept flexible packaging along with other recyclables. And of course, we remain core partners in the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's New Plastics Economy initiative, which has brought together over 400 organizations across industries and around the world to work together to help solve the issue around packaging waste. And finally, as you'd expect, we're innovating and developing great new products at a rapid pace, typically in partnership with our major customers. This month, we've been helping a major food customer transition an iconic brand to a container made from 100% recycled material. We continue to win awards for our packaging innovation. And last month, we took home another one for one of our paper-based materials. And we also continue to introduce new flexible packaging structures that are fully recyclable. All of this innovation and product development will help us reduce our use of virgin plastic by more than 200,000 tons by 2025, while providing consumers with the same great functionality that they currently enjoy. So to close off and summarize on Slide 17, the 2020 fiscal year is off to a solid start. First quarter results were in line with our expectations and we've reconfirmed our full year guidance. We're making great progress on our longer-term priorities, including maximizing the benefits from the Bemis acquisition and taking a leadership role on sustainability, all of which will further differentiate Amcor and create meaningful value for shareholders. And that concludes our opening remarks. We'd be happy to take your questions. Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Daniel Kang with Citigroup. Daniel Kang : Just pleasing to see that you mentioned that overall volume growth was shown in Flexibles in North America, Europe and also in Rigids in North America. Just wondering if you can provide some detail on the product categories where you are seeing this strength? And also maybe provide some color in terms of the magnitude, if possible. That's my first question. Ron Delia : Yes. Look, we had growth in Flexibles in North America and in Europe that you would expect and that we're used to seeing, which is very low single digits. That's what we would expect from the business and that's what we've seen in our business historically. Areas of strength continue to be health care, that would be true globally. We continue to see strength in liquid packaging or packaging requiring higher barrier structures, coffee packaging, generally. These are actually the same segments that have grown both in Europe and in North America. And then outside of that, we see growth in some of the emerging markets. I didn't mention Asia in the prepared remarks, but Southeast Asia and India in particular, we continue to see good growth as well. So I think like any period, Daniel, there are segments that are going really well and there are segments that are softer. But generally, we're very pleased with, particularly the bigger parts of the Flexible Packaging business through Q1. Daniel Kang : Got it. And Mike, in terms of operating cash flow, I noticed that first quarter is a negative number. Can you talk us through the seasonal drivers for first quarter operating cash flows being negative? Michael Casamento : Yes. Look, as you stated, the cash flow was an outflow in the first quarter. I mean this was in line with our expectations and meaningfully better than the prior year. And it also enabled us to -- this was included in our full year guidance, and so we were able to confirm that full year guidance as being cash flow of, after dividends, of $300 million to $400 million, and that's before $100 million of integration costs. So we indicated back in August that our cash flow will vary widely from quarter-to-quarter and versus prior year. And typically, it is seasonally weaker in the first half as we come off a strong, the strongest quarter in Q4. So we'd expect that in Q2 it will improve. And -- but a reminder there that we will also have 2 dividend payments in Q2 as we realign to the quarterly dividend program. So one of those, obviously, was declared in August, and we paid that in early October, and then the one that was declared today will get paid in December. So that will have an impact. But typically, we see the first half cash flow as a small outflow and we don't see any difference at this stage. Daniel Kang : Got it. And just finally, in terms of your guidance for profit growth to be 5% to 10%. Given the 15% growth in the first quarter that you generated and the synergies that were only $10 million out of the $65 million that should be generated this year, are you actually running ahead of your guidance of 5% to 10% for the full year? Michael Casamento : No, no. Look, I think we were expecting the result we had. This is really in line and that's why we confirmed the guidance where we are. There were a couple of things in things like corporate cost and interest that we had a lower number in this first quarter, but that will ramp up as we progress through the period interest. Yes, so I think that's what we see. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Reilly with UBS. Nathan Reilly : Just in relation to the Bemis integration process, it sounds like you're tracking pretty well there from, I guess, an operational point of view. Just curious how you've managed to the customer expectation levels through that in terms of delivering to their requirements through that process. And then I'm just wondering how you're placed at this point to start driving some of the revenue synergies through cross-selling initiatives and whatnot. Just give an update on that would be fantastic. Ron Delia : Yes. That's a good question. Look, the first priority with customers is to make sure that we're keeping our eyes on them. The integration is a massive undertaking internally, and the thing that we're most on watch for is that we become too internally focused. So the first priority with regard to management of customers is spending the same amount or more time with them than we had previously. So that's been priority 1, 2 and 3, is just being as attentive as we can possibly be. And I'd say that's all gone very well. I mean I think as Michael commented, the integration, the nuts and bolts of it, has gone very well, and that includes our continuing service and quality levels with customers, which hasn't missed a beat in any part of the business, which is just great. And that gives us a great foundation from which to start to talk about the benefits of the acquisition for those customers and those conversations are continuing. They're accelerating. I think we've probably talked about this publicly a few times, but this deal, unlike some others, is a little less threatening to customers, because there's very little direct overlap. And there's very little -- very few examples where the 2 companies were supplying the same products to the same sorts of customers in the same regions. And so really, the onus is on us now to turn the acquisition and the combination benefits into value for customers. And I would say they continue to be highly engaged and optimistic. And the topic of sustainability is the one real thread that has made us even more relevant to the customers of both legacy companies. It's early days to talk about traction on revenue synergies. I think those conversations evolve over time. And I think I would say watch this space on that. We're not expecting anything material in the next couple of periods here. Nathan Reilly : Okay. And just finally, just on the sustainability agenda. I'm pretty sure that when you sold your health care assets, you had an intention to allocate some of the proceeds from those sales towards some investment in sustainability. Can you just give us an update on what that is shaping up to look like at this point? Ron Delia : Yes. It's really going to be the 4 buckets we talked about at the time in August. First of all, you're right. We divested some plants to satisfy the trust regulators and get the deal approved. That liberated $550-odd million of cash after tax. And we said we're going to commit $500 million of that to a share buyback and $50 million to advancing our sustainability initiatives. And the money is going to go in 3 or 4 big areas. Firstly, the R&D infrastructure that will really help us turbocharge the product development efforts is a little bit uneven. We've got more infrastructure in certain parts of the world than others. By infrastructure, I mean customer prototype and design centers, pilot equipment, et cetera. So that will be 1 area. Second is some capital equipment to make some of the products that are more sustainable, whether that's handling recycled resin or some of the flexible structures that require different types of coatings and things. And thirdly, putting some more money behind our partnerships. And there's some really exciting things happening with our partnerships, including in the U.S. with The Recycling Partnership and their support for the Every Bottle Back initiative. So those would be the big 3. And then ultimately, we're -- we want to make sure people know we're open for business from an innovation perspective, and we'll do a bit more open innovation sourcing, which will require some investment as well. So that's where the money will go. No update in terms of something specific to point to, but those are the themes that are being worked through and will evolve over time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brook Campbell-Crawford with JPMorgan. Brook Campbell-Crawford: Just one on raw materials for Flexibles. Apologies if it's in the materials already, but what was the impact to sales and the benefit to EBIT in that Flexibles division from the pass-through of raw materials? Ron Delia : Yes. The EBIT benefit was very similar to what we saw in terms of magnitude in the second half of fiscal '19. So we had a modest benefit, about $5 million in the quarter, which is basically the same pace we were at in the second half. As you might recall, we had about a $10 million benefit for the full second half. Overall basket of materials was modestly lower but not really material. I'd say that we're sort of at the same pace for the second quarter, but nothing in a substantive -- nothing to impact the results substantively that would change either the outlook or the results for the period. Brook Campbell-Crawford: And I'd appreciate any sort of comment on the sales line as well. Just trying to understand the 0.8% decline really for Flexibles sales that would have been pulled down a bit by raw materials. So either on a growth rate basis or absolute dollars, the impact on sales? Ron Delia : Yes. Just basically, the sales would have been roughly flat. Brook Campbell-Crawford: Okay, great. And speaking about Flexibles and Specialty Cartons and the destocking there, which influenced that business, and can you help sort of outline what level of decline? Ron Delia : Yes. Look, I mean, this happens from time to time in this business. And as we report on a 90-day cycle, it will become more evident that this happens. I mean customers manage through excise tax changes or packaging regulatory changes in different ways, depending on the jurisdiction. And in the quarter, there were a couple of changes in Eastern Europe, where it was actually to the customer's advantage to deplete inventories. And when that happens, then we wear it through the top line. I think we've seen it before. We know that these are temporal, so we're comfortable with where the business is at. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Brian Maguire : Just a first question, just on the 2Q outlook. I think did you say in the prepared remarks that you expected EBIT to be down year-over-year? I wasn't sure if that was the whole company or just specific to North America Rigids? Ron Delia : No, we're just flagging that Rigids last year had an extraordinarily strong quarter on really strong volume and mix. And for this quarter, it will be more of a normal pattern, which typically, the second quarter in Rigids is the seasonal low for the year. So the EBIT in Rigids for Q2 will be lower than the prior period. EBIT for the company will grow, and all of which [indiscernible] driven our -- yes, and this is all factored into our full year guidance. Brian Maguire : Okay, great. And then, I think you also mentioned that the impact to EPS from currency, you expect to be pretty minimal. I'm just wondering if that's what you said. And if so, why? It seems like the FX rates might have moved a little bit more than the minimal levels since the average of where we were in fiscal '19. And then just sort of a related question on that. I see you guys are excluding some hyperinflation costs. Just wondering what's the policy on that and why exclude that? Michael Casamento : Yes. So look, on the currency, look, we had a very small impact in the period, it was about $3 million. Based on today's rates and the convergence of currency over the balance of the year, the impact, we don't see it's going to be material, so we've basically called out that we don't see a material impact for the year. There'll be some, but it'll be small, based on what we see if you take today's rates. In terms of the hyperinflation adjustment, really, that's just -- what we're trying to do there is provide a comparison of the results. And so we're just taking below the line the translation impact on that front to give a comparative of the period year-on-year. Brian Maguire : Okay. And last one for me, just on the sustainability topic. Just wondered how your conversations are going with some of the supply chain partners that you're going to need to partner with to develop the sourcing for recycled plastic? I imagine it's still sort of early days with some of these 2025 targets that a lot of companies have. But as you said, a lot of CapEx, a lot of wheels need to be put in place today to kind of satisfy those goals. How are those conversations going? Are they still high level or are we at the point where you're starting to see a lot of CapEx dollars be allocated to that and actual like rubber hitting the road? Ron Delia : I think you're seeing an intensifying of the effort generally. I mean I think first thing I would say is the big brand owners remain committed to their current package formats. That's the first thing I would say. I mean I think they're under a lot of pressure and they need to show traction and evidence of progress and they're making that. But they remain committed to providing the consumer the same experience that he or she has today, with the added benefit of a more recyclable or a more responsible end-of-life solution. So that's the first thing. I would say that you are seeing an acceleration of activity and conversations and spend. And I think the announcement in the U.S. last week from the American Beverage Association and the Every Bottle Back initiative, which is essentially a joint statement by the 3 major beverage brand owners in the U.S., is a great example of that. I mean there are hundreds of millions of dollars behind that. I think separately, each of the 3 would make the same comment that Amcor would make, which is we would happily secure and convert every pound of recycled resin that we could get our hands on. And I think you're starting to see real evidence of people putting their money where their mouth is. So I think we all know that the challenge here is not just the package design but also the infrastructure, which will require capital and coordination, but also the consumer and their understanding of how to deal with the package when it's been used, what to do with it and their active participation. So I think it'll be a journey, but there are some real green shoots to point to for increasing activity. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Debbie Jones : My first, just a follow-up on some of the previous volume questions. Could you remind us why Q2 volumes were so strong in Rigid Packaging last year? And then the Specialty Carton weakness that you talked about, are you actually seeing improvements in the quarter -- in the current quarter? Or is that something that will linger into this quarter? Ron Delia : Last year, Debbie, in the second quarter, we had -- first of all, for the whole half last year, we had double-digit growth in hot-fill, which is the higher value-added part of the rigid beverage business. That volume growth was pretty benign in the first quarter last year and was just extraordinary in the second quarter. And that's not going to happen again. We're in a more normal pattern. And that's all -- that's all been out there for a year, so it's consistent with the results for last year. On Specialty Cartons, we definitely see signs that the destocking will abate. I think that it will continue a bit into the second quarter. There's a couple of changes in Russia and in Turkey, in particular, which will go into effect in the beginning of the calendar year. And so as you work your way towards January 1, you start to see the impact of the destocking dissipate as consumers or as customers resume normal ordering patterns. So it's not something that will linger into the second half, but the second quarter will have a bit of a negative drag as well. Debbie Jones : Okay. And then my second question. By the way, the slides I thought were very helpful on sustainability and responsible packaging and the message around the carbon footprint. My question is really around the waste infrastructure and kind of your optimism and thoughts about whether that can improve sooner rather than later. I know that's like a very broad question, but you sounded pretty optimistic about some of the programs you threw out there that are being supported by your customers or whatnot, but it's just -- it's a little unclear to me what -- where the optimism lies and like how soon that problem can be addressed, because it seems like one of the big issues around kind of shifting away from some of these other forms of packaging. Ron Delia : Well, look, I think what we're seeing is the brand owners realizing that the format that their consumers prefer, just like all the other formats, has to have an outlet in a responsible way. So we need waste management infrastructure regardless of whether you're talking about a can or a glass bottle or a PET container. And I think what we're also seeing is those brand owners remain committed to the same sort of mix that they've had. So they realize now that they've got to shift gears a bit. And if you go back over several decades and you just think about the positions that several of the actors in the value chain have had on things like bottle bills, things like sponsorship for this sort of activity, waste management in particular, I mean and how that's shifted pretty dramatically, that's where the optimism comes from. I think it comes from the fact that if the consumer wants a package that is fully recyclable, can be turned into a new package over and over and over again, then they have a choice, because PET is just as recyclable and just as reprocessable as any of the other substrates. They don't have to give up the functionality that they have come to enjoy and appreciate. But they also now have a particular desire to see a more responsible solution and that's going to require infrastructure. So I just think the pressure through the system now is at a point where there's action and not just words. And how fast does it get addressed is a good question. I mean you would know in the U.S., only 60% of households have access to curbside recycling. That's not enough. And you'd know that in the U.S. it's fragmented, right? It's city by city, municipality by municipality. So it'll be a journey. But I think that today's consumer is educated enough and committed enough to helping ensure that outcome and the brand owners are following. So that's where the optimism comes from. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Purtell with Macquarie. John Purtell : Just had a couple of questions. Look, just in terms of sustainability, I mean you've obviously highlighted some of the longer-term issues. But just in terms of what you're seeing as far as impacts on the business in the short term. You've called out North American water, but what other impacts are you seeing, either positive or negative, on the business right now? Ron Delia : Look, that's a great question. I mean the short answer, John, is we really don't see anything in the here and now. I mean if you look at the industry figures, and everyone focuses on PET, which is the easiest one to focus on, it's not the biggest part of our business, but it's obviously quite visible. If you just take PET and beverages in North America, the growth in the third quarter was the strongest quarterly growth that PET has had in the last 5 or 6 quarters. And so there doesn't seem to be any real shift in terms of demand patterns in the market at large. That's the first thing. So we don't really see it impacting the business. I think where we see action in the business, not so much in the results, but in terms of activity, is sourcing of recycled materials. No question, that's intensified, our own activity in sourcing more recycled material. And then I think the other thing is, obviously, the product development agendas and the dialogue with customers is probably increased by an order of magnitude. So those are the current impacts you see on the business. Today, it's more activities, activity level, as opposed to financial statement income -- impact. John Purtell : Okay. Just sorry, lastly -- sorry, a 2-part question here for the second. Just in terms of North American Flexibles, what drove the higher sales and volumes? I mean obviously, you've got a couple of things happening there in terms of growth in protein, in terms of meat and cheese, but weakness in dry goods. How did that sort of play out? Ron Delia : Well, for our business, really, the growth in the quarter was from health care and from what we would call liquid packaging or packaging that is a -- has higher barrier properties that is a substitute for metal cans or is for refillable formats as well. So it would be more the structures that provide high barrier where we saw good growth and the health care end markets, both medical and pharmaceutical, would be the particular areas of strength. John Purtell : And just last one. Latin American volume weakness, how did that track through the quarter? And Bemis, you mentioned previously, was profitable in July, how did that track through August and September? Ron Delia : Yes, that's -- well, that's right, John. I mean the softness in LatAm in the Flexibles business was primarily from that legacy Bemis business that we flagged in August. And what I would say there is really -- it's a good news story. Sales are obviously weaker than prior period. They continue to track weaker than prior period. But the business is in a much better place. It's returned to profitability for the quarter. The bottom line has benefited from the quick actions that were taken in the summer -- northern summer around the cost base, the headcount takeout and some of the other things. So I think we probably feel a lot better about that business than we did 3 months ago or 2 months ago when we last spoke. But the top line is still soft, and I wouldn't say that there was any major shift through the quarter sequentially. So we're going to wear a bit of a softer top line there, but the business is back in the black. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Salvator Tiano with Vertical Research. Salvator Tiano : So wanted to ask about your Rigid Packaging. Firstly, can you clarify a little bit the mix impact in Latin America? Because it seems sales, excluding currency and raw materials, were still down despite both the volume and mix in North America. So I'm trying to understand a little bit what was the mix impact that drove the entire segment down. Ron Delia : Yes. The mix in this business is driven by a number of factors, but one is -- that impacted the quarter primarily was the product mix in Latin America. So if we sell more preforms and less hot-fill containers, that will have a negative mix impact, both on the sales line and the profit line, and that's really what we're referring to there. Salvator Tiano : Okay. And can you also provide a little bit more clarity with regard to North America volumes. What drove the growth? Was it hot-fill, cold-fill? How did you do on specialty containers? And are you essentially -- do you believe you're growing with the market or are you still gaining market share like plastics have been doing historically? Ron Delia : Look, I think our growth was pretty flat in the beverage space. We had good growth in some of the other segments, food and health care, which we would put in the specialty bucket. I mean I wouldn't read too much into the 90-day period. I'd say generally, the format took a bit of share and grew about 2.5%. And we, over time, have been gaining share and that hasn't changed. But I think for the quarter, it would be safe to say the volumes are more or less flat in the beverage categories, with a little bit of growth in the specialty space. Salvator Tiano : Perfect. And one last question. We've talked about sustainability. And it seems the companies that do make plastic packaging are now starting to fight back and make a stronger case for their product. And the corporate world seems to understand that you have these [quotes] by some of your very large customers about the importance of plastics. But have we seen any change in the attitude of legislators? Ron Delia : That's a good question. Look, I mean I think -- maybe I'll respond to the first part of the question. I think there's no doubt there's a shift in the communications from the big brand owners over the last several months. I think you can track comments by any of the large MNCs, and what I think you see is a much more balanced position on the topic. I think you see an acknowledgment of the impact of greenhouse gases. I think you see an acknowledgment of the need for more waste management infrastructure. And I think you're also starting to see the acknowledgment that the consumer has a role to play in this. That even with the right package design and even with the right waste management infrastructure, we still have to make sure consumers understand what they're supposed to do at the end of the use of a package and that they actually do it. So I think I would say that the narrative, particularly from the industry at large, and that includes our suppliers and our customers and probably some of our competitors, I think the narrative is much more balanced and helpful and informative. As far as what legislators and regulators have to say on the topic, I'd sort of -- I'd probably not comment. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Larry Gandler with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Larry Gandler : If I can just ask some finance questions to start. Just in terms of net debt, in the GAAP balance sheet, if you just take the liability, short- and long-term, less cash, you get about $5.5 billion. Michael, can you sort of reconcile that to about the $5.3 billion of adjusted net debt in the media release? Michael Casamento : Just give me 1 sec here. All right, I just have a -- I mean the net debt was -- we ended at $5.2 billion for the period. Are you taking... Larry Gandler : $5.2 billion, sorry, yes. Michael Casamento : Yes, $5.29 billion was the net debt and that's after taking into account the cash balances and the short- and long-term debt position, so. Ron Delia : What's the number you're looking at, Larry? Larry Gandler : Just looking at the GAAP balance sheet in the 10-Q has about $5.5 billion if you take the long-term and short-term liabilities less -- less cash. Michael Casamento : Larry, we'll -- I tell you what -- yes, we'll get IR to... Larry Gandler : We'll take that offline, yes. And I guess related to that then is there's an asset held for sale of $460 million. Is that in your adjusted net debt figure? Have you sort of, or is that still to be taken off? Michael Casamento : So I think you're actually looking -- you're looking at the 30 June numbers there, Larry. So the... Larry Gandler : Oh, okay. Yes, you're right. Great. Michael Casamento : You're in the wrong column. So I think that impact probably [indiscernible] the difference in the net debt as well, you're in the wrong column. Larry Gandler : Yes, picked that up. Okay, great. Just my other question related to Latin America. And I'm just wondering, Ron, if you're starting to see reusable containers perhaps explain some of the flatter volumes in LatAm that you achieved rather than any other factor there? Ron Delia : No. Actually, we've seen really good growth in reusables. I mean in a market like Mexico, it's double the volume of 2 years ago, but the base is very, very small. It's a low single-digit percentage penetration in terms of our mix. And it's actually -- those, the containers would be accretive to our mix as well. They tend to be high margin and there's a bit of technology in the design. So I would say that's encourage -- it's encouraging because the brand owners are also putting a lot of emphasis behind those containers in Mexico and Brazil, in particular. And we're right there in the middle of it. But at the moment, the numbers are pretty small. Larry Gandler : Right. So that doesn't eat into your one-way package volume, having a growing reusable base there? Ron Delia : No, it's actually -- typically, it's geared towards a different segment. So the returnables tend to be 2-liter or even 3-liter now in some of the latest formats; 3-liter carbonated soft drink containers in a refillable format. And a lot of the growth that we see in that region is in single-serve for away-from-home consumption. So it's really tapping into 2 different occasions. Larry Gandler : Okay, great. Specialty Cartons North America. Altria reported some weak volumes there, but you guys seem to be bucking, at least in terms of revenue, bucking that trend. Just wondering if you could comment on how you guys are pulling that out? Ron Delia : Yes. Look, we -- well, we have a mix of customers in that business, as you know, and we actually had growth in the Americas, which continues the last several quarters of growth, modest but positive. And yes, that customer did have weak volume for the quarter. But look, I think there's still share opportunities in this business. There's still premiumization opportunities, which help drive the top line. And the business in the Americas is quite healthy. Larry Gandler : Yes. That's what I was wondering. So is pricing a main driver of the better revenue performance there in the Americas? Ron Delia : It's a little bit of all the drivers that you would expect, including some volume. Larry Gandler : Okay. And I just wanted to ask something on the sustainability side of things. So it's my understanding that virtually 80% of the mismanaged plastic waste comes from 5 or 6 countries on the planet. So there's a lot of discussion about recycling infrastructure and waste management infrastructure, which sort of goes to the developed world. But what can Amcor do to really improve the waste management infrastructure or motivate governments, perhaps even help fund that waste management infrastructure in the countries where the planet is really being affected, which is India, Indonesia, et cetera? Ron Delia : Well, I mean it's a good point, a perceptive point. I mean I think it's -- there's a handful of rivers actually in Asia that account for a big chunk of the ocean plastics in the world. So you could start there and make a real impact. I think -- look, what can we do? I'd say it's the same mix of levers we have in developed countries as well. First of all, we got to do our part, and we've got to make sure that the packaging is recyclable or compostable in the first place. And we're making good progress there. I think secondly, we're a big company but only one company. So we're going to have to work with others. It's a big-scale macro problem and we can help inform the debate by providing insights and messaging and technical expertise. And the other thing we can do is help fund pilots and pilots can be really impactful. I mean we happen to be, along with others, launching one in Pottstown, Pennsylvania and which is the MRFF pilot I referred to earlier. And there's plenty of opportunities for us to support pilots like that in the developing world as well. So I think, Larry, it's -- we can make sure our packaging is designed right in the first place. We can help inform the debate, including with governments, and then we can also help contribute in the form of pilot projects that can then eventually scale up. So it's -- I'd say it's a full-frontal attack on multiple dimensions. Larry Gandler : Do you think these countries need a resin tax, which I've raised a couple of times in my research, to help fund waste management infrastructure? Do you think that's a solution? Ron Delia : Look, somebody has to pay for the infrastructure. And I'm not sure that a resin tax that is applied just to 1 substrate is the answer, because ultimately, the issue here is waste. I don't think that a tax on 1 type of material, which may disadvantage it versus others, is necessarily the right answer. But as it relates to things that are closed-loop in nature, where the funding that's generated goes directly to the required infrastructure, we're much more interested in those sorts of solutions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Richard Johnson with Jefferies. Richard Johnson : Ron, could you talk a little bit more generally about the performance of the Bemis assets in the quarter? And I'm particularly thinking about it in relation to the $112 million it's reported. If I think about that number compared to what historically they've produced in the September quarter, and the fact, presumably, the $112 million's got some synergy in it and it benefits from some accounting changes, I mean is it reasonable to assume there's little or no growth from those assets? Ron Delia : Richard, no, it's not reasonable to assume there's no growth. There is good organic growth across the businesses, both Flexibles and Rigids. We had 10% EBIT growth, of which a good chunk of that was the base business and then the $10 million of synergies that we referred to. I think you might be talking about last year's number. There's a table at the back, which is the comp, $112 million was the legacy Bemis contribution. Richard Johnson : I'm just thinking about Bemis stand-alone. And if I think about what historically they produced in their September quarter, that $112 million doesn't suggest to me there's a lot of growth. Because that $112 million's being inflated by accounting changes anyway, when you compare it to legacy Bemis. So I'm just trying to get a sense of whether those assets have actually delivered growth in the quarter. Ron Delia : The short answer is those assets have delivered growth in the quarter. And I think the $112 million you're referring to is last year's number. Richard Johnson : Okay, got you. Okay, that's fine. And then second on sustainability, another very large North American packaging company yesterday made the comment that they thought the plastic replacement opportunity was $5 billion over time. So I'd just be interested to get your sort of take on that. And they called out the beverage market, which they've done previously. So I just wondered if you could update me on where the beverage overwrap business at Bemis sits at the moment. Ron Delia : The overwrap business is -- it's one of many Flexible Packaging formats, and it's a good healthy business. There's actually technology in bundled shrink wrap for beverages. You have to go to a pretty dramatically different format with different functionality if you wanted to replace that. Doesn't mean it's not possible, but that's not a very meaningful part of the portfolio. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Grant Slade with Morningstar. Grant Slade : Just a really quick one for me on the remaining synergies that you expect to flow this fiscal year. How should we think about the remaining $55 million being allocated between the Flexibles and other segments? Ron Delia : Well, look, the synergies are really accruing in the Flexibles space, Flexibles and corporate. I think that you're going to see the vast majority of them in Flexibles over time. I think because this year is more heavily skewed towards overhead synergies, you will see more balance in, a little bit more on corporate. And there'll be more to come. I think we called out 5 in Flexibles and 5 in corporate for the quarter. You'll obviously see both numbers grow. But as we get to the later quarters, you're going to see the Flexibles portion increase disproportionately. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Chau with MST Marquee. Keith Chau : I'll try and keep this brief. Just the first question around your discussions with customers who are ultimately trying to shift towards using more recycled import -- sorry, inputs. As this happens, will Amcor be able to pass through the cost of recycled PET, for example, straight through to customers? I imagine that recycled PET prices now sit above virgin PET in some regions. So in other words, is it simply like a pass-through like the rise in oils associated with the oil price or are the discussions with customers somewhat centered around the sharing of the burden? Ron Delia : No. At the moment, it's a straight pass-through. I think the challenge for everybody in the value chain now is to get their hands on as much recycled material as possible. It has historically and continues to carry a premium. But I think it's clear the way the industry model has been set up over decades that the pass-through of raw materials is just fundamental to the way the business operates. So the cost of recycled resin gets passed along just like the cost of virgin materials does. Keith Chau : Okay. And just a second follow-up on the Flexibles business. I think you briefly spoke about applying some of that $50 million of sustainability spend to, I guess in part, changing some of your assets to be able to take on new materials. Is it a matter of reconfiguring your existing fleet of assets to be able to handle alternate film products like recycled plastic or bio-based films? Or is there -- if we really take this to extremes and talk about the entire fleet being converted to be able to, I guess, handle some of these alternate or recycled films, is there much cost associated with that? Ron Delia : No. Look, it's a good question. It's not really a question of reconfiguring the existing fleet. We have machines that laminate different materials together, and they can laminate any type of polymer substrate, whether it's made of recycled content or virgin content. So it's not so much about reconfiguring, but some of the investments will be in places where we're literally just sold out, where we've got more demand for some of the recyclable structures than we have capacity for, or some of the ancillary equipment to handle new materials and recycled inputs. So the assets in the business, both in Flexibles and in Rigid Packaging, are fully fungible between virgin material and recyclable. Operator : At this time, you have no further questions. Do you have any closing comments? Ron Delia : No, operator, I think we'll leave it there. Thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Tracey Whitehead, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Tracey Whitehead : Thank you. And welcome to Amcor's First Half Earnings Call. Good evening to those of you in the U.S., and good morning in Australia. Joining me on the call today is Ron Delia, Chief Executive Officer and Michael Casamento, Chief Financial Officer. At this time, I'll direct you to our Web site, amcor.com under the Investors section, where you'll find our press release and presentation which will be discussed on the call today. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures as we talk about performance against combined comparative information. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures can be found in the press release and presentation on our Web site. Also I\u2019ll remind you that statements regarding future performance of the company made during this call are forward-looking and subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ from historical, expected or predicted results due to a variety of factors. Please refer to Amcor's SEC filings, including our statement on Form 10-K to review these factors. With that, I'll turn it over to Ron. Ron Delia : Thanks, Tracey. And thanks, everyone, for joining us to discuss Amcor's first half results for the 2020 financial year. As Tracey mentioned, with me here today is Michael Casamento, Amcor's Chief Financial Officer. And we'll begin with some brief prepared remarks and then open the line for Q&A. Let's start with Slide 3 in the presentation pack. Everything we do at Amcor starts with safety and so safety is where we begin these calls as well. For some time now, our role has been no injuries and we're not there yet. But we continue to believe it's possible and we see evidence of that with over 150 of our sites injury free for six months or more. And our overall recordable case frequency rate for the half was 3.2 per million man hours\u2019 work. The rates related to Amcor business during that period was 2.1. And we know from past experience that acquired businesses typically have higher numbers of injuries, and this is no different with Bemis. So our primary focus this year remains on aligning the Amcor's safety practices across all of our sites, and on building on the progress we made in the first six months where we had a 6% reduction in injuries across the company. We look forward to providing updates throughout the year as we drive towards eliminating all injuries. Moving to the five key messages we have for today on Slide 4. First, we've had a good first half with the business delivering solid earnings growth and strong cash flow. Second, taking into account the good first half performance, organic growth expectations for the rest of the year and faster delivery of synergies, our outlook for constant currency EPS growth has improved to a range of 7% to 10% for the year. Third, integration of the Bemis business is progressing well, not only in relation to synergies but also in terms of the organic earnings growth delivered by the business, as well as the opportunities we see to leverage our customer value proposition, which has been improved as a result of the combination. Fourth, we're continuing to lead the way on sustainability. We're uniquely positioned, fully committed and taking action on multiple fronts. And then finally, our market positions and our exposure to defensive consumer segments leave us very well positioned to continue generating consistent returns for shareholders, regardless of macroeconomic conditions. Slide 5 provides a summary of the first half results where we delivered strong overall earnings growth, synergies at a faster pace than we had initially expected. And we returned a significant amount of cash to shareholders. Sales were generally consistent with what we saw in the first quarter. Sales revenue down 1.4% in constant currency terms and excluding the negative impact related to pass through of lower input costs. Volumes grew modestly in our larger flexible packaging businesses in Europe and North America, and there is no volume impact on sales in Rigid packaging. However, sales were lower in Flexibles Latin America, and especially cartons. EBIT was up 4.4% in constant currency terms with 8% EBIT growth in the Flexibles segment, driven by mid single-digit organic growth, plus synergy benefits of approximately $20 million. Earnings were lower in the Rigid Packaging segment as we highlighted would be the case on our first quarter earnings call. EPS increased by 11% in constant currency terms, and the Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.115 per share. Free cash flow before dividends was strong and we returned more than $600 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the half. Before handing over to Michael, who will cover financials in some more detail, just a few words on the Bemis acquisition, I would go to next slide, Slide 6. First of all, the integration of the two businesses is progressing very well. The two legacy companies are functioning as one, and the excitement and the focus demonstrated by our employees has enabled the Flexibles business to simultaneously grow organically and to surpass the synergy targets we originally set for the first six months of the year. The response from customers has been very positive, given Amcor\u2019s enhanced global value proposition, which includes a broader and more sustainable product offering. Now, in terms of synergies, we delivered $30 million overall in the first half, which was ahead of our initial expectations and are mainly coming from overhead reductions and procurement benefits. We've increased our guidance for the current fiscal year from $65 million to $80 million in synergies, and we feel very confident in our ability to deliver the full $180 million by the end of fiscal 2022. So the key takeaway today is that we feel very good about where we're at in terms of the integration and the delivery of synergies. I'll hand over to Michael, and then I'll come back and talk about some of Amcor\u2019s longer-term opportunities. Michael Casamento : Thanks Ron. Good morning, everyone. Starting with the Flexibles segment on slide 7. Sales of 1.4% were lower than the prior period and constant currency terms and excluding a negative impact related to pass through of our input costs. This reflects the continuation of the volume trends experienced in the first quarter, which Ron just mentioned. Adjusted EBIT was up 8% in constant currency terms and in addition to delivering synergy benefits, the base business performed very well with organic growth of 5%, driven by strong cost of funds across the businesses and benefit for the normal time lag in recovering more material costs. Overall, we're really pleased with the way the Flexibles business did performed, and we\u2019re excited about the long-term opportunities for the newly combined business. In the last since months, we've secured a number of long-term commitments in North America based on the strength of Amcor\u2019s enhanced value proposition, and we continue to improve the cost base in Latin America, as well as taking steps to reduce the complexity in that business. Turning to Rigid Packaging on Slide 8. Sales of 1.6% than the prior period in constant currency terms after excluding 2.4% favorable impact to revenue from passing on lower raw material costs, and this was driven by unfavorable product mix given the sales volumes were flat during the period. I think in the second quarter we\u2019re in constant currency terms, which was expected given the business cycle the particularly strong comparing period. In North America, overall mix was unfavorable in both beverage and specialty containers, which also made some higher costs in some of our plants. This compares to the prior period, which benefited from exceptionally strong mix. Beverage volumes were flat compared with last year with the hot fill container volumes 4% higher, supported by market growth and share gains as a range of customers launch new products in PET format. In Latin American, volumes were 2% higher, however, earnings were lower than the prior period as mix was unfavorable and the business benefited from early recovery of cost inflation in Argentina in the second quarter of last year. Most importantly, for the Rigid Packaging business, we expect to return to profit growth in the second half of the year and this is taking into account in our full EPS guidance. On Slide 9, adjusted free cash flow of $310 million was in line with our expectations, and keeps us on track to generate more than billion dollars for the year. One of the consistent highlights for the business has been our working capital performance. And on a like-for-like basis, the working capital to sales ratio is improved by 30 basis points in the half to 10.4%. And we will maintain our focus in these areas to reduce this ratio further overtime. Free cash flow and proceeds from assets divested to complete the Bemis acquisition enable us to return more than $600 million in cash to shareholders during the half. Of this, $391 million was through dividend payments. Amcor has a strong track record of cash return through a competitive dividend, and it was great to enter the prestigious S&P 500 dividend aristocrats on February 1st issue. The remaining $223 million was returned by reposting nearly 22 million in shares through to the end of December. We\u2019re roughly halfway through the 500 million share buyback program that we announced in August of 2019, and we're on track to complete it by the end of June 2020. On Slide 10, we have provided some balance sheet highlights. In simple terms, the balance sheet remains strong with leverage at 2.9 times, and we continue to be in a very comfortable position with access to a diverse range of funding sources at very competitive rates. Combined with our ability to generate significant free cash flow, the balance sheet provides flexibility and capacity to simultaneously invest in the core business, pay a compelling dividend, buyback shares and growth through acquisitions. Finally, moving to our outlook on Slide 11. The business is delivering good first half results and we mentioned building in relation to the delivery of synergy benefits, and lower expectations for our interest costs. Our outlook for adjusted EPS increased to a range of 7% to 10% in constant currency terms. This is now inclusive of $80 million of pretax synergy assets, an increase of $15 million from previous guidance, and assumes net interest costs for the year will fall in the range of $210 million to $230 million, which is $20 million lower than previous guidance. Corporate costs, tax and cash flow were all in line with our expectations for the first half and as a result, we have reconfirmed guidance to each of these metrics. All guidance is in constant currency terms and assuming average exchange rates for the first half of 2020 prevail for the balance of the year, currency headwinds would have an unfavorable impact to reported EPS of approximately $0.01 per share. So with that I'll hand back over to Ron. Ron Delia : Thanks, Michael. Before we turn the call over to you for questions, we're going to lift out of the details for a few minutes and focus on the longer term. And Slide 12 recast Amcor strategy, which has not changed we've described it many times before. We have actively managed our way through a focused portfolio of businesses in four product segments. And each of those businesses benefit from a small number of differentiated capabilities, which we call the Amcor way and which provide real competitive advantage. And then finally, our aspiration is to win four key stakeholders. And for investors specifically what it means, taking the strong cash flow we generate and deploy that in several ways to generate value, which I'll describe on the next slide. Slide 13. This is Amcor's capital allocation framework, and it provides a perspective on how we think about generating value for shareholders overtime. And over the last six years, the outcome of allocating our cash and the capital in this way has resulted in average value creation of about 4% per year through combined EPS growth and dividend yield. And looking forward over the next few years at a time when uncertainty and volatility are high, we have clear visibility to controllable sources of value through continued organic growth and $180 million of cost synergies from the Bemis acquisition, along with continued strong cash flow to fund the compelling dividend and to complete the $500 million buyback we announced in August of last year. As we did in the first quarter, I want to touch on sustainability, which remains the most exciting organic growth opportunity we have at Amcor, and it's not a new topic for us. And we've been fully committed to making a positive difference here for several years now. In fact, made our first public aspirations in January of 2018 over two years ago with our 2025 pledge and in August last year, we demonstrated that conviction again by committing another $50 million of investment to accelerate our sustainability agenda. And over the course of our journey, we've developed some particular points of view, which are outlined on Slide 15. Firstly, Amcor makes primary consumer packaging that actually touches and holds food and medicine, and other consumer products. And as world population and consumer needs grow, we believe there will always be a role for that type of packaging. First and foremost, to reduce food waste which is around 30% globally and contributes, by itself, 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Second, we know that consumers have come to expect a lot from packaging, and they want packaging that works well, is lightweight, convenient, easy-to-use, cost-effective, great looking and the list goes on. And now they have expectations that the packaging has a responsible end of life solution as well that doesn't result in more waste in landfill or the ocean. And the third point is, we believe that's possible and the way to get there is through responsible packaging. And lastly and most importantly, Amcor is uniquely-positioned and taking action on that front. When it comes to responsible consumer packaging and elimination of waste, we believe a total system solution is required across three elements. First, smart packaging design that takes into account environmental impacts throughout the product life cycle and that means packaging that's recyclable, reusable or compostable, made from recycled materials and that uses less material in the first place. And second is the right waste management infrastructure needs to be in place, whether that's recycling, or composting facilities, or returnable systems. And finally, consumer participation is critical to properly dispose of packaging in an inappropriate way, either by recycling, or composting or in fact reusing. There are couple of other important things we believe when it comes to responsible packaging. Responsible packaging also does not mean no plastic. In fact, our customers continue to use and believe in plastic, because it provides great functionality, it's fully recyclable and it's clearly advantaged versus other packaging materials from an overall environmental footprint. And the benefits of plastic relative to other materials will grow over time as waste management infrastructure increases and consumer participation grows as well. When it comes to making responsible packaging a reality, Amcor is uniquely-positioned starting with package design through our innovation capabilities. On Slide 17 I think it\u2019s evident, Amcor is already offering customers a broad range of responsible packaging options to help them accelerate their own sustainability agendas, including packaging made from recycled or bio-based materials, packaging that's recyclable, reusable, or compostable and of course, lighter waste packaging that results in a lower carbon footprint. In making these products available, we're addressing the materials that go into the package, the environmental effects of manufacturing and distributing the product, as well as how the package will flow back into a circular economy rather than becoming waste. And these options are available today in both flexible and rigid formats, and there's a continuous flow of new product introductions. In flexible packaging, recent examples include the first recyclable stand-up pouch for liquid products in Thailand, which is also a multilayer material, multilayer structure and a lighter weight recyclable tray with a recyclable barrier for protein applications, both of which you can see here on Slide 17. And Slide 18 includes examples in the Rigid packaging business, which includes converting the existing products to 100% recycled PET, converting from other package formats to PET and re-launches of iconic brands in the PET format. And by evolving to these more responsible packaging options, Amcor will have reduced our annual consumption of virgin resins by more than 200,000 tons by 2025. And in that process of doing so, we will have supported the development of an effective and more sustainable market for recycled resin by creating cumulative demands of more than a million tons over that time period. And finally, as the industry leader, we're actively sharing our expertise and perspectives, directly with consumers through our podcasts and social media channels, with customers through bilateral sustainability summits and with participants across the entire supply chain through our partnership network. We've had a number of strong long-term partnerships for some time now and we'll add others to maximize our reach and impact. As a recent example, Amcor joined the World Economic Forum this year and had a seat at the table with leaders from the world's largest companies, many of whom are Amcor customers and suppliers. And by contributing in a number of discussions, which were focused on redesign of the plastic\u2019s value chain and the new plastic\u2019s economy global commitment, two things became even more clear; one, we're fully aligned with our customers and our suppliers in our perspectives and our goals; and two, there's a shared determination to develop a waste free future and to do that with pace. When we announced our 2025 pledge, we knew Amcor have the opportunity to make a positive impact on the world, and to lead the industry through better packaging. And we're more confident today than ever that Amcor is uniquely positioned to capture that opportunity and to deliver on our commitments. Summarized on Slide 20, we're pleased with our first half results and confident of delivering against the increased financial outlook we have for this year. Capitalizing on the value and the potential of Bemis acquisition is one of our top priorities, and that integration is going very well with momentum building every day. We're acting with confidence and conviction to drive change as we progress towards our 2025 sustainability goals. And we're excited about the many other opportunities we have to drive long term growth and maximize shareholder value. With that, we'll be happy to take questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead, your line is open. Anthony Pettinari : You raised the full year guidance, I think by about a half a cent at the middle of the range. And I think the benefit from the higher synergies and lower interest cost expenses maybe a bit more than that if my math is right. I'm just wondering when you think about organic EPS growth. Has anything changed versus three months ago? And how do you think, just generally, about upside or downside to the full year guidance for the remainder of the year? Michael Casamento : We feel really good about the first half. I think that point has been clear, and so we increased our guidance for the year, as you pointed out. I think what I would remind you is it is a range. We've given a range again today of 7% to 10% in constant currency terms, up from 5% to 10%. And what that suggests is that we feel pretty good about the full year. I don't think we see anything markedly changing about the business organically or otherwise in the second half. If we think about where the opportunities may come from to hit the high end of that range, obviously, better top-line growth would help, maybe a more favorable raw material environment and certainly, continued acceleration of synergy benefits would help us to get there. And obviously on the inverse, the inverse would be true as we think about the bottom of the range. Although, I think what you can take away from today is that we've minimized the downside risk on the financial year, which is why we've raised the bottom end of the EPS growth range. Anthony Pettinari : And then just switching gears, are you seeing or do you anticipate any impact from the corona virus disruptions? And can you just maybe remind us Amcor's footprint in China and any regions that are impacted? Michael Casamento : Yes, it's an evolving topic. Obviously, it changes by the day. But just to contextualize it, Amcor has got a big flexible packaging business in China. We have about 12 plants spread across the country, although, none in the Hebei provice, which was the epicenter of the virus. We have about 3,000 people and it represents roughly 4% of sales. So it's a big important business for us. Firstly and most importantly, as far as we know, as of today, none of our employees have been stricken by the virus. And our plants are actually all operating, which is great. Many operated right through the New Year period, because we're supplying health care products. Others came back online last week and this week. They're not all running at full tilt, because we don't have all the employees back and our customers are not all operating, but our businesses are functioning. Now the impact on the business in the second half will remain to be seen. Obviously, we didn't have any impact in the first half. Any impact on the business would be in front of us. And while it's an important business for us and it's going to be a real big part of our story going forward, it's not ultimately material in the grand scheme of Amcor's about 4% of sales, as I said. Operator : Your next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ghansham Panjabi : I guess, first off on the comments of the long-term commitment secured in North American Flexibles. Can you just give us more color on this dynamic? Is this incremental business or is it purely just extending contract terms? And if it's incremental, how should we think about layering this in as it relates to the next few quarters? Ron Delia : Yes, it's a good pickup because we feel really good about that. I mean one of the highlights of the integration so far, has been the customer reaction. You know as we talked about, this is a deal that should be exciting for customers. It should not be threatening in any way, because there's not a great degree of overlap in similar regions with similar products around the world. So I think the customers are rightly seeing it as a complimentary combination of two companies. And that's manifesting itself in wealth in a number of commitments, which we highlighted today. I think what I would say is, it's a combination of business that's been locked down and secured with a little bit of incremental share of wallet gain at some of these customers. I wouldn't think that, there's a material impact that needs to be layered in, because we're talking about four or five deals with customers all of whom are important, but out of hundreds and in fact thousands of customers in this business. So I think what it says to us is that we are avoiding any substantial negative synergies. And if anything, we're getting some, let's say positive revenue benefits in the form of locking up business and maybe picking up a little incremental share over time. Ghansham Panjabi : And just in terms of EBIT for Flexibles, it looks like it was up about $38 million for the first half versus the previous first half, plenty of which was from synergy. And so of the remaining $18 million, how much of it came from the timing lag you referenced of raw material cost recovery? Michael Casamento : We had about $5 million in the first quarter. We had a similar type number in the second quarter. So all up we had about 5% organic growth, part of that would have been from the raw material lag, or the recovery, I guess, you could say of the raw materials. But we're pretty happy with the organic growth of 5% generally. Ghansham Panjabi : And will that continue into the second half the way you see it right now? Michael Casamento : Look, it remains to be seen. I think the pace of raw material movements is relatively benign overall if you look across the global portfolio of spend, and you might have a little bit of a benefit in the quarter that we're in. But beyond that, it's difficult for us to say, it looks more benign than anything. Operator : Your next question comes from Larry Gandler with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Larry Gandler : Ron, just a question on North America following onto that. The statement here says North America volumes grew in high value protein. First question is, did volumes in North America overall grow. And one of the things that challenges, I think, us analysts is the external data is showing some pretty weak food and personal care volume performance in North America. Just wondering if you could talk about where you guys maybe picking up pockets of growth. You mentioned a few here. So first question is did overall volumes grow? And two, can you talk about where you're capturing that growth? Ron Delia : First, simple answer to your first question, yes. Volumes grew overall both in North America and in Europe, which is really pleasing, because those are our two engines in Flexibles. Those are two big businesses, neither of which are in dynamic growth markets as you pointed out. So if we can get a little bit of growth through volume in those businesses, it's good to see, so absolute volume grew in both North America and Europe. In fact, in similar end markets in both regions, protein, healthcare, liquid products, which are coming out of cans and into big pouches, particularly in the back of food service outlets, coffee, pet care. So a number of the higher value add segments, we're seeing good growth. Generally, if you were to aggravate the whole FMCG space, I think it's no surprise that volumes grow generally with population, maybe 1% or 2% and then you have all kinds of mixed impacts in there between different types of customers in different types of segments. I don't think that's going to change much from period-to-period. And then it's up to us to migrate our mix towards the higher value add part of that overall space. Larry Gandler : With regards to your customer mix, are you picking up volume at the small end of town or are the large customers also contributing to your volume growth? Ron Delia : It's a little bit of both. In some of the segments I just mentioned, those are driven -- as some of that growth is driven more by the larger customers. We also see some of the larger customers in certain discrete segments, I can think of dairy or cheese is one where some of the larger customers are losing share. But we know that we're picking up the share that they're losing at retail with some of their smaller competitors. So it's a combination. Obviously, the big engine in these businesses is the MNCs, but the incremental growth is disproportionately coming from the smaller companies that we're also serving. Larry Gandler : And last question from me, perhaps for Mike on the finance side. Looking at the cash flow target, a $1 billion adjusted free cash flow, maybe less $100 million for one-off, so call it $900 million, that's a big jump in the second half and same thing with the free cash flow after dividends going from minus $81 million, to $300 million to $400 million. When you look at the line items above in that Slide 9, are you anticipating significant reductions in some of those items like interest and tax and CapEx, and maybe even comment on working capital, how that's going to evolve into the second half? Michael Casamento : Typically, our cash flow is much stronger in the second half, and we do get higher rate in the second half, so there\u2019s seasonality there. We expect there\u2019ll be some working capital improvements as we\u2019re standing in the first half that will continue to flow in the second. So generally speaking, that's the normal trend we see and that's what we expect in the second half more around the seasonality. Larry Gandler : So simply seasonality earnings and working capital will get you to that $900 million? Michael Casamento : Yes, correct. Operator : Your next question comes from John Patel with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Your line is open. John Patel : Just had a couple of questions, just in terms of Rigid, obviously, flagging second half improvement there. Appreciate the sort of comps movement. But you sort of -- in terms of what's driving that, you\u2019re getting some restructuring cost benefit flowing through and the likes of Pepsi recapturing share? Is that part of this too? Michael Casamento : It's a good question, John. I mean, we did flag, we had growth in the first quarter, first of all and we were pretty pleased with first quarter. We did flag that the second quarter would be tough, which has a lot more to do with last year than this year. We're okay with this year's performance. It's really cycling at pretty difficult 90 day period when you look at it on that sort of basis versus last year. It's a combination of things. Last year in North America, we had particularly strong mix, not just in product segments because we obviously have had hot fill growth again this year, but with our customer mix and to some extent our end markets in specialty containers. And in Latin America, we had a better mix of outcome last year. We also had an early recovery of inflation in Argentina last year, which benefited. So those two things really made it a difficult 90 day comparative period in Q2 for Rigid. But we do expect the business to get back to growth in the second half from a profit perspective. The good thing is that volumes have continued to be robust so overall volumes were pretty much flat with hot fill going up 4.5%. Latin America, we had couple of percentage points of growth too. So now it's just about profit conversion and cycling a better competitive period in second half, which we expect will lead to profit growth. John Patel : And just second question, in terms of sustainability impacts in this result, it appears relatively steady state, but in terms of where you're seeing the benefits in this result and also where you're seeing the negative impacts, I know you've called out, continue to call out North American order. But where are you seeing the positives and negatives, I think perhaps in this result and looking forward? Ron Delia : John, I think it's becoming more and more of an opportunity for us as we get into it further. So I would say that we don't see any negatives in the result at all. In fact, the positives that you can take out of the result related to our sustainability agenda would come from some of the comments we made about the customer commitments. The reason that we've re-upped with most of these customers that we referred to and someone asked about earlier, is largely because of our shared sustainability agendas and our innovation developments. Customers are more inclined to want to work with us now than ever before. And not just because of the Bemis acquisition in the bigger footprint, but also because we're completely aligned on the innovation required for sustainability. I think the other thing that we highlighted today is there's been a number of new product launches in PET and plastic, which suggests to us that the format is alive and well and customers are doubling down on that format more than anything. And then I guess the third thing, which I don't know if it's in our materials. But over the last six months, there has been an increasingly balanced dialog externally, including some very supportive comments from our customers who have been very supportive of plastic packaging generally and its role in reducing greenhouse gases and reducing food waste. And then in PET, in particular, we've had basically the two major brand owners come out in very, fairly vocally, or fairly strong language support to the PET format. So I'd say, John, if you took the six months view no negative impacts at all, but two or three real positive indicators, maybe not financial, but generally, about the environment we\u2019re in. Operator : Your next question comes from Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, your line is open. Debbie Jones : First, I wanted to see if we can get some more detail about fixing -- the comment you made about fixing the cost base in Latin America. What do you still need to do there? And then is that the really the only thing that you're focused on to get to where you want to be, or are there other things? Ron Delia : Debbie, the last part of your question I missed. The first part was about the cost base in Latin America and whether there's anything else that we need to do there. And you tailed off at the end there. Can you repeat the end of the question please? Debbie Jones : It was basically what you just said. Is that it, or are there other things that you might still address in the region as well? Ron Delia : Yes, this relates to the Flexibles business in Latin America and then particularly the legacy BMS business, which we flagged a few times now. First of all, what we are doing, well, let's set the context first. So before the acquisition closed, the business was performing at a very high level in the quarter or two before it closed, it had deteriorated a bit, lost some sales and ended up in the fiscal fourth quarter last year losing money, which we've flagged. And we get a hold of the business in mid-June last year and the first thing that happened was we took a lot of costs out and we've taken headcount way down, we're looking at the footprint as well. So those actions were taken very early on. And the business is improving from a profit perspective with each month. So it's absolutely improved quarter-over-quarter, it's actually improving month-over-month from a profit perspective. Despite the fact that the presales take longer to regenerate, it always takes a lot longer to regain sales and it does to lose them. And so in addition to the cost actions we've taken, we're working hard on getting the top line back to where it can and should be and has been in the past. So that would be the other thing. And then the third thing I would point out is we probably flagged this before, but it's a fairly complicated portfolio as we see it. We try to keep things even more focused and more simple. And that business functions, when I say the business, the legacy Bemis business, in particular, in a number of segments that we haven't historically been in. And so we're taking a close look at that as well. We took one step in the first half. We sold out of a joint venture we had to produce tube laminates in Brazil, it\u2019s a small business, good business, very good business, which is not a one that we're in anywhere else in the world. And so we sold out of that JV as a step towards simplifying that portfolio a little bit further. So it\u2019s combination of costs and getting the top line going again and making sure we're focused from a portfolio perspective. Debbie Jones : And then my second question, not really sure if it's something you can answer. But I'm curious on the target for less virgin resin, the 200,000 tons by 2025. What is that implication for you in terms of volume and mix if you hit that? Is this just people cycling into at this type of recycled resin versus virgin, or do you plan on acquiring new customers? And then on that just below it\u2019d be on Slide 18, the effect of market of 1 million tons. Out of curiosity, where does that come from? How do you identify what that market is? And kind of regionally or by end market, what is the addressable market there? Ron Delia : Yes, and I'm glad you asked about it, because it's an important topic which we spend a little more time on it. So this is all about the rigid plastics space in North America, in particular and Latin America. So in the Americas where we make rigid containers out of PET primarily, that's what we're referring to there. And as far as the reduction of virgin resin 200,000 tons a year, that's the house number based on the current glide path. We are actually kind of putting an inflection point now where we're seeing the percentage of recycled material that we're processing it's pretty much double this year. And assuming we kind of continue at that new level, we'd be reducing our virgin resin by about 200,000 tons a year. Now I think it's fairly conservative. There's no reason for us to be, anything other than conservative, in that number. But I think it's more likely that one that\u2019s using more over time rather than less. But nevertheless, we're on a glide path to see us replace 200,000 tons of virgin resin with recycled PET all in the next five or six years. And then still doing -- and that's with existing customers, as well as just the normal mix of business that we have today, and that's just where we're at. As we do that over that five or six year period, we will have been out in the market sourcing that 200,000 tons plus of recycled material, over five or six years, that's over a million tons of a cumulative demand. And we think that's going to be important, because it helps underwrite the much needed investment that's required to not only fund waste management infrastructure but also to fund the processing capacity that will be required to actually convert recovery bottles into post consumer recycled resin, and so we're just flagging that. One role we can play here is as a demand creator and we'll be active in that market for those who are seeking to invest and deploy capital in that space. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian McGuire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open. Brian McGuire : Just wanted to piggyback on that last question and your response there Ron. Just interested to see over the last couple of months, what progress you've seen in the supply chain along the waste collection and processing side, that's going to lead to an increase in our PET supply. Actually you and a lot of others have targets to use a lot more recycled PET in the next couple of years, and a lot of the companies have made commitments to buy it. I'm just wondering if you've seen the infrastructure already start to be put into place to actually make that supply available for you. Ron Delia : Brian, it's a good question and that is the challenge, right? I mean, everyone's got great aspirations and expectations but now the capital and the infrastructure has to follow. I think it's hard to assess over a short period of time. I think generally the momentum is there. I think you see that momentum in the form of increased commitments. You see companies like Amcor talking about, I know our willingness and readiness to buy every pound of recycled material we can get our hands on. You can see the big brand owners making similar comments. You can see Coke and Pepsi teaming up to launch an initiative called every bottle back, which is helping on the front end to drive collections. You see Nestle making public commitments about putting money behind buying recycled material, so I think it\u2019s coming. I don't know that we could point to specific investments over the last 90 days that would meaningfully move the needle on supply. But I think all the momentum is headed in the right direction and all the components of what's going to be required are falling into place. Brian McGuire : And just a question on the outlook. I think previously you talked about D&A being similar to CapEx in the kind of $450 million range. It looks like after stripping out the amortization from deals, it was only $96 million in 2Q and kind of ran just a little bit north of $200 million in the first half. Just wondering if that $450 million is still a good number for the year, or if it's maybe going to be coming in a little bit lower than what you thought initially? Michael Casamento : Typically, we would spend CapEx kind of in line with depreciation, so around that $450 million mark. We were a little behind that in the first half just slightly behind. I think that's pretty typical when you're doing an integration of the size that we\u2019re doing with payments. We expected we got to be there and thereabout by the full year. At this stage, might be slightly low but that's what you should expect to see. Brian McGuire : And then just last one for me, just trying to kind of bridge from the first half EBITDA to the second half outlook. I think the EBITDA was $911 million in the first half, it sounds like maybe $10 million of that was some timing benefits that may not recover -- recur in the second half. So maybe $900 million is the starting point if we could pick up $20 million for increased synergy capture, then seasonality, seems like it maybe adds $50 million or so. So is that directionally about right, something in the kind of nine high $900 million in EBITDA through the back half of the year? Ron Delia : Brian, we're giving our guidance on an EPS basis. I mean, you can get there a lot of different ways. I think the key for us is that we're going to get to 7% to 10% constant currency EPS for the year. Operator : Your next question comes from Richard Johnson with Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is open. Richard Johnson : Ron, just returning to the commentary you made around the long term contracts you signed in Flexibles in North America. I was just trying to put that in the context of all the longer term arrangements that Bemis themselves have put in place prior to you acquiring the business, which I seem to remember involve pretty significant price incentives. So I'm just sort of trying to understand how I should think about what you've done relative to what they have done? Is it completely separate or is it sort of one and the same thing as part of the same process? Ron Delia : No, it's separate. I mean look the business has thousands of customers and dozens of large FMCG customers to go with a thousands of small customers that it has. Any contracts that were in place when we bought the business are still in place. We're just referring to positive momentum that we've had with customers where there is a contract, let's say that's up where that matures where we've made really good progress in terms of just re-upping that business, none of which are material on an individual basis. In fact, they\u2019re probably not material in aggregate other than to suggest that the momentum is very positive on the commercial side of the business. Richard Johnson : And then just on raw material, I was hoping you might be able to give me a feel for how what the, on Rigids, what the contribution in the first half was from your restructuring program? Ron Delia : Not a whole lot in the first half as we flagged. We've got $20 million to $25 million of total benefits come through that program. We had about $10 million so far. We didn't do much at the end of the last fiscal year that would have benefited the first six months of this fiscal year. We're going to get back on with several plant closures later this calendar year, which will deliver the remaining $10 million to $15 million benefits that we expect. Richard Johnson : And then just to confirm that your plant closures net, net don't result in any overall capacity reduction in the system that you've got in North America. Is that right? Ron Delia : Not in any meaningful way. I mean, there might be on the margin in certain types of products, but that's not really the intention. The intention is to lower the fixed cost base, the structural cost base and to consolidate essentially similar and in fact growing volumes in fewer number of facilities. Richard Johnson : And I just want to reconcile what you're doing with your business, which obviously makes perfect sense was the common share your get out of the beverage can producers who are all in full expansion mode and adding capacity, it seemingly way but that kind of -- in fact, they sold out. So I'm just trying to sort of understand, the same to you all the color you put to your growth opportunities in that business when you are effectively taking out capacity and they grind very aggressively? Ron Delia : No Richard, just to clarify. I think I just said that we're not taking out capacity, where we do see a number of plants that are [Multiple Speakers]. No, we're retiring older assets and putting the assets and the capacity in a smaller number of factories. But our business is expecting to grow, it has been growing. If we take a step back around the package formats and the mix and what's happening there, particularly in cans, we see an overall liquid beverage market, non-alcoholic beverage market growing about 2% and this is just based on scanner data. So it's not anything proprietary. We see the market growing about 2% in the back half of the calendar year, which lines up with our fiscal year. We see the PET portion of that market also growing at 2%. And we would see canned volume growing at about 3%. So what it says to us is that plastic format continues to grow at least with market, cans have grown well as well and there's enough growth for both. I think where the can growth has been extraordinary, has been in the alcoholic space. And I think the industry data would suggest this as much, and beer in particular and hard seltzers and things like that, it's been outstanding growth. But that's not a part of the market that we've been participating in or are interested in. Richard Johnson : And then just finally on sustainability, I was just interested to get your view on, if you look at the consumer packaging industry across the entire value chain. I mean, what part of that chain actually holds the key to solving this issue right from raw material producers through to the converter to the customer, and particularly the seasonal markets as well? And the reason I asked the question is, if you think about the numbers that Nestle had talking about, they\u2019re obviously significantly higher than the numbers or investment they\u2019re make in this process than the converters are doing. So I'm just trying to understand when you stand back in that and look at the problem in its entirety, or look at the issue and all the solution in its entirety. And who really holds the key, is it the customer or is it actually the raw material producer? Ron Delia : I actually think its equal parts converter, brand owner, waste management provider be that a regulator or private enterprise and consumer. So I actually think it's an equal parts those three. I think it's less about the retailers and probably a little less about the raw material suppliers. I think it's more about those other actors. And I think that's why we feel really good about our position, because ultimately you need a combination of materials and you need other functionality design into packaging, which no raw material supplier provides today and we don\u2019t envision in the future will provide. So the converter has a critical, critical role there. I think the brand owner has a role in making sure things move quickly and with the right set of tradeoffs in mind. I mean these products are not going to be cheaper initially and the brand owners are going to have to kind of live with that in the early days. Waste management infrastructure is mission critical, because it's not in place everywhere and it's a fragmented landscape depending on the jurisdiction we were to focus on. And then I don't think we can underestimate the role of the consumer, because whether the answer here is recycling, or even reusing, or composting, the consumers have to do something different than what they've been doing and what do today. They have to use -- make use of their compost facility, or their reuse system, or their recycling. And that's not an insignificant shift. So I genuinely believe its equal parts those four part, the equal contribution from those four parts of the value chain. Richard Johnson : Do you have any formal sort of corporate agreements with any of your key customers to develop particular products? And the reason why I asked question, and you might well do is that sort of I just don't know what they are. Whereas I do know and your customers talk very loudly about the arrangements and development project cycle of material producers and reusable packaging systems and so on and so forth. So it's so easy to find those out. So I've thought of NGOs. Is there anything particularly you can point to that would help us sort of understand what the converter is doing in conjunction with any customers? Ron Delia : Well, the clearest manifestation is the new products we launched. Those don\u2019t come by our own activity in isolation. We do have several what are called joint business development agreements or joint product development agreements with customers that are typically separate from commercial contracts where you've got almost like a product development contract, if you will, in a number of segments. In fact, across our entire business, we don't have all customer names associated with those. But that's where the innovation and the new product development comes from that leads to the examples that we've highlighted today and kind of highlighted before. Operator : Your question comes from Scott Ryall with Rimor Equity Research. Please go ahead your line is open. Scott Ryall : I have been thought some specific questions around the sustainability slides, Ron. On Slide 17, you've shown a recyclable stand-up pouch in the context of that pouch being multilayer and all of that. How do you define recyclability in this respect please? Ron Delia : Yes, it's a good point that -- it's a good pick up that it\u2019s a multilayer materials, because recyclable doesn't have to be in single layer or monolayer. And in this particular case, it's a combination of different polyolefin materials that are brought together to provide the functionality that's required for this home care product line, which is set of generation, it\u2019s I think the laundry -- so laundry detergent that's pictured here. As far as the definition of recyclability, there are industry standards out there that are facilitated and being developed by NGOs, and particularly Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which is the leading authority on the space and has gotten signatures from 450 companies behind what's called the new plastics economy global commitment around certain definitions. And so, there is a specific definition of what means recyclable has to be recycled today someplace at scale, and this particular product would meet that definition. Scott Ryall : So you'll come -- so that was where I was really getting through with the recyclability at scale. I had thought they talked to that also at scale in the market. Are you comfortable in -- I think you said Thailand, is that recyclable in Thailand? Ron Delia : I don't know that it is recyclable in Thailand. But the definition at this stage is recyclable at an industrial scale, because the infrastructure has to be developed in different parts of the world. And so it's also a guide to what the infrastructure agenda should be in different markets around the world. Scott Ryall : And then a quick question on your next slide, which you -- on 18, which you clarified the less virgin resin and what you want to signal as your demand creation? Can you just confirm for me how much of your virgin resin in North American Rigid that would represent please? Ron Delia : I don't think we break it out publicly. We're one on the larger buyers [Multiple Speakers]\u2026 Scott Ryall : But are you getting up to a material proportion, I guess, of like you said a material proportion of the 200,000 tons? Ron Delia : Let me help a little bit there. This year, we're going to exit the financial year, converting more than 10% of the resin in our Rigid Packaging -- in our PET resin and our Rigid Packaging business will be recycled resin. So that's why I referred earlier to an inflection point. We're accelerating at very rapid pace the proportion of the resin we convert as recycled and this year we're going to exit at over 10%. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to management for closing remarks. Ron Delia : Okay. Thanks everyone for joining us today. And on the call there, operator, thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you very much for joining me. You may now disconnect.",

After the speaker's presentation, there'll be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Miss Tracey Whitehead. Thank you Please go ahead, ma'am. Tracey Whitehead : Thank you, operator, and welcome to Amcor's third quarter earnings call. Joining the call today is Ron Delia, Chief Executive Officer and Michael Casamento, Chief Financial Officer. At this time, I'll direct you to our website amcor.com under the investor's section where you'll find our press release and presentation which will be discussed on the call today. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures as we talk about performance against combined comparative information. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures can be found in the press release and presentation on our website. Also, a reminder that statements regarding future performance of the company made during this call are forward-looking and subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ from historical expected or predicted results due to a variety of factors. Please refer to Amcor's SEC filings, including our statement on Form 10-K and 10-Q to review these factors. With that, I'll turn it over to Ron. Ron Delia : Thanks, Tracey. And thanks, everyone for joining us to discuss Amcor's year-to-date results. Joining me on the line as Tracey mentioned is Michael Casamento, Amcor's Chief Financial Officer. We'll begin with some prepared remarks and then open the line for Q&A. We'll start with safety. We start every meeting with safety and always have and obviously the topic takes on a different meaning in today's environment. Our goal is no injuries and we're making good progress this year so far. This fiscal year we've got 8% fewer injuries in the first nine months of the year, and more than half of our sites around the world have been injury-free for at least 12 months. We're really pleased with that progress at a time with so much distraction and new ways of working to accommodate physical distances et cetera. Never more important than today and our employees have really risen to the occasion and remain vigilant. Moving on now to the key messages we have for the call today; it's obvious these are unprecedented times for everyone and lots of challenges that no one's had to deal with before. Against that backdrop, it's important to make clear that Amcor is absolutely not immune but we are relatively well-positioned and we've been demonstrating resilience so that's the first key message today. There are a number of reasons for that, which I'll come back to in a minute. But it really starts with the commitment of our 50,000 employees around the world and their dedication and resilience through this period has been amazing and we can't thank them enough. The second key message is that our financial results have been strong through nine months and for the second consecutive quarter; we've increased our outlook for the 2020 financial year. We now expect EPS growth of 11% to 12% and we'll generate over $1 billion of free cash flow this year. We've had good organic growth, momentum building in the businesses, and we've also benefited from faster delivery of synergies from the acquisition of Bemis last year. Now we're coming up on the one year anniversary of that deal, which was an all-stock transaction, the largest in Amcor's history and by all measures, it's been exceeding our expectations so far. That's the third point. Fourth, we have a clear line of sight to controllable drivers of shareholder returns in the near-term, defensive organic growth, further cost synergies to come, a compelling dividend and also the benefits from having bought back over 3% of our shares outstanding so far this year. Lastly, longer term, we'll remain well-positioned to generate continued value for shareholders in all macroeconomic conditions. Five, relates specifically to COVID-19. With almost 50,000 employees in 250 factories around the world in over 40 countries, a global pandemic creates a global challenge for a company like ours. The work to manage through it has been massive as you can imagine. Early on, we established three guiding principles. It starts with keeping our employees healthy. Everything we do starts with safety anyway, so this would be the natural starting point for us and we're taking many extra steps now, more frequent cleaning and disinfection of our facilities and equipment. Obviously, increased physical distancing, restricted travel, protective masks, lots of work from home arrangements as well. Again, our employees have been incredibly adaptive and agile as we've introduced new measures to help keep them safe and healthy. Contributing to the communities in which we operate has also been a guiding principle. We're fortunate we've been able to keep our people employed and our operations running so we can help those around us who've been less fortunate. There are hundreds of examples from around Amcor of great initiatives really at the local level, which range from producing face masks and face shields to donating packaging for hand sanitizer or supporting Community Food Banks and healthcare agencies; just lots of really good, passionate work by the teams around the world. Of course, since we make packaging for food and healthcare products, we've got to keep our plants running, so we can continue to supply our customers. Doing that requires extensive planning, obviously to prevent any issues but then also to deal with them in an efficient way should they arise and we've been doing just that. So again, we've not been immune here, but we've managed well so far with minimal disruptions. I mentioned at the outset that Amcor is relatively well-positioned and demonstrating resilience and I want to come back to that for a few minutes starting with Slide 6. One reason we remain in a relatively good position today and why it's so important that we keep our plants running is because Amcor is making primary packaging for consumer staples. That's really all that we do. It's essentially who we are. We're making packaging for defensive consumer segments like food, beverages, medical and pharmaceutical products, products that people need all the time, obviously, including now. These supply chains have been recognized as essential by governments and healthcare authorities around the world. That essential designation extends to Amcor and provides us with the license to continue operating. In almost all of the products we package are for home consumption or use in medical facilities or sold through retail. Very little of our packaging is for on-premise consumption or for sales through the foodservice channel. Turning to Slide 7; the primary packaging that Amcor makes for food and healthcare products has always played several important roles; to protect consumers and ensure food safety, to preserve products and extend shelf life and to promote brands. Those things will always be important but right now in the current environment, certain needs are especially important for consumers and companies around the world. Hygiene would be the most obvious one. In every aspect of our lives now hygiene has become much more front and center. Is this beverage I'm about to drink out of this beverage container is that clean? Is this medical product sterile? Should I buy the loose lettuce from the open bin or the packaged lettuce? These are the questions that people have on their minds now. Convenience is another one. We're eating at home now more obviously. I don't have any more time than I used to have probably less so how can we make cooking and food preparation easier? Can we just pop this product in the microwave? Then automation, if you're running a factory right now, you're asking about automation not just about cost but also about worker safety and whether or not there's a packaging solution that can make the production process less labor-intensive. It's way too early to project how any of these needs will evolve or what priority they'll be given over time. But it is clear that long-term demand for food and healthcare packaging will continue and that demand will be there globally. Slide 8 indicates Amcor is present in all the major developed and emerging markets around the world and so in this challenging time, we've benefited from our scale, but also our geographic breadth and diversification. The scale provides many advantages at times like this, starting with the ability to ensure we have access to raw materials and other supplies, but also making sure we have redundancy in our supply chain, in our production network. If production is disrupted in one region, there's the opportunity to source from another. Of course, being diversified geographically means in this instance, while one region may be struggling like China was earlier this year, other regions have been less impacted especially during the pandemic, being so global has also meant that we've been able to share learnings as different parts of the world have suffered through the pandemic at different times. We've learned from the experiences in Asia and Europe now as we've dealt with the outbreak at later dates in the Americas. Lastly, turning the Slide 9; Amcor is also relatively well-positioned by virtue of our strong financial situation. The market positions we have in the scale and the defensive consumer segments we supply have led to consistently strong cash flow, which in turn has enabled consistent financial performance and shareholder returns and that's continuing this year. We also have a strong balance sheet. We're committed to an investment-grade credit rating and we've always maintained lower leverage than most of our industry peers. With consistent cash flow and a solid balance sheet, we continue to have plenty of cash to reinvest in the business, as well as to distribute to shareholders. While our dividend has always been compelling, it's especially compelling right now, relative to the alternatives that investors might consider. Amcor is certainly not immune from the impacts of COVID-19 and we've not been spared by any means but we're relatively well-positioned to navigate the challenges. I'll touch briefly on Slide 10 on what we've seen over the last few months. We try to run the company for the long-term, and we focus on one year at a time, so we normally discuss results on a year-to-date basis. But clearly, it's an unusual time and we appreciate the need and the interest in some more insights on recent trading activity and so that's what we've got here on Slide 10. The key message on the slide here is thus far, we've seen no material impact on our financial results that we can directly attribute to COVID-19. We're a global company with balanced exposure across North America, Europe and the emerging markets. We've seen plenty of puts and takes on volume, especially across regions and categories. Ultimately, sales in the third quarter were in line with the long-term averages that we've seen in the business. There have been no real cost impacts so no real material impacts on the financials for the company so far. The results for the third quarter were in line with our expectations. Now, Slide 10 lays out what we've seen using volume growth for the third quarter and you see the positives and negatives across the global portfolio. Overall volume growth for Amcor was about 2% in the quarter, 1% in our flexible segment, 5% in rigid packaging. We had good volume growth in North America for beverage packaging, as well as flexible packaging where in flexibles, North America represents about one-third of our sales in that segment. Another third of sales in the flexibles segment is in Europe and volumes increased by about 1% in the quarter. Then the other third in the flexible segment would be in Latin America, Asia and especially cartons. Those sales for the quarter we're down low to mid-single digits. By end-market, healthcare continues to grow well around the world. It's obviously a pickup at homecare and protein packaging had a good quarter. On the other hand, anything that does go through the convenience channel, or on-premise of which is very small part of our portfolio was a bit softer. More recently, in April, we didn't see many changes, but Latin American volumes and all of our businesses in that region were very soft, and beverage packaging volumes in North America were also weaker given that package is often sold through the convenience channel. Other than in the most obvious cases, it's quite difficult to quantify with any degree of precision exactly what the COVID impact on those volumes has been but all up at about 2% volume growth, the results were consistent with our longer term averages. So the key takeaway here is that we remain relatively well-positioned and resilient. Let me pass the call over to Michael to discuss the financials in more detail. Michael Casamento : Thanks, Ron. Good morning and good evening, everyone. Beginning with a summary of our results on Slide 12, the business has delivered strong year-to-date earnings growth, which reflects a healthy balance of synergies and organic growth. Sales are in line with the prior period excluding unfavorable effects and raw material pass-through impacts. Year-to-date EBIT was up 7% in constant currency terms, with growth in both segments contributing to the double-digit EBIT growth delivered by the Amcor Group in third quarter. Net income and EPS were up by 13% and 14%, respectively, and free cash flow of $360 million within line without expectations and significantly higher than last year. Very strong cash flows have enabled us to return more than $1 billion to shareholders through three year-to-date quarterly dividend payments and share repurchases. The board remains committed to a sustainable and compelling dividend, declaring a quarterly dividend of $0.115 per share to be paid in June. Moving to the flexible segment on Slide 13, year-to-date sales were 0.7% lower than the prior period in constant currency terms and excluding a negative impact provided to the past to have lower raw material costs. This reflects solid low single-digit volume growth in flexibles, Europe and North America across a range of high-value health care, food and home care products, partly offset by weaker demand in China and India through the third quarter. We've previously highlighted business and periodic specific challenges in the flexibles Latin America and especially cartons business and we're encouraged to see the sequential volume improvements we anticipated during the month quarter. Year-to-date adjusted EBIT grew 11% in constant currency terms and margin expansion of 150 basis points reflects growing synergy benefits as we move through the year and strong cost performance. Overall, we're really pleased with the way the flexibles business is performing. Especially so given we've been able to leverage the unique position created through the Bemis acquisition covered on Slide 14. First, there is momentum in the acquired Bemis business, which is evident in the strong year-to-date results in North America. Second, the integration is mostly complete and the teams have come together incredibly well to operate as one and support our customers through the COVID crisis. As Ron mentioned, the timing of synergy benefits is ahead of expectations and we are on track to deliver $80 million in fiscal 2020 and $190 million by the end of FY 2022. Turning to rigid packaging on Slide 15; in line with expectations, adjusted EBIT grew 4% in the March quarter with growth in both North America and Latin America. On a year-to-date basis, earnings were lower given the unusually strong comparison in the first half. Overall year-to-date sales were 2.2% higher than the prior period in constant currency terms, after excluding a 3.6% and favorable impact from passing on low raw material costs, which reflects volume growth partially offset by unfavorable price mix. In North America, beverage volumes were 1.7% higher with 5% growth in hospital container volumes. The overall North American non-alcoholic beverage market continues to grow at a modest rate, in line with long-term trends. Importantly as you see on the slide, consumption in PET format has remained stable after taking into account quarterly seasonality. In Latin America volumes grew 3.4%. It's worth noting that volumes in both regions have slowed noticeably through the month of April impacted by low demand through convenience store and on the go channels as people are restricted from moving around during lockdowns. During the month, volumes in North America were down around 5% to 7% compared with last year, and in Latin America, were down around 12%. While the trajectory from here is difficult to predict, we have assumed volumes will remain soft through the balance of the June quarter. This has been taken into account in our revised four-year outlook which I'll come back to shortly. Turning to cash flow on Slide 16; year-to-date adjusted free cash flow of $367 million increased significantly compared with last year. This is consistent with expected seasonality given cash generation is always weighted seasonally to our fourth quarter when EBITDA is the strongest and when we say working capital benefits peak. Most importantly, we remain on track to deliver more than $1 billion across the current financial year. We've continued to focus on working capital and we measure progress through the working capital and the sales ratio. On this measure over the last nine months, we have released the equivalent of more than $90 million of cash on an annualized run rate through a 70 basis point reduction in the ratio. In this current environment, we've taken a prudent approach to non-essential expenditure. However, the overall strength and reliability of cash generation for our business means we remain in a position to invest and to maintain a strong and investment-grade balance sheet as shown on Slide 17. We have an investment-grade credit rating and our balance sheet metric is strong, including leverage at 3.1x at the end of the third quarter. This is where we expect it to be given quarterly seasonality of cash flows and is in line with last year's 3.1x. As has consistently been the case over many years, we expect leverage will fall in the fourth quarter with FY20, estimated to close at around 2.8x. We have less than 2% of our drawn debts facilities maturing within the next 12 months and we also have ample liquidity of $1.9 billion should the need arise. The key message here is our strong balance sheet and cash flow means we have flexibility to meet the needs of our business and to continue our legacy of paying a compelling dividend while maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating. Turning to Slide 18, the highlights of our outlook for the financial year ending June 30, 2020. As shown, we expect heightened levels of uncertainty and volatility will continue in the broader environment. This means there are additional challenges with regard to estimating future results. However, the business has delivered strong year-to-date results. We have visibility through the month of April and have assumed that we and our business partners are able to continue operating plants with minimal disruption. Taking these factors into account, we are confident the business will deliver our increased EPS growth range in constant currency terms of 11% to 12% and be able to deliver over $1 billion in free cash flow before dividend and cash integration costs. So in summary, we believe we are on track to close out a strong first year following the Bemis acquisition and return significant capital back to shareholders. With that, I'll hand back over to you Ron. Ron Delia : Thanks, Michael. Just turning to Slide 20 and looking beyond the end of fiscal year 2020 at a time of lots of uncertainty and volatility, we continue to have good clear visibility to controllable sources of shareholder value in the near-term. We've touched on each of these already, but we expect continued defensive organic growth for our food and healthcare packaging, additional cost synergies from the Bemis acquisition. We'll deliver $80 million by the end of this year and expect another $100 million over the next two years, continued payment of a compelling dividend, especially in this low-interest-rate environment and the EPS benefit of having bought back over 3% of our shares this year. In longer term, Amcor's capital allocation framework has not changed and as we saw earlier, over the last five or six years, the model for shareholder value creation has delivered an average of 12% per year of combined EPS growth and dividend yield, and that will be higher this year. Before we close off our opening remarks today, I want to touch briefly on our best long-term organic growth opportunity, which is around sustainability. Sustainability, as it relates to consumer packaging, touches on a number of things that have become increasingly important to consumers around the world, including waste and pollution and greenhouse gas emissions and global warming, all-important issues that aren't going to go away despite the immediate focus right now on COVID. So two points to emphasize today; the first point as Slide 21 makes clear is that when it comes to these consumer needs and sustainability concerns, we believe the answer is responsible packaging, not no packaging or misinformed packaging. Responsible packaging requires a total system solution. First, mark design that takes into account environmental impacts through the product lifecycle. That means packaging that's recyclable, reusable or compostable, made from recycled materials and using less material in the first place. Second, the right waste management infrastructure needs to be in place whether that's recycling or composting facilities or returnable systems. Finally, consumer participation is critical to properly dispose of packaging in an appropriate way. The second sustainability point today is on Slide 22. Amcor is uniquely positioned to make a difference here and capture the opportunity and we're fully committed and continuing to invest. This is not a new topic for us. We've been fully committed for several years now. We first made our aspirations public two and a half years ago with our 2025 pledge, and again in August last year, we committed to invest $50 million to accelerate our sustainability agenda. While we're dealing with the pandemic, like everyone else, sustainability has and will continue to be in focus for Amcor. Just to close off and summarize on Slide 23, clearly, volatile times, challenging times for everyone. Amcor is not immune or any different but we are well-positioned in demonstrating resilience. We've delivered strong results so far this year and we've increased guidance for the second time. The Bemis acquisition is ahead of our first year expectations. We have clear visibility to shareholder returns in the near and longer term. Of course, one more thank you to any of our employees who might be listening in today. So with that, operator, we'd like to open up the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Ghansham Panjabi : Hey guys, good day to you and I hope everybody's doing well. I guess first off, Ron, for the regions that benefited from a COVID related volume increase, if you will, is order flow starting to normalize as we're now in May and consumers have basically had time to cycle past the initial pantry loading with demand starting to mirror closer to consumption trends? Then related to that Bemis on a legacy basis has a decent amount of exposure towards meat, just given the meaningful meat production disruptions in the U.S. is that a risk for what would -- it's a high margin category for the industry. Ron Delia : Well, maybe I'll take the second one first if I can. The meat business in North America is a big important part, but it's about 20% of the North American flexible sales. As a proportion of Amcor, it's low single-digit percentage. We really haven't seen significant disruptions in that segment. We've had some ebbs and flows in volume but no real shutdowns despite the challenges that have been well documented and that continues. One of the things that is a real advantage for us in that segment or will be longer term is the film technology in that business really lends itself to more automated meatpacking processes and more automation in those facilities going forward. Some of those plants are quite labor-intensive, as you've seen and so we think in the medium to longer term that's going to bode well for growth but in here and now no major disruptions and generally robust volume. The first part of your question was about trends. Look, I think the key message from us today is we didn't see much overall across the whole business that seems to have been impacted by COVID. We obviously see some areas where things grew better than we might expect, 4% volume growth in North America is a couple of percentage points higher than we'd expect but not astronomical. In a business like Europe, which is just as big, we saw volume growth of 1%, which is, again, sort of normal. And then obviously in China, in January and February, we had had a decline. India was shut in March. So there is really puts and takes. April has continued largely in the flexible space along the same lines. I think, as Michael alluded to Rigid's volumes have slowed a bit and everything in Latin America has slowed in April, but generally speaking, if we look across the entire portfolio, there's not much material change. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay, that's helpful. Then so just related to that, Ron, on the EPS increase of, let's say, $0.02 at the midpoint excluding FX, can you help bridge that for us year-over-year? Lower interest costs looks like it will sum to roughly half of that. Is the rest from just better volume than you thought initially or is it also due to lower raw material costs? Ron Delia : You've got it, interest less tax -- interest and tax net is about half and then the rest is just the good organic performance of the business. We've seen momentum building in the base business throughout the year. We saw this in February and raised our guidance then and we've continued to see it through the third quarter. Volume is a part but we've had really good margin performance generally in the businesses. If you look in flexibles we've got like 150 basis points of EBIT margin expansion. Some of that synergy related but some of it is just good performance in the base business as well and the mix has been healthy with good healthcare sales and some other segments so it's a combination. Ghansham Panjabi : Sorry, on the raw material fees, is that incremental benefit. Ron Delia : Not so much so far. Look where Roz go from here with oil hitting the lows that it hit in late March and April we'll see but in the third quarter, we had a few million dollars of benefited similar to the first half where we saw about $4 million, $5 million per quarter. We were at about that pace in the third quarter as well. Ghansham Panjabi : Perfect. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Larry Gandler with Credit Suisse. Larry Gandler : Thanks, guys. Hope everybody's doing well. My question just is about the cash flow run. Looks like given the nine months cash flow of 470 and your guidance of over a billion, it's going to rain cash in the fourth quarter. Just wondering if you can talk to whether both Rigid's and flexibles generate significant cash in that fourth quarter and talk to that cash seasonality. Michael Casamento : I'll take this one, Larry. Thanks for the question. Look, we're really pleased to feel the cash flow is year-to-date. It's meaningfully better than the prior year and it's in line with our expectations based on the usual seasonality. Looking at the prior year, there's a couple of areas on that we've had, obviously, a lot higher earnings, which is a positive, and also really a good working capital performance. As I mentioned in my notes, we look at the working capital sales ratio, and that's reduced from 10.7% at June 30, to around 10% now, which is a meaningful improvement across the year-to-date. We're right on track to deliver the $1 billion in cash flow we talked about before dividends and typically our quarter four is always the strongest cash flow quarter, and that's for a few reasons. Firstly, Q4 is our highest earnings quarter for the year so typically you're $100 million better EBITDA in Q4 than any of the other three quarters. So probably that adds to the cash flow. Inventory cycle we tend to build imagery leading into the pig season, particularly in Rigid's and then in Q4, when it's done well, we draw that down so we benefit from that. We're going to see continued benefits from the working capital sales ratio particularly coming out of the Bemis acquisition so we've seen some benefit there. Then obviously, as we head into year-end, we have a strong focus on working capital and it tends to lead to a stronger rally than some of the other quarters. Overall, we feel good about the position and it comes generally across the board. Larry Gandler : Okay. Just to follow on to that largest -- Q4 being the largest EBIT quarter of the year. With the volume weakness you're seeing in Rigid's, is there any concern about sort of negative operating leverage, perhaps chewing into those earnings and cash flow? Michael Casamento : As we said in the comment flow, we've seen some softness in Rigid's volumes in April. We've factored that into our guidance for the full year. That's also factored into the cash flow guidance so we feel good about where we're at. Obviously, COVID has some other variability that we've also talked about that where we are right now we feel okay with where we're at. Larry Gandler : Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Brook Campbell-Crawford with JP Morgan. Brook Campbell-Crawford: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple for me. First on Rigid's restructuring, just a couple of comments if you could, just around where you're on that cost program and when we should start to see benefits long-term. Ron Delia : We're still going through that. We've benefited I think about $10 million or $15 million so far. There's another $5 million to $10 million to go, which will come next year. There's a couple more plants to close, which will happen after the high season at the end of the North American Summer so you'll see benefits in 2021 from the final plant closures in that program, which was announced a couple of years ago. Brook Campbell-Crawford: Okay, understood, then just on flexible's in the 10-Q for the quarter, for the March quarter looks like price mix was a bit of an issue there 4% headwind to EBIT. Just back could you step through there what the issue was with price mix for that business? Ron Delia : It's mostly mixed. I think it's probably because we've got some weaker sales in Latin America as we flagged and especially cartons. Those are the businesses where sales have been weaker. I think mix tends to be lots of different things. I think we'll probably get back to you on that one, Brook, because the business is growing nicely in some of the better segments around healthcare and meat. The offset will be in Latin America and in especially cartoons. Brook Campbell-Crawford: Okay, I understand. I'll follow up. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes rolling in Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Brian Maguire : Hey, good morning, guys. Good afternoon, depending on where you are. Just wanted to follow up on that last question on pricing trends in general. I think in the prepared remarks, you might have said that price mix was a little bit negative in Rigid's. With the volumes, it seems like some regions' volumes are growing a little bit faster now than other regions. On a segment basis, it seems like the trend is consistent like you said with the long-term trends but seen some divergence between segments. So just wondering how that's affecting mix and then if you could just kind of comment on overall industry pricing in the current environment. Are people being aggressive trying to pass through some of the deflationary benefits? Or if there is any changes in competitive behavior you can ascertain. Ron Delia : On the last one no changes in competitive behavior. I think the whole supply chain is focused on just keeping our plants running, whether you're an upstream raw material supplier or a downstream customer or retailer. I think what we've seen is reprioritization in a number of different dimensions towards just sustaining operations. So no change in competitive dynamic and certainly no change in pricing. I don't think there's any real commercial discussions happening in our supply chain right now anyway. As far as Mexico is, I think it's a 90 day period so there's a lot of moving parts. I would say in flexibles, you see the mixed benefits flowing through in the margin expansion. We're doing really well in healthcare this year, have been for several periods now; medical and pharmaceutical packaging growing well, protein packaging, which was flagged earlier, despite some of the pressure on issues in the U.S. which have been more recent that business continues to grow well. So generally speaking, the mix has been positive. Brian McGuire : Okay. And just on the margins, flexibles look like the EBIT margin stepped down a little bit from 2Q despite I would guess, a little bit more Bemis synergy capture there, just wondering if there's anything that would drive some differences in the margins between the 2Q and 3Q? And what's sort of the outlook for the margins in that business in the rest of the year? Ron Delia : Brian, quite frankly, we wouldn't really look at the margins on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We'd be thinking about the full year. I think on a year-to-date basis, the margins have stepped up quite substantially, and we'd expect that to continue. Brian McGuire : Okay, this last one for me. Just wondering if you're, in fact, working capital and cash flow, just wondering if in this environment, you're seeing customers look to extend their payment terms or, you know, suppliers asking for payment a little bit quicker, if just trade terms are something to be concerned about? And if you think you can kind of hold a line on those? Michael Casamento : I can take that one, Brian. Look, I mean, we haven't seen any near-term stress from our customers who, you know, like I said, typically well placed from essential products, expected to deal with a situation like COVID. And I think having said that, we really continue to stay focused on our working capital management, which includes the customer collections and supply term, so we haven't really seen too much on that front right now. Brian McGuire : Okay, thanks very much. Operator : And your next question comes from line of John Purtell with Macquarie. John Purtell : Good morning, guys. How are you? Ron Delia : Hey, John. John Purtell : Just have a couple of questions, just firstly, obviously you highlighted Rigid\u2019s weakness in April and likely extending into May or June but you've lifted your overall guidance for the year on EPS terms, so it does imply outperformance in flexibles. I think you sort of provided some detail there, but essentially is that outperformance coming from, you know, the big developed markets in flexibles, North America or in Europe and you've called out healthcare as well? Just trying to understand where, I suppose, the offset is, if you want, versus Rigid\u2019s. Ron Delia : Yes, look, Rigid\u2019s is softer in April as we flagged, I mean, it's functioning well. I think it's a week by week story in volumes when you're talking about consumer -- convenience channel business, which is where the weaknesses in North America. And Latin America is really related to the pandemic. In flexibles, we've had good momentum in North America, good momentum in Europe, building throughout the year. The Asia business weathered the storm early in late January and February but has built momentum as well. So we expect them to have a good fourth quarter. The cartons business also has built some momentum after a tough Q2 in particular. And so really at least Latin American in flexibles is the question mark, but generally speaking across the rest of the segment, we have seen and continue to see good momentum. John Purtell : And just picking up on Latin American flexibles, obviously, you've indicated payments as a head of your first year expectations sort of overall but where does LATAM now stand for in terms of what was a disappointing start with some loss of market share? Ron Delia : Yes, that look that business notwithstanding, you know, the last couple of weeks and the pandemic impacts has been building momentum as well. And so we've sequentially improved profit in that business in each quarter. I think we flagged that at the end of Fiscal \u201819, our fiscal fourth quarter, the business actually had a modest loss. We started to make money again by July and August, and having had profit in the first quarter, second quarter, even more so, the third quarter was better again. So despite the softness that we're currently seeing, the business has generated incrementally more profit in each quarter; and so we're on the right track there. And I think operationally and from a cost perspective, the steps that we took in July and August last year, and the headcount reductions put us in a good position. I think the customer relationships have been solidified. And we had seen some better volume trends and better comps on sales period over period in January and February than we've seen in the first half of the year, and even March. So, now I think we're dealing with maybe the last major region in the world to go through the pandemic and that's where the softness is coming from now, but generally speaking, we would say that businesses has progressed throughout the year in line, maybe even a bit ahead of expectations. John Purtell : Thank you. And just the last one, just to clarify response from an earlier question, just in terms of flexibles, you haven't seen, or you wouldn't characterize it being a significant portfolio of demand in the quarter. So there's going to be an evening out there, you sort of see these trends in terms of at home consumption being sort of enduring? Ron Delia : Well, if we look at the whole segment, we had pretty modest growth of 1% across the board, and we spelled out on the slide there some of the puts and takes. I think, you know, 1% or 2% buying growth is what you'd expect to see in this business. And in the first half, we had some challenges in Latin America and in cartons in particular, which had us a bit softer than that, but generally speaking, 1% or 2% is what you'd expect and that's sort of where we're at. John Purtell : Okay, thank you. Ron Delia : Thanks, John. Operator : And your next question comes from line of Richard Johnson with Jefferies. Ron Delia : Richard? Richard Johnson : Can you hear me? Ron Delia : I can now. Richard Johnson : Apologies, for the terrible echoes, but if you can\u2019t hear me, just shut. I just want to reference slide 8, and ask a question in general about emerging markets. I know you've touched on this individually across or at times through the presentation. But it looks like proportionately EMs dropped quite materially through the year. And I just want to check is that an error that you've got Australia and New Zealand in there? So if I adjusted that out, it would have come back even more. So the question really is, can you talk or give a bit more color about EM in general? You talked about China and India, but I'm trying to get a sense of where else the weaknesses has been? Ron Delia : Yes, let\u2019s -- answer the first question, as know that emerging markets portfolio or percentage of sales for emerging markets has not changed through the year with Bemis, we are waiting towards EMs, went down a few percentage points. I think maybe 2 or 3 percentage points overall, but that hasn't changed. Generally speaking, look, I think we've talked enough about Latin America, Asia has been relatively robust this year, save for the late January-February period in China where things obviously were quite soft, although bounced back quite quickly in March, India in March was short essentially. So we had a very soft month in India. But to that point, for the first eight months of the year, we had very strong growth in India and the rest of Southeast Asia. And then, Eastern Europe has been softer in cartons, but pretty robust in food and personal care in the flexible side. So it's a mixed bag like it always is across the EMs, but there's still a substantial part of the business and still an area where we expect to get this proportionate growth going forward. Richard Johnson : So just to clarify, is that divide is worth $3 billion as a proportionate $13 billion, that's 23%. That's significantly lower than what it was. So is that just rounding? And if I take Australian and New Zealand data goes down even further. So you started the year at 27% in EM, but -- and perhaps we can take this offline, I just want to clarify with the right number. Ron Delia : Let's pick it offline, Richard. The percentage in the EMs is in the high 20% in the high 20s. Richard Johnson : Okay. Maybe [indiscernible], okay. And then, just a couple, and then just -- I just want to go back to John's question around flexibles in Europe. Can I just double-check that you haven't lost any share there? Because given the trading backdrop, you know, it wouldn't have been unusual if you've done plenty [ph] more than what trend is -- which is perhaps a note to 1% volume growth? Ron Delia : Now, I think in the quarter, you have to remember that Europe was pretty hard hit by this pandemic in many countries in the beginning of March. And so we had probably as much of an impact in, probably the end of February or early March in parts of Europe as we had in Asia. So yes, you had some stronger sales towards the end of the quarter. But in the middle of the quarter there and France and Spain and Italy, parts of Germany, even Switzerland, we saw a pretty dramatic slowdown for a week or two. Richard Johnson : Got it, that's helpful. Thanks. And then, just finally, for Michael, Michael, your interest guidance dropped by nearly 20% through the year, so I'm just trying to understand what the main moving parts are because that's a pretty big change through the nine months? Michael Casamento : Well, Richard, at the start of the year, we were expecting interest rates to increase, particularly through the U.S. And obviously that didn't happen and more recently, obviously, the more recent reduction in guidance we've put through is really on the back of the U.S. one month libel, I mean, it's dropped nearly 2% in, you know, a month or two. So, you know, if you think about our debt portfolio on the fixed and floating rates and where our mix of currencies are, it\u2019s pretty easy to understand that the interest cost is going to come down. Richard Johnson : Got it. Thanks. That's it for me. Good luck. Michael Casamento : Thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal. Mark Wilde : Good evening, Ron. Ron Delia : Hey, Mark. Mark Wilde : I wondered, Ron, just to start out that 4% volume in North American flexibles is one of the strongest numbers I can recall in years for Bemis or even any of the peers, any kind of particular things you would point to there, behind that growth? Ron Delia : Look Mark, I think it's what you've -- what you've seen on, you know, all over the TV and the media. It's been well documented. I think the U.S. consumer tends to pantry load like no one else, and so sales were particularly strong in March. I think the business actually had reasonable sales in the first half. So we would have been in the low single digits, which is probably building on -- building a bit of momentum over where the business had been the last several years. So we probably started from a bit higher base, and then picked up a few more points -- a couple more points of growth in the third quarter. Really across the board, healthcare, and we keep coming back to it, but healthcare has been strong throughout the year, but in the protein segment in homecare, in packaged beverages, powdered beverages, etcetera; we had pretty good growth across the board. Mark Wilde : Okay. And would you say that this is like just better growth from kind of a lot of the old kind of benchmark brands that Bemis had focused on historically? Are you also getting any benefit from this effort they'd had over the last few years to try to diversify their customer base and get down with some of the smaller faster growing brands? Ron Delia : Look, I think they're doing -- the business has done a really good job in that space. So, I'd say the growth in the quarter and probably the growth throughout this fiscal year since we've owned the business has been equal parts, growth with larger customers and in the healthcare space as well as good traction with the smaller customers as well as it is with our rigid packaging business where we also have, and have had for a number of years, concerted effort to tap into that smaller end of the market. So it's across the board. Mark Wilde : Okay. Any kind of lessons or kind of clues that you take from what you've seen in China and elsewhere in Asia, in terms of what you might expect in terms of recovery in Europe and now in North America from the COVID situation? Ron Delia : Well, the biggest lessons that we were able to benefit from in Asia were just how to deal with the situation operationally. So in China, obviously in February, we had disruptions in a number of sites. We learned pretty quickly about the protocols to get sites up and running and protect sites, everything from how to set up printing line to ensure physical distancing to how to process hundreds of employees through temperature checks and PPE. All of that we learned through the 11 plants we have in China and the experience they went through in the earlier part of the quarter, and those lessons then were built out in Europe and carry through to Northern America and Latin America. So operationally, would be the big lessons learned. From a consumer perspective, you know, the consumers are quite different. Generally speaking, though our business is very defensive, and it's exposed to the same segments in China as it is elsewhere in the world. It's food, it's personal care, it's pharmaceutical and medical packaging. And those segments just tend to be quite resilient and defensive. So it's been more on the operational side, where we've benefited from the learnings. Mark Wilde : Okay, last one, for me, is it possible to get some sense of what the tobacco volumes are doing kind of year-over-year? Ron Delia : Look, the industry itself declines 2% or 3% a year and some of the customers do a great job of laying all that out. And I think they would say that the global demand in units declines 2% to 3% a year and then you have short-term periods where either there's inventory builds which provide an offset or you might have an excise tax in a major market, which builds on that decline. Our volumes would look similar from that perspective; and then, the offset for the packaging is outside of North America in particular. The complexity of the packaging is quite extensive, and so there's a mix and a complexity offset that drives the sales at a bit higher rate than the volumes. Mark Wilde : Okay, very good. I'll turn it over. Good luck in the last quarter of the year. Ron Delia : Thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Nathan Reilly with UBS. Nathan Reilly : Just a couple of questions from me. Firstly, Ron, did I hear you say that you'd seen no significant change in cost for the manufacturing costs or otherwise so far during the third quarter? And if so, is that sustainable through the fourth quarter? I'm just wondering you\u2019re at around sort of increase of hygiene standards, social distancing. I guess there's an offset there with things like lower travel costs and whatnot? So just try to get a better picture of that. Ron Delia : Yes. Now look, that's exactly right. I mean, there's no material cost changes that impacted our financial performance one way or the other, or that we expect to in the fourth quarter. There's definitely puts and takes, you know, obviously there's increased costs around cleaning and disinfecting and extra PP&E, and things like that. We have not seen yet any substantial increases in any inputs or freight or anything like that. So those are bigger cost items, and we haven't seen any real material change in those items. And then there are offsets, as you said, you know, there's generally no travel, no one at Amcor is traveling at the moment, and you just have generally less expense in that side of things. So, puts and takes but no material cost change. Nathan Reilly : Got it understood. And finally, just on your R&D plans. I'm just wondering, the shifts we're seeing in consumer behavior, prompting a rethink on some of the R&D investment. And I guess I'm also wondering if this shift to the online channel, in particular, just create some packaging redesign conversations with customers? Ron Delia : Yes, look, it's a really good question. Our view internally and in the discussions we've had with our customers is that the things that we have been prioritizing before this pandemic are still the things that are going to be important when we get to the other side of it, so particularly around sustainability. Bearing in mind that our investments in that space are just core to what we're doing, we're making packaging, to make that packaging recyclable is going to satisfy a need that we're all confident is going to be there on the other side of the situation that we're in now. On e-commerce, clearly there's a lot of sales of grocery and food products going through e-commerce right now and the online channel. We, at the moment, supply the same sort of packaging for the most part for that channel as we do through regular retail. Over time, gradually our customers are developing omni-channel packaging or e-commerce specific packaging, but those things take time, and that will continue. If anything, we'd expect that to accelerate, but in the here and now, that's not impacting our R&D agenda for the next let's say quarter two. Nathan Reilly : Okay, thanks for that. Operator : And that is the last question we do have time for. I'll now turn it back over to the speaker to end the call. Ron Delia : Okay, operator, well, it looks like there are no further questions. Again, we thank everybody for joining us at different hours in different parts of the world and we'll end the call there. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Tracey Whitehead, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Tracey Whitehead : Thank you, operator, and welcome everyone to Amcor\u2019s 2020 full year results call. Joining the call today is Ron Delia, Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Casamento, Chief Financial Officer. At this time, I\u2019ll direct you to our website, amcor.com, under the Investors section where you\u2019ll find our press release and presentation, which will be discussed on the call today. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures as we talk about performance against combined comparative information. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures can be found in the press release and presentation on our website. Also, a reminder that statements regarding future performance of the company made during this call, are forward-looking and subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ from historical, expected or predicted results due to a variety of reasons. Please refer to Amcor\u2019s SEC filings, including our statement on Form 10-K and 10-Q to review these factors. With that, I will turn it over to Ron. Ron Delia : Thanks, Tracey and thanks everyone for being with us today to discuss Amcor\u2019s full year results. We acknowledge it\u2019s early in the morning for those in the U.S. and on the evening for those in Australia, so we appreciate you\u2019re making the effort to join the call. Joining me on the line today, as Tracey mentioned, is Michael Casamento, Amcor\u2019s CFO and we will begin with some brief prepared remarks and then open the line for Q&A. We will start with safety, which is where we start every meeting. Safety is value at Amcor, and our employees\u2019 well-being has always been a top priority for us. Of course, safety has taken on an even higher level of prominence this year, not only given the need to work through a COVID-19 environment, but also as we\u2019ve been integrating the largest acquisition in the company\u2019s history. Against this backdrop, one of the highlights for us in fiscal 2020 was our safety performance. Across Amcor, we had 10% fewer injuries compared to the prior year, and over half of our sites were injury-free for at least 12 months. Now that magnitude of improvement, especially in this environment, can\u2019t be achieved without dedication, commitment and focus, and our coworkers demonstrated all of those qualities consistently through the year. Safety, health and well-being will continue to be our first priority in 2021 as we continue to manage through and navigate further complexity and uncertainty related to COVID-19. Early on, we established three guiding principles and implemented a number of new protocols focused on keeping our employees healthy, keeping our plants running so we can continue to supply packaging for essential food, beverage and health care products, and then contributing more broadly to the communities in which we operate as they navigate the fallout from the pandemic. We are really proud that our business has demonstrated great resilience through the period, and the ability to continue playing a vital role in the supply chain of essential consumer products, without interruption, has been a source of great pride for our employees. Their care, passion and dedication has been nothing short of inspiring. And we can\u2019t thank them enough for rising to the challenges of this current environment. Moving on now to the key messages we have for today on Slide 5, first and foremost, we delivered an outstanding result across multiple dimensions, despite unprecedented market conditions and while integrating a transformational acquisition. Along the way, the resilient, defensive nature of our end markets was evident, and execution against the things we can control was outstanding. Our second key message is that the Bemis integration is progressing ahead of initial expectations, and the benefits we anticipated from the acquisition were increasingly evident throughout the year. We made excellent progress on delivery of cost synergies in this first year, and performance across the combined Flexibles businesses is building momentum. Third, we have clear line of sight to controllable drivers of growth in the near-term and expect another strong year in fiscal \u201821. Fourth, sustainability remains our most exciting long-term growth opportunity, and we continue to make strong meaningful progress throughout the year. And lastly, we remain well positioned to deliver strong value for shareholders over the long-term regardless of macroeconomic conditions. Turning now to a summary of our financial results on Slide 6, overall, the business delivered strong financial numbers in fiscal 2020, better than expectations and ahead of the upgraded guidance we issued in May. EPS was up 13% on a constant currency basis and was driven by solid organic growth, cost synergies and a reduction in shares outstanding resulting from a buyback completed during the year. Free cash flow of $1.2 billion was up 26% year-over-year, while we continue to invest in the business and increase our dividend. Sales were in line with the prior year, excluding the unfavorable raw material pass-through impact. And EBIT was up 7%, including double-digit growth in the Flexibles segment, which also had over 5% organic growth in addition to cost synergies. And one of the most important highlights for the year was the ability of our teams to execute and outperform against the controllables at a time when the external environment was clearly less predictable. I mentioned safety earlier, but working capital management was also exceptional. And we had outstanding cost performance in all of the Amcor businesses. And we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the Bemis acquisition after 1 year, which is ahead of our original plan. Slide 7 provides some of the key highlights related to the Bemis acquisition, and it\u2019s worth pausing on three points. First, the integration and synergy capture are ahead of expectations. The two businesses came together quickly during the first 100 days, and essentially, all of the integration activities were completed within the first 12 months and that efficient integration enabled even greater focus on synergies. And we delivered $80 million of cost synergies in fiscal \u201820, almost 30% of our initial expectations. We anticipate an additional $50 million to $70 million in FY \u201821, and we\u2019re well on our way to delivering $180 million by FY \u201822, the third year post acquisition. Second, in addition to synergy benefits, we acquired a high-quality, well-invested business, which has already contributed to strong organic margin expansion and returns for the Flexibles segment of more than 15%. And the third point on Bemis is that it\u2019s clear the acquisition is already delivering longer-term strategic benefits. Most importantly, we have a strengthened customer value proposition from our expanded global footprint and best-in-class innovation capabilities, and we\u2019ve also increased our exposure to high-value segments like protein and health care, both of which grew well above the rest of the business last year. So all-in-all, we are pleased with the way the two companies have come together, with return on investment tracking ahead of expectations after year one and the long-term potential becoming clearer every day. Before I hand over to Michael, just a word on value created for shareholders in FY \u201820 against the framework we\u2019ve been using for several years now. We generated very strong cash flow in FY \u201820, which helped support $1.2 billion of cash returns to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. And our board remains committed to a competitive and progressive dividend and today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.115 per share, which will be paid in September and which brings the total dividend for the full year to $0.46 per share. But through a combination of organic growth, acquisition synergies and buyback benefits, EPS growth was 13%, and the dividend yield was about 4%. So, total shareholder value created during the year was 17%, well above our long-term average of about 12%. To go a bit beyond those highlights, I\u2019ll turn it over to Michael now for some more detail on fiscal 2020. Michael Casamento : Thanks, Ron and hi everyone. I will start with a few comments specifically related to COVID-19 and what we have seen over the last two quarters. The key message on this slide is aligned with what we discussed at the end of our March quarter. Overall, we have seen no material impact on our financial results that we could directly attribute to COVID-19. Amcor is a global company with balanced exposures across North America, Europe and the emerging markets. And although we\u2019ve seen plenty of puts and takes across regions and end markets, the low single-digit volume growth achieved across the group in the second half is consistent with the long-term average range we would expect from the business. We operated our plants with minimal disruption during this period and did so without incurring significant cost impacts, so our financial results have also remained in line with expectations. As we did in the March quarter, Slide 9 lays out the positives and negatives across the global portfolio in our second half. We have seen good volume growth in North America, Europe and Asia, with weaker volumes in Latin America and volumes comparable to last year in the global specialty cartons business. By end market, categories like hygiene, health care, protein and pet care have all performed quite well, while there have been pockets of weakness in areas like confectionery and in convenience around premise channels. The business has also experienced a heightened level of month-to-month volatility than we would typically see in a 6-month period. Most recently, April was a good volume month overall despite soft volumes in Latin America and beverage packaging volumes in North America. May was softer in most areas. And since then, we have seen good improvements in June in most regions, with growth continuing into July. The key takeaway is that we remain relatively well-positioned and resilient, with volume growth over the last 6 months continue \u2013 consistent with our long-term average. Moving to the Flexibles segment on Slide 10, full year sales were in line with last year in constant currency terms and excluding the impact from passing through lower raw material costs. Overall, segment volumes were marginally higher than the prior year. This reflects consistent low single-digit volume growth in developed markets, such as Europe and North America, and higher volumes in the Asian emerging markets, where we saw good momentum towards the end of the fourth quarter in China and India, in particular. We are encouraged to see the sequential volume improvements continued in Flexibles Latin America and cartons during the second half of the year, in part due to the initiatives we have taken to simplify these businesses and lower operating costs. Adjusted EBIT for the year grew 10% in constant currency terms, with more than half of that growth coming from organic sources. This was driven by a combination of positive mix with growth weighted towards a range of high-value products, such as coffee, healthcare and protein, along with strong cost and operating performance across the business. The remaining 4.6% growth was driven by delivery of cost synergy benefits, which Ron referred to earlier. So overall, we are really pleased with the way the Flexibles business is performing and the unique position we have as a result of the Bemis acquisition. Turning to Rigid Packaging on Slide 11, in line with expectations, adjusted EBIT grew 3% in the second half of fiscal 2020 compared with the second half of the prior year, reflecting strong cost performance in a variable demand environment. On a full year basis, earnings were lower given the unusually strong comparison in the second quarter last year. Full year sales were 0.7% lower than last year in constant currency terms and excluding a 4.1% unfavorable impact related to the pass-through of lower raw material costs. In North America, full year volumes were 0.2% lower than prior year, with hot fill container volumes up 1%, and growth continued to be weighted towards our regional business unit, which services smaller customers. Volume in the Specialty Container business were higher than last year, particularly in the second half, with strong growth across each of the spirits, home and personal care, food and health care end markets. And in Latin America, annual volumes grew close to 0.5%, with strength in Central America and Colombia, offset by weakness in Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. So overall, we were pleased with the resilience of the business in the fourth quarter in light of the volume challenges and with the business now well-positioned for future growth. Turning to the cash flow on Slide 12, adjusted free cash flow of $1.2 billion was 26% higher than last year, reflecting higher earnings and excellent working capital performance. It\u2019s also worth pointing out that the cash flow benefited by $50 million into the June quarter due to timing of tax payments, and we expect this to reverse in the first quarter of 2021 fiscal year. We have discussed our continued focus on working capital on many occasions, and this continued as we worked our way through the Bemis integration this year. We also recognize the need to be even more focused during the last 6 months once the environment became more uncertain. As a result, our cash performance in the June quarter was particularly strong, driven by a higher rate of collections. We measure working capital performance through the working capital to sales ratio, which ended the year at 9.5% to sales, representing a reduction of 1.2% in fiscal 2020. This is the equivalent of around $150 million in cash that has been released through the period and, at this level, essentially funds all of the Bemis integration cash costs. CapEx spend for the year was around $30 million lower than last year on a like-for-like basis, reflecting lower investment requirements, which is typical when working through large-scale integrations. Moving to Slide 13, Amcor has an investment-grade credit rating, and our balance sheet metrics are strong, including leverage at 2.9x, which is in line with our year-end expectations. We have less than 2% of drawn debt facilities maturing within the next 12 months and ample liquidity of $2.5 billion in un-drawn committed lines and cash on hand. Key message in relation to our balance sheet and cash flow is that we remain very well positioned, with the flexibility to meet the investment needs of our business in a low-cost and effective way, fund returns to shareholders and made a strong \u2013 maintain a strong investment-grade credit rating. As we turn to Slide 14, this highlights our outlook for the financial year ending June 30, 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic, of course, creates heightened levels of complexity and uncertainty when estimating future results, particularly over a 12-month period. However, we expect our business to continue demonstrating resilience, given we supply packaging for essential consumer goods. And we assume that we and our business partners are able to continue operating plants with minimal disruption. Taking this into account, we expect adjusted EPS growth in constant currency terms of approximately 5% to 10% compared to the $0.642 in the year just delivered. And we expect approximately $1 billion to $1.1 billion of adjusted free cash flow before dividends. So in summary, the business generated outstanding results in fiscal 2020, and we expect another strong year in 2021. So with that, I\u2019ll hand back over to you, Ron. Ron Delia : Okay. Thanks, Michael. I\u2019ll switch gears here for just a few minutes and take a longer-term perspective, starting with Slide 15. And just as I do that, I want to mention, we\u2019re planning a more fulsome investor briefing with a number of our management team members for the end of September, where we will expand more on our strategy and long-term opportunities. So, further information on that event, which will be virtual, will be made available shortly. So stay tuned. So, for now, back to Slide 15, despite the macro challenges and uncertainty around us, we\u2019re confident Amcor will continue to deliver shareholder value in the near term, given the range of controllable drivers we have visibility to, starting with continued defensive organic growth for our food and health care packaging; additional cost synergies from the Bemis acquisition over the next few years; continued payment of a strong dividend, which should be even more compelling in this low interest rate environment; and the benefit to EPS from having repurchased approximately 3.5% of our shares this past year. And longer term, our shareholder value creation model, or you could call it our capital allocation framework, has not changed. We will continue to generate organic growth, pay competitive dividends, pursue acquisitions at attractive returns or else, return residual cash to shareholders. And Slide 16 shows the outcome of that model over the last several years. Since 2014, Amcor\u2019s delivered an average of 12% per year of combined EPS growth and dividend yield, and as we saw earlier, that number in FY \u201820 was much higher at 17%. And as Michael mentioned, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with lots of capacity and flexibility, and we continue to offer a compelling dividend relative to alternatives that investors might consider for yield. Before we conclude our opening remarks today, I want to touch on the topic of sustainability on Slide 17. And many of you will know, this is not a new topic for us, and we\u2019ve developed some well-informed perspectives over many years. But two key messages here today. First, sustainability is just as important now as ever; and second, sustainable packaging represents Amcor\u2019s most significant long-term growth opportunity. Of course, COVID has dominated the headlines for much of the calendar 2020 year, but consumers around the world remain concerned about climate change and waste. And we believe when it comes to addressing both of those consumer needs and sustainability concerns, responsible packaging is the answer and requires a system solution across 3 elements : first, packaging designed to take into account environmental impacts through the full life cycle, which includes recyclable, reusable or compostable structures, packaging made from recycled materials and packaging that uses less material in the first place; second, the right waste management infrastructure, whether that\u2019s recycling or composting facilities or returnable systems; and third, consumer participation to properly dispose off packaging after its use. And Amcor is uniquely positioned to make a difference and contribute across each of these areas, innovating and developing new packaging, collaborating with other stakeholders on the waste management challenge and informing and educating consumers in order to increase their participation. And we have continued to make meaningful progress during the last 12 months, as you can see here on Slide 18. Through continuous innovation and product development, we\u2019ve made good progress increasing the amount of Amcor packaging that is designed to be recycled. And in the past year, we increased our use of post-consumer recycled resin by over 40% and up to almost 2 million pounds in total, as we supported many customers launching new products, several made from 100% PCR. We continued to collaborate with a range of stakeholders to increase available infrastructure for waste collection, sorting and recycling and two examples to the note from the last few months. In the U.S., a pilot organized by the MRFF partnership was successful in demonstrating the potential for collection and sorting of flexible plastic packaging. And in China, Amcor initiated the first packaging sustainability statement, bringing together the China packaging federation, the Green River NGO, customers and suppliers to jointly develop and promote recycling systems and to work with regulators to establish sustainability standards. And finally, we are using our experience and insights to educate and inform consumers and customers about the environmental implications of their packaging. During the year, we launched campaigns through social media and industry channels and conducted proprietary research on consumer perceptions and behavior related to packaging. So, to close off and summarize on Slide 19, 2020 has been a milestone year for Amcor. We delivered outstanding financial results and demonstrated resilience through uncertain times and outperformed on the things that we can control. The Bemis integration is progressing ahead of expectations, exceeding our synergy targets for the first year and enhancing the overall financial performance of the business. We have clear line of sight to continued growth in fiscal \u201821 and we are committed \u2013 we remain committed to leading the industry toward a more sustainable future. And with that, operator, we will open the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. Ron Delia : Hi. Anthony. Anthony Pettinari : Ron, it seems like the Bemis integration has gone better than expected from a synergy and cost reduction perspective. I am just wondering if you could talk about how it\u2019s gone from an organic growth perspective, how the business performed relative to maybe expectations at the beginning of the year. And then you referenced gains in protein and health care. Just wondering if there is any kind of finer point you can put on that? Ron Delia : Yes. Look, it\u2019s a good question. And I think we will inevitably get focused on the synergies, but the organic performance of the businesses \u2013 the business that we acquired has performed very well. And I think it\u2019s important to point out, it\u2019s a high quality business, and it\u2019s well invested. I mean, clearly, the North American position is well known, but the businesses around the world as well. And we got really strong performance in the first 12 months. I think there was momentum building into the close of the acquisition, which was in June of \u201819, and that carried through into the fiscal year. Generally speaking, the organic growth was positive in North America, low single digits. We had really good growth in the European business that we acquired in Asia. I think the one soft spot that we have highlighted several times was Latin America, though I think it\u2019s pretty clear to us that, that business was absolutely on the right track by the end of the year. In fact, the profit in that business doubled over the previous 12 months. With regard to the segments that I mentioned which are a big part of the organic story, we had low single-digit growth, almost mid-single-digit growth, I should say, in protein and health care globally. I don\u2019t know if I would call those revenue synergies, but they are clearly benefits of being exposed more broadly to those two segments, which clearly are higher value-add relative to the Flexibles segment, the Flexibles business at large. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And with regards to the \u201821 guidance, EPS is guided to be up, free cash flow down. Is that just the non-repeat of the working capital benefits? And then from a \u2013 is there any kind of resin benefit that you saw in \u201820 that could reverse in \u201821, given some of the hikes that have been announced just any kind of color there? Ron Delia : Yes. I will talk about \u2013 I will talk on the raw material point, and Michael can answer the question on cash flow. Look, the raw material environment was relatively benign throughout the year. I think we flagged through the first three quarters we had some modest benefits through 9 months of about $5 million a quarter, maybe $15 million for the year. In the fourth quarter, the raw material impact on our business was neutral. We had a lot of volatility. Think about just oil, where oil was in March and April versus where it finished the quarter. But all up, the impact was neutral in the fourth quarter. And there\u2019s nothing material to point to, Anthony, that we would be cycling in FY \u201821. Michael Casamento : And yes, on the cash flow side, Anthony, I think, look, the key difference is really the $50 million tax payment, which we deferred in Q4 of FY \u201820. And that\u2019s going to get paid in Q1, so basically, you have a double up there, and that\u2019s $100 million movement when you consider the year-over-year. So that\u2019s really the key difference that we are calling out. Anthony Pettinari : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I will turn it over. Operator : Your next question comes from Larry Gandler with Credit Suisse. Larry Gandler : Thanks guys. Can you hear me? Ron Delia : Yes. Larry Gandler : Thanks, Ron. Ron, it\u2019s always a difficult question to ask about acquisitions because it\u2019s pretty much generally a vague answer, but I will see if I could take your pulse. It might be that the pandemic has resulted in acquisition opportunities. So perhaps, are you seeing more opportunities? And now that Bemis might be very much \u2013 you are quite confident of integrating it, you might be turning your attention to deals now as well? Ron Delia : Well, look, you are familiar with our business model and our history, right? We have always been quite acquisitive. We have been a consolidator in the industry for a long-time. So that\u2019s part of the formula going forward as well. There\u2019s no question we want to be growing the business. We have got great market positions that can be bolted on to. We have got strong cash flow and a healthy balance sheet. So that\u2019s clearly part of the plan going forward. Look, at the moment, I wouldn\u2019t overstate it, the Bemis integration is off to a great start. But if we are talking about our Flexibles perimeter, priority 1, 2 and 3 is to close off that integration and really nail the synergies as we turn our minds towards what could come next. Rigid is no question. There will be opportunities, particularly in the specialty space as we continue to diversify that business. As it relates to opportunities emanating from the pandemic, we haven\u2019t really seen much in terms of distress in our sector, which probably makes sense given most of what we would be interested in is exposed to the same consumer staples that we are, food and beverages and health care, so those end markets, and the demand has held up. But no question going forward, you can expect us to be acquisitive. Larry Gandler : Okay, fantastic. My second question, just, again, somewhat big picture in terms of resin tax and sustainability. I know it\u2019s been talked about now in Europe, I am just wondering if you can talk to where you think the plastic tax or resin tax risk might be most acute? Ron Delia : Well, look, there is a number of moving parts on that one, or I should say, a number of developments on that front. I think, particularly as governments struggle to raise revenue to offset the costs of dealing with the pandemic, I think this is a place they may look. I think we are seeing that a little bit in Europe. Look, ultimately, if consumers around the world value waste reduction and value greenhouse gas reduction just as they value convenience and functionality, then they will pay the costs that are associated with that. So that\u2019s not something that we can completely control. I think we have a voice and a perspective to add to the debate. And should governments go down that route, our hope would be that it\u2019s well-structured and focused and targeted at actually funding the waste management infrastructure that\u2019s required as opposed to a general revenue raise. But ultimately, the cost of the product will represent the full value that it\u2019s offering consumers and society at large, including any taxes that are levied against it. Larry Gandler : And any particular markets, where you see it at risk at the moment? Ron Delia : No. Look, you highlighted, in Europe, there\u2019s a levy on the member states of the EU. It\u2019s not quite a tax, I guess. They call it something else. It sounds like a tax to me, but where member states have to contribute back to the EU on the basis of un-recycled waste that\u2019s going to go into effect in the next 12 months. It remains to be seen what \u2013 how that transpires, how it eventuates. So you could say Europe is a place where there\u2019s more activity on that front. But I think even in the U.S., we see signs of extended fiduciary responsibility type mechanisms being discussed. So look, it could come anywhere, Larry. I am not sure there\u2019s one region leading. Larry Gandler : Okay, good. Thanks, Ron. Operator : Your next question comes from John Purtell with Macquarie. John Purtell : Good morning. Ron, how are you and Michael? Ron Delia : Hey, John, how are you? John Purtell : I am not too bad. Thank you. Look, just had a couple of questions. Look, in terms of \u2013 obviously, been a fair bit of debate about trends such as at-home consumption and to what extent we have seen sort of demand pull forward in certain areas. Just be interested in how you sort of see maybe how that sort of conceptually sort of developed through that fourth quarter, and how you think about that as sort of forming part of your growth guidance for the year ahead. Ron Delia : Yes, that is the topic. I think for us, this is almost like a second half topic because we have a substantial business in Asia and China where this whole pandemic started. And so we have been monitoring this pretty closely since. I think we are kind of coming out the other end of the let\u2019s say, outside the norm volume movements. If we think back over the last, let\u2019s say, 4 months, March and April, where March was a strong month, volume-wise, generally. I am generalizing here, but March was generally strong. April was softer. May was very weak in most parts of our business. June then started to normalize again, and July feels more normal. So maybe sequentially, that\u2019s the way to think about it. Obviously, there\u2019s puts and takes by region and by segment. But for the most part, I think that we are seeing more normal demand patterns and probably have for the last 6 to 8 weeks, certainly through the last month and into the start of this quarter. John Purtell : Thank you. And second question, specifically on Latin America. You mentioned, obviously, we have seen sort of weaker full year volumes, but there has been some sequential improvement. Can you provide any color on as to sort of where did volumes sort of end up through that fourth quarter? Have we got back to a flat level yet? Ron Delia : Yes. So this is about the Flexibles Latin America business. We have a number of businesses in Latin America, but the one that I was referring to is Flexibles Latin America, which if you were to trace its legacy is kind of half legacy Bemis, half legacy Amcor and spans the whole of Latin America. It\u2019s a business that we have discussed throughout the last 12 months when we acquired Bemis. That part of the business was not performing well, in fact, had lost money in the fourth quarter of what would have been our fiscal \u201819. And it\u2019s been a great turnaround success story for the last 12 months. We have taken an enormous amount of cost out of the business. We have simplified it. We have sold 2 plants. We sold a joint venture in Brazil. We sold a disposable cups and plates business that was in Argentina. So we tried to simplify the business. And overall, the profit is up \u2013 was up, as I said earlier, almost 2x what it was the year before. As far as the sales, that takes longer to stabilize. One of the reasons it struggled leading into the close was the top line had been eroding. That\u2019s well and truly stabilized. I think when we look through what the COVID impact was to the best we could surmise versus what the business was doing, we were certainly back to steady seas and then had some COVID impacts in May in particular. But I think we can feel pretty good that we have stabilized the business and now can see \u2013 expect to see growth of the top line going forward. John Purtell : Nice, Ron. Operator : Your next question comes from Keith Chau with MST Marquee. Keith Chau : Hi. Ron and Michael, just the first question to follow-up on adjusted free cash flow target of $1 billion to $1.1 billion in FY \u201821. Michael, you mentioned earlier that deferred tax or the swap around for that was going to be part of the contributing factor of it stepping back a bit. Just wondering if you can give us some guidance on any, I guess, working capital unwind that you can still generate into next year, particularly given the strong performance that we saw in FY \u201820, and whether you can keep improving that working capital position. And in addition to that, what the CapEx outlook is to the FY \u201821? Michael Casamento : Yes, sure, Keith. Look, on the working capital side, obviously, this year, we had an exceptional performance. I mean, on a pro-forma basis, we started the year at around 10.7% of sales, a really strong focus throughout the year and particularly in the past 3 to 6 months. And the business got down to 9.5% of sales. So as I mentioned in my speaking notes, we had a 1.2% reduction there, which is exceptional in anyone\u2019s terms and that\u2019s about $150 million, as I touched on, and in effect, supports the cash integration cost of the Bemis acquisition. So really important to get ahead of the game on there which was great. As we move forward, I mean, I wouldn\u2019t expect to see those exceptional gains again in the coming year. We still will expect some continuous improvement in working capital. And you may recall, Amcor typically was around that 9% to sales level, and I would \u2013 we would hope to get back there over time. But certainly, in the cash flow, you won\u2019t see that benefit in FY \u201821. But there, as I touched on earlier, the main difference is really that tax reversal. From a CapEx standpoint, we spent around $400 million this year. We would expect that\u2019s probably going to be a little higher next year, maybe another 5% to 10%, but that\u2019s kind of where we see things. Keith Chau : Okay, great. And then just a second question, throughout the course of FY \u201820, there was a comment made on the Flexibles business that strong cost and operating performance was a key driver of margin expansion within the division, notwithstanding some of the Bemis synergies as well. So obviously, that\u2019s paid dividends in FY \u201820, but is there a, I guess, runway for cost and operating performance to continue to improve in FY \u201821 or do we think we are at a steady, I guess, cost structure and operational performance structure going forward? Ron Delia : Keith, it\u2019s Ron. Look, I think if you look back over the last 10 years or so, there\u2019s been a pretty consistent track record of margin expansion in that Flexibles space. And it\u2019s driven by cost and operational performance, as you alluded to, but it\u2019s also driven by continuous improvement in the product mix, sometimes at the expense of the top line. And I think you see a bit of that coming through in FY \u201820. We had 80 more \u2013 80 basis points of organic margin expansion through the year, and it was a combination of factors, including good product and end market mix. That\u2019s an abnormally strong year for us. I think normally, we have seen 10, 20, 30 basis points per full year. That\u2019s sort of what we would expect going forward, and it will be a combination of commercial and cost productivity. Keith Chau : Okay, fantastic. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America. George Staphos : Hi, everyone. Good day. Congratulations on the progress in fiscal \u201820. Thanks for taking my question. Hey, Ron, a couple of questions back to sustainability. I know it\u2019s kind of a tall order, but if sustainability is your biggest opportunity in terms of long-term growth, is there a way to somehow measure or quantify what that actually added to your core growth in fiscal \u201820, or what you would expect in terms of the trading in and trading out of product, what it might mean for fiscal \u201821? And relatedly, from the survey work that you do of consumers and your customers, what, if anything, are you seeing in terms of changes in terms of how plastic packaging is perceived in the market? And then I have a follow-on on growth rates. Ron Delia : Well, look, the second one, I might deal with first. I think the pandemic has been a bit of a level setter on the importance, first of all, packaging, right? I mean, I think we have seen this whole topic go in cycles over \u2013 or peaks and troughs over the last several years. From a debate in different parts of the world, maybe 3 or 4 years ago about whether packaging was needed to, I think, a general view that packaged food and packaged health care products have a real purpose. I think we see that again reinforced with some of the issues around wet markets and things like that. So I think that\u2019s the starting point. And then secondly, obviously, the focus is on hygiene and sanitation and those sorts of things have become more prominent now than ever. So if anything, the base \u2013 the fundamental attributes of packaging in general and plastic packaging, specifically, have been strengthened through this pandemic. And as it relates to the growth, look, it\u2019s \u2013 I mean, you sort of \u2013 you said it. I mean, it\u2019s very difficult to measure. How much of our book of business with big global key accounts is driven by their comfort or interested in working with us on longer-term sustainability developments, really hard to say. We have a really strong staple of products that are designed to be recycled now and always have. How much of that growth is because of that attribute versus others, really hard to say. So I am not really sure, George, that we could even venture a guess at this stage. George Staphos : Okay. Look, I appreciate the answer and the candor. Switching gears and recognizing Amcor obviously, runs a business on a longer term basis and not month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter, could you comment at all in terms of what types of growth rates you are seeing right now across any of your more important product lines or geographies within the business? And particularly, I am interested in what you are seeing you mentioned India and China had improved in fiscal 4Q? What are you seeing there into fiscal 1Q for \u201821? Thank you very much. Ron Delia : Yes. Look, I think that the headline to answer the question would be that the growth that we are seeing now and that we expect to see, let\u2019s say, in the next few months and through FY \u201821 is generally consistent with what we have seen long term and what we expect long term. So what does that mean across the whole of Amcor? It means 1% to 2% volume growth. That\u2019s exactly what we have seen for the last six years. It\u2019s actually what we saw in the second half. And that\u2019s what we see going forward. Now when you double-click in a portfolio as broad as ours, there is differences by region. In North America and Europe, we are going to see low single-digit growth, particularly also as we optimize the mix, to the question that was asked earlier about margins. In the emerging markets, especially Asia, we should see mid- to high single digits and in China and India, India even more so because it\u2019s a smaller base, that\u2019s what we see; and China, certainly in the mid single-digit range. So \u2013 and that would be the expectation over time over the long-haul as well. So that\u2019s kind of the model. And you put all that together, and we have some strong growth businesses like health care, which has been a really strong grower for many years above those overall averages, and you have some other parts of the business that grow at lower rates. But all up, assume it\u2019s a 1% to 2% volume growth business, which generates organic profit growth of 3% or 4%. George Staphos : Thank you. I will now turn it over. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Brian Maguire : Hey good day to you all. I just wanted to ask a little bit about volume trends in the quarter. If I look at, I think, 3Q, you talked about Rigids being up something close to 5%. I think for the half year was only up 1% so implies it was down a couple of percent in 4Q, just hoping to get a little bit more color on trends in the Rigids business through the quarter? And then just within the Flexibles business, it seems like this was asked a little bit earlier but maybe not as much of a benefit from at-home eating as we might have expected or seen. Were there just some offsets in the food service part of the business or was the portion that you would consider at-home truly kind of only up 1% or so? Ron Delia : Yes. Look, it\u2019s a good question. I think in the case of Rigids, I referred to month-to-month volatility and variability, and Rigids would be the business that had the biggest swings. You\u2019re right, in the third quarter, we flagged 5%, and actually, I\u2019m talking about North America, right, specifically. So in the third quarter, we had 5% volume growth in the North American beverage business. In the fourth quarter, there was a mid-single-digit decline in volumes in that business. That\u2019s a business that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a big fourth quarter business anyway from a seasonal perspective, and it\u2019s heavily levered towards away-from-home consumption, the C-store channel, in particular. And so that business had a mid-single-digit volume decline in the fourth quarter. But even within that, quite a bit of variability from month-to-month, again, a pretty good March at the end of Q3 weaker April, really weak May and good June and good start in July, so really up and down. We also have the specialty business in North America in Rigids, which is a big business as well, and that business picked up momentum in the fourth quarter. So we\u2019re sort of puts and takes. In Flexibles, I think the thing to think about in terms of the volumes is just how broad and diversified the business is geographically. It\u2019s about one-third, North America; one-third, Europe; and one-third, everywhere else. And in Europe and North America for the quarter, generally, with our end markets, we had low single-digit growth, which is nothing extraordinary. But it\u2019s the all other where you have a lot of variability. So Latin America was softer, and Asia was stronger. Really, it was a mixed bag by region. Brian Maguire : Okay, thanks. And just one follow-on, I was wondering if you could just comment on pricing trends in the industry in general, just as contracts are coming up for renewal. Are you seeing any increased competition or people more aggressively trying to pass-through lower resin prices or maybe given the stable end markets, not much change? But just interested in kind of hearing if you are seeing any change in competitive behavior as contracts come up for renewal? Ron Delia : Yes. Look, it\u2019s a good question. No change would be the headline, right? That\u2019s the short answer. There\u2019s no change in competitive dynamics. It\u2019s an industry \u2013 if you stand back from it and compare it to other industries, it\u2019s got sort of the same pricing dynamics. It\u2019s very difficult to have price appreciation for like-for-like product. I don\u2019t think that exists in many industries. When you have something different, that\u2019s where the pricing opportunities come in. But generally speaking, the competitive environment is stable. Brian Maguire : Okay. Just last one, if I could sneak it in. Just any color on the trends in folding cartons and healthcare, would imagine there may be kind of opposite ends of the spectrum, but if you could just kind of provide a little bit of color on trends in those markets? Ron Delia : Well, healthcare has been a big part of Amcor for a long time. It\u2019s about 15% of the business. It\u2019s roughly half pharmaceutical packaging and half medical device packaging. We participate globally in both. We have big market positions in both and lots of differentiation and product technology in both. And those businesses over time have grown at higher rates than the whole of Amcor at higher margins. And we expect that to continue going forward. On health \u2013 on folding cartons, look, that business actually rebounded quite well. It had a tough first half volume-wise. Second half volumes were more or less flat with the prior year. And that\u2019s a business that\u2019s not going to grow at the rate of health care, but it\u2019s attractive for other reasons. Brian Maguire : I will turn it over. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Ghansham Panjabi : Hi, everyone. Good day. Ron Delia : Hi, Ghansham. Ghansham Panjabi : So Ron, just from a high level standpoint, from the initial stages of the pandemic, I think it was pretty clear that consumers were pantry loading in the western world. Some of your customers were rationalizing SKUs and so on to ensure product availability. Just comment on what you\u2019re seeing at this point. Are we sort of in a normalization phase at current? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense as to how to think about the weighting for EPS from the first half of this year, for fiscal year \u201821 versus the back half? Ron Delia : Well, look, I think, generally speaking, the environment is normalizing as it relates to our markets. You\u2019re right, there was a bit of \u2013 well, to different degrees, I would say, was their pantry loading. I think in different regions that\u2019s less of a factor than it might be in the U.S. That\u2019s really behind us now. That was more of a March, April phenomenon. And you are also right that customers, I don\u2019t know if retreat is the right word, but certainly consolidated into fewer SKUs that could be run at higher volumes, I think, primarily to ensure continuity of supply. And we certainly saw that. Now whether that reverses, let\u2019s see. We are still in an environment with, I would say, fewer SKUs generally, but let\u2019s see where that evolves. As far as looking forward, I mean, we haven\u2019t given guidance by quarter. You just have to remember that we\u2019re building synergy benefits, which is probably the biggest driver of benefits in the first half, and those benefits continue to accrue with each month. Ghansham Panjabi : Got it. And in terms of going back to an earlier question on EBIT year-over-year specific to Flexibles, so it looks like about a $96 million EBIT benefit, \u201820 versus \u201819. I think synergies were $57 million of that. You mentioned resin of $15 million for the total year, I assume, let\u2019s say, $10 million for that specific segment. Can you just break out the other drivers of the $30-some-odd million of EBIT delta? Where did that come from? Because volumes were basically flat, you mentioned mix, but that just seems like a very large number relative to just mix. Ron Delia : Well, I mean, mix is part of it. We would call that commercial productivity, so that\u2019s the health care growth, that\u2019s the protein growth, that\u2019s growth in some of the higher performance materials for things like coffee and pet food. So that\u2019s meaningful. Cost productivity is absolutely a part of it. Ongoing cost productivity is big. It was particularly big in the last fiscal year. Those are two things that we manage all the time. And sometimes we have a bigger bump than others. I mentioned in response to a similar question earlier that traditionally, we would expect to see 10 to 30 basis points of margin expansion in that space collectively, and that\u2019s on the back of fairly low volume growth, as I alluded to in response to George\u2019s question. So it was a strong year from an organic margin expansion perspective, but no mystery as to where. It\u2019s just a better year than the average on both commercial and cost productivity. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay. And then just final one in terms of the sequential increase in resin and also freight costs in the U.S. and I assume any other petrochemical-related costs. Is that a dynamic that you are baking in? I mean, should we kind of \u2013 how should we think about that delta relative to the synergies for Flexibles on a full year basis? Are margins going to be up year-over-year just given the tough comp you have from this year, obviously? Ron Delia : Well, look, I think we have given a range, and the range takes all those things that you mentioned and others into consideration. I mean, the synergies, still, it\u2019s a big year of expected synergies going forward, right? We said $50 million to $70 million of EBIT. The vast majority of that will be in the Flexibles segment. That\u2019s clearly going to be a big driver of margins. Raw materials for us, historically, I mean, it\u2019s a pass-through, as you know, as it is for everybody. And any impact, positive or negative, tends to just be a timing issue that tends to wash out through the course of a 12-month year. So all of that\u2019s factored into the guidance that we gave at the EPS level. Ghansham Panjabi : Very good. Thank you so much. Ron Delia : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Richard Johnson with Jefferies. Richard Johnson : Thanks very much. Ron, sorry to flog a dead horse, if I could just return quickly to the issue of organic growth and your comments you made earlier on margins. I recall one of your predecessors saying to me more than once, it wasn\u2019t reasonable to assume you could have ever rising margins on flat revenues and notwithstanding what you are saying about mix. So really, my question is, how much opportunity do you think you\u2019ve got for bottom slicing to try and improve your mix from here, particularly when we think about the margin improvement you showed this year, of which a great chunk of which was obviously related to the lower revenue number? Ron Delia : Look, the margin expansion this year was not really related to the lower revenue number. I think the raw material impact came up on a previous question that was maybe 10 basis points out of 140. So that was a factor, but not a big one. The bottom slicing is \u2013 it\u2019s an ongoing activity. I mean, it\u2019s really important in Flexibles especially because the fragmentation of the customer mix, the product mix is enormous as I mean, there\u2019s thousands of SKUs and thousands of customers. So \u2013 but the ongoing optimization of that mix is critical, but that being said, the business will grow 1% to 2%. It has historically and it will going forward, so that gives us a lift as well from a margin perspective. Richard Johnson : Great. Thanks and then just a question for Michael on the cash flow and the adjustment, the $163 million adjustment you made, which you helped me breakout includes $80 million of integration costs for Bemis, the other $83 million, I was just wondering if you could help me understand what that was? Michael Casamento : Look, it\u2019s a combination of things, Richard, partly timing of the transaction costs. Obviously, this deal, we have transaction costs, which are combination of adviser fees and employee fees which spanned over both years. There\u2019s some costs related to the remedy and splitting out the business there, and then there\u2019s just some general cleanup costs coming out of\u2026. Richard Johnson : Okay. So the Rigid Plastics\u2019 restructuring is not in there? Michael Casamento : Absolutely not. That\u2019s separate. We just treat that as normal cash. Richard Johnson : Okay, perfect. Great. And then just quickly if I can, I noticed that you have started to hedge. We have got some hedges in place for PET, which I\u2019ve never seen before. I was just curious to try to understand what that was and what the accounting for that is? Michael Casamento : Yes. Look, we have been on the back of customer request. We do back-to-back hedging at their account, so it\u2019s similar to what we have done on the aluminum side, which we have been doing for many years. So that\u2019s it, as straightforward as that, Richard. Richard Johnson : Okay. So there are no hedging gains or losses? Michael Casamento : No. Richard Johnson : Okay, great. Thanks very much. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from Anojja Shah with BMO Capital Markets. Anojja Shah : Hi, good morning everyone. I just wanted to ask about that cost reduction program in Rigid Packaging. You made good progress in 2020, and I believe you\u2019re targeting another $5 million to $10 million benefit in 2021. Can you just give some more details? Is that still the goal? And just what we can expect next year? Ron Delia : Yes, it\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s an important part of resetting that business and setting it up for growth in Rigids. There is some more benefits to come. We \u2013 there is some more footprint work and some more plant closures that are in front of us. There is a couple of plants that we have remaining to close. And so we will see benefits coming in FY \u201821 as we complete that restructuring program. Anojja Shah : And is $5 million to $10 million still a good number, $5 million to $10 million? Ron Delia : Yes. I would say that\u2019s a reasonable number. We got a little bit of benefit this year, but we will get the residual benefits in FY \u201821. And depending on the time of the year when we close the plants, we would see some potential benefit, some of that carryover into FY \u201822. Anojja Shah : Got it. And then my other question, in your slide deck, you talked about a 41% increase in PCR usage in fiscal \u201820. What does that translate to in terms of what percentage of your products use PCR now? And how much higher can you go given the availability of PCR? Ron Delia : Well, almost all of that is in our Rigid Packaging segment, and that business exited fiscal \u201820 running at about 10% PCR. There\u2019s no technical reason why the number can\u2019t be much higher. There are, from time to time, some supply constraints. But over the long term, we expect those to abate, and that number will continue to grow substantially. I think in Flexible Packaging, it\u2019s a little bit more of a challenge because polyethylene and polypropylene and general polyolefins are less available. But even that will \u2013 that supply chain will start to expand as well. So that\u2019s where we finished. We finished at exit rate of 10%. Anojja Shah : Alright, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Nathan Reilly with UBS. Nathan Reilly : Hi, guys. Quick question in relation to dividends, just in terms of the outlook there, just wondering, should we expect those dividends on a, I guess, a dividends per share basis to follow your EPS growth rates going forward? Ron Delia : Nathan, that\u2019s a good question. The dividend is super important for us and for our shareholders. It\u2019s a base return. It\u2019s a quite, we believe, quite compelling return relative to alternatives, whether it\u2019s the dividend yield of others or interest rates. And we continue to grow it, and we will continue to grow it over time, particularly to keep pace at least with inflation. I\u2019m not sure that it will grow in line with EPS because I think we\u2019ve got a pretty attractive dividend yield as it is. But it will continue to grow. Nathan Reilly : Okay, thanks. And just a final question, just in relation to Bemis revenue synergies. I think you\u2019ve previously flagged that, that would be sort of a longer term to sort of go after a few of those potential revenue synergies. I\u2019m just wondering now that we\u2019re a little bit more advanced on the integration of Bemis, are we just getting a little bit closer to going after some of those revenue synergy opportunities now? Ron Delia : Well, we have had a focus on a few key areas that we \u2013 over the past 12 months even. We\u2019ve had a little extra focus on health care, a little extra focus on protein. And the third area would be our global key accounts where we now have a more complete global footprint to supply them from. So the efforts are underway. I think generating a dollar of sales in this business tends to take \u2013 it tends to take a while. So as we think about revenue synergies per se and any acceleration in the top line, that\u2019s still a couple of years off. Although you can point to some of those segments and the growth we\u2019ve had even more recently, and it\u2019d be hard to pull apart what that synergy versus what\u2019s just good base performance in a segment like protein. Nathan Reilly : All good. Thanks, Ron. Ron Delia : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Brook Campbell-Crawford with JPMorgan. Brook Campbell-Crawford: Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up. You talked earlier on about the improvement in the Bemis and Flexibles Lat Am business. I think you mentioned 2x improvement in profit, can you just provide some dollar numbers around this? So what was the swing in EBIT basically from FY \u201819 to FY \u201820, if I caught your comment correctly? Ron Delia : Yes. Look, Brook, I mean we haven\u2019t broken the business out. It\u2019s not a material enough business for us to break out the numbers. But \u2013 and what I am referring to is the Bemis business that we acquired, which was in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. And so that legacy perimeter, as we talked about, was losing money in Q4. It was a modest amount in the grand scheme of the whole group or even the Flexibles segment. But we turned it around by taking out several hundred people and driving the plants in a much more, I guess, effective way. And then as I alluded to, I have taken steps to simplify that business. It\u2019s quite a complicated business and a lot of different product segments. And we have exited two of them already in the first 12 months. And we will continue to look at ways to further simplify the business. Brook Campbell-Crawford: Okay, that\u2019s great. Thanks. And then just two simple ones for Michael just any guidance you can provide around interest for next year? I know you have recently refinanced some debt. But I guess, as a base case, should we expect interest costs to be higher next year? And then also as well just around cash costs below the line for next year, is it just the remaining $70 million or so of integration costs for Bemis? So is there any other cash costs that we should expect to see there as a significant item in FY \u201821? Michael Casamento : Yes. Brook, I will take your question here. Thanks. Look, on the interest side, we haven\u2019t given specific guidance. Obviously, we\u2019ve given a range in the EPS guidance range. I mean, you\u2019re quite right, we did term out some debt in June, two bonds, one in the U.S. and one in Europe, both around $500 million. As we look forward, look, we don\u2019t expect a material difference in interest moving forward. The bonds are at a higher cost, but then we have lower interest rates year-on-year. So we\u2019re not expecting anything material there. And in terms of the cash costs, yes, the adjustments there around \u2013 we\u2019ve called out around $50 million to $70 million in cash costs. That\u2019s included in that $1 billion to $1.1 billion adjusted cash. Brook Campbell-Crawford: Okay, that\u2019s great. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to management for closing remarks. Ron Delia : Well, thanks, operator. Just to close off, a quick recap here. 2020 was a milestone year for Amcor, an outstanding year from a financial perspective. Off to a really good start on our biggest acquisition and the integration of Bemis, and we\u2019ve got visibility to continued growth in 2021 and beyond. So thanks again for joining, and we will be in touch shortly. And that will end the call operator. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Thanks, everyone, for being with us today to discuss Amcor's first quarter results for our 2021 fiscal year. We appreciate you making the effort to join the call and as well for any of our team members are on the call who sometimes join and we appreciate their efforts as well which have been really outstanding over the start to the fiscal year. As Tracey mentioned, joining me on the line today is Michael Casamento, Amcor's CFO. And we'll start with some brief prepared comments before we take your questions. If I start with slide 3, everything we do at Amcor starts with safety. As you would know from those who have followed us before, safety is a value at Amcor, so the priorities in the business may shift from time to time, but our values remain consistent and safety would be the most important of those values and this year given the context around COVID-19, we're also clearly focused on keeping everyone on our team healthy as well. And as we continue to navigate the additional risk and complexity of operating during the ongoing pandemic, we remain confident and convinced that the protocols we implemented earlier this year in our facilities will enable us to continue to keep our co-workers healthy and keep our plants running as they have been thus far. With regard to safety in a more traditional sense, our recent performance continues to be a real highlight for Amcor through the first quarter. Across the company, we achieved a 30% reduction in the number of injuries compared to the prior year and over half of our sites were injury-free for at least 12 months. That's a significant achievement in our view particularly in the current environment and it's a direct result of the dedication, commitment and focus of our employees to keep themselves and their co-workers safe. Moving on to slide 4 and the key messages we have for today, first and foremost, we've had a strong start to fiscal 2021. We delivered outstanding results in the first quarter, which were ahead of our expectations and both segments produced strong organic growth. Our flexible packaging business is capitalizing on the strategic and financial benefits from the transformational Bemis acquisition. And the rigid packaging business is also building momentum with strong volume growth and cost performance. Second, the outperformance in the first quarter gives us the confidence to raise our outlook for fiscal 2021. We now expect adjusted EPS growth of 7% to 12% in constant currency terms and today we've also announced the dividend increase and a share buyback. And lastly the investment case for Amcor has never been stronger. In the near term, organic growth from our consumer and healthcare exposure should remain resilient, we'd deliver further acquisition synergies and we continue to offer an attractive dividend currently yielding more than 4%. In longer term, we're very well positioned. Momentum is building around innovations to deliver more sustainable packaging and we have a strong balance sheet an annual free cash flow of over $1 billion which provides the capacity to invest back in the business to pursue growth opportunities and to maintain an attractive dividend. Slide 5 provides a summary of our first quarter financial results and earnings growth was strong with EPS increasing 20% on a constant currency basis and that growth was really driven by three discrete components. The first, 8% of the EPS growth was organic which is a real highlight for both the flexibles and rigid packaging segments. On EBIT terms, organic growth in the flexible segment was more than 4% and all of the 7% growth in the rigid packaging segment was organic. And the strong performance in the operating businesses was partially offset by the phasing of some corporate expenses during the first quarter. Demand for our products remained resilient and we saw overall volume growth in North America and the Asia Pacific region while volumes in Europe were marginally lower than last year. There was also good leverage through to the bottom line which was enhanced even further by favorable operating cost performance. 7% of the EPS growth came from synergies resulting from the Bemis acquisition. We delivered an incremental $20 million in cost synergies during the period. And we're well on track for the full year. And third, the remaining 4% of the EPS growth came from the benefits of the share buyback that we completed in the last fiscal year. Free cash flow was also in line with our expectations and the business continue to make good progress on working capital and our balance sheet remains strong. The strength in the underlying business and financial position means we've also been able to increase cash returns to shareholders during the quarter. Today, the board declared a quarterly dividend of $11.75 per share continuing our long track record of dividend growth and we also announced plans to repurchase $150 million of shares. So, the key message here is Amcor had a strong start to the 2021 fiscal year with both segments delivering excellent results and building momentum. And with that, I'll hand over to Michael to provide some more color on the financial performance for the quarter and our outlook for 2021. Michael John Casamento - Amcor Plc : Thanks, Ron, and hi everyone. I'll start with some comments on the flexible segment on slide 6. So, our overall segment volumes were 2% higher than the prior year with particularly good growth in North America and higher volumes in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region. This was partially offset by marginally lower volumes in Europe and unfavorable price mix in North America where \u2013 over the last quarter and relative to last year we saw some variable demand shifts across the portfolio. A combination of higher volumes and lower price mix resulted in net sales being 1% higher than last year excluding the unfavorable impacts of currency, the pass-through of lower raw material costs and the impact from divested businesses. The adjusted EBIT for the period grew 11% in constant currency terms and margins expanded by 140 basis points. This was driven by a combination of these higher volumes, synergy benefits and strong operating cost performance which mainly reflects productivity improvements and waste reduction. Overall, we're very happy with the performance across the flexibles business, which has been significantly enhanced as a result of the Bemis acquisition. Before moving to the rigid packaging segment, I'll provide a brief update on Bemis cost synergies on slide 7. As Ron mentioned, we delivered an incremental $20 million of synergies during the quarter which was in line with our expectations. Our teams remain resolutely focused on achieving our goals and we continue to see benefits accrued from flexibles G&A procurement and from the initial work we've undertaken on plant closures. The business outperformed against our initial synergy expectations last year and we are on track to meet our objective of $50 million to $70 million in cost synergies for fiscal year 2021. And we're well on our way to delivering $180 million by the end of fiscal year 2022, a milestone we remain confident of reaching. Turning to rigid packaging on slide 8. In summary, the business delivered an outstanding result with organic growth driving earnings 7% higher than last year. Sales growth included a 4% increase in volumes as well as 4% price mix benefit which includes higher pricing to recover cost inflation in Latin America. Volume performance was strong in North America and mix was positive. Beverage volumes were up 7% compared with last year and hot fill container volumes were up 12%. There was growth across most beverage segments on higher consumption of packaged beverage products and the launch of innovative new products in PET containers. Specialty container volumes were also higher as a result of continued growth in spirits, personal care and home cleansing categories. As a partial offset, volumes were lower with 3% lower in Latin America, and while this represents a sequential improvement performance continues to be mixed by country. As I mentioned, adjusted EBIT for the period grew 7% in constant currency terms. This reflects higher volumes, favorable mix and lower plant operating costs. This was partly offset by lower fixed cost absorption related to a demand-driven drawdown of inventories in North America. So overall, we are really happy with the commercial and cost performance of the business during the quarter and believe we are very well-positioned for continued growth. Moving to cash, balance sheet and currency on slide 9. Adjusted free cash outflow of $190 million was broadly in line with the prior year and within our expectations for the period. As a reminder, our cash flow is seasonally weaker in the first half of the fiscal year and this quarter also includes approximately $50 million of US cash tax payments that were deferred from Q4 in 2020. We remain focused on improving working capital management. And as you can see, momentum continued this quarter with our rolling 12 months average working capital to sales ratio at 8.8%, down from 9.5% at the end of June just past and 10.7% when we completed the Bemis acquisition back in June 2019. We continue to have a strong BBB, Baa2 investment grade balance sheet and leverage stands at 3 times on a trailing 12 month EBITDA basis, which is in line with the expectations for this time of the year. We have no material refinancing over the next 12 months and with this strong financial profile, Amcor continues to have significant capacity and flexibility to invest in many growth opportunities available to us. We've also highlighted our currency mix and the impact from currency movements in Q1 on this slide. While the net translation impact of currency movements was unfavorable during the current quarter, you can see it's been a result of significant depreciation in our basket of approximately 20 different currencies, which began to depreciate through the second half of last year, being partly offset by strength in the euro in the quarter. Which brings me to our outlook for the 2021 fiscal year on slide 10. Today, we have increased our guidance for constant currency EPS growth to a range of 7% to 12%, and we continue to expect adjusted free cash flow of approximately $1 billion to $1.1 billion. The strong start to the year and the momentum we see in the business are the two factors which have given us the confidence to raise our 2021 full year guidance. We expect the business to continue demonstrating resilience as a supplier for essential consumer goods, but we are also maintaining a reasonably wide range of outcomes for the remaining nine months of our fiscal year, which is appropriate given the ongoing uncertainty and complexity related to the COVID-19 pandemic. So in summary for me today, the business is performing well. Organic growth is strong, synergy delivery is on track, our financial profile remains solid, and we are positioned to deliver another year of EPS growth in fiscal year 2021, which is ahead of our original expectations. So with that I'll hand back to your, Ron. Ronald Stephen Delia - Amcor Plc : Thanks, Michael. Just picking up on slide 11, many of you will be aware, Amcor hosted an Investor Briefing a few weeks ago and this was an opportunity for several members of our management team to provide an overview of the company and to highlight our growth opportunities. And the materials from that briefing are available on our website. So I'd encourage anyone interested in learning more about Amcor to have a look. But the main theme of the event really was to outline our investment case. Why invest in Amcor? And before turning to the Q&A, I'll just take a couple of minutes to reiterate and reaffirm those key messages that we use to answer that question, and these are shown on slide 11. To start with, we're a global industry leader with a 160-year history, strong track record of performance and a clear strategy going forward. Organic growth has been very consistent as a supplier to stable end markets, and we have several levers to pull to continue to grow including product innovation and capitalizing on our leadership positions in faster growing emerging markets. Our dividend remains compelling and currently yields greater than 4% and that dividend will continue to grow. We have a strong investment grade balance sheet with substantial capacity to invest and no shortage of opportunities. And lastly we have momentum right now which is very clear in the results delivered today and we expect this to continue as we realize further synergy benefits and organic growth. So collectively these drivers have resulted in 10% to 15% of shareholder value each year that's EPS growth and dividend yield and we expect that to continue. Another way to look at this return is due to our shareholder value creation framework on slide 12. We generate strong cash flow from relatively defensive end markets and we redeployed that cash flow in the way as shown on the slide here through a combination of reinvestment in the business, M&A and share repurchases. We'd expect to generate 5% to 10% constant currency EPS growth and our dividend is growing and has historically yielded between 4% and 5% continues to be especially compelling in such a low interest rate environment. So again when you add these components together the outcome has resulted over the last six or so years in annual shareholder value of 10% to 15%. And we're very well positioned to continue that trend. One of the reasons we remain confident in that model that I just referred to is because of our sustainability agenda. And we believe without question, the sustainability will be the biggest organic growth opportunity in the business over time. It's part of our winning aspiration and our best opportunity to differentiate and it's our best opportunity for competitive advantage and ultimately to create shareholder value. We've developed a reasonably well-informed perspective over the years on the topic of sustainability and we believe we're uniquely positioned to leverage our scale and resources to help address growing consumer concerns about both climate change and waste. And we believe the best answer to addressing those consumer needs and sustainability concerns is responsible packaging, by which we mean a system based solution across three elements. First, packaging design which accounts for the full environmental impact including the carton footprint through the full product lifecycle. This would include packaging made from recyclable or compostable structures, packaging made with recycled material, packaging made with less material in the first place or reusable packaging. Second, the right waste management infrastructure whether it's recycling or composting facilities or returnable systems to enable the packaging to stay out of the environment. And lastly, consumer participation to properly reuse or disposed of packaging after its use. Amcor already offers a full range of responsible packaging options today, including packaging made from 100% recycled material or compostable packaging and packaging made from bio-based materials and we're continuing to make meaningful progress leading the way in defining and developing the innovative, more sustainable solutions our customers want and their consumers expect. A great example of a differentiated breakthrough innovation from Amcor is the AmLite HeatFlex product for retort, which we launched a few weeks ago. This is the world's first fully recyclable retort pouch, which Nestl\u00e9 has introduced into the market for wet pet food. And there's a wide range of end market applications for this multilayer structure and we're really excited about the demand potential for this product over time. In summary on slide 16, Amcor has delivered an outstanding first quarter result, with both the flexibles and rigid packaging segments delivering strong organic growth and building momentum. On the basis of the strong start, we've raised our outlook for fiscal 2021. We've increased the dividend and we'll buy back shares and finally, the Amcor investment case has never been stronger, with resilient organic growth, further acquisition cost synergies, substantial capacity to invest to grow the business and to maintain an attractive dividend. With that operator we'll open up the line for Q&A. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. On full year guidance, could you talk a little more about the drivers of the raise, is it fair to say that improved expectations around organic growth is the primary driver, are there others that you'd highlight? And then when you think about price mix for the year, are you thinking about that as a positive, neutral, negative kind of any color you can give there? Michael John Casamento - Amcor Plc : Yeah. So I'll take the question on the guidance. So look the increase in the guidance really just reflects the increase in the performance in the first quarter which was ahead of our expectations. So we had \u2013 we were pleased with the performance on that front. In terms of the balance of the year, there's no real change in the range of outcomes that we anticipated back in August to what we see today. And so really the key driver was the Q1 performance, clearly we've got good momentum in the business and we're comfortable with where it's heading. So that gave us some confidence to raise the guidance. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then with regards to the mid-single-digit volume growth in North American flexibles, do you feel like you're growing faster than the market, was there any kind of comp issues that you'd flag to the extent that you're saying maybe higher level of demand in CPG categories, do you view that as maybe sustainable. I'm just wondering if you kind of frame the relative strength in North American flexibles because it's a bit better than what the business has done historically and I think what some of your peers are doing. Ronald Stephen Delia - Amcor Plc : Yeah. I'll take that one, Anthony. Look first of all where was the strength in North America in flexibles, it was in some of the real important segments for us going forward; so meat, cheese, pet food, these are all high value added segments. Back to your question on mix, we also had growth in home and personal care which is important as well. I would say that our growth generally speaking is relatively consistent with some of the peers and customers that we track. But I do think that we're performing very well and not missing any opportunities to pick up business along the way. So look, we would expect the business over time to grow roughly with the market as we try to manage mix and optimize mix over time. And that's low-single-digit growth. That's what the expectation would be. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, that's helpful. I'll turn it over. Operator : Your next question is from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi everybody. Just as a follow up to Anthony's last question. Again, back to North American flexibles, was the trend line a mid-single-digit growth pretty consistent during the quarter? Are you seeing comparable momentum going into your second quarter? And then, you call it unfavorable mix for the region. Can you also expand on that? I assume it's partly healthcare weakness, but any color there would be helpful. Thanks. Ronald Stephen Delia - Amcor Plc : Yeah. Look, I think generally speaking month-to-month, week-to-week volatility is still pretty high relative to historical patterns. I mean if I look at generally across Amcor and this would apply to North America too, we had a stronger July, a weaker August, probably a stronger September. It's a little early to talk about the second quarter, but things haven't really changed dramatically. So I'd say where we ended \u2013 mid-single-digits is pretty indicative of the exit run rate if you will. And then on the unfavorable mix comment, yeah, you picked up on the comment on healthcare. Healthcare volumes in North America are more weighted towards medical than pharmaceutical and medical sales have been slow and a lot of that material goes into the operating theater for elective procedures or just general healthcare consumption that sometimes a bit more discretionary. So you're not really surprised to see that but that's a negative mix impact for us. Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then second question for the \u2013 in terms of your outlook for resin and just raw mineral prices more broadly specific to 2Q and possibly 3Q, there have been some substantial resin increases that have been implemented for example in North America, less so in Europe and also freight has picked up, a lot of your peers are calling that out in terms of incremental costs. So just have us \u2013 help us think through the margin paradigm for North America excluding the Bemis synergies which of course is very specific to you. Thanks. Ronald Stephen Delia - Amcor Plc : Yeah. Look I mean, maybe I'll just take the freight part, that's the easier one. Freight \u2013 most freight is passed through to the customer in this business. And so that's really a pretty benign input cost for us. So I wouldn't expect much material impact on freight in any parts of our business. Raw materials is obviously a big part of the cost of sales. It's 50% to 60% depending on the business of the sales line. And no question, we've seen relatively strong increases in several categories particularly in North America. The outlook is for moderation of those increases and more stability going forward. So we could have a little bit of a lag impact in the quarter coming second quarter but nothing that we would project to be material for the full year. And we factored in our outlook on raws around the world into the upgraded guidance today. Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thanks so much, Ron. Ronald Stephen Delia - Amcor Plc : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from John Purtell with Macquarie. John Purtell - Macquarie Group : All good (23:51) hi Ron and Michael. Ronald Stephen Delia - Amcor Plc : Hey John. John Purtell - Macquarie Group : I just had a couple of questions, thank you. Look, just in terms of emerging markets, it looks like sort of things are starting to \u2013 particularly in Asia starting to get back to traditional growth right there after some challenges. Obviously you sort of saw some decent growth in Asia and also in LatAm, just in terms of the drivers of that, Ron. Ronald Stephen Delia - Amcor Plc : Yeah, look it's a good pickup. We're pretty excited about the growth particularly in Asia. China, it seems to be tracking along at kind of mid-single-digits and India, which is a smaller base, up in the double digits. I think we're performing well in the market. I certainly don't think we're getting any help from the market. Those businesses especially India still \u2013 those economies are still somewhat constrained a bit by COVID and in Southeast Asia, in particular, some of the smaller businesses for us are continue to be constrained from COVID impacts. But generally speaking, I think we're executing well. I think the value proposition in those markets for Amcor as a blue chip global supplier with good technology, good business practices, product safety and all the things that have helped us grow over the last several decades, I think are true as much today as ever. And I think we're executing well. John Purtell - Macquarie Group : Thank you. And just in Europe, obviously so marginally lower volumes there, just to sort of understand the drivers of that, was healthcare also affected there, you also talked to lower closure volumes. Ronald Stephen Delia - Amcor Plc : Yeah. Look again pretty consistent with the peers and the customers that we track in that part of the world. Healthcare, a bit soft for the reasons that I referred to in North America, same applies in Europe. Closure businesses or the capsules business there is really levered to the champagne and spirits and wine segments which have been a bit soft. Nothing particularly out of the ordinary, but just for the 90-day period softer volumes in some of those segments. John Purtell - Macquarie Group : Okay. So \u2013 would you have an expectation that some of this still starts to sort of normalize out through the course of the year, it's probably hard to call, but do you see some of these are sort of there's a little bit of cyclicality there? Ronald Stephen Delia - Amcor Plc : Look, I think it's a short period of time. And part of it is the summer months which are hard to read. What's very encouraging about our European business is the offset of mix because of the growth in the higher margin segments. So we had really strong growth in cheese, snacks, pet food, ready meals. And so, those segments creative mixed benefits to us. And we did a positive mix in Europe benefiting the bottom line in the quarter. John Purtell - Macquarie Group : Got it. Just last one if I can, in terms of the buyback, I mean is there anything to read into that as far as list M&A opportunities in the near-term (26:55) still pretty full. Ronald Stephen Delia - Amcor Plc : No, definitely not. I mean multiples are certainly full. That's a separate topic. We'd expect us to be acquisitive. But we monetize investment we had and realized some proceeds and we've simply redeployed those proceeds or simply announced an intention to redeploy those proceeds into share repurchases. John Purtell - Macquarie Group : Got it. Thank you. Ronald Stephen Delia - Amcor Plc : Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question is from Salvator Tiano with Seaport Global. Salvator Tiano - Seaport Global Holdings LLC : Yeah. Hi, Ron, Michael and Tracey. So first thing I wanted to clarify is if you can provide a little bit more color on that beverage strength? And in North America, the volume growth you saw was very strong, I would have thought that even with lockdown seizing (27:41) people are not going out as much and I know a lot of that beverages \u2013 the beverage packaging you make is for on-the-go consumption. So was there some inventory restocking there, some pent up demand from the prior quarter and generally any color would be very helpful? Ronald Stephen Delia - Amcor Plc : Yeah. Look, the business did have a good quarter. It's had volume growth like that before. So it's not unprecedented, but it certainly was strong. I mean, I think longer term, we would expect low-single-digit growth across that beverage space. That's what we've been seeing for a number of years and that's what we're expecting to continue. I would say we've benefited from good customer mix, some of our hot fill business in particular, grew quite well in the back of some strength from particular customers. And has there been any inventory restocking? It's possible. I don't know that that would be a material driver. When we look at retail sales in the period against our sales by segment, we see pretty close to match, it is possible there's a bit of inventory in there though because that number in hot fill of 12% is not what we would typically expect although not unprecedented. Salvator Tiano - Seaport Global Holdings LLC : Yeah. Okay. Perfect. And my second question is a little bit on the M&A front, during the Investor Day also you said you are looking actively obviously your leverage allows that and you're over to one year into the Bemis acquisition, I was wondering would you consider expanding into areas beyond the traditional plastics? And I know it's a little bit unusual given that you did spun out everything for Orora, but you did talk a lot about paper, for example. So does something in the folding carton some space make sense to you at this point? Ronald Stephen Delia - Amcor Plc : First of all, yes, we are on the lookout for acquisitions and we have been acquisitive over the journey. I think we've done 25 or 30 deals in the last 10 years. The first priority just to be crystal clear is to complete the integration of Bemis in the in the flexibles businesses, which is a substantial part of Amcor. We're about 16, 17 months into that and we're not declaring victory yet, so that's the first priority. But we will keep our eyes out for deals. I wouldn't expect us to go outside of our current segment participation, our segment mix to the extent that we can build out the flexibles portfolio in Asia and bolt-on in some of the bigger markets. The rigid business in North America outside of beverage is a place that we find pretty attractive and we've been on the diversification path of our rigid business for the last five, seven years. So I'd like to be more active there. But I think the big constraint is likely to be valuations. Valuations are quite high and that doesn't seem to be abating. So we'll continue to be on the lookout. We'll be active, we have the balance sheet as you suggested. We'll have that management bandwidth in flexibles, I would say we have it already in rigids and we hope to be active. Salvator Tiano - Seaport Global Holdings LLC : Thank you very much. Ronald Stephen Delia - Amcor Plc : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Brook Campbell with JPMorgan. Brook Campbell-Crawford - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just had one range \u2013 the targeted synergies there for this financial year. The range there \u2013 just trying to understand the focus of cost to sort of explain that range and trying to understand really what needs to happen to get to the top end there for FY 2021? Ronald Stephen Delia - Amcor Plc : Yeah, Brook, it's Ron. Let me try and I think I'm not sure I heard the question completely, but let me see if I've gotten it. So, question was about synergies this year, the composition of the synergy benefits and what would it take to get to the upper end of the range I think... Brook Campbell-Crawford - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.: Yeah, the range. Ronald Stephen Delia - Amcor Plc : ...yep. Okay. Good. So, the range for the year is $50 million to $70 million of the EBIT benefit. We've hit $20 million in the first quarter, so a little bit ahead I guess sort of pace. The composition through the quarter is a bit balanced between continued G&A reductions and procurement and a little bit of footprint. If we look out over the remainder of the financial year, we would expect \u2013 we went into the year expecting footprint to be a bigger component of that $50 million to $70 million. And so that often is the footprint initiatives often be dependent on our ability to execute and get to the sites that need to be rationalized, get OEMs and contractors and technicians out to those sites. And some of those things can be impeded with mobility restrictions and other implications of COVID. So, we've been a bit cautious with regard to that source of synergies and for us to get to the top end of that range, will require us to be able to execute unimpeded some of the footprint initiatives. Brook Campbell-Crawford - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.: That's very clear. Thank you for that. And then my second question just on \u2013 I might have missed this in the release. But any sort of guidance you can provide on corporate expense and interest for the full FY 2021 period would be great. Michael John Casamento - Amcor Plc : Yeah. Hi, Brook. It's Michael here. Look, we're not giving any specific guidance on those items, we gave \u2013 they're kind of all covered in the EPS range, so we put out there. I guess what I can tell you is if there was something materially different, we'd let you know, but I think so corporate expenses, we're on track and will be similar to prior year, perhaps a little higher. Interest, I think you've got to look at interest and tax on a combined basis. You saw in the quarter, we had some interest benefit there year-on-year with an offsetting tax. And that's going to be similar as we head our way through the year. So you'd expect that on an absolute basis, the spend in interest in taxes is going to be similar perhaps slightly higher than prior year. But I guess overall, that's all factored into our EPS guidance range. Brook Campbell-Crawford - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from George Staphos with Bank of America. George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi everyone. Good day. Thanks for all the details. I wanted to drill into rigid packaging a little bit if we can go back to slide 8, guys. And so you mentioned very strong volumes in North American bev, hot fill up 12%, specialty up, you mentioned good mix. The volume growth and the mix considerations you mentioned would have normally led me to believe, you'd see a bit more incremental volume or \u2013 incremental margin 1Q versus 1Q. I think you said there was some absorption issue as well. Can you help me go from what was real good volume and good mix to 4% EBIT growth at the reported level and then I had a follow on. Ronald Stephen Delia - Amcor Plc : Yeah. Look, first of all the EBIT growth as we would look at it was 7% of the 4% volume and I mean really simply... George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. Ronald Stephen Delia - Amcor Plc : ...really simply stated \u2013 I mean you pretty much called out the drivers. We had good mix in North America and good volume growth although the profit impact of that was tampered a bit by drawing out of inventories given the strength of those volumes. So you know that when you pull out of inventory you've got a bit of a negative impact there. So I would say that that normalizes over time (35:24) George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : What was that inventory factor if you could comment to that? Ronald Stephen Delia - Amcor Plc : George, I mean in the grand scheme of the whole financial year, not material. It's just \u2013 it would have held back the growth of a couple of percentage points potentially. And then you have to remember we also had negative volume growth in Latin America. We were down 3%. So those are the building blocks. The headline here though is this is a \u2013 this business is performing really well. It's very healthy and it's growing in the right segments. George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Appreciate that. My other question is on sustainability and kind of a two parter if I could and I'll turn it over. First of all, from the work that you've done, what do you think or what are your customers telling you is most resonating with the consumer in terms of sustainability? Is it footprint? Is it recyclability? Is it light weight? I know it's going be all of the above. But if you had to pick one thing that right now is most resonating with the consumer what is it on sustainability? And on the AmLite, when that comes back \u2013 it's end of life story, what is that \u2013 what's occurring? Is that going back into polypropylene, recycling structure, how is that ultimately recyclable in a positive? Thanks guys and good luck in the quarter. Ronald Stephen Delia - Amcor Plc : Yeah. Thanks, George. Two really good questions. The first one is an excellent question because I think we've got to remember that the consumer ultimately has a massive role to play in this. They've got to participate at the end whether it's reusing something or composting it or recycling it. And there's a lot of \u2013 there's an expansive narrative in the space that covers a lot of different things. What seems pretty clear to us and to our customers and we have good insights here through a number of the organizations and associations that we sit side by side with the big brand owners on, that the consumer gravitates more towards recycling. And I think it's because it's the easiest thing for the consumer to get their head around. The idea to recycle something if the infrastructure exists is the easiest thing for the consumer to embrace. Composting can have a place, but that also requires infrastructure which is just less ubiquitous around the world and is a little complicated, if you think about the science of it. And the reuse systems while they have a place and they'll have a role and there's a lot of buzz about some of those reusable systems. We've not seen and we've done a bit of research \u2013 primary research on this ourselves. We've not seen lots of consumer take-up at scale on reusable systems. And I know that's not \u2013 doesn't make us popular necessarily with some of the rhetoric from the NGOs. But I think it's the reality. And if we want a better outcome here, we need to embrace what the consumer is interested in adopting. So that that would be the long answer to a short question. We would say it's recyclability, is the outcome that resonates most with the consumer. On AmLite HeatFlex really quickly, that's a multilayered structure which is constructed with basically the same base polymers which are consistent and allow it to be compatible with the polyethylene recycling stream that exists in places in Europe where that pouches is hit the market. So hopefully that answers the question on AmLite. Operator : And your next question is from Richard Johnson with Jefferies. Richard Johnson - Jefferies: Thank you very much. And just a quick one to start with. Michael, could you clarify whether any of the $20 million incremental synergy was in the corporate line, please? Michael John Casamento - Amcor Plc : No, it was all in flexibles, Richard. Richard Johnson - Jefferies: Fantastic. And then just on the topic of restructuring, if I look at your reconciliation table for adjusted EBIT and I look at the material restructuring and related costs, I was just wondering if you could just clarify whether the number in flexible is all Bemis related? And then talk a little bit around what's going on in \u2013 on rigid packaging because that number has obviously gone up a lot year-on-year. And I'm just interested to know as well, whether there's any footprint reduction across the group that's outside of the two effective restructuring programs we know about which is obviously Bemis synergies and the rigids restructuring? Thank you. Michael John Casamento - Amcor Plc : Yeah, so I can take that one, Richard. So under flexibles, yes, that's all Bemis related. Under rigid packaging, yeah, I mean it's just a timing point around some of the actions we've taken relating to some of the G&A and the plant work that we've been doing. So we'll finish that program this year. We've only got really one site left to close on that front. So that'll be finished this year with full run rate by the end of the year as we exit the year, so that's covered off. And then, the... Ronald Stephen Delia - Amcor Plc : Plant closure (40:34) Michael John Casamento - Amcor Plc : ...yeah, we just had one \u2013 we had one plant closure during the period which we took in the EBIT line, it was about $9 million of cost which is in the result. Richard Johnson - Jefferies: And what was that? Michael John Casamento - Amcor Plc : It's a plant in Switzerland. Richard Johnson - Jefferies: Fantastic, great. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question is from Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal. Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Hi, Ron and Mike. Ronald Stephen Delia - Amcor Plc : Hey there, Mark. Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: First question. I wondered if you could just give us a little color on the strength that you had called out in the specialty carton business this quarter and kind of related to that whether tobacco packaging is an issue at all for any of the ESG investors? Ronald Stephen Delia - Amcor Plc : Yeah. The business in \u2013 the specialty cartons business had a really good first quarter. Volumes essentially flat, we had some strength in the Americas, as we highlighted, some softness in Asia, Southeast Asia, in particular, pretty flat in Europe. So all up, we had a pretty good top line and the business is executed really, really well. It continues to drive cost out and optimize its operations. So we're pleased with that business. It's a good margin business, big cash generator and it's got a leadership position in each of the markets around the world. The second part of the question, the short answer is no. I think investors realize we're not actually in that end market. We're printing a cartoon board and shaping it and then it gets filled with a product that sometimes creates issues from an ESG perspective, but we're not an active participant in that end market any more than the bank who finances those companies and those customers is an active participant. So short answer on the ESG related point is no, no issue. Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Okay. And then I wanted to just toggle over to Brazil, that was a big business for Bemis historically. We've seen in a number of other packaging products a pretty marked pickup over the last two or three months, it sounds like you didn't get any of that in the first quarter, but I wonder if you're seeing any pickup right now in Brazil? Ronald Stephen Delia - Amcor Plc : Yeah. Look, we actually had a good quarter in Brazil. We had higher volumes in rigid packaging in Brazil and our flexible business, our core flexible business in Brazil and flexibles grew as well. Now, the offset somewhat was we have a disposable business there which is one of the old Dixie Toga businesses. And that's really impaired because there's no food service and there's not much action happening from the disposables perspective. These are paper plates \u2013 paper, poly plates and cups and things. So there was some softness \u2013 there is softness continuing in that segment in Brazil, but the core of what we're going to do their long-term rigid packaging and flexibles and thermo forming has grown and did grow in the quarter. Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Okay. And then if I guess just slip one other thing in here. You raised guidance, I think you've held the free cash flow number for the year. Any thoughts to being able to bump that up at all? Michael John Casamento - Amcor Plc : Look, it's Michael here. Look, the free cash flow number has a reasonable range in it. So it's $1 billion to $1.1 billion. The guidance increase really fits within that range. So we've kind of left it for there for the moment if we think that that's going to change over the year, we'll update you as we progress through. Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: All right. We'll stay tuned. Thanks, Michael. Ronald Stephen Delia - Amcor Plc : Thanks, Mark. Operator : Our next question is from Larry Gandler with Credit Suisse. Larry Gandler - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.: Thanks, guys for taking my question. Ron, my question is about the synergy, first one. Amcor being is a constructive and proactive company as it is. Is it possible to think that as you guys close the Bemis deal or after, you went to your largest customers in North America, of course, that happens \u2013 hang on a second. Can you hear me, Ron? Ronald Stephen Delia - Amcor Plc : Yeah. No problem. Larry Gandler - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.: Sorry. Sorry about that. Ronald Stephen Delia - Amcor Plc : That's okay. Larry Gandler - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.: So you would come to your largest customers in North America and say look, we have some gross synergy that will develop out of the merger. Can we work an arrangement where we share some this synergy, but it's a win-win we get a larger part of your business? And if those sort of conversations happen with your larger customers very persistent. Can you kind of maybe describe some of that and how that's influencing these more recent results? I'm going to throw my phone out the window in a second. Ronald Stephen Delia - Amcor Plc : Yeah, no, that's all right. Yeah. Look I don't know that we're seeing material impact on our top-line yet from those discussions, but there is no question that there is good things happening from a commercial perspective that are coming from this acquisition. The most obvious is the ability to engage with some of these big brand owners to help satisfy their needs around the world not just from a supply perspective but back to the sustainability agenda, the joint development programs we have on R&D and product development. So that's started really from the beginning. There is other examples where we've been able to secure a business in certain parts of the world because of strength and our value proposition in other parts of the world. So I think that will continue and the benefits will accrue over time. The other part of the commercial story for us is just leveraging the commercial capabilities that Amcor's refined over the years around margin management and mix management and layering those on to the legacy Bemis portfolio. And then taking some of the segments that we've acquired here particularly around meat and cheese and protein packaging, it's film based and levering that across our structure around the world, we're getting more active in that regard. But that will take some time to see real top line benefit. So I'm not sure you're seeing it in this result. And I'm not sure you'll see it this financial year. But I think over time, we expect to have commercial benefits. Larry Gandler - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.: Yeah, it was meet that particularly picked my curiosity because you do seem to be bucking the performance of many companies participating in that space even Kraftime (47:17) your largest customer in the first quarter called out, I think weaker meat volumes. Ronald Stephen Delia - Amcor Plc : Yeah. Larry Gandler - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.: And you had COVID impacting that sector with difficulty to get people to abattoirs \u2013 labor to abattoirs. Ronald Stephen Delia - Amcor Plc : Yeah. Larry Gandler - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.: You do seem to be (47:33) Ronald Stephen Delia - Amcor Plc : Look I think in that segment, you're right there is some disruption in the supply chain there and some of the meat packing plants have been constrained a little bit. But despite that, I think we're performing pretty well, we'll probably be taking some share... Larry Gandler - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.: Yeah. Ronald Stephen Delia - Amcor Plc : ...and probably outgrowing the market in that space as we believe we should do and we've got great products. Larry Gandler - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.: And that's not related to sort of constructive conversations with customers around sharing synergy here. Ronald Stephen Delia - Amcor Plc : All of our conversations are constructive. But just on the back of the value proposition, that starts with the product. Larry Gandler - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.: Okay. Great. And a financial question for Michael. Just on a AMVIG, there's some associate income or equity accounted income reported is that AMVIG and will that zero out for the rest of the financial year? Michael John Casamento - Amcor Plc : That's exactly right, Larry. So we had $3 million for the first quarter and then from now on, it will be zero versus the prior year where we had $11 million for the full year. Larry Gandler - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.: I think equity accounted line was $19 million in the quarter. Michael John Casamento - Amcor Plc : Yeah that includes the gain on sale. Larry Gandler - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.: Okay. Yeah. Michael John Casamento - Amcor Plc : So the underlying which (48:48) out if you look at the table with the adjustments that gain on sale was taken out of the result. So was just the base $3 million that was in the base result. Larry Gandler - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.: Okay. Fantastic. Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Keith Chau with MST Marquee. Please go ahead. Keith Chau - MST Financial Services Pty Ltd. (Marquee Research): Good morning, Ron and Michael. Just going back to interest cost, Michael, for the full year. I think the full year result, you called out interest expenses is going to change materially for the year. I think at the time, you may mention of the $500 million bond rollover and a high cost and then low interest rates balancing out to a net kind of similar outcome for this year. Seemingly, the first quarter, net interest expense was significantly lower than the first quarter of last year and also the fourth quarter of last year as well, notwithstanding a high net debt balance. So I'm just wondering the guidance this year, I know you spoke about it earlier today, but I just wanted to dig into that a little bit further and just trying to work out what the order of magnitude and change could be at the interest line going forward please. Michael John Casamento - Amcor Plc : Yeah. As I said, I mean, we're not going to call out numbers specifically. Clearly in interest, we've had some benefit during the period continued low interest rates, so this quarter versus this time last year, I mean it's a 200 basis point reduction in LIBOR and we're still getting really good access to commercial paper both in the US and Europe. So we've had quite a strong benefit there in the period, more pronounced than it will be for the rest of the year because interest rates started to come down this time last year and progressed through the year. That said, look, we will have a lower interest number, but you've got to look at that interest number in line with tax as well. And they offset clearly we saw an offset and we've seen increased tax in absolute terms and the ATR. So as I said earlier, we will see some lower interest now at the full year, but the offset will be tax. So we're going to have a higher tax bill just based on higher earnings and perhaps a slightly higher ATR as well. So when you put all that together, net-net you add those two together in absolute terms, they're going to be pretty similar to the number last year. Keith Chau - MST Financial Services Pty Ltd. (Marquee Research): Okay. Okay, fantastic. Perhaps maybe if we look at it first quarter to fourth quarter last year because rates albeit have gone down, but not as much as kind of the first quarter versus first quarter last year. The $45 million in net interest in the fourth quarter last year, playing that $37 million for the first quarter, is there any kind of timing issues here that we should be thinking about from a quarter-on-quarter basis? Michael John Casamento - Amcor Plc : There was some additional costs we had just on some of the bonds and the like in that period. So \u2013 but I think overall, the interest bill will converge as we head through the year. Keith Chau - MST Financial Services Pty Ltd. (Marquee Research): Okay. Excellent. And then the second one just very quick one on Bemis synergies, can you give us some guidance as to whether there will be some Bemis synergies allocated to corporate for the full year? Ronald Stephen Delia - Amcor Plc : Keith, it's Ron. It's unlikely. Most of the synergies in corporate were executed very, very early on post close. And so we were \u2013 for all intents and purposes, all the synergies this year will be in the flexibles segment. Keith Chau - MST Financial Services Pty Ltd. (Marquee Research): Okay. Great. Thanks very much, gents. Ronald Stephen Delia - Amcor Plc : Thanks, Keith. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Ron for closing remarks. Ronald Stephen Delia - Amcor Plc : Okay. Thanks, operator, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call. And I think we'll close it there. Thank you.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Tracey Whitehead, Global Head of Investor Relations. Ma\u2019am, please go ahead. Tracey Whitehead : Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Amcor's first-half earnings call for fiscal 2021. Joining the call today is Ron Delia, our Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Casamento, our Chief Financial Officer. At this time, I'm directing your attention to our website, amcor.com, under the Investors section, where you'll find our press release and presentation which will be discussed on the call today. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures and related reconciliations can be found in the press release and the presentation. Also a reminder that statements regarding future performance of the Company made during this call are forward-looking and may subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ from historical, expected or predicted results due to a number of factors. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our statements on 10-K and 10-Q forms to review these factors. With that, I'll hand over to Ron. Ronald Delia : Thanks, Tracey, and thanks, everyone, for being with us today to discuss Amcor\u2019s first-half results for the 2021 fiscal year. We appreciate you taking the time and making the effort to join the call. As Tracey mentioned, joining me on the line today is Michael Casamento, Amcor\u2019s CFO, and we\u2019ll start with some brief prepared comments before we take your questions. But the first place we'll start on Slide 3 is with safety, and everything we do at Amcor starts with safety. And this year, of course, we are also focused on keeping all of our coworkers healthy as well. And over the last 12 months, our COVID protocols have enabled us to do just that while also keeping our plants running to supply our food and healthcare customers around the world. And despite the added challenges of operating during the pandemic, our safety performance has continued to be a real highlight. Across the company, we reduced the number of injuries by almost 30% during the first-half, and all of our business groups had fewer injuries compared to the first-half last year. And we are also pleased to report that over half of our sites around the world were injury-free for at least 12 months. So we still have not reached our goal of no injuries, but we need to acknowledge the commitment and focus of all of our coworkers to keeping each other healthy and also safe, especially in the current environment. Our key messages for today are set out on Slide 4. First, Amcor had a strong first-half of fiscal 2021 ahead of our expectations, balanced across all businesses and regions. And that strong first-half translates into higher expectations for the full-year on the back of strong momentum in the base business. And so the second key message today is that we've raised our outlook for EPS growth for full-year fiscal 2021 to 10% to 14% on a constant currency basis. Third, we are also increasing cash returns to shareholders through a higher dividend and $200 million of additional share repurchases. And the fourth point is that we continue to believe Amcor has never been better positioned from an investment case perspective. And I'll spend a few minutes explaining why we believe that before I turn it over to Michael, who will describe the recent results in more detail. Slide 5 is a simple snapshot of Amcor today and understanding who we are and what we do has to be the basis for understanding that investment case. The company has been around a long time, over 160 years, and is now the global leader in consumer packaging. And Amcor is a truly global company with scale positions in every major region, including over $3 billion of annual sales in faster-growing emerging markets, where we also have leadership and scale positions. Essentially, all of our sales are the fast-moving consumer and healthcare segments. And the healthcare business now generates around $2 billion of sales each year to the medical device and pharmaceutical markets, which are among the most attractive places to play in the packaging industry. And finally, regardless of whether they are operating in developed or emerging markets or in consumer or healthcare segments, all of our businesses go to market with differentiated innovation capabilities, which are increasingly valued by our customers as they look for packaging to meet shifting consumer needs around the world. Slide 6 is another quick snapshot, this one to highlight Amcor\u2019s performance and track record over the last 10 years. And we've maintained, as a starting point, a consistent investment-grade capital structure, despite several transformational transactions and we've driven consistent sales and earnings growth, and always had high cash conversion. And that cash flow has funded capital investment in the business in close to 30 acquisitions over this time period, along with share repurchases and a growing dividend with an attractive yield. And added together and shareholders have been rewarded as well as the company has delivered consistent operating performance. Now going forward, we expect our operating performance and cash flow to remain at least the strong and our approach to allocating that cash is set out on Slide 7. This is not new. There is no changes here to this framework, but it's worth just reviewing. We consistently generate significant free cash flow every year. And this year, our free cash flow will be nearly $1.1 billion and that number will grow over time. And that cash flow will comfortably support reinvestment in the business as well as M&A or share repurchases. And in addition, we will continue to pay an attractive and growing dividend, which has historically yielded between 4% and 5%. Taking together, the EPS growth and dividend yield should result in 10% to 15% of shareholder value each year. And so while we've been delivering returns to shareholders at this level for a long time now, momentum is building in the business and we believe this is a special time for the company and our investors. Slide 8 is the slide we shared last year at our investor briefing and it remains relevant today. And we believe that the Amcor investment case is as strong now as it's ever been and we set out the reasons why in this slide. And several of the points I've made already, global leadership positions, consistent growth from attractive markets, strong balance sheet and cash flow to fund growth and dividends and a consistent track record, and they're all important features of our investment case, but we also believe that momentum matters in business. And in that respect - in that respect, the last point on the slide might just be the most important. Momentum has been building across the Amcor over the last couple of years and we expect it to continue. And that should be clear from our recent performance, including the first-half result and the increased full-year guidance that we are announcing today. At the core of our investment case is the consistent organic growth Amcor generates in several ways as set out on Slide 9. The starting point for the organic growth is the mix of growing end markets we play in and that's especially true in emerging markets. We've had a long history of profitable participation and profitable growth in emerging markets and high-impact locations like China and India continue to grow sales and profit at impressive rates, including in the most recent half. Managing our sales mix across higher-value, more packaging-intensive consumer end markets like protein and premium coffee and more differentiated product types like hot-fill containers or barrier films drives consistent margin expansion and volume growth over time. And we have a global healthcare business approaching $2 billion in sales from every region in the world and across the pharmaceutical and medical device segments. Innovation is also an important growth driver for Amcor and probably the area where we are the most differentiated from our competition. Our customers are launching new products in Amcor packaging regularly. We've highlighted a few examples here of new and actually more sustainable products commercialized in recent months, including an extension of our HeatFlex family of products with a world's first microwavable recycle-ready pouch for food and some premium coffee packaging using a bio-based polymer. And finally, a common thread that cuts across all of what we do is sustainability, which we believe is Amcor\u2019s greatest opportunity for growth and differentiation. A few more comments on Slide 10 to describe our comprehensive sustainability agenda, which includes our products, but also our factories. Of course, we're deeply committed to the idea of responsible packaging and we're working with our partners upstream and downstream to address concerns about packaging waste in the environment. We've stepped up to take a leadership role in the development of responsible packaging, which we believe requires three things. The first is package design, which accounts for the full product life cycle in addition to the end-of-life or waste profile. And Amcor is uniquely positioned here with leading R&D and innovation capabilities to handle the packaged design requirements and we pointed out some examples already in this presentation. The other two requirements for responsible packaging required collaboration with others across our value chain and Amcor has been active in that way as well to help drive improvements in waste management and consumer participation. A couple of examples over the last six months help highlight that work. In one case, Amcor has joined with 35 leading brands and retailers in the consumer goods forum in a CEO-led initiative to develop packaged design rules to deliver packaging that's easier and more cost-effective to recycle. And another example, we've extended our work with the Carbon Trust to launch a label that can be printed on pack to indicate reduced CO2 intensity and provide greater transparency to the carbon footprint reductions enabled by our packaging. And the value created through our work in these initiatives and the progress we've made across a range of other ESG areas, including our EnviroAction program in all of our plants to drive greenhouse gas reduction, waste and water reduction continues to be recognized by leading independent organizations, most recently MSCI and Dow Jones. Turning now to a summary of our first-half results on Slide 11. We had strong earnings growth with EPS up 16% in constant currency terms, including 7% organic growth and strengthened both the Rigid Packaging and Flexible segments. Demand for our products remained balanced across the regions and businesses, resulting in volume and sales growth in every region and 3% for Amcor overall. The execution discipline and operating performance of the businesses drove cost performance, which also contributed to the organic profit growth. Roughly 6% of the EPS growth came from synergies from the Bemis acquisition, which was ahead of expectations, and cost synergies totaled an incremental $35 million pretax during the half. And lastly, benefits from share repurchases accounted for the remaining EPS growth. Free cash flow was in line with expectations and our balance sheet remains strong and the company returned $450 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the first six months. Strength in the underlying business also enables us to increase cash returns to shareholders for the balance of the year. The Board declared a quarterly dividend of $11.75 per share, which is higher than the prior year. And we announced today an additional $200 million of share repurchases, bringing the total announced this year to $350 million, which we expect to complete during the remainder of FY2021. The key theme enabling the strong performance in the half across the company has been the ability of every one of our businesses to execute and outperform against the things that are within our control, despite an incredibly challenging in volatile external environment. Safety, working capital, cost synergies, cost performance innovation, in all of those areas the execution has been outstanding and we could not be more pleased with the performance of our teams through the first six months of the year. The key message here is that Amcor had a strong first-half with results ahead of expectations and we have an improved outlook for the full-year and increased dividends and share repurchases to go along with it. With that, I'll hand over to Michael to provide some additional color on the financial performance to the half year and the outlook for the rest of 2021. Michael Casamento : Thanks, Ron, and hi, everyone. I'll start with some comments on the Flexible segment on Slide 12. Overall segment volumes were 2% higher than the prior year. As Ron mentioned, demand has been broad-based with growth across all regions in the low-to-mid single-digit range. From an end market perspective, we've seen solid growth in food, pet food and beverage categories. And this was partially offset by lower volumes in certain healthcare end markets driven by reduced elective surgery rates and lower prescription trends. Higher volumes were partially offset by unfavorable price mix, resulting in net sales being 1% higher than the first-half of last year, excluding the unfavorable impacts of currency and the pass-through of lower raw material costs. Adjusted EBIT for the period grew 9% in constant currency terms and margins expanded by 110 basis points driven by the higher volumes, strong operating cost performance and $30 million of cost synergy benefits, which I'll come back to in a moment. Particularly pleasing to see the strong performance of the Flexibles business is continuing to improve as we extract benefits from the Bemis acquisition, deliver innovative new products to support customer growth and operate our plants efficiently. Now turning to Slide 13 and synergies. So in terms of cost synergies related to the Bemis acquisition, the ability to continue delivering benefits from overhead reduction, procurement and adjustments to our operating footprint has been exceptional, despite the need to address some additional challenges prevented in a current environment. As Ron mentioned, we are tracking ahead of expectations with $35 million of benefits included in our first-half results. And given the strong progress we have made across the range of synergy projects in the last six months, we now expect to deliver approximately $70 million in fiscal 2021, which is at the top-end of our previous guidance range. This means at the end of this fiscal year, we'll have reached $150 million of cumulative benefits. We also have good visibility to remaining initiatives, which leaves us very confident with regards to our original expectation of $190 million in cumulative benefits by the end of fiscal 2022. Turning to Rigid Packaging on Slide 14. In summary, the business delivered another outstanding result with organic growth driving year-to-date earnings of 10% higher than the same period last year. Sales growth included a 6% increase in volumes as well as a 4% price mix benefit, including higher price to recover cost inflation in Latin America. Volume performance continues to be strong in North America and mix is positive. Beverage volumes were up 9% compared with last year and hot fill container volumes were up 19%. There's been strong consumer demand across all beverage segments, particularly in hot fill categories, including juice and sports drinks where Amcor also benefited from favorable customer mix. The strong demand reflects higher at home consumption of packaged beverage products. And this has been supported by the work brand owners have done to increase the availability of multi-packs across the wider range of product categories and through the launch of innovative brand extension and new health and wellness oriented product in PET containers. Specialty container volumes were also higher as a result of continued growth in spirits, personal care and home cleaning categories. As a partial offset, volumes are marginally lower in Latin America. This represents a sequential improvement in trends generally improved through the current half. While we saw a higher volumes in Brazil, Central America and Argentina, month-to-month variability continues and performance remains mixed by country in the regions. Strong overall EBIT growth of 10% reflects good leverage from the 6% volume growth and favorable mix across the business partly offset by higher labor and transportation costs in North America, which were incurred in order to service the higher demand. So overall, we are happy with the performance of this business during the half year. I believe we are well positioned to support customer needs and deliver continued growth. Moving to cash flow and shareholder returns on Slide 15. Adjusted free cash flow of $276 million was higher than the prior year, excluding approximately $50 million of U.S. cash tax payments that were deferred under the CARES Act from Q4 2020. And as a reminder, our cash flow is seasonally weaker in the first-half of the fiscal year and this outcome was in line with our expectations, which believes us on track to deliver more than a $1 billion in this financial year. We remain focused on improved working capital management and execution has been strong across all businesses with our rolling 12-month average working capital sales ratio continuing to improve closing at 8.2% of the sales at the end of December. This represents more than a $300 million reduction in average working capital over the last 18 months since the Bemis acquisition. Our financial profile remained strong and leverages 2.9x on a trailing 12-month EBITDA basis, which is in line with where we would expect to be at this time in the fiscal year. As Ron mentioned, with strong annual cash flow and an investment-grade credit rating, the business has significant capacity and flexibility to invest in the many growth opportunities available to us as well as increased returns compared to a growing dividend and further share repurchases. In terms of the outlook for fiscal 2021 full-year on Slide 16, the strong start for the year through solid volume-driven organic growth and synergy outperformance, as well as the momentum we see in the business are the two factors which have given us the confidence to rise our 2021 full-year guidance for the second consecutive quarter. We expect the business will continue to execute, deliver further synergy benefits and grow organically as a global supplier for essential consumer and healthcare products. However, we are also maintaining a reasonably wide range of outcomes for the remaining six months of our fiscal year, which is appropriate given the ongoing uncertainty and complexity related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We now expect constant currency EPS growth range of 10% to 14%, and while we continue to expect adjusted free cash flow between $1 billion to $1.1 billion, we see more opportunities to deliver cash flow towards the top half of that range. To recap, the business is performing very well. Growth from organic sources and synergies is strong. Our financial profile remains solid, and we are positioned to deliver another year of EPS growth in 2021, which will be ahead of our original expectations. So with that, I'll hand it back to Ron. Ronald Delia : Thanks, Michael. Just in closing our opening remarks today and come back to where we started, Amcor had a strong first-half to the 2021 fiscal year with results ahead of our expectations and growth balanced across the businesses and regions, and the strong start and momentum in the business has translated into higher expectations for the full-year and we raised our outlook for fiscal 2021. We've also increased cash returns to shareholders through a higher dividend and an additional $200 million of share repurchases, and we continue to believe that the Amcor investment case has never been stronger with consistent organic growth and momentum building, substantial capacity to invest to grow and also to maintain an attractive dividend. With that, operator, we'll open the line up for Q&A. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Keith Chau from MST Marquee. Your line is now open. Keith Chau : Good morning or good evening, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my question, Ron and Michael. The first one is just on that hot-fill product category. The numbers just seem to be a belief in the second quarter, volumes up 19% in first-half 2021, up 12% in the first quarter. So the implied numbers going into the second quarter with north of 20% or close to the mid-20s. So I'm just wondering if you can give us a sense of, has there been anything in particular that's driven that whether there has been a pull-forward of volumes? How sustainable you think that is going into the balance of the year, please? Ronald Delia : Yes. No, it\u2019s a good question. It's a real highlight. Look, I think, as we look across the business, that is a standout in terms of volume. I think there's a couple of things going on there. Firstly, retail sales are very strong and our volumes track pretty closely to what we're seeing at retail for some of the main categories that we supply hot-fill containers for. So hot-fill juices, iced teas, isotonics, those categories have been very strong throughout the whole first-half and especially in the second quarter. I think it's a combination of things, Keith. There's some additional sales going through multi-packs and big box retailers, which are certainly helping. There's an introduction of the new products. Our customer mix has been quite favorable and I think all of those things are contributing. I mean, clearly, these are higher growth rates than we would normally see. This is a segment that should grow kind of low-to-mid single digits. So it\u2019s a particularly strong period. Keith Chau : And Ron, do you think that particular stream can carry through into the third and fourth quarters or at least the third quarter? Things are pretty hard to get a handle on under the consumer backdrop at the moment, but is there something that you're seeing persisting into the third quarter already? Ronald Delia : Look, I think some of the things that I mentioned will persist for a while, but not at this level, Keith. I think, as we look around demand patterns, there's a couple of anomalies that stand out for us. On the negative side, we've had soft healthcare volumes across the business. On the positive side, we've had strong beverage volumes. Both of those have to be influenced to some extent by at-home consumption and other COVID-related factors. So it's very difficult to predict that aspect of it. But I think some of the underlying trends around new product launches, multi-pack sales, some of our particular customers gaining share, those things we would expect to continue. But all of that is incorporated into our overall guidance for the full fiscal year. Keith Chau : Okay. Thank you. And then my second question is just on Bemis synergies. They continue to track ahead of expectations or at least up to the top end. And I think momentum in both FY 2020 and the first-half of 1H \u2013 sorry, first-half of FY 2021 still remains pretty strong. So it seems like almost a foregone conclusion that the total target could be upgraded at some point in time. I know that hasn't been done at this juncture. But can you give us, I guess, a sense Ron or Michael on where, I guess, our synergies are overachieving relative to expectations? Ronald Delia : Yes. Look, to the first part of your question, I might just address first. I think, we feel increasingly confident about the $180 million that we committed to. So I think we would expect to exit at the end of this fiscal year, we would be exiting at a run rate that would be at that level. Now it's also getting increasingly difficult to pull apart what\u2019s the synergy versus what's the base business driver. I mean, as you can imagine, the businesses are completely integrated now. As far as what's driving the performance, generally speaking, I think we've probably exceeded our expectations across the three big cost synergy buckets. So overheads, which came out faster and probably yielded a bit more benefit than we would've thought that the procurement savings have been higher than we would have expected, and footprint which is building momentum is also positively contributing. And I guess if we're thinking about this year, in particular, we've gotten some more footprint benefits than we thought we might be able to given the COVID backdrop, which makes those projects difficult to execute. Keith Chau : Great. Thanks very much. I leave it there. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Wilde from Bank of Montreal. Your line is now open. Mark Wilde : Yes. Congratulations, Ron, Mike and Tracey. Very nice start to the year. Mike, I wondered if \u2013 sorry, Ron, I wondered if there's any way you could help us think about sort of how much of the strength you think is tied to more food-at-home kind of a COVID-related issue because we are seeing most consumer packaging companies report very good volumes over the last couple of quarters. So when you just think about your portfolio, how do you think about what's kind of being driven by COVID versus just the underlying business? Ronald Delia : Yes. Look, that's the question, Mark. And we - like everyone else, we spend a lot of time trying to unpack that. And the conclusion we've come to is that, we really had no net impact one way or the other. And the way we get there, if you just take the big chunks of drivers, we've had a lot of extra costs in the business and increasingly so as we've continued to operate. And we've had lots of folks out on quarantine. We've had lots of overtime to backfill those people. We have lots of extra shipping going around in the rigids business. So there's a lot of costs to be born in this environment, first of all. And then the offset to that is obviously some stronger volumes in certain segments like the beverage segment that we talked about a minute or two ago. The offset is, commercially is healthcare, which is a really high-margin, attractive profitable segment for us has been really soft. Medical device consumption generally has been very low with less elective procedures, surgeries, and otherwise prescriptions have been way down, and so the sales in that healthcare business have been way off. So higher costs in many parts of the business, some strong sales in some segments like beverage, offsetting some weak sales in medical and pharmaceutical, the net-net of all those puts and takes as we look at the business is really not much. And 3% sales growth is not too far off where we've been historically. We've been at about 2% over the last five or six years, and the profit growth is flowing from that, plus the cost performance and synergies in the business. So I mean, we do a lot of work on this and there's a lot of interest in it, but our conclusion is there's really no net impact. Mark Wilde : Okay. And then for my follow-up, I wondered, Ron, if you could just give us a kind of a quick lay of the land for plastic packaging in your key markets from a political and regulatory environment. It seems like in the short-term, you've benefited because people have kind of moved to kind of more single use products. I mean, we aren't seeing people here in the states go to the grocery store with kind of a returnable bags anymore. But at the same time, it seems like from a medium-term perspective, we are seeing kind of more discussion in Europe and even here in the U.S. to some degree of producers having to fund sort of end-of-life solutions to packaging and that winds up getting embedded in the cost. So maybe if you could just give us a sense of kind of what you're seeing from a political and regulatory standpoint in just your main markets? Ronald Delia : Yes. I mean, I\u2019ll start with that part of your question. You asked about the political environment. I would maybe broaden that to just say the general environment, political, consumer, customer and otherwise. I mean, the short answer I would give you is, you asked how we see that environment evolving. And the short answer I would say is, it's improving and it's improving for a couple of reasons. One that you highlighted already, which is that I think the value of packaging and the role it plays in food and healthcare has become even more evident over the last 12 months. I don't know that we need to spend a lot of time explaining that. But I think the idea of packaged food is clear, I think, the distribution of medicines, and now we see vaccines and how important packaging is and the delivery devices are in that process. So I think the value of packaging has increased in the eyes of pretty much any observer. As it relates to plastic, I think the other thing that's happening, which is quite helpful is an increasing focus on greenhouse gases and climate. And I think as people and stakeholders get more and more educated holistically on the environmental impacts of different types of packaging, I think increasingly, plastic scores pretty well. And that's why we continue to see our customers very focused on finding better alternatives for the end-of-life of their packaging. But increasingly focused on doing what they're doing today with lighter weight and better functionality. I think that the point you made about funding waste collection, extended producer responsibility, things like that, that has a role because clearly, we need the waste management infrastructure in place around the world to address the waste problem that we have, and that needs to be funded. And there are good successful models where funding that's generated through EPRs goes directly to waste infrastructure and can certainly help alleviate the problem. There's nothing wrong with that. We're in favor of well-designed EPRs. And as long as they're focused and we targeted at the right level of infrastructure. So generally speaking, the environment has improved. We expected to continue to improve as people get more educated on the total topic. Mark Wilde : Okay. That's really helpful, Ron. Thanks very much. I will turn it over. Operator : Your next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Your line is now open. Ghansham Panjabi : Yes. Thank you. Good day, everybody. I guess going back to Rigids, Ron, I mean, 10% sales growth, 6% of which was volume, 4% price mix. Why didn't that translate into a higher realization in terms of EBIT growth? I know it's very respectable at 10%, but just curious if something in terms of incremental cost held that number back? Michael Casamento : Hi there. It\u2019s Michael here. I can probably take that one. Look, we're really pleased with the overall performance of Rigids for the half. As you said, the volume growth was 6%. We had some price mix benefit, largely that was recovery of inflation in Latin America. So when you see that then the leverage through the P&L, we grew 10% for the half. So we're pretty pleased with that. Some of the \u2013 we had positive mix as well in the hot fill container business. The offset really which Ron has touched on this before, as we did have some higher operating costs during the period just to deal with that, that\u2019s really strong demand both in labor and then shuttling and freight costs around the network just to be able to meet the demand for our customers. So putting that all together, we were really pleased with where the growth ended up for the half in the Rigids business. Ghansham Panjabi : Yes. Thanks for clarifying. And then if we switch to Flexibles, it looks like volumes were relatively even for your first two quarters. And I think you mentioned Europe picked up as the second quarter unfolded. Was the increase in Europe due to the expanded lockdowns as the quarter unfolded? And was it the same case in North America as well? And just more broadly, how do you expect volumes to play out for the segment during the back half of your fiscal year? Thanks. Ronald Delia : Yes. Volumes were very comparable from Q1 to Q2. There was a bit of momentum picking up into Q2, particularly in Europe, where we had more of a sluggish Q1, I would say rather than an extraordinary Q2. We're in the low-single digits across both quarters. And we would expect that to continue into the second-half. Again, I think, when you net it all out to healthcare softness more than offset any extra volumes in some of the food segments, and so the low single-digit performance that we had in the first-half is more or less what we would expect to see in both of those big businesses. Ghansham Panjabi : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John Purtell from Macquarie. Your line is now open. John Purtell : Good evening, Ron. How are you? Ronald Delia : Hey, John. John Purtell : Just a couple of questions there. Yes, just in terms of raw materials, obviously you've seen some decent uplift in or related costs coming through at least on a spot basis. And then what was the impact on rural mix or from rural mix in the second quarter and how you are expecting that to play out through Q3 and Q4? Ronald Delia : Yes. John it\u2019s a good question. It was definitely a modest headwind in the Flexible segment. We have no impact really in Rigids because the pass-through mechanisms are quite frequent. But in Flexibles, our raw material pass-through is going to affect every three to six months. And so we did have a bit of a lag in the first-half, really in the second quarter, relatively modest. And we would expect some continued headwinds into this quarter, but again, that's factored into our guidance. And then you know from looking at this over time, the pass-through and recovery mechanisms are well-refined in Amcor. Any impacts we have positive or negative are just timing. John Purtell : Thank you. And just a second question coming back to Rigids and the higher transport and labor costs you are seeing, I mean, presumably those will normalize as demand comes back to some level of train. But if demand does stay high and therefore, cost stay high, are you able to recover those because it does appear there was a limited pass-through in this period? Michael Casamento : Yes. Look, John, I think it would depend on what the costs were and what the reason was. I mean, typically, with demand that the level that we had this period there is some shuttling and moving around the network that we have to do to meet the customer demand. And from a labor standpoint, as Ron touched on, part of that was due to higher absentee levels, typically in Q2, due to COVID. So you'd expect perhaps some of that normalizes over time and would have less and less of an impact. But regardless, when you have strong demand like that, you are going to see some cost increase. John Purtell : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Brook Campbell-Crawford from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Brook Campbell-Crawford: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Ron just on sustainability, you continue to talk about sustainability is the greatest growth opportunity for the business. Well, I'm just trying to understand, do you think sustainability will allow you to take share and improve mix and basically grow stronger than \u2013 and if it wasn't a focus area or do you think it\u2019s a necessary thing we could do just to hold sharing and keep yourselves where it is, I guess over the next five years when you're looking to reach those target? Thanks. Ronald Delia : Brook, we would think for the foreseeable future, it's a share opportunity and a margin opportunity. And that's because of the differentiation that we're going to bring to the more complicated aspects of the whole equation. So when we look at some of the products we've launched in the last three, four or five months that are more sustainable. If we look at the reportable pouch for pet food, and then the human food version that we launched with Mars for microwavable rice, I mean, that's just a different better mouse trap. And we've got the only product on the market that's got that sustainability profile. So clearly there's an opportunity there to take share. There's also obviously a higher level of value that's delivered to the customer in those two instances. We've got a PVDC-free shrink film called Eco-Tite, which is another example for protein. I mean, again, all of these \u2013 the more differentiated they are, the more opportunity for share, and ultimately margin for the foreseeable future. There'll be a point down the road \u2013 well down the road where some of those types of products will be expected. But certainly in the short and medium-term, and for as long as we can see, we're going to have a big advantage that should turn into some commercial benefits. Brook Campbell-Crawford: Yes. And I guess just wondering if you think at some point should be able to frame up that opportunity and provide some sort of targets or pull apart in your financials where the benefits going true, or does it all just kind of get washed up and then we can just talk about it qualitatively? Ronald Delia : Well, I think you're going to see it continue to flow through the sales line, and I think you're going to continue to see margin expansion, and that will be a more meaningful part. Sustainability dimension of our products will be a more meaningful part of the topline as well as the margin line. At the same time, we'll be managing the mix and we'll be exiting certain products as well. And so I think it will come out in the wash, but it clearly sets us apart from our competition and that's got to be nothing, but positive from a commercial perspective. Brook Campbell-Crawford: Last one for me, maybe just for Michael, just having a look at corporate costs looks like in the half steps up from the sort of $35 million in prior period to $48 million, and despite some synergy there in the current quarter. So an underlying increase there in corporate. And just wondering if you could [indiscernible] and what's driven that increase. Michael Casamento : Yes. Look, it's largely fading, Brook. It was particularly in Q1 where we had some higher cost from a fading standpoint around insurance claims and just timing of management incentives and the like. As we look forward, we'd expect that to more normalize. The full-year level, we're not providing guidance. We'd expect corporate cost to be \u2013 they're about perhaps slightly higher than last year on the back of inflation and other things. But generally speaking, we expect a more normalized view of the timing year-end. Brook Campbell-Crawford: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Kyle White from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Kyle White : Hey, hope everyone is doing well. Thanks for taking the questions. Just to focus on the EPS guidance raised. Two consecutive quarters where you\u2019ve raised the guidance here. Yes, your free cash flow has remained unchanged both times. Just curious what the offset is. Is it working capital with kind of the increases we have in resin or is it something else there? Michael Casamento : Yes, I can take that one. To your question, I think, look, we've given a relatively wide range on the cash flow of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. With these guidance upgrades, what we're seeing is that we would expect now probably more to be at the upper end of that $1 billion to $1.1 billion range. So we haven't raised the guidance at this stage, we'd say we're going to be at the upper end of that range. If that changes, we'll come back to you. Kyle White : Sounds good. And I want to focus on the recycled resin. I think you're pushing towards 10% of your resin purchase or consumable being a post-consumer recycled resin by 2025. Are there any limitations on how high this could be as a proportion of your overall resin by in terms of maintaining the integrity and characteristics of certain packages, it's probably the most applicable to your Rigids here. And then I hear from recyclers is that really just isn't the end market demand for PCR necessarily, but on the other hand, it seems consumers want more sustainable products. So I'm just kind of curious what's the disconnect here? Ronald Delia : That would be a good question. I think there's incredible demand for PCR. In fact, you asked about limitations and you went to the technical thresholds. And the answer to that one is really, there are no technical thresholds, Kyle. We're making containers pretty much for every segment now and a 100% PCR in the Rigids business. The consumption of recycled resin in the Rigids business has dramatically increased in the last 18 months, even despite the COVID backdrop. So we\u2019ve gone from about 4% or 5% of the resin that we processed to exiting December at about 10% of the total resin that we processed in that business. And that number will go up again by June. So there really is no limit. There is no technical limit to the amount of recycled content we can use in a container. We're making plenty with all PCR. The constraint maybe at a point in time, not too far into the future limitation on supply. And so we along with our customers and consumers is back obviously are sending every demand signal possible that there is going to be an appetite to source PCR. So I'm not sure where the disconnect is. Kyle White : Got it. Is there maybe \u2013 from a cost standpoint, what's the differential from using virgin over PCR? Ronald Delia : Well, it is a premium at the moment and there typically has been, but there's also a value premium as well. And so I think there\u2019s the cost plus aspect to the pricing mechanism, but more importantly, this is going to be an expected input to the end product that we're making and that our customers are packaging their products. And so I think it's \u2013 I wouldn't want to say it doesn't matter what the cost is, clearly it will. But there is a premium, I think there's a demonstration in practice that there's a willingness to pay that premium. Kyle White : Yes. I\u2019ll turn it over. Good luck to the next and the balance of the year. Ronald Delia : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from George Staphos from Bank of America. Your line is now open. George Staphos : Thanks. Hi, everyone. Thanks for the details. Congratulations on the progress so far. Ron, I wanted to hit a little bit on the new products to the extent that you can, recognizing that they are by definition smaller and perhaps the growth that you're seeing in them is not meaningful. Can you talk maybe qualitatively or as much as you want to quantitatively about, what you're seeing in terms of AmLite and some of the other products, the growth that you're seeing? And I was particularly interested in what you're seeing out of the Eco-Tite product and whether you're getting any measurable market share in the protein market with that film? Ronald Delia : Yes. Those are really good examples of having a differentiated product and a differentiated offering that even the customers now are trying to reconcile and get their heads around in terms of what they can and can't do. The AmLite structure and the basic chemistry behind it, is got wide application. So we've launched the product for pet food first. And then we've also more recently announced the rice package that essentially uses similar technology. The demand has been really far exceeded our expectations. And now we're going to have to scale up the capacity which is a good thing to deliver against that demand. But it's a good example of solving the problem that didn't seem to have a really easy answer maybe 12 months ago for these big brand owners and also their smaller competitors. So I\u2019d say watch this space on AmLite. There's incredible appetite not only from the European customer base where the product was first launched, but also around the world. India, Brazil, obviously North America, China, there are kind of advanced orders or a book build if you were taking place globally for that structure. On Eco-Tite, this is a recycle-ready structure, but maybe even more importantly, right now it's a PVDC structure or PVDC-free structure, sorry, for protein, which is also a major concern for many brand owners to get PVDC and chlorides out of their packaging. And so this one has been targeted at the European protein market. In the first instance, there's a lot of take up there where that material is of particularly high concern. It's pretty early days, but I would expect that demand to start to also come from the other regions of the world as well. So I mean you alluded to it neither of these products are going to change the overall revenue profile of the company in a given quarter, but over time, the cumulative momentum of products like these is going to help generate a good topline growth and good margin. George Staphos : Thanks, Ron. My second question, if I look at the performance over the first six months, again, as you mentioned, it's inline or were ahead of your expectations. And you are performing well on any number of KPIs that you point to. When I look though at Flexibles, there was a little bit of deceleration in EBIT from the three month to the six month period, there was also a little bit of deceleration, even though I know you're raising your target for synergies. In the synergy momentum, it was $20 million in 1Q, it was $35 million through the six months. So if you can give us maybe a look underneath the hood with all the things that are going well for you in Flexibles, what's causing the minor deceleration that we've seen from three months to the six-month period? Thank you very much. Ronald Delia : Yes. Look George, the organic performance of the business is pretty similar from period-to-period. In fact, we had a modest pickup in the base business, organic growth let's say from Q1 into Q2. Q2 was modestly higher than Q1 from an organic growth perspective. I think what you're seeing is just the comp, just a year-on-year impact of the synergy capture, which in the prior year was three to six to nine months into the acquisition. And a lot of low hanging fruit drove higher synergy benefits in those first couple of periods. So we're just cycling higher levels of synergy in the prior year. And over time, that's going to continue to dissipate as a comp. But the organic performance of the business actually picked up a bit and we expect it to sort of stay at that level and build momentum through the second-half as well. George Staphos : Thanks, Ron. I\u2019ll turn it over. Operator : And your next question comes from Lawrence Gandler from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Larry Gandler : Thanks guys. Yes, lot of progress in the business. And Ron, you made such good progress with Bemis. I'm wondering why you guys are buying back shares. It seems for anybody born in the last century, the world's expensive except for the packaging sector, so I'm just wondering how you're feeling about valuations in the packaging sector. And it seems in congress that you're buying back shares when it seems like it's relatively inexpensive. Ronald Delia : Yes. It's a great observation, Larry. First of all, you've watched this for a long time. We're active acquirers and we would expect to continue to acquire. So that's the first priority is to reinvest in the business, grow the business, continue to consolidate and acquire. And we're certainly going to get increasingly active as the Bemis integration and synergy capture comes to a close. And we'd be actively looking at it now as you'd imagine. And the benefit of doing a non-market buyback is flexibility. So if we were to come across an opportunity that required more capital, we could always suspend the share repurchases. Although, as you also know, most of the deals in our space are pretty small. So in all likelihood, we could fund acquisitions and continue the share repurchases. I think the last point I would make comes to the way you asked the question, which is around value. And I think, we would say as we look across the industry, yes, asset values are relatively high. But the best value in the industry right now is Amcor. And so what better time to buy shares in the company than right now, where we have clear line of sight into where the business is traveling and the momentum that the business had. So we would never try to be stock pickers here, but from a value perspective, we think Amcor is probably the best value in the sector at the moment. Larry Gandler : Okay. And just a clarification on this first question because I want to answer the second one. Public company or private company, are you seeing any disparity evaluations there? To me, it seems like actually public company valuations might be more attractive than private company at the moment. Ronald Delia : Look, there's not a whole lot of deals getting done, right? So the mark-to-markets, if you own the private assets, only happen when there's a transaction. There's been a lot of cross, I would say on the deals that have been done. So there are certainly asset prices that have been pretty high and the market will pay what the market will pay for a public equity. And I think it becomes more of a relative game in the public markets, relative attractiveness of the sector and the players in it to all the other alternatives in the public markets. And there's just a lot of excitement around certain growth segments that maybe seen more appealing to people at this point in time. Larry Gandler : Okay. Thanks, Ron. Just my second question relates to some research I did back a couple months ago regarding small customers in U.S. And it seems to me that that's like a $5 billion market. To frame the question, you guys had as you disclosed in your Investor Presentation, some 6,000 small customers in Europe, but only 850 small customers in North America. So it seems like a big opportunity, any progress there in terms of addressing the small customer market more broadly and deeply in the U.S.? Ronald Delia : Really good progress, and it is a great opportunity. I mean, you've flagged it. And we've also flagged it in different forums. We've been after it in Rigids for a long time in the regional beverage space. We continue to see double-digit growth from those customers. Flexibles, the legacy Bemis business had identified this as a market segment, if you will, that offers some really attractive characteristics, but they also continue to \u2013 that business also continues to generate higher than average growth, higher than the rest of the portfolio. I think as far as the impact on the overall result, you have \u2013 maybe there's the challenge of small numbers, but very high growth rates. So I would say watch this space over time, it continues to be a part of the market that we're excited about. Larry Gandler : Okay. Thanks, Ron. Operator : And your next question comes from Richard Johnson from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Richard Johnson : Thank you very much. Ron, my first question is just on R&D and I know you're spending, I think you stated, it\u2019s roughly $100 million a year. I was wondering if you could sort of talk around where that's going? And what I mean by that is, if you would sort of put it into various categories, what percentage of that goes to film development or material science or product development and design and that sort of thing? Ronald Delia : Yes. It\u2019s a good question. If you break it down, I mean, I wouldn't give you a number, but what I would say is dramatically, a lot of the design work that we do is with customers. In many cases, we actually get reimbursed for that work. And there's a lot of activity in both Manchester, Michigan in the Rigids business, and in Wisconsin, in the Flexibles business in North America doing design work that has also at times been done by advertising agencies. So that's an increasing part of the activity, but also one that quite often we get compensated for. We also on the other end of the spectrum do advanced technology development on material science, films, barriers, and things that will benefit the business in the medium-term. And in the middle is where most of the spend is, which is application development and product development and product commercialization. If I was to use the 80/20 rule, I would say probably 70% or 80% of it is in that middle area. Richard Johnson : Got it. That's super helpful. Thanks. And then, I just wanted to ask around \u2013 or try and get a sense of what your view is on the broader competitive environment. And the reason I ask that, and that's in Flexibles \u2013 the reason I ask that is as you made reference to your recyclable retort pouch that you're doing for Mars. But my understanding is they're all competing products that have been launched as well. So I'm just trying to get an understanding of, one, where you feel you are competitively and whether there's been any significant changes, and has anything changed in the industry, which has always been a case that technology hasn't always been a barrier of entry? Ronald Delia : Well, I think it's becoming more of an increasing barriers to entry. There's a lot of announcements, particularly around sustainability and product attributes. There's announcements every week. And you could imagine that would be across all of those and also across what we believe to be that the makeup of some of those products. And we maintain that on the products that we've highlighted here today, that we have the only solutions in the marketplace that have the attributes that we described. So in terms of the broader competitive environment, nothing has changed of any substance. I think, it's never been a place where you see really rapid changes in the competitive set, and we're not necessarily seeing that today. Richard Johnson : Got it. Just a really quick one in, just on the shareholder value creation model, which has obviously been in place for quite a number of years now. In the first few years of its existence, there was quite a good correlation between the TSR and the total shareholder return and the shareholder value accretion, that hasn't really been the case in the last few years. And I was just wondering from your perspective, what you think is missing. Ronald Delia : I think that's the kind of thing that plays itself out over time. I mean, if you take up a 10-year view, it winds up actually pretty well. And we would expect over the following 10 years, it will line up pretty well again. From time-to-time, again, there's relative valuations in a public market that makes certain sectors and certain industries more or less attractive. I think there's a bit of that over the last few years as well as segments sectors like tech and others have really had incredible returns. So I would expect over time that to converge as they have historically. Richard Johnson : Fantastic. Thanks, and well done on the results. Ronald Delia : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Nathan Reilly from UBS. Your line is now open. Nathan Reilly : Hi, Ron. Just a question just around manufacturing, actually, just in the context of some of the comments you made around the momentum that you're seeing in the business and picking up some of the volume growth, which we've seen this quarter as well. Do you just give a quick update just on where you're at from a manufacturing capacity and utilization point of view around the network at the moment, and just what you're thinking about sort of reinvesting in that network for growth in the near-term? Ronald Delia : Well let me start with the first part, and then Michael can talk about the second part, which is around the reinvestment profile of that business going forward. I mean, look at the moment, we're at a comfortable utilization level and an efficient utilization level, probably with the exception of Rigids more recently as Michael alluded to. So when we talk about extraordinary costs to service, extraordinary demand, that is one of the outcomes of running a very, very high capacity utilization, probably too high over time. Now we don't expect that to continue as we've talked about. But other than that segment, and then the inverse would be true at healthcare where the demand has been soft. Generally speaking, we're running at a more normal level of utilization. And then as far as what does that mean for capital going forward, maybe Michael can talk to that point. Michael Casamento : Yes. Sure, Ron. Yes, so look, I mean, capital expenditure, I think last year we spent around $400 million, probably that was a year after the acquisition, which probably was a little lighter than we normally have. Typically we invest around depreciation a little bit more depending on what the requirements were in any given period. But this year, look, we're expecting that probably around 10% above where we were last year. So around that $450 million range, and that's really taking into account some of those additional needs for growth CapEx across the network and new technologies as well. So I think as we look forward, that's kind of where we see the CapEx \u2013 in that $400 million to $500 million range, which we think is sufficient \u2013 more than sufficient to cover the expanding growth requirements and the technological advancement. Nathan Reilly : Okay. Thanks for that. Ronald Delia : Thanks, Nathan. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. I'll hand it back to Ron Delia for closing remarks. Ronald Delia : Thanks, operator, and thanks to the participants on the line for all the questions. Just to close off where we started, we had a strong first-half to fiscal 2021. Results are ahead of our expectations and performance balanced across the businesses. That start is translated into higher expectations for the full-year and so we've raised our outlook for fiscal 2021. We've also increased cash returns to shareholders through a higher dividend and $200 million of additional repurchases. And then we conclude with probably the most important point, which is that we continue to believe that the Amcor investment case has never been stronger. Thanks very much, operator. And with that, we'll close the call. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you, everyone for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Tracey Whitehead. Please go ahead. Tracey Whitehead : Thank you, operator, and I would like to welcome everyone to Amcor's Third Quarter Earnings Call for Fiscal '21. Joining the call today from Amcor's side is our Chief Executive Officer, Ron Delia; and Chief Financial Officer, Michael Casamento. At this time, I'll direct your attention to our website, amcor.com, under the Investors section, where you'll find our press release and presentation which we will discuss today. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and related reconciliations can be found in those documents on our website. As a reminder, the call today includes some forward-looking comments, which remain subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings to review factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we're discussing today. With that, I'll hand over to Ron. Ronald Delia : Thanks, Tracey, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today to discuss Amcor's year-to-date results. Joining me on the line, as Tracey indicated, is Michael Casamento, our Chief Financial Officer. And we'll begin with some prepared remarks and then open the line for Q&A. Starting with Slide 3. We begin every meeting at Amcor with safety, so we'll start today with safety as well. And this year, our safety performance has been a real highlight. Across Amcor, we've reduced the number of injuries by almost 30% in the first 9 months of the year, and all of our business groups reported fewer injuries, with over half of our sites remaining injury-free for the last 12 months or more. And of course, over the last year, we've also been equally focused on keeping our co-workers healthy as well as safe. And as the COVID pandemic continues to present challenges in many countries, maintaining our protocols and our vigilance remains a top priority for our teams around the world who also understand the critical role we play in helping maintain availability of essential health care and food products. Given the continued challenges of navigating the pandemic, we're particularly pleased with our safety performance so far this year, and we remain confident that our objective of no injuries is, in fact, possible. Our key messages for today are set out on Slide 4. First, our year-to-date financial results have been strong and ahead of expectations, with organic momentum continuing through the year such that the March quarter has been our strongest thus far this year despite the operating environment remaining dynamic and volatile, maybe even more so over the last few months. Our teams have navigated that volatility by demonstrating an exceptional ability to stay focused on the key business drivers within our control, to respond quickly as conditions change and to execute to deliver results despite the circumstances. The second message here is that the strong performance translates into higher expectations for the 2021 fiscal year, and we've raised our outlook for full year EPS growth to 14% to 15% on a constant currency basis. And third, we're actively investing in several growth initiatives, which illustrate the range of opportunities we have over the medium term to maintain our momentum. The strong result, increased guidance and growth investment examples demonstrate the strength of our investment case, which I'll touch on briefly on Slide 5 before returning to the results in more detail. The Amcor investment case is set out on Slide 5 and it's one we've shared a few times this year. We believe the investment case is as strong as ever, and this slide sets out the reasons why, including our global leadership positions, consistent growth from attractive end markets, strong balance sheet and significant annual cash flow of more than $1 billion, and growing, to fund growth investments and dividends. And lastly, momentum's been building, which you can see in our upgraded guidance, and we believe that will continue. Looking ahead into fiscal '22, we would expect EPS growth to benefit from continued organic growth, additional synergies from the Bemis acquisition, a lower share count after the repurchases during FY '20 and '21 and the value that will be created from the $300 million to $400 million of free cash flow that will remain after CapEx and dividends. So the Amcor investment case has not changed and that's part of the message here today. Despite volatility in our operating environment and maybe even more so because of that volatility, the Amcor investment fundamentals remain very attractive and will continue to generate total value of 10% to 15% each year across EPS growth and dividends. Slide 6 includes the actual outcomes of that investment case over the last decade. Over this period, we've always maintained an investment-grade capital structure. We've delivered consistent sales and profit growth, including margin expansion organically through multiple economic and commodity cycles. And we've consistently paid out a compelling dividend. And that growth and yield has been supported by best-in-class free cash flow conversion and return on invested capital, which have also contributed to strong total returns to shareholders as well. Organic growth has always been a key driver of our overall financial performance, and that will become increasingly evident going forward. Slide 7 highlights 3 of the key organic growth drivers for Amcor. The starting point on the left is the set of growing end markets we serve around the world. Now Amcor has substantial positions in several higher-growth, higher value-add, more packaging-intensive segments like health care, protein and premium coffee or hot fill beverage containers and barrier films. In each of these segments, market growth tends to track higher than average. And in each one, we have differentiated positions -- scale positions, differentiated products and global leverage opportunities. Second, emerging markets will also continue to be a key source of organic growth for Amcor. We've got a scale emerging markets portfolio with over $3 billion in annual sales from 27 profitable emerging market businesses, where we benefit from leadership positions and differentiated capabilities, and where we have a long history of profitable growth. And third, growth enabled by innovation, which is an area where we continue to differentiate ourselves from competition, and we're investing to extend that lead. All of our businesses go to market with world-class innovation and R&D capabilities, which are increasingly valued by our customers as they look for packaging to meet shifting consumer needs around the world, particularly around sustainability, which I'll come back to in a minute. We're also allocating capital and actively investing for growth in a number of areas, and Slide 8 shows 2 examples. First, the example on the left. Within a few weeks, we will expect to begin commissioning a major capacity expansion for one of our aluminum-based product segments at a Flexibles Packaging plant in Switzerland. Now this investment will support the continued high growth of the premium coffee segment and is underwritten by a long-term supply agreement with a key customer. We've made a number of similar investments over the years and several recently where we have real long-term partnerships with higher-growth customers who value the various ways Amcor can help them grow. In the other example on the right-hand side of the slide, in the last quarter, we began construction of a new greenfield plant in China to add capacity to our business in that high-growth market, where we already maintain a leadership position and healthy financial profile. The new state-of-the-art plant will be the largest in Amcor's China network and will start up by the end of calendar 2022 to support a range of global and local customers, primarily in the food and personal care segments. And turning to Slide 9. Last week, we announced a corporate venture-type investment in ePac, a relatively new startup in the flexible packaging space, who has leveraged technology and a unique business model to grow to $100 million in sales in just over 4 years. Now as excited as we are to work with ePac, the key point of this slide is to make clear our intentions to do more with regard to open innovation and corporate venturing generally so that we can complement our internal innovation capabilities with great external ideas from all around the world. We're looking forward to exploring opportunities across new packaging products, processes and business models and will be much more systematic and purposeful in this area. And moving to Slide 10, it remains very clear to us that our best and most exciting opportunity for growth and differentiation will come from the development of more sustainable packaging. More sustainable packaging means responsible packaging, starting with better package design. And on that dimension, which needs to take into account the full product life cycle, there's no one better positioned in the industry than Amcor and we're demonstrating that with a steady stream of new product platforms and launches around the world. Waste management and consumer participation will be equally important, and both require close collaboration with others across our value chain. And Amcor has been actively partnering with others in both areas to drive scalable solutions and real impact, and I'll describe some of the progress we're making on the next slide. The KITKAT example on the left is a great one because it demonstrates the potential for Amcor to use chemically recycled resin in food-grade flexible packaging, and it also highlights the level of collaboration that's possible across the full value chain to make it happen, in this case, in Australia. In the middle is AmSky, which is a breakthrough innovation launched by Amcor just last week. Now Amcor created the world's first recycle-ready thermoform blister packaging by eliminating PVC without compromising functionality or the consumer experience. And AmSky is an exciting development, which has the potential to transform the sustainability profile of health care packaging, particularly for solid-dose pharmaceuticals, but it also highlights the potential to eliminate PVC and other packaging segments as well. The example on the right-hand side of the slide is another one that brings to life the concept of responsible packaging with a real example in practice, in this case, in the U.K. The supermarket rollout of this rice product in a recycle-ready microwavable pouch made with Amcor's HeatFlex technology coincided with a number of U.K. retailers announcing in-store trials to collect and recycle flexible packaging. And this one demonstrates that responsible packaging design enabled by Amcor can catalyze change and motivate progress on the waste management and consumer participation requirements as well. And finally, in March, Amcor also took an Executive Committee role in the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, a group whose mission is fully aligned with our vision for responsible packaging through design, infrastructure, innovation and consumer participation. Turning now to a summary of our results on Slide 12. The business has delivered strong year-to-date earnings growth, with EPS up 16% on a comparable constant currency basis. And of that EPS growth, 7% was organic as overall demand for our products has remained healthy and combined with outstanding execution, has resulted in organic growth continuing to build each quarter. 6% of the EPS growth comes from incremental Bemis acquisition synergies, which have reached $55 million so far this fiscal year. We continue to progress ahead of initial expectations, and we're well positioned to deliver at least $180 million of synergies by the end of fiscal '22. And the remaining 3% EPS growth reflects benefits from share repurchases in fiscal '20 and '21. Free cash flow in the balance sheet continue to be strong and in line with our expectations. And we've returned more than $850 million so far this year of cash to shareholders through higher dividends and share buybacks. So the key message here is that we're executing very well, building momentum, delivering strong growth and cash returns to shareholders. With that, I'll hand over to Michael to provide some further detail. Michael Casamento : Thanks, Ron, and hi, everyone. So starting with the Flexibles segment on Slide 13. Overall sales were 1% higher than the prior year and this was all driven by higher volumes. Demand has remained relatively broad-based, with growth in North America, Latin America and the Asia Pacific regions, while Europe was in line with last year. Through the last 9 months, we have consistently seen solid growth across a broad range of end markets, including in higher-value end markets like protein, coffee, cheese and pet food. And this has been partly offset by lower health care volumes driven by fewer elective surgeries and lower prescription trends, which began back in the June quarter of 2020. Adjusted EBIT has grown 9% in constant currency terms, and margins expanded by 110 basis points, reflecting volume growth, $45 million of cost synergy benefits and strong cost performance and management. It's worth noting here that increases in raw materials have remained manageable, given the diversity of the materials we buy and the multiple reasons in which we consume those materials, combined with the strong commercial capabilities that we have built for over a decade as part of The Amcor Way. The business also continues to extract the financial and strategic benefits from the Bemis acquisition, which is covered on Slide 14. We acquired a high-quality, well-invested business, which has delivered consistent earnings growth since the date of the acquisition. In terms of cost synergies, our teams have done a great job of delivering benefits from overhead reduction, procurement and by optimizing our footprint. Year-to-date, we have delivered $55 million in benefits, and we continue to expect this will increase to approximately $70 million for the full year. At the end of fiscal 2021, cumulative benefits will have reached $150 million, and we expect to deliver at least $180 million of total cost synergies by the end of fiscal '22. It's also exciting to see examples of collaboration across the regions as we leverage our capabilities and differentiated product offering to support customer growth. For instance, our business in China, Australia and Brazil have all secured differentiated packaging for protein and pet food applications from other Amcor regions across the globe. There are many examples like this and more in the pipeline to come through. Turning to Rigid Packaging on Slide 15. In summary, the business has continued to deliver outstanding results driven by strong consumer demand. Sales growth included a 4% increase in volume as well as a 3% price/mix benefit, including higher pricing to recover cost inflation in Latin America. In North America, year-to-date beverage volumes are 7% higher than last year, and hot fill container volumes are up 13%. We have seen another quarter of strong consumer demand for PET packaged beverages, particularly in hot fill categories, including juice, ready-to-drink teas and sports drinks. This strong demand has built capacity across our network and reflects higher consumer demand, innovative brand extensions and new product launches and formats. Year-to-date, Specialty Container volumes were higher than the prior period, with growth in certain categories, including spirits, personal care and home cleaning. And volumes in Latin America were also 2% higher than last year, with growth delivered in Brazil, Central America and Argentina. The EBIT growth of 9% reflects higher volumes and favorable mix across the business. [Technical Difficulty]. Operator : Pardon the interruption. Mr. Casamento's line disconnected. Ronald Delia : I don't know if it's disconnected, operator. Just give us a second here. We'll see if we can get him back on. Operator, I'll pick it up from here. It's Ron Delia. I'll just pick up from where Michael left off. Michael was just summarizing the Rigid container story -- Rigid Packaging segment. Sorry about that, for those on the line. I think he was just updating on the Specialty Container volumes, which were higher than the prior period, with growth in a number of categories. And then volumes in Latin America, 2% higher than last year, with growth, particularly in Brazil, Central America and Argentina. EBIT growth in the segment of 9% reflects that higher volume and favorable mix across the business, partially offset by higher labor costs and transportation costs as well. Rigid containers has rapidly become -- it's rapidly become evident the preference for Rigid containers, given their recyclability, lightweight, resealability and hygiene profile as well as having the lowest carbon footprint. And the business has continued to benefit from these trends. We've doubled the use of PCR, post-consumer recycled resin, over 2 -- over the last 2 years even while navigating the pandemic. And we continue to launch new products made of 100% PCR. In fact, today, almost all of our sites in North America are converting to PCR along with virgin resin. We move on to Slide 16. Adjusted free cash flow of $360 million was in line with prior year. However, this includes approximately $50 million of U.S. cash tax payments deferred under the CARES Act in the Q4 of FY '20. Excluding that timing variance, adjusted free cash flow is approximately 10% higher than last year and is in line with our expectations. Our financial profile is solid. Leverage is at 3x on a trailing 12-month EBITDA basis, and this is lower than last year and in line with what we would expect at the end of the March quarter given the seasonality of the cash flows in the business. So with strong annual cash flow and a strong balance sheet, the business has significant capacity to invest as well as to return a substantial amount of cash to shareholders, as we have this year already, through a growing dividend and further share repurchases. And in fact, in 9 months so far this year, we've returned over $850 million to shareholders. Turning to Slide 17, which is the outlook slide. You'll find the latest view here, which is a revised or an increased outlook for the year. The continued strong performance of the business and the organic momentum has been built -- that has been building gives us the confidence to raise our 2021 full year guidance. And we expect constant currency EPS growth of 14% to 15% for the full year, which is comparable to and higher than the 10% to 14% guidance provided in February and includes an unfavorable EPS impact from businesses we've disposed of over the last 12 months of approximately 1%. So to be clear, the constant currency EPS growth for this year would have been 15% to 16% had the disposals not occur. In terms of cash flow, we continue to expect adjusted free cash flow between USD 1 billion and USD 1.1 billion. In closing today, on Slide 18, Amcor has delivered a strong result ahead of expectations, and organic momentum has continued. This has translated into higher expectations for the full year, and we've raised our outlook for fiscal '21. We're actively investing in the future, and these investments, along with strong execution, will enable continued momentum and reinforce our belief that the Amcor investment case has never been stronger. Operator, with that, we'll finish our -- we've finished our opening remarks, and we're happy to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question will come from George Staphos of Bank of America. George Staphos : Two questions, both really around volume. I guess, first off, it seems like every week, we get another press release from Amcor, and this is a high-class problem in terms of another new product. Is there a way you could give us some form of a vitality index or some approximation, how much of your sales right now where volumes are coming from products that you hadn't created, produced two years ago, three years ago, whatever time frame you want to use? That's question number 1. And then question number two, recognizing you prefer to look at things on a year-to-date basis, on a yearly basis, when we do some reverse engineering of the press releases, it looks -- this quarter versus last quarter, it looks like Flexibles saw a little bit of a slowdown, volumes might have been flat to slightly down. Can you give us some perspective in terms of what was happening in the third quarter by market and some key products? Ronald Delia : Yes. Look, good question, George. Look, on the volatility index, it's not a measure that we use pervasively inside the company. I mean I think the -- what we're really focused on is launching products that are commercialized -- commercializable and will have take-up in the market and then tracking the sales of each of those, none of which are material to the group per se. But we think it's important to continue to demonstrate the vitality of our innovation pipeline because ultimately, that will contribute to the positive mix and the positive margin that we want to drive in the business. And so the ultimate vitality index for us is the margin expansion that we've generated period after period after period for well over 10 years now. That's the vitality index because what it says is that each new product that we sell today is a higher-margin product than the unit it's replacing from prior periods. So that's maybe the roundabout way of answering your first question. On Q3, we'll talk about Q3. I mean we do tend to focus on the full year to try to orient the conversations in the longer term. But that being said, the third quarter was our strongest quarter of the year on a number of dimensions. We had increasing organic momentum -- profit momentum across both Rigids and Flexibles. And we're really pleased with the execution because the environment in the third quarter, fiscal third quarter for us from an operating perspective, was probably as difficult as it's been so far this year. As it relates to the sales side of things, yes. I mean look, I think these businesses, both Rigids and Flexibles, will generate low single-digit growth over the long term. I think that's roughly where we've been -- where we were through 6 months. That's likely where we'll be at the end of the fiscal year. The 90-day period that was Q3 was a little bit softer in Flexibles, particularly because of the weakness, the ongoing weakness in the medical device packaging and pharmaceutical packaging. But more or less, we're consistent with our long-term trends in both businesses for this fiscal year at sort of low single digits. Operator : Your next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi of Baird. Ghansham Panjabi : I guess, Ron, just kind of following up on George's question in terms of the cadence of volumes as we look ahead. Some CPG companies, as they reported, have talked about an abrupt sort of shift in terms of volumes as you cycled through the tougher comps from a year ago. Mobility in certain parts of the world are starting to increase, in North America, for example. So can you just sort of give us a real-time pulse as to what you're seeing so far in your 4Q and then how exactly you expect volumes to sort of evolve over the next 2 to 3 quarters? Ronald Delia : Yes. Look, good question. I mean last year, at this time, we would have been describing pretty much a neutral impact from COVID, and that carried through then for the fourth quarter of FY '20, and that's pretty much been our experience. And that's because of the geographic diversity of the business. Last year, our Q3 would have seen a real strong negative impact in Asia, particularly in China, which is a business that generates a lot of growth for us. And we would have seen softness in other parts of the business, compensating for some of the better sales in North America in the month of March last year as an example. The net-net of all that, last year, wasn't really much. And so as we think about cycling comps this year, including the results that we're reporting today, there's really not much in it in terms of variation period-to-period related to COVID. And that's the perspective that I would offer looking forward as well. Our Q4, as I said to respond to George's question, it will be back at the end of this fiscal year and will be in the low single digits, which is where we would expect to be on any given year. And so there's not -- it's not the sexiest answer I could give you, but it's the reality of the diversified portfolio that we're operating. Ghansham Panjabi : Understood. And then for my second question, on raw materials, your favorite question, I'm sure. So with the reflation dynamics that we saw in the U.S. coming into this year and then Winter storm Uri, just give us a sense as to how you're navigating pricing in the context of just significant cost inflation on the resin side plus logistics, et cetera. And what's different, if anything, post-Bemis in terms of how your commercial guys are tackling higher cost inflation? Ronald Delia : Yes. Look, it's a good question. It's obviously a topic -- a key topic this period. First thing I would say is that this isn't new, right? These are commodity cycles that we experience every few years. If we look back over the last 10 years or so, it's probably maybe the third or fourth real pronounced spike that we've seen in our input costs. And so it's not new. It's something you deal with periodically. And the way we navigate is with lots of rigor and lots of precision. And I would say that, that rigor and that precision improves every time we go through one of these cycles. And I think that whether it's the shortening the pass-through lags on contracts, whether it's expanding the coverage of the materials that are subject to rise and fall mechanisms and the like, I just think we get better at it with each year. And I can go back to each of those cyclical peaks over the last decade and kind of point to things that we've learned and that we've added to the toolkit so that in the next time, the experience is less impactful. And I think that's what we're seeing now. We're not really -- obviously, we're wearing a headwind like everyone else, but it's not material enough to distort the results, and it's certainly not holding back our expectations for the fiscal year. I think with Bemis, maybe Bemis is a segue into another dimension to this question, which is the diversification of our spend, which only got further enhanced or further diversified with the Bemis acquisition. So obviously, if we take the 2 business segments, you've got rigid packaging, which is largely PET-based, which operates in a much tighter lag, it's an easier administrative process, if you will, because it's really primarily one material. So when we talk about lags in Amcor's businesses, it's primarily in Flexibles. And in Flexibles, it's also important to remember that about 60% -- or maybe I'll say it the other way, about 40% of what we buy in the Flexibles segment is not polymer-based. It's aluminum, it's fiber, and it's other things. So the spend from a commodity perspective is pretty well-diversified. And then particularly in polymers, the other 60%, that's really split. It's split across 4 geographic regions, and it's split across grades. And so the netting of that, the portfolio effect of that, again with the addition of Bemis, which is $4 billion out of the $9 billion of sales in that segment, just creates more of a portfolio effect or a dampening or a leveling effect. So we're more -- I would say, to summarize it, we're better at this and we -- and our portfolio is better positioned to withstand these kind of cyclical spikes. Operator : Your next question will come from Richard Johnson of Jefferies. Richard Johnson : Ron, sorry, just to continue on with the -- your commentary on raw material price lags. I'm just trying to understand properly what the impact of -- or what the lag is when you think about what the impact on your revenue line has been of low raw material prices and it's the same for the group as it is with Flexibles. I mean that's been negative really right through '20 and into '21. And if you assume that nearly all raw materials really turned -- started to turn back up midway through last year, it looks like the impact on your revenue line continued to be negative for 9 further months. I mean is it that simple, or how should we think about the lag? Ronald Delia : Look, I think the way to think about the lag is that in Flexibles, it's roughly a quarter. There's probably an average in there that's somewhere between 3 and 4 months, but it's close enough. And that hasn't really changed over time. I mean I think with the addition of the Bemis portfolio, that part of the equation hasn't really changed much. I think we have to remember, there were times over the last 9 or 12 months, I think, was the period you referenced, where raw materials also went down in some parts of the world. And so I wouldn't read too much into the -- I think it would be very difficult to bridge back the commodity charts with the raw material impact on the revenue line, which is why we just break it out for you. Our measure of organic sales growth excludes the impact, positive or negative, of commodity prices. Richard Johnson : Yes, absolutely. I mean but that's always been negative for quite some time now. Anyways, that's helpful. And then just secondly, on sustainability. I would be interested in your view on what's going on in France at the moment. And obviously there, a single-use plastic legislation passed a big hurdle overnight. And I'm particularly interested around what they're thinking about doing in supermarkets with compulsory refill stations and the like. I mean is that something we should be worried about longer-term? Ronald Delia : No. Look, I mean, I think consumer consciousness is rising everywhere, and that's a good thing because, ultimately, we need the consumer to participate. And in countries like France and others in Europe that have various forms of legislation in place, all of that is supportive to the infrastructure funding that's required, whether it's composting infrastructure, recycling infrastructure, et cetera. So none of that is necessarily a bad thing. I think on the reusable side of things, I'm not sure that's an Amcor issue per se. It's particularly in France. But the consumer behavioral shift required for reuse at scale is just not something we've seen anywhere in the world yet. It doesn't mean it won't happen, but I think that's a big ask of the consumer at this stage, quite frankly, when we're trying to get them to recycle or compost. Operator : Your next question will come from Anthony Pettinari of Citi. Anthony Pettinari : Ron, when you first gave fiscal '21 guidance last year, I think you guided to 5% to 10% EPS growth in the $1 billion to $1.1 billion in free cash flow. And you've now raised the EPS guide a couple of times. I think you're basically double the original guide at the midpoint in terms of EPS growth. And the free cash flow is still that sort of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. And I understand it's not a huge delta, but is there any kind of like working capital impact from resin that maybe you get back in fiscal '22? Or is there something on the CapEx side? Just wondering how we should think about you being maybe at the low end or the high end of that free cash flow guide. Ronald Delia : Yes. No, it's a good question. Michael is actually back, so we'll let him tackle that one. Michael Casamento : Yes. Hi. Can you hear me there? Anthony Pettinari : Yes. Ronald Delia : Yes. Michael Casamento : Yes. Perfect. No, yes, look, we -- you're quite right. The guidance has increased through the year, and we're still talking about a cash flow range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. We think we'll be at the upper end of that range. But that said, clearly, the raw material escalation will have some impact on working capital as we just cycle through those increases and get them out into the marketplace. So really, that's the reason why we're sticking with the 1-point -- $1 billion to $1.1 billion. It's basically that point. As I said, we think we can get to the upper end, but let's wait and see what happens with any further raw material movements. But that's really the simple answer. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then you saw strong Rigid volumes in the quarter. I think hot filled volumes were up double digits. And I think you indicated on the Flexibles side for next quarter, there wasn't necessarily much in the way of a big COVID benefit when we look at the year-over-year comp. If I got that right, does that also apply to Rigids? And just as the U.S. economy reopens, how should we think about the positives and the negatives for Rigid on kind of a year-over-year comp basis? Ronald Delia : Yes. Look, I think you're right to call it the trends. I mean the business hasn't had much of an impact. I mean I know we've sort of sounded like a broken record on that point because we don't have a whole lot of exposure to the foodservice side. The place where we have a little bit of exposure is the convenience channel in Rigids, where you saw some softer sales at times last year. The offset to that has been the health care segment. The 2 just about net. And so, again, I think somebody else asked the question earlier and I made the comment. As far as trying to find a comp and whether it's a negative or a positive, there's just not a whole lot in it for us. So I think you're going to see volume growth at the end of the year that's consistent with our long-term averages. We're having, obviously, a pretty good year in Rigids, with positive mix on the hot fill side. But that's really driven by just the consumer demand in some of the hot filled sports drink, juice and tea segments more than anything else. Operator : Your next question will come from Salvator Tiano of Seaport. Salvator Tiano : Firstly, I wanted to see a little bit with your fiscal 2022 starting in less than 2 months from now. How should we think about the earnings grade, some big key items, key buckets for EBITDA? And I know you have additional Bemis synergies. There's going to be accretion from buybacks. But any other things we should consider as we look into next fiscal year? Ronald Delia : Look, actually, I think you described the main elements in the bridge. I think -- and it's -- there's no secret here. We pretty much lay it out there each quarter. The business will generate organic growth kind of mid-single digits, 3% to 4%. I think, as you've heard us say a few times, the momentum organically in the business has accelerated actually this year. So you can make your own assumption around that piece. The Bemis synergies, we're saying we're going to end up this year at about $70 million. We got last -- we got $80 million last year and we're on track to get at least $180 million, so you can make your own assumption about what the increment might be next year. And then we repurchased shares this year, which will add to the base for next year. And then the other thing that we want to make sure people don't lose sight of is this business will generate a lot of cash and will generate well over $1 billion of cash again next year, which will result in $300 million to $400 million left over after CapEx and after dividends. And we'll do something with that. And that's been our track record. We've been active acquirers over the years, and we've also been active share repurchasers over the years. And so you should assume that some productive use for the benefit of shareholders will come out of that extra cash. Salvator Tiano : Perfect. And touching base exactly on potential opportunities for M&A, what are you seeing on the pipeline? What's your view on the multiples out there? Any specific areas that you're targeting? And I guess, on the reverse side, I think we -- after being Bemis especially, people are spending less and less time focusing on your folding carton business. Does this continue to fit into your strategy going forward? Ronald Delia : Yes. Well, let me answer the first part, and then I'll come back to folding cartons. Look, we're going to be active acquirers, there's no question about it. And we've done about 30 deals over the last 10 years, and I hope we do at least that number over the next 10 years. That will be part of our playbook. This is an industry where even despite leadership positions across our portfolio, there's still lots of bolt-on opportunities across Flexibles and in Rigids. And then there's some areas that we would like to double-down on or that represent bigger opportunities for us, I mean, obviously, Flexibles in Asia. We have a business that's well over $1 billion in sales, but the market opportunity is enormous. So hopefully, we can supplement our growth there with M&A as one example. Probably another one would be in the Rigid Packaging space outside of beverage. We've got a big business growing well organically, but can we supplement that with further M&A, we certainly hope so. So those would be a couple of examples. But there's bolt-on opportunities across the board, and we really hope to be active. Look, on folding cartons, it's a business that's about 8% of sales in Amcor. It's the industry leader in what it does because it's a very specialized type of folding carton, high-graphic intensity and shapes and tactile features as well. So it's sort of at the high end. It's not cereal boxes per se. So it's a high-margin business that generates a lot of cash. And it's pretty core to our Flexibles perimeter because it's essentially a printing and converting business. And industrially, it looks exactly like our Flexibles businesses. In fact, some of the equipment is actually the same. So it's every bit as core as everything else, and it's got a great financial profile. It's obviously got a different top line profile than the rest of the company. But from a return on capital and cash perspective, it's about as good as it gets. Operator : And your next question will come from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : So I guess, first question, just thinking about kind of business trajectory. I was hoping you could maybe give us a bit of a split by geography in terms of what regions, especially EM versus developed markets. And especially, you talked about some of the volume kind of weakness in health care, and any sense on kind of the -- when comps -- when do comps ease there and visibility to business activity kind of picking up, especially in the U.S., where it's getting past the worst of COVID, it seems. Ronald Delia : Yes. Well, look, health care is a good long-term grower. I mean that's a business that would have been disproportionately accretive to growth for a long period of time. And it's a medical device business and it's a pharmaceutical business. And both of those have fantastic financial characteristics, including growth in excess of more traditional FMCG growth. And that will come back, there's no question about that. And I think we're seeing signs of life in the developed markets, in particular, which were the hardest hit through COVID. So we operate that business globally. And in particular, it's big in Europe and North America as you would expect. And those are the areas where the COVID impacts, the reduced elective surgeries, the lower prescription rates, had a particular bite. So that's obviously -- I think we're coming out the other end of that. And hopefully, over the next couple of quarters, we start to see that normalize, and normalize in that sense means it's accretive to growth. That's been the big impact, really. The rest of it is -- the rest of the portfolio will continue to grow low single digits. The comp issue is sort of less meaningful everywhere else in the company, except for the negative impacts from the health care dynamics that I just referred to. Adam Samuelson : Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up on the ePac acquisition, which I thought the framing of it was different than you called it, a corporate venture investment. But can you talk about kind of what your real plans are for that business? And is it -- is there a real opportunity to gain some penetration with faster-growing small- and medium-sized customers that you struggle to reach today? Ronald Delia : Yes. Well, look, I think the framing is intentional. So I'll talk about ePac in a second, but the key point to take away here is that we're going to be much more purposeful and systematic in tapping into external ideas of all types. We believe, and we have conviction, that we have differentiated R&D capabilities in the company. But we're not naive enough to think we've got all the great ideas out there. So that's really -- the headline message is that we're open for business if there's a great idea that somebody wants to help -- wants help developing or wants to come talk to us about. ePac is a corporate venturing-type investment. It's a minority stake in a business that is essentially a startup. It's about a 4-year-old business. Fantastic business. It's really exciting. It's a flexible packaging business in essence. And it's gone really from 0 to about $100 million in sales in 4 years. It's got about 15 sites, most of them are in the U.S. I think there's a couple outside the U.S. And we're really excited to learn from it, quite frankly. So the first objective is to learn and kind of leave it alone. And what we hope to learn is in a few areas. One is the commercial approach, which, as you point out, is geared towards smaller enterprises, and it leverages short runs, quick turnarounds and also high quality. So that's -- there's a commercial learning opportunity for Amcor. I think, industrially, the business is enabled by digital printing and some other kind of neat industrial aspects inside the 4 walls of a plant, which are also interesting to us. And then the third thing, honestly, is how does the business grow from 0 to $100 million in 4 years. And I think there's a whole lot we can learn, like any big company, from a startup and how that happens, from a managerial and organizational perspective as well. So we're going to leave it alone a little bit, Adam, in the first instance, not a little bit, we're going to leave it alone. And we're going to watch and listen and learn. And then watch the space. I think you'll see different manifestations of those learnings benefit Amcor for many years to come. Operator : Your next question will come from Larry Gandler of Cr\u00c3\u00a9dit Suisse. Larry Gandler : I also had a question about ePac and raw materials, so might as well continue the ePac conversation. 0 to $100 million in sales in 4 years, that's, as you say, incredible. What does it say about the size of that market? Can you give us some color about how big that small customer market is and really, what the opportunity is? Ronald Delia : Well, look, I think it says that it's pretty damn big. I don't know that we would even size it. I think it's -- that's primarily a U.S. figure that I gave you, and so you can compound that when you think about the other parts of the world. So look, I think it's really big. What I don't know at this stage is just, of that bridge from 0 to $100 million, how much of that is new business with new customers of that type versus how much of it is the growth of those customers as they continue to outgrow big multinational FMCG players. But both are important. But direct answer to your question, Larry, I'm not sure we could really size it per se. Larry Gandler : Okay. Let me ask it a different way. When you look at ePac, do you have any similar customers, or is it a completely different market than where Bemis and Amcor is hitting in the U.S.? Ronald Delia : Well, we certainly have customers like that in the rigid space. We -- in some respects, you've heard us talk about our regional business unit. In some respects, we created our own version of ePac about 5 or 6 years ago in Rigids for exactly that purpose. Look, in Flexibles, I would say, I'm sure we have customers of that type, but I'm not sure we've been all that purposeful and systematic about attacking that part of the market, and that's where the real opportunity comes from. Larry Gandler : Okay. And then on raw materials, Ron, you described the situation as manageable. As I talk to investors and characterize Amcor, we talk about it as safety, quality, The Amcor Way. When it comes to managing raw materials, I know pass-through is one of your mechanisms, and that also characterizes Amcor. But can you give us some anecdotes about Amcor's raw material procurement? I remember, perhaps in the last or two resin spikes ago, I think Amcor was bringing resin into the U.S. from Asia in a unique fashion, which others were not doing. So maybe you can call out some anecdotes on how you're beating the higher raw material costs through procurement and raw material management. Ronald Delia : I will, but let me just make one thing really clear. Like the convention in the industry is that the raw material fluctuations are passed through to the marketplace. And so this is really -- the conversation about the lag or the P&L impact of changes in raw material prices is really about the commercial side of the business and the commercial capabilities of, first of all, measuring what those changes are and then executing price increases to recover those costs. So that's the absolute key point here. And I think we have, I think, a pretty special approach to doing that, which goes all the way back, firstly, to understanding the profit of each order and each customer and each product. So I can talk more about that, but that's the commercial side. On the procurement side, which I would treat as a slightly different dimension, I think our procurement capabilities have evolved over the years. I think as we've gotten bigger, we've added people, we've added expertise, we've added IT systems. Our buy is broad. I think the fact that we're now a bigger buyer in the U.S. gives us visibility into the dynamics in this market, that maybe we always had in Europe and didn't have as well in the U.S. As regional as the market can be at times, it absolutely has elements of a global market as well. So I think all those things contribute. Operator : Your next question will come from Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal. Mark Wilde : Ron, I wonder with COVID, are you being drawn into more conversations with your customers about automation and automation of the packing process as part of the packaging? Ronald Delia : Yes. I mean look, there's -- automation has always been important, and it's always been important from a productivity perspective, I think, for obvious reasons in terms of labor cost reductions. And so that's always been there. I think what's added, what's been accretive to that discussion now is the hygiene factor, right? And then obviously, meatpacking gets a lot of attention. There are other segments as well, where you've got a lot of people in a confined space, and that creates a health risk, the way none of us appreciated 12 months ago. So the short answer is absolutely. And I think we have some unique product offerings that will help support that over the journey. Mark Wilde : Yes. And just I remember about 4, 5 years ago, Bemis was talking about a flat film technology they use in fresh meat that would replace kind of 3-sided bags, which got to be stuffed manually. Are you seeing pickup there? Ronald Delia : Yes. Well, you're on it. I mean that's the differentiation, right? There's 2 ways to pack fresh meat, really simply stated. There's a film -- a continuous process using film, and then there's bags and -- which obviously has been more labor-intensive. So we think we have some good products to offer in both. But our film technology, we would put up there with anybody's. So yes, we would expect to see an acceleration in that space. Mark Wilde : Okay. And then just as a follow-on, you mentioned the use of a PCR PET in a number of new North American, what you see thereabouts. Just trying to get a sense of what percent of the mix post-consumer PET, would be at this point for you in North America. Ronald Delia : Yes. I'm glad you asked because we're pretty excited about this. I mean it's almost becoming pervasive. So we're going to exit this year in North America, converting about 10% of our resin as post-consumer recycled material. So 10% of what we convert in North America will be PCR. In terms of absolute pounds, that's a doubling of the amount of pounds we were converting 2 years ago. And that's despite the pandemic. And the pandemic has actually slowed down that trajectory. We probably would be at a higher level than 10% had it not been for some of the disruptions in the supply chain from the pandemic. And it's also pretty exciting that many of the new SKUs that we launched, and we've got a lot of new product examples scattered throughout our materials today, many of them are made with 100% PCR. And it's almost like electronic vehicles to some extent. We're not launching a lot of new products in PET that aren't leveraging PCR to some extent, and many of them are 100% PCR. So I think what you're seeing, you're right, kind of we're in the middle of a migration to a different industry convention, which says there's no reason you can't continue to reuse this material over and over and over again. Mark Wilde : Is the supply of PCR the limiter, or is it just getting the consumer goods companies' price? Ronald Delia : It's a little bit of both. I think, right now, we're adequately supplied, and I would say the market is creating the right level of demand. We all project out, at some point in the near to medium term, where we could have a supply constraint. But that's absent other factors that will increase supply, things like deposit legislation expanding beyond 10 states in the U.S., things like consumer education. We see the -- you may have seen the Every Bottle Back campaign that a number of the beverage companies are cosponsoring. So absent big increases in supply, we could be tight in the next couple of years. I do think there will be big increases in supply, however. So I think this trend will continue. I think it will accelerate, quite frankly. I think we get through the pandemic, any concerns around hygiene, any cessations of collection schemes will end, and we'll start collecting again. And I think that 10% number that we're going to end this year at will be much higher 12, 24 months from now. Operator : Your next question will come from Brook Campbell-Crawford of JPMorgan. Brook Campbell-Crawford: I just had a couple of follow-up questions on the corporate venture and -- side of things. Just wondering if you had considered pre-committing a dollar amount to an internal fund of some sort. Or is it just really opportunistic investments sort of made at the head office level? That's the first question. And then the follow-up would be, would you consider investing in raw material processing or recycling assets on that side of things, the sort of evolving technologies on the raw material side? Ronald Delia : Yes, two good questions, two discussions that are always ongoing inside Amcor. On the corporate venturing side, we are getting more systematic, as I said. Part of that is including a couple of staff who will be full-time focused on this. Whether or not we're going to communicate a number remains to be seen. We probably will. We'll allocate a certain portion of capital every year towards investments of that type, but it won't be material. I can tell you that in the grand scheme of the capital budget that we have each year or the free cash flow that the business generates. But we think a purposeful amount of investing on a regular basis will help us make sure that we're tapped into the best ideas out there. So I would say, look, watch this space on this one. There will be more to be said on this topic. On the investments in the recycling part of the value chain, look, never say never. We prefer not to put big looks of capital into parts of the value chain that are not necessarily areas we can be differentiated and unique in. We would prefer to be a demand catalyst and a source of demand for others who might put their capital in those spaces because it's more aligned with what they do. And then the other way that we hope to influence infrastructure development is through some of the collaborations and partnerships that we've entered into. And we announced recently that we signed up with the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, which is not a new entity, but one that we stayed close to for a couple of years and are really encouraged by the progress that, that group is making, particularly on the waste management side. So we're hopeful that we can influence that part of the responsible packaging equation without allocating substantial amounts of capital. Brook Campbell-Crawford: Understood. And one quick one for Michael. Just on the corporate cost line. In the 9 months, about $18 million increase in corporate costs if we sort of put synergies to one side. Are you able to just provide a few examples of what's driven the step-up there? And is any of it one-off in nature so that we might see it online in FY '22? Michael Casamento : Basically, Brook, the corporate cost increase is $8 million year-to-date. You have organic synergies there. There's puts and takes against that. But if we just think about that, half of the $8 million is FX, so we have unfavorable FX in that. And we've talked about some insurance claims, higher insurance claims that we've had and the insurance costs that we've had year-to-date. So they're really the 2 key areas behind the increase. As we look forward, I would say that they're probably going to roll through the year-end, and that's going to be about the increase versus prior year at year-end. So really, that's -- you're not seeing any major movements in the costs, albeit we are investing in things like sustainability and innovation in those areas. So we'll continue to invest in that space as well. Operator : The next question will come from Keith Chau of MST Marquee. Keith Chau : The first one, Ron, just following up on Adam's question previously on raw materials. I think in the disclosure, it talked about an unfavorable impact of revenues in the 9 months. But certainly, as raw material prices have increased then, the impact on sales should be favorable within the third quarter of FY '21. So just wondering if you could narrow it down just to give us a sense of whether raw materials did contribute favorably to sales and whether there was indeed an impact or not in the third quarter. And as we look into the fourth quarter of fiscal year '21 and the initial quarters of the next financial year, whether there will be any impact from raw materials. Ronald Delia : Yes. I mean absolutely. The short answer is yes. So in the third quarter, in the Flexibles segment, you'll see a positive impact from raws, and I would suspect that will be the case in the fourth quarter as well. Keith Chau : Any guesses as to what the magnitude could be or not material enough to be concerned about? Ronald Delia : Not material enough to be concerned about because also, as we report the numbers, we're always referring in the first instance to organic sales, and so we're stripping out that impact. But I'm just -- I'm answering your question directly, and there will be a positive impact from -- in reported sales from passing through higher raw material costs. Keith Chau : Okay. And then the second one, it seems like the business is becoming significantly more comfortable with the Bemis assets. Certainly, an upgrade coming through for synergies, if not today, being the soft upgrade there and something further in the future. Can you give us a sense of whether that will be driven through the cost line or whether you're starting to see some revenue synergies to start coming through for Bemis? Ronald Delia : Yes. Michael might just comment on the cost side, and I'll talk about the commercial benefits. Michael Casamento : Yes. No, look, so on the cost side, as we said, we feel really good about where we are. I mean the integration has gone exceptionally well. We've been able to generate synergies from the G&A side from the procurement. And more recently, we're starting to get impact on the footprint side. And as Ron commented earlier, we got $80 million last year. We're at $55 million year-to-date this year. And we'll end up approximately $70 million by year-end. So as we exit the year, we will have captured $150 million, and we'll be at least able to catch the $180 million. And we've got clear line of sight around the projects that are still to come to deliver that extra synergy benefit next year. So as we get more and more through the time frame, we feel more -- increasingly confident around that delivery. So we're right on track to deliver at least $180 million. Ronald Delia : Yes. And then just briefly on the commercial side, I would say, more broadly, I mean, I think there's examples of products' transfers going in both directions. And we've called out a few examples. I mean I wouldn't describe them as material yet, but we've got some products going from the North American business into ANZ. I think we've got an example on Bega Cheese individual wrap slices. That's a good example of leveraging a structure from the U.S. legacy Bemis business into ANZ. We've got some examples going the other way, from our New Zealand dairy film business, going to the U.S. market. So I think you'll see more and more of that. It's a really interesting and complementary mix of segment participation that the businesses have had historically. If I look in North America, the big positions in protein and hard cheese, processed cheese that we acquired are absolutely additive for our portfolio in Europe. And then the pet food and coffee positions that we've had, in Europe, historically, are completely new and additive to the Bemis -- the legacy Bemis platform in North America. So I think we'll see more and more of that. I think our way to probably describe that will be through examples as much as anything else. But I think we're starting to see it already. Operator : Your next question will come from Kyle White of Deutsche Bank. Kyle White : On the severe weather this quarter, was there any meaningful impact to earnings from this event outside of the raw material inflation that you saw? Ronald Delia : Yes. I mean I wouldn't say material, but definitely impacts. I mean we, like everyone else, we're struggling to get raw materials at times. Some of the businesses that were most dependent on specific materials at the specific plastic plants were a bit constrained. So we had all of that and more. I mean it's a really difficult quarter, which is why we're particularly proud that it was our best profit quarter of the year, not to mention the fact that in certain parts of the world, we're dealing with continued impacts from COVID. In Latin America, India, the businesses are wearing extra costs and certainly extra complexity and management time and attention to keep everybody healthy. So we're not calling anything out as material, Kyle, but there's no question that the business had a headwind in the quarter from all those exogenous factors. Kyle White : Yes. I know it's a bit early, but given the greenfield plant you referenced on Slide 8 in China, should we anticipate an uptick in CapEx next year? Or will it be kind of similar to this year's level? Michael Casamento : I'll take that one, Kyle. Look, I think we typically would spend 3.5%, 4% of sales on CapEx. Last year being the first year after an acquisition like Bemis, it was a little lower than that so we were around the $400 million mark. I think this year, this FY '21, we'll finish the year probably about 10% higher than that. And as we look forward, we can manage these investments of this kind. We've done them before within our CapEx spend, and you should expect that the CapEx is going to be somewhere around 3.5% to 4% of sales, so probably getting closer to $500 million as we move forward. And we're really pleased with these type of investments because they generate growth and they get good returns. And they really help us support our customer base as well. So we're quite pleased to be able to invest in these activities. Operator : Your next question will come from John Purtell of Macquarie. John Purtell : Sorry, just another one on raw materials, obviously a popular theme here. But if we go back to fiscal '18, I mean, emerging markets seem to be, in particular, an area that we saw an extended lag of up to 6 months. So you seem to be flagging a shorter lag this time. So I know you've sort of alluded to it, but just trying to understand what dynamics have changed there. Ronald Delia : Yes. I mean it's a good pickup, John. You've watched the company for a long time, and there's, as I said, I alluded to it in my answer earlier, like we -- I think we've improved. We improved with each commodity spike, and we improved not just when raws are going up but I think each year. And so if I contrast where is the company today with where were we in 2018, when I also would have said we're reasonably good at this, I think that the base capabilities are more pervasive around the company. So the Asian business, the Latin American business are closer in sophistication and maturity at passing through raw materials. They're our most indecipherable, from maybe the legacy European business. That would be the key, if I look back at the 2018 cycle, that would be the key legacy of that. If I go back to the one before, we got much more sophisticated about aluminum when the spike in aluminum occurred in sort of 2011, '12. So each of them, each opportunity for learning is capitalized on them, and I think our capabilities are just continuing to evolve. John Purtell : And just the final one. We've seen large increases in aluminum and inks and solvents prices. Is the pass-through lag or pass-through and recovery mechanisms similar to resin? Ronald Delia : Yes, yes. The short answer is yes. I think that we have good contractual coverage. For contracted customers, we absolutely have coverage over those commodities. And the pass-through mechanisms function, for all intents and purposes, the same way. Operator : Your next question will come from Nathan Reilly of UBS. Nathan Reilly : Just a question coming through on plant capacity and utilization. Can you give us a bit of an update on where you are on those factors at the moment? Notwithstanding the fact you've flagged some growth opportunities, but are there any areas around the network where you might be a touch constrained? And are there some opportunities to grow with customers in some of those areas of the network? Ronald Delia : Yes. Look, it's a very good question. The one standout area is in the hot fill space in containers in North America. I think, without question, the network is maxed out. It's a segment that has grown steadily over a 5- or 6-year period at about 3% a year, but obviously has had a much better run over the last several quarters. And so, without question, that part of our footprint is capacity-constrained at the moment. Now that won't last forever. Obviously, we'll put the capacity in place if necessary to capitalize on that growth. But that's the one that stands out. Other than that, the supply-demand balance is manageable. But as Michael alluded to a couple of questions ago, we do hope to deploy some more capital and get back up towards that 4% of sales number to capitalize on the growth opportunities that we're seeing. Operator : And that's all the time we have for questions today. I'll now turn the call back over to the presenters for the closing remarks. Ronald Delia : Okay. Thank you, operator, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call today, for your interest in Amcor and for your questions. We'll close the call now. Thanks very much. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you very much for joining. You may now disconnect.",

After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Tracey Whitehead, Head of Investor Relations, please go ahead. Tracey Whitehead : Thank you, operator. And thank you, everyone, for joining in plus the full-year call for Fiscal 2021. Joining the call today is Ronald Delia, Chief Executive Officer, and Michael Casamento, Chief Financial Officer.  At this time, I'll direct you to our website, amcor.com under the investor's section, where you will find our press release and presentation which will be discussed on the call today. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and related reconciliations can be found in the press release and presentation on our website. Also, a reminder that the call today includes some forward-looking statements, which remain subject to certain risks and uncertainties.  Please refer to Amcor's SEC filings, including statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q to review factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we're discussing today. During the question-and-answer session, we request that participants limit their questions to a maximum of two and then rejoin the queue for any follow-up. With that, I will turn it over to Ron. Ronald Delia : Thanks Tracey and thanks to everyone for joining us to discuss Amcor's Fiscal 2021 full-year results. Joining me today, as Christine mentioned as Michael Casamento, Amcor's Chief Financial Officer. We'll begin with some prepared remarks and then we'll open the line for Q&A. We start every meeting at Amcor with safety, we'll begin there on Slide 3.  Safety is the first and most important of our values and Amcor has been on a long-term journey towards our goal of no injuries. Our safety performance has shown continual improvement, including in the last 12 months where our performance has been a real highlight. Across Amcor, we reduced the number of injuries by almost 25% compared to last year. All of our businesses reported fewer injuries and over half of our sites have remained injury-free for at least 12 months.  And through a year where the pandemic continued to present operational challenges in many countries, our focus on safety was unwavering, and we're incredibly grateful that our people continue to be engaged and focused on staying healthy as well as safe. We're proud of our safety performance, which we believe is the best in our industry and the progress we've made over a number of years but we're also convinced that our objective of no injuries is absolutely possible, and we continue striving towards that goal. We have 4 key messages today, which are set out on Slide 4. First, FY '21 was an outstanding year for Amcor on multiple dimensions. The operating environment remains highly dynamic, but our teams stayed fully focused on the key business drivers within our control, remained agile as conditions changed, and demonstrated exceptional execution and consistency all year.  Financial results exceeded our expectations as the year progressed. We ended the year with momentum and we expect another strong year in fiscal '22, which is the second key message. The third, our recent performance in many ways is a result of the financial and strategic benefits from our 2019 acquisition of Bemis. 2 years on immigration is now essentially complete. The financial benefits are ahead of our expectations and strategically we're better positioned than ever, with a stronger foundation for growth into the future.  And lastly, we're capitalizing on that strong base by investing in the number of organic growth initiatives, which will maintain our momentum beyond fiscal '22, and for the long term. Turning now to the financial highlights on slide 5, FY '21 was an exceptional year financially for Amcor with record earnings, exceptional margin management, despite steep raw material cost increases and supply constraints, and momentum building through the year. Organic sales growth was 2% and we exited the year in Q4 with sales 3% higher than the prior year. EBITDA growth was 8% with the flexibles and rigid packaging segments, both delivering strong results, growing in several higher-value end markets, and contributing to margin expansion. In Fiscal '21, Amcor's EBITDA margins increased 60 Basis points to reach 12.6% for the year, which is a new high, and an exceptional achievement in an environment where raw material price increases in supply disruptions continue to require an intense focus on securing the availability, as well as managing price recovery.  We estimate Bemis acquisition synergies were around $75 million. And as we close out the final integration activities, we expect to exceed the original synergy target by at least 10%. EPS increased 16% for the year and with the head of guidance, which we're able to continuously increase through the year. And free cash flow of $1.1 billion was at the top of our expected range. Return on capital or return on average funds employed finished well above 15% at a time when our cost of capital is at an all-time low. And through the year, we returned $1.1 billion of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and higher dividends.  The key message here is that the fundamentals of our business continue to strengthen, our teams around the world have demonstrated [Indiscernible] focus on executing against our strategy, and as a result, we've delivered another year of outstanding financial performance with momentum continuing to build as we begin fiscal '22. I'll turn it over now to Michael to provide some more detail on the financial results, and I'll finish up with some comments on growth and sustainability. Michael Casamento : Thanks, Ron. Good morning -- good evening, everyone. I'll start with a flexible segment on Slide 6, which performed very well delivering record sales, EBIT, and EBITDA margins for the year. Sales include recovery of higher raw material costs. And as Ron mentioned earlier, these have continued to move high during the quarter. Across the business, our response to being proactive and we have implemented price increases quickly. As a result, in the June quarter, net sales increased by more than 100 million, with the annual recovery run right reaching more than 500 million as we [Indiscernible] the year.  From an earnings perspective and consistent with last quarter, the price cost impact has remained manageable given the diversity of materials we buy and the multiple regions in which we consume those materials. This is clearly evident in our margin performance, which continued expanding in Q4 and through the year. From the volume perspective, demand in many of our key high-value end markets has remained consistently strong, including mate, coffee, and pet food. However, this is being offset by double-digit declines in North American medical volumes and European pharmaceutical volumes, driven by pure elective surgeries and lower prescription trends. From a geographic perspective, volume growth has been relatively broad-based with good overall performance in emerging markets. And more volumes in North America were higher than the prior year.  Along with Europe, this is where large parts of our healthcare business are located and growth in these regions is inclusive of our headwinds. Adjusted EBITDA is growing 9% in constant currency terms, mainly reflecting volume Growth, Exceptional margin management with expansion delivered every quarter, and around 65 million of cost synergy benefits related to the Bemis acquisition. Turning to rigid packaging on slide 7. In summary, the business has continued to deliver outstanding results driven by increasing consumer demand in both North and Latin America.  Sales growth included a 5% increase in volume, as well as a 3% price-mix benefit, including higher pricing to recover the cost inflation in Latin America. In North America, annual beverage volumes were 8% higher than last year and hot-fill container volumes were up 13%. Driven by rising consumer demand through the year, which resulted in capacity shortages and historically low inventory levels across the industry.  The volume was particularly strong in hot-fill categories, including sports drinks, ready-to-drink tea, and juice. Year-to-date, specialty container volumes were higher than the prior period, with grossing categories including spirits on the personal care and this was partly offset by lower volumes in the healthcare segment. Volumes in Latin America were 5% higher than last year with first delivered in Brazil and Argentina in particular. EBIT growth of 8% reflects higher volumes and a favorable mix across the business and this was partly offset by higher labor and transportation costs in North America. These high costs of being a direct result of capacity shortages and lower Inventory throughout our network introduced supply chain inefficiencies in the short-term ahead of installing additional capacity. rigid containers continue to be one of the world's preferred packaging formats into their recyclable, resealable, and hygienic and have the lowest carbon footprint.  As you will see on the slide, this preference continues to be reflected over time with format share and a healthy growing market remain inconsistent. Demand for recycled content is also rising rapidly and our use of recycled resin has doubled over the last two years.  Looking forward, we expect this trend to accelerate further and are working with customers on a very active pipeline of new product launches, incorporating higher levels of recycled materials. Moving to Slide 8, adjusted free cash flow of 1.1 billion was at the upper end of our expected range for the year, and we finished the year strongly. Compared with last year free cash flow benefited from the higher flow-through of higher earnings.  And this was offset by 100 million adverse impacts from the timing of U.S. cash tax payments and allowing the working capital benefit. Working Capital has been an area we have been particularly focused on through the Bemis integration and is a real highlight. In total since 2019, approximately 250 million of working capital is being released. And this has been a source of funds to cover synergy-related cash costs.  Capital expenditure increased in the current year as we have stepped up our organic investments in the high-growth segments and geographies. Looking ahead, we have a broad range of attractive investment opportunities and expect to increase the CapEx platform by the 10% to 15% in fiscal '22. Our financial profile is solid with leverage of 2.7 times on a trailing 12-month EBITDA basis and is right in line with our expectations. With strong annual cash flow and a strong balance sheet, the business has significant capacity and flexibility to invest in organic growth, execute M&A, as well as return a substantial amount of cash to Shareholders. In Fiscal '21, total cash returns to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases reached an impressive 1.1 billion. Turning to slide 9 in our outlook for the 2022 Fiscal year, we expect comparable constant currency EPS growth of 7% to 11% for the full year.  This excludes the effect of despising businesses which impact comparability, and an unfavorable current -- currency impact of approximately 1 cent per share, assuming current exchange rates prevail for the remainder of the year. So, on a reported basis, this results in an EPS guidance range of approximately 79 cents to 81cents per share. Free cash flow is expected to be 1.1 billion to 1.2 billion, up to 10% higher than fiscal 2021 EBITDA as we added accelerating capital investments to support organic growth.  Growing cash flow enables us to continue planning, and compelling, and growing dividends, and allocate cash to share purchases, which we expect will be around 400 million in fiscal '22, while retaining the flexibility and funding acquisitive growth when needed. So, with that, I'll hand it back to Ron. Ronald Delia : Thanks, Michael. I'll start with a few points to recap the Bemis acquisition on slide 10. The all-stock acquisition of Bemis was completed in June 2019 and was the largest in Amcor's history. So, two years in now, our integration efforts are essentially complete and the outcomes are clearly exceeding our original expectations.  Firstly, from a financial perspective, the transaction unlocked substantial value through the realization of cost and cash flow synergies, which have materially strengthened Amcor's financial profile. More specifically, based on our Fiscal '22 expectations over the 3-year period post-closing the acquisition, we will have out-performed the original cost synergy target of $180 million by at least 10%. And as Michael mentioned, the cash released from working capital over the last 2 years funded the cash costs to achieve those synergies. Margins in our flexible segment will be more than 200 basis points higher than in fiscal 2019. EPS will be at least 35% higher, or at least $0.21 per share. We will have repurchased approximately 25% of the shares issued to fund the acquisition. And the annual cash flow will be close to double Amcor's annual cash flow in the year prior to the acquisition. Strategically, Bemis was a perfect fit for Amcor. It was pure-play coming into what was already the world's largest global flexible packaging business.  And putting these two companies together created the only truly global flexible packaging platform able to serve multinational customers around the world with an even stronger value proposition, especially in the most attractive end markets like healthcare and protein, where our participation has meaningfully increased. Amcor's now the clear Flexible Packaging leader in every major geography, with greater absolute and relative scale advantages.  And we have strengthened our talent and capabilities, particularly in R&D, so we can support large and small customers with the broadest range of innovative and sustainable packaging solutions. Today, as a result of the Bemis acquisition, we're better positioned than ever with a strong foundation for growth looking forward. With that stronger foundation, we have a range of organic growth drivers that we're investing behind, and on Slide 11, we've highlighted a few.  First, an increasing percentage of our sales are coming from the most attractive, higher growth, higher value-add segments, where we have the best opportunities to differentiate, including healthcare and protein packaging and flexibles, and the hot-fill products segment in Richard's. Our Global Health Care business is approaching $2 billion in sales across medical device and pharmaceutical packaging, segments that required unique capabilities that are not easy to replicate.  We're investing to add both capacity and capability with current projects underway in Malaysia and Ireland, to highlight two examples. In protein and meat packaging, we have a great opportunity to leverage our capabilities and high barrier films and our growing business in North America to the benefit of our other businesses around the world. In the hot-fill rigid packaging segment, we have extensive intellectual property and product design capabilities, and we had to partner with customers to help them drive growth through innovation.  Given the sold-out environment we're in and the growth outlook, we're adding capacity across our North America plant network. The second organic Growth driver we're highlighting today is our leading emerging markets portfolio with over $3 million in annual sales and a long history of profitable growth.  Again, we're investing behind the emerging market opportunity, including in the new greenfield plant in China that we highlighted on our last call. And third, innovation and new product development will increasingly contribute to organic growth going forward. We've been investing in this area as well to extend our global innovation center network into Europe and China, through the recently announced partnership with Michigan State University School of packaging.  And with our entry into the corporate venturing space earlier this year. And finally, the number 1 organic growth driver for Amcor going forward, which cuts across the other 3, and really everything else we do will be the increasing need for more sustainable packaging. And we know there will always be a role for packaging for essential food and health care products.  And so, the ability to provide that packaging so that it meets all consumer needs and is more sustainable creates unique opportunities for growth. Slide 12 highlights sustainability a bit more, and as we take stock at the end of one financial year and start a new one, we are particularly pleased with the progress we are making to accelerate responsible packaging through advances in package design, waste management infrastructure, and consumer participation.  Examples of recent progress on package design demonstrate the breadth of our product range across substrates with packaging that uses less material overall and more recycled content, eliminates problematic materials, and has a better end of life profile. In terms of materials, our use of recycled resin in rigid packaging has almost doubled over the last few years, and we expect to almost double again over the next 12 to 18 months. We've also announced our new AmSky platform, which eliminates PVC and has the potential to transform the sustainability profile of health care packaging in particular.  To improve end-of-life outcomes, we've commercialized several new recycle-ready product platforms, including the polymer-based AmLite and AmPrima, and the paper-based Matrix product ranges, and we've entered into a new partnership to extend our offering of compostable solutions. Demand is growing for these new products and we'll be scaling up to capture the growth opportunity.  Making progress on weeks managing infrastructure and consumer participation will be equally important and both require close collaboration with others across the value chain. We stepped up that collaboration over the past year through our partnership network where Amcor's increasingly relied upon to shape and established packaging design standards around the world, which commended infrastructure investment and consumer education to help to prepackage out of the environment.  We'll talk more about our sustainability agenda following the publication of our annual sustainability report later this year. Slide 13 is a slide we shared late last year at our Investor briefing, but it remains relevant today. And we believe the Amcor investment case is as strong now as ever, and we set off the reasons why in the slide.  Several of the points have already been made, but in simple terms, we generated significant and growing free cash flow every year. In fiscal '22, that free cash flow will be up to $1.2 billion and that cash flow will comfortably support reinvestment in the business, as well as M&A and regular share repurchases, which in turn drive strong EPS growth. And in addition, we will continue to pay attractive and growing Dividends.  We also believe that momentum matters and momentum has been building in Amcor, which is clear from our recent performance and outlook comments, and the expectations we have for our Fiscal 2022 year. And finally, on Slide 14, a quick recap of our key messages from today, Amcor had an outstanding year in FY '21. We believe momentum is building and we expect another strong year in FY '22.  The Bemis integration is essentially complete and we've summarized the outcomes today which have exceeded our expectations. And finally, we now look forward to capitalizing on a range of organic growth drivers, and we're investing in the business to make that happen. With that Operator, we'll conclude our opening remarks, and we'd like to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. In the interest of time, we would like to remind participants to limit their questions to 2 and to rejoin the queue for any follow-ups. Our first question coming from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Your line is open. Anthony Pettinari : Good evening. For the 2022 guidance, is there anything that you'd say about the cadence of earnings growth, whether you'd expect that to be more second-half weighted or first half-weighted, given you. have a few moving Prices with cost inflation and some volume comps that are maybe a bit unusual? Michael Casamento : Again, we've given the full-year guidance that for you in that 7% to 11% typically, our business is weighted 45% first half, 55% second half, we haven't given particular guidance by quarter. But I think that range [Indiscernible] we're expecting to be within that as we because we hit to the year and through the year? Anthony Pettinari : Okay. And then you obviously have a large global footprint. Is it possible to say how the Delta variant has impacted demand if at all, across the regions that you operate in, and is there anything sort of anticipated in Fiscal '22 guidance from that perspective? Ronald Delia : Yeah Anthony, first of all, it's all incorporated in our guidance, our outlook on the top-line is our starting point for the outlook in the forecast for the coming year. It's really early to say, I think we would say that consumption and our demand, other than in healthcare, has more or less normalized over the last several months, notwithstanding the pickup in positive test results that are coming from the Delta variant. So, at this stage, we haven't really seen any kind of dislocation resulting from COVID in the near term here. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over. Operator : We have our next question coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird, your line is open. Matthew Krueger : Hi, good evening. This is actually Matt Krueger sitting in for Ghansham. I guess -- I just wanted to start out with given several moving pieces, including some unusual volume comps and things like that. Can you outline what your budgeting volume growth by segment and/or by region might look like for fiscal '22? And then just given that we're halfway through August already, can you -- can you talk about how the -- some of those sales in key segments or end markets are trended to kick off the year here? Michael Casamento : Looked at -- typically we'd expect low-single-digit growth from the top line, I mean, that's what you saw around this year, and if you look at the history that's typically what we see. So, I think if we can give you any more detail now, I think it's the low-single-digit is where we would point to. Ronald Delia : I think also if you look back over time, we have typically grown kind of mid-to-high single-digits in emerging markets and kind of low-single-digits in developed markets, which is consistent with consumption patterns in those different parts of the world. And then from an end-market perspective, we are pleased with the performance in some of the higher value-added segments. where we're really pushing. typically, protein pet food, coffee, the things where there's more differentiation. Healthcare would typically be at the top of that list, but obviously, we're in a bit of a blip because of Covid at the moment, but that's how we think about getting to that low single-digit expectation over time on the top-line. Matthew Krueger : Great. That's helpful. And then I just wanted to shift over to the raw material environment. Can you talk a bit about what type of headwind you experienced from higher raw material costs and potentially raw material shortages during the latest quarter and full-year of 2021, along with how those raw material trends are likely to impact your business as we move into 2022? Any detail on if you had issues procuring materials or if there was any downtime taken because of lack of supply would be helpful as well? Michael Casamento : Yes, all right. I'll take the financial [Indiscernible] to be alike, the first thing is, as you know, in standard industry, we pass through raw material pricing to customers on a contractual basis so it's a timing issue more than anything on that front. The other point about Amcor, obviously we have a broad and diverse range of raw materials and consumption around the globe so you've got to take that into account.  As you look at our number through the year. And then, of course, we built capabilities of the -- many years of getting that raw material pass-through. So, from where we sit today, we're really pleased with how we dealt with some of the spikes in '21. As we've said in the remarks, we have covered over 100 million in flexibles in Q4 alone and exited the year on an annualized basis that was about 500 million in those prices and more to come. The price lag costs as manageable as it was in Q3. And so, we haven't called that out specifically. And really the evidence around that is through our margins. So, you can see that our margins continued to expand in Q4 and in fact expanding in every quarter throughout the year. Michael Casamento : So, when we put all that together, we're really pleased with the way we've gotten to on that front. And our teams are really, really, we build capability in that space to make sure that we get that pass through efficiently. And then on the. Ronald Delia : As far as the outlook in terms of the commodities - I mean, as Michael said, we are pretty diversified, so it's always a little bit of a mixed bag, but generally speaking, we see things moderating and possibly the increases abating over the next quarter or 2.  As you pointed out, Matt, the supply availability, availability of certain materials is probably the bigger issue potentially. At the moment we have not taken any downtime to answer your question specifically, but there are certain materials, particularly some of the specialty grades that are in short supply and that are on allocation.  And that didn't quite disruptive and it consumes a lot of management time just to ensure that we are getting access. And I think we've done a good job of that by virtue of the scale and relationships we have in the breadth of the supply base we have, but that isn't big an issue as the price inflation. Matthew Krueger : Great, that's helpful. That's it for me. Thanks. Ronald Delia : Okay. Operator : We have our next question coming from the line of Salvator Tiano with Seaport Research, your line is open. Salvator Tiano : Yes. Hi, Ron, Michael, thanks for taking my questions. So, the first thing I wanted to understand all VPs, as we think about that 7 to 9% to EPS growth for next year : what are the key drivers of that besides the buybacks and the synergies? How should we think about it by segment and if it's more price cost recovery - driven or volume-driven? Things like that. Michael Casamento : Sorry, I can start. Salvator -- I mean, if you think about the growth descent until 11%, you're going to see around mid-single-digit from an organic standpoint as the first point. And then you've still got some benefits from the buyback to come through as always, more organic. So, there's probably 1-2% there that's going to come through. And then obviously we've got some synergies left to go, which will be low single-digit.  So that kind of explains to you the make-up of the guidance and obviously to get to the upper end we'd see some better revenue in the topline, perhaps a stronger recovery in healthcare. And that's the opposite in terms of the long end of the range, maybe some further raw material headwinds could drive the lower end of our range, but that's really the make-up of the components in that guidance. Salvator Tiano : Okay, great. And then I'm not sure if I missed it but do you have any outlook with regard to some other items, components of your EPS or free cash flow guidance, like interest expense, CPS, working capital expectations, and also cash boasted that you exclude from your adjusted free cash flow guidance? Michael Casamento : So yes. We've said the adjusted cash flow is going to be 1.1 billion to 1.2 billion. Again, a range there, which -- depending on the earnings, we hope that Working Capital potentially could move around depending on Headwinds to raw materials, but that's the key items there. We haven't called out specifically interest in tax.  I think you can expect that they'd be similar to where we are this year if there was something unusual to call out there, we'd call it out for you. Obviously, we're going to have higher earnings so the tax absolute will be higher, but otherwise, within that range. And then we're looking to invest more in the CapEx front, as I spoke to in my notes. And that's really to support organic growth into the future in several opportunities that we've got on hand today. Salvator Tiano : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Kyle White here with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Kyle White : Hey, thanks for taking the question. Wanted to focus on rigid packaging for my first question. Hot-fill volumes continue to see nice growth here. Can you provide a bit more details on what exactly is driving this? Is it still at home consumption with some of the large multipacks growing or is it really just being driven by the new product introductions and innovation that you're seeing on the net market? Ronald Delia : It's a good question because it's across the category. So hot-fill containers are typically used in ready-to-drink teas or certain premium segments of the juice market, and of course, isotonic or tranks (ph.). And those categories collectively are growing pretty rapidly and most of the participants and brand owners in those categories are enjoying that growth and it pretty much is a combination of the drivers you mentioned Kyle is I think, increased distribution and availability and multi-pack formats.  There is probably a bit more at-home consumption, but there are also a lot of new product launches and a lot of rejuvenation of legacy brands and also just extensions or introductions of new ones. So, there's a lot happening in that space. A lot is oriented towards healthier and better for you type line extensions or new products. And so, there's just a lot of activity there, and that's a segment where there really is only one packaging format.  I mean, it's a PG set of segments that's -- resale ability, lightweight, on-the-go consumption, it all kind of fits together with the value proposition of the plastic container. So, it's all coming together. The volume growth has been strong, we've seen strong volume growth in the past. We sort of expect at some point to get back towards mid-single-digits, but for now, the industry is enjoying strong growth and essentially a sold-out environment. Kyle White : Got it. That's helpful. And then on flexibles and healthcare packaging is just given to higher value, product for you or mix for you. What's the update there? Are you seeing a recovery in that end market or has it been dulled now, recently would come to uptake COVID cases with the tops inflation rates that we're seeing? Ronald Delia : I think it seems to have stabilized a bit. I'm not sure we're ready to call it to say that it's turned the corner, but these are segments and the predominant subsegments would be medical device packaging and pharma packaging. And we're more weighted towards pharmaceuticals in Europe and a little bit more weighted towards medical in North America. And these segments would be growing typically at mid-single-digits and have for several decades. And they offer great differentiation and therefore good margins.  I'm not sure we're ready to say that we've turned the corner, we see evidence that things may be stabilizing a bit, notwithstanding the recent spiking cases, I'm not sure hospitalizations have followed suit. So, I think -- we would hope that as we work our way through the fiscal year, that's an area that builds momentum through the four quarters of FY '22. Kyle White : Got it. Appreciate the details and good luck in the next fiscal year. Ronald Delia : Thanks. Operator : We have our next question coming from the line of Andrew Scott with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Andrew Scott : Thank you. Ron just wanted to sort of step back and ask a bigger picture question. Is it -- great job offsetting raw materials in these periods? Just want to sort of understanding how you say that ability's been changed with the Bemis acquisition, obviously my view -- if you like the thousand-pound gorilla brought that scaling and purchasing. Has that fundamentally changed your ability to manage your recent input and other input of costs? Ronald Delia : It's an interesting question, I -- there's a couple of things that have changed. What Bemis would have brought is just greater diversification in the buy. So, we got bigger, obviously, but -- and that helps. The relationships we have with the big suppliers are not unlike the relationships we have with big multinational customers. It definitely matters to be big on a global basis. And there's a lot of discussion about these regional markets or global markets, I think ultimately, we have some big global relationships and it's helpful.  So, Bemis brought to scale, it brought further diversification in the spend, and that's -- I'm sure it helped. But I think the other thing Andrew, and you've covered us for a long time, I think the experience curve, we continue to go down and we've kind of learned over the years and I've been around long enough to been through probably 3 of these peaks in the last 10 years.  And I think with every cyclical peak, like the one we've been going through, we get better and better in terms of the internal processes and capabilities to, first of all, measure what's happening and then take action and mitigate it. So, it's probably a combination of BMS and maybe just getting further down the experience curve that's kind of help us through this cycle. Andrew Scott : Understood. And I have told you for a while and I know this is a question that you probably too often, but to what extent should we view the comments around the buyback as a reflection on maybe a lack of attractive opportunities in the acquisition market of demand? Ronald Delia : Look, I don't think you should see it as an either/or. I think what you're seeing with this result -- we've been talking about the cash fix business, but that's for a long time, and this is going into our fiscal year with a line of sight to excess cash flow, even after continuing to fund the dividend and continue and actually fund more CapEx. As Michael pointed to, CapEx will pick up again in FY '22.  Even after those two allocations of cash, the business will generate a substantial amount left over. And we go into the year with an expectation that we will have to lease, buy back shares. And if there is an acquisition that popped up, we will not hesitate for a second to either suspend the buyback or to find the funding, which we would comfortably be able to do. So, it's, I think it's an And Andrew, it's not an Oar. Andrew Scott : Very helpful. Thank you. Ronald Delia : Thanks. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Adam Samuelson : Hi. Yes. Thank you. Good evening or good morning, everyone. I may be following up on that last question and your response, Ron. Just thinking on the M&A front, if you think about the kind of growth potential beyond Fiscal '22, obviously there are some more Bemis synergies that you're capturing and annualizing as you roll into your Fiscal '22 outlook.  The size and scale of that being this opportunity was fairly unique and probably not going to be easy to replicate. And so, I'm just trying to think about the ability or the confidence that you have to drive the inorganic growth, and especially not just to buy the businesses, but to extract value from them at scale moving forward where it might be harder to find businesses of Bemis resized moving forward? Ronald Delia : Look, it's a really good question at this point in time because we were absolutely resolute and focused on making the Bemis deal a success. And we know there's a little bit to do, but it's essentially complete, which is why we provided a bit of a wrap-up today. You're right, from a pure-play perspective, there's not another $6 billion to $7 billion deal out there that's -- that's obvious and we don't feel compelled to move outside of our product segment mix because we just think there's ample growth in the segments that we're in. So, if we constrained things or put the boundaries around the opportunities, that does not limit us in any way. I mean, generally speaking, if you go back over the last 10 years or so, the Company has been pretty acquisitive. We are probably up to around 30 deals.  We've had a good track record of bringing synergies out on the cost side, in particular, getting some product benefits as well so we'll continue to do that. I think there's no shortage of medium-size deals in the packaging space, as you can see every week there's another deal announced. And the good thing about being acquisitive and being big is that we're in the deal flow so almost never a deal was happening that is at least not put in front of us, and we at least get the option to take a look or not.  And that will be part of the formula going forward. So, the $400 million that we're allocating this year to buybacks, we have an equal amount each year that we'd be thinking about deploying in an ongoing sense for bolt-on (ph.) M&A. And then obviously if something better comes up then we would love to have a crack at that too. Adam Samuelson : Okay. And then maybe just following on the discussion on growth investments. Can you give me a little color on some of the capacity adds within the growth CapEx? I think I heard a $500 million number referenced earlier, so 100 million, 150 million or so of growth capital, just where that's being directed and more broadly, is meeting with some of the responsible packaging\u2019s invest, think the opportunity to pursue, if those might be greater uses of capital moving forward. Ronald Delia : Yeah. No, it's a good question. I mean, we are going to be stepping up. Will be about 4% of sales, which we think is a reasonable number to expect us to deploy each year. We did a little bit lower than that, because we have been focused on integrating Bemis and obviously, but will be at about 4% which means another bit of a step-up next year, which is incorporated into the free cash flow guidance that Michael described. Ronald Delia : Look, anecdotally some of the places that we're deploying cash, I highlighted a few. We're putting some capacity in the hospital space in North America. Great use of Capital, particularly when it's on-site, co-located within customer premises. Those are as good as it gets, in terms of organic investments.  We're investing in the medical space -- medical device packaging in Malaysia and in Ireland. We've got some capacity we're going to put in Malaysia for a certain product category that we typically export out of North America or Europe and we're going to localize that, which opens up just a whole other set of growth options for us.  And in Ireland, we're going to get into a product line and in medicine that we hadn't been in before. And then from our sustainability perspective, we made a number of announcements over the last 6 to 12 months in new products. So, we've talked about. a couple of platforms like AmLite, which is recyclable, or ready to be recycled retort pouch, which is unique and the demand has just been outstanding.  The product is sold out before it's even, barely getting been launched and so we're going to add capacity in Europe for that. So those are just some examples, but that all fits within that roughly 4% of sales number that's embedded in our free cash flow guidance. Adam Samuelson : All right. I appreciate the call; I'll pass it on. Thank you. Operator : We have our next question coming from the line of George Staphos. Your line is open. George Staphos : Thanks very much. Hi, guys, congratulations on the end of the year and I appreciate the rundown and the presentation today. Ron, I want to segue off that last question and maybe go to Slide 12. If we can -- if you could, for us, quantify or categorize the packages like AmLite likes the PVC film, free films, how much revenue do you think you're doing right now in terms of the responsible packaging product suite that you're offering your customers right now? And what do you think that's drawing at? If you could put any numbers around that.  And relatedly, is this scenario that could get -- I mean, the answer will be yes obviously, but where you really think there is an opportunity for acquisitions to improve your performance here, you really don't need acquisitions, you've got the best technology in the market so a couple of questions to start? Ronald Delia : Yeah, let me answer the second part first. We do believe we have the best technology in the marketplace. We also are humble enough to realize we don't have all the good ideas out there. And so, if there is an acquisition that would add to our product portfolio, we would absolutely do it. And it's one of the reasons why we're going to be much more active in the corporate venturing space.  It's another -- it's also one of the drivers of the investment with Michigan State. So, we're going to do much more in terms of external sourcing of, let's call it good ideas and innovation to supplement what we do believe is industry-leading R&D. So, I'd say watch this space. As far as the sales into we might describe it as more sustainable packaging, if we think about it through the lines of what's recyclable, or just take that lens, we're not for a second suggesting that that's the only answer here, but that tends to be the most readily available end-of-life solution.  We've got three broad segments, two of which are fully recyclable. So pretty much everything that we produce and sell on rigid packaging is recyclable. Everything we make in the carton segment is recyclable. That leaves the flexible segment. And in that space, right now of the sales in the flexible packaging segment, about 60-odd% of what we're selling today is considered designed to be recycled.  There's probably another 75% of our sales that could be. So, there's 10% to 15% that could convert, it would just require customers to adopt a different structure. And then you have additional platforms like AmLite, AmLite Matrix, and like AmPrima, which helped move those numbers up in steps. None of them are going to move that needle on those metrics in a material way, in a given year.  But over time, the percentage of our flexibles that are recyclable will start to increase as those products get to take up. I'll stop there, but we are also acknowledging that's not the end of the story. We've got to have the waste management infrastructure and the consumer has to participate as well too but as far as the package design, that's about where we're at. George Staphos : Okay. Ron, I appreciate that. And then coming back to the fourth quarter, and I recognize obviously Amcor likes to focus on the year-to-date results and the year results and you had a good performance. It looked like in flexibles, there was a deceleration, naturally a decline calling in the low single-digit range in flexibles.  Was that just purely healthcare and the continued weak end markets for you this year? Did anything else slow down for you at the end of the year as we're getting and going into Fiscal '22? Thanks, and good luck in the Quarter. Ronald Delia : Yeah, thanks, George. I mean, that's basically it's the same story that we have in flexibles all year, it's healthcare. Healthcare is a sizable business if you just think about it as in between $1.5 billion and $2 billion in sales if within that flexible's portfolio, or when you think about the big North America Medical business and European pharmaceutical business being down double-digits. That took a couple of percentage points off of what you would expect from a growth perspective, right? They should be growing mid-single-digits and they were down double-digits. So that takes a meaningful fight out of the overall segment growth. George Staphos : Thank you, Ron. Ronald Delia : Thanks, George. Operator : We have our next question coming from the line of Richard Johnson with Jefferies. Your line is open. Richard Johnson : Thank you very much. Good morning, everybody. Ron, our first question I just wanted to ask about organic growth in the Flexibles division. If I look at this over the last two years and absolute dollar change, all the growth comes from cost or efficiency lines. In fact, the mix of volume and price is negative. So that's obviously very impressive. So really my question is, how sustainable is that? Richard Johnson : How can you continue to drive organic growth simply through cost-outs or other efficiencies, and should we be worried about the fact that the mix of volume and price continues to be negative? Ronald Delia : Look, I mean, Richard, you followed the Company for a long time. The top-line sales are growing kind of low single-digits, actually about 2% for a long period of time. Flexibles would normally be in that space. I think the last couple of years is a tougher read-through if you're talking about the long-term trajectory of the business.  And that being said with that level of growth, we've been expanding margins for over a decade. And the flexibles margins now being up over 14% from where they were 10 years ago or so, probably 6 or 7, I think gives us some comfort that at that level of relatively modest top-line growth, which mirrors the end-markets that we supply. We're continuing to grow profit and expand margins. Richard Johnson : Okay, thank you. And then secondly, could you just run through the performance of the carton business in '21 and particularly by region? I'm interested to know; get an understanding of what volumes you're doing. Thanks. Ronald Delia : Yeah, with the carton business which is about 8% or 9% of sales, had a very good year. The business had a good year on profit. The profit was up. Great job managing costs. And actually, the volume performance is probably a little bit ahead of the long-term trend. That business from a volume perspective is likely to be flat to declining on a single-digit. Last year it was close to flat on a volume perspective too. It's -- by region, we start to get into some smaller parts of the business, but the bigger parts of Europe and the Americas would mirror the trends that I just described. Richard Johnson : Glad, thanks very much. Operator : We have our next question coming from the line of John Purtell with Macquarie... Your line is open. John Purtell : Well, good evening Ron and Michael. Ronald Delia : Hey, John, how are you? John Purtell : Just had a couple of questions. Look, the first one, Ron this is in relation to [Indiscernible] and some of those increments. Can you remind us what your return targets are on that incremental, all that growth campaigns? So, as you had growth [Indiscernible] targets in the past. So now they change, perhaps or not? The second question for Mac, in this in terms of that free cash flow of 1.1 Bill. What was the drug if any, from raw materials and higher assets leading to the, or impact on that? Thank you. Michael Casamento : Hey John. Yeah, I'll take that one. I mean, in terms of returns on CapEx, we really haven't changed the model there. I mean, it's a cash investment, we expect 20% return on those as a minimum, and that's typically what we work towards, so no real change there over the term. With respect to working capital, yeah, we saw some high [Indiscernible] during the period and some high receivables as we started to flush that through the system.  And then the offset was payable. So, from a year in perspective, it wasn't a meaningful impact, but there's probably still a little bit of that to flow through the system and it's more timing issue than anything. But in the cash flow that we saw at the year-end, we were pretty pleased with where we ended, it was a strong performance and we had a good finish in the year, and that's really on the back of the continued focus in working capital. And particularly around things like that as an overdue, we've had a really good performance there across the board. Just generally, inventory management is been strong, and we continue to manage with our supplies as well so I've already placed on the working capital front. John Purtell : Got it. Thanks a lot. Operator : We have our next question coming from the line of Anojja Shah with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Anojja Shah : Hi there. I wanted to ask about your sourcing of recycled resin. You're clearly sourcing enough to double your usage and then I think you said you're going to double it again over the next 18 months. And we hear from other companies that it's actually quite difficult to source the amount of recycled resin that they would like to. What do you think that Amcor is doing differently? Ronald Delia : Well listen, it's becoming more and more important, obviously, to our customers. A lot of what we use and maybe just to mention the numbers. So, across Amcor, rigid packaging would be the place where we're using the most recycled resin. We exited FY '21, converting about 10% recycled resin out of the total that we convert. And that number is growing in absolute tons as you referred to. But it also it's growing at a percentage of the resin that we convert. In that space, we are clearly the biggest buyer out there.  And so, we have been actively sourcing both from new entrants into the recycled resin space, as well as some of the virgin resin providers that have gotten into PCR. So, it's a pretty broad book that we're buying across. And then in flexibles, it is a little bit more challenging when you're trying to source polyolefins and that's still pretty nascent. A lot of the material that we're using for food for Flexible Packaging it's coming from food-grade, milk and water jugs and things and those are in scarce supply.  That will change over time. Chemical recycling will be a contributor over time. We're active in more than half a dozen different pilots and feasibility projects on chemical recycling around the world, which will be part of the mix too. So, I'd say what's the space, but we're so far, we've been able to satisfy our demand. Anojja Shah : Great, that's very helpful. Thank you. And then my other question, you've talked about exceeding with synergy target by at least 10%. Maybe you could just give a little more detail on where you're doing better than anticipated just so we could get a little more granular around that at least 10% number. Ronald Delia : Yeah. So, the retail number was $180 million, and that's the number that we're going to be buyback 10% or at least 10%. We talked at the time of the deal about three big sources. First G&A, overhead reductions. We estimated that would be about 40%. That's more or less track, and probably a little bit ahead of that number, but it's been in that ballpark. Procurement, we said would be another 40%, that's more or less in line. Ronald Delia : And then footprint, at the time of the deal we thought might be 20%. We found more footprint opportunities than we probably anticipated. And so more of the outperformance proportionately will come from Footprint, which means plan closures. So, if you stand back from it, it's mostly the Footprint plant closure side and a little bit on G&A, which is the source of the outperformance. Anojja Shah : Great. Thank you very much. Ronald Delia : Thanks. Operator : We have our next question coming from the line of Larry Gandler with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Larry Gandler : Thanks, everybody. Good day. A couple of questions obviously. My first question is, if I can do by way of example, the question is, what are the top 3 opportunities to create organic earnings over the next day, 3 years, call it FY '25? Here is an example of what I'm asking for; In Asia, you guys might be under skewing in terms of your overall market share in medical and pharma packaging relative to your market share in other parts of the world.  So, when you look at the size of the agent market, in medical packaging, is that an initiative Amcor might undertake, and how would they do it to grow out its earnings over the next 3 years? You might not look at its geography, you might look it maybe pet food across the world. So, can you dimensionalize those top 3 initiatives? Trying to look past short-term earnings. Ronald Delia : Yeah. It's a good question. I mean, you picked on one -- I'm not sure it makes the top 3. I'm going to elevate up on the top 3, but on the medical point, Asia specifically, absolutely. I mean, we're actually doing that now and that's the investment in Malaysia that I referred to where we're putting capacity in that part of the world that enables us to be much nimbler and more responsive to this local market demand, which is substantial.  So that absolutely is part of it. If I zoom out and I try to think thematically, one thing that comes to mind is broadening our participation in some of the higher value-add segments that were deepening in one region. Pet food, coffee, protein, these are segments that we have really strong positions in, but it's uneven so we might be particularly strong in Europe in 1, and a little bit weaker in North America.  And so, evening out that participation is going to be a big source of organic growth. As a region, as a whole, I would say Asia particularly China and India. And I would probably elevate up from medical and just say generally in the places we're choosing to play in those high-growth Asian emerging markets, that would make the list.  And then I probably wouldn't rule out rigid packaging in North America, particularly as we continue to expand the healthcare -- sorry, the hospital franchise that we have and grow in the Specialty Container space where there is technology and differentiation, but also share opportunities. So, it's a good question, Larry, I sort of give you those three -- certainly amongst the top 4 or 5. [Indiscernible]. Larry Gandler : Okay. I look forward to scoping those out maybe in near future. And my second question pertains to Alliance to End Plastic Waste. Ronald Delia : Yes. Larry Gandler : Excuse the criticism, but it feels like a bit of greenwashing here. I impose taking this executive committee position, and when you get on the website for Alliance to End Plastic Waste, first of all, there's no set of accounts and it's supposedly an organization that's well-capitalized, but when you look at the projects, I think there was a project in India where they put some sort of filter in a river which ends up getting stolen.  There are a couple of projects like in India and Africa where it's highly manual intensive, doesn't require auto (ph.) capital of collecting waste. This is an organization that's backed by billions and the project seemed very small. I'm just wondering where you want to take that organization? Because as you say, we need the waste management to make a structure, particularly in emerging markets. And I've always had hoped that that was going to be the organization that would drive it. Ronald Delia : Listen, Larry, I think it's finishing observation. I would say that all the different partnerships and organizations that were part of have catalyzed the most actual funding by a long shot. And so, I take on board some of these projects that have been launched are smaller. And I think -- to contextualize it also, we have to keep in mind, this is a new organization.  Essentially it was started a couple of years ago and then as soon as it stepped up with full-time management, the pandemic kind of has slowed things down, but there is more capital that's been committed by the executive committee and the board of that organization than anything else that we're associated with, it's real money, I mean, we write the check. Larry Gandler : And that's what scares me, there are just no such accounts that we've seen anywhere. Ronald Delia : While like any NGO, Larry, sometimes our industry association is not always this transparent, but the money that the participants are putting into that organization will crystallize and will catalyze action. And there are good examples. In the project stopping in Indonesia is a good pilot. There's one in the U.S. now called First Star, which is small. And I think as -- as the initiative gains steam, we will have bigger, bolder projects to point to. But for the early days, I'm pretty pleased with the way it's distributing its resources. Larry Gandler : Okay, good. Thanks for that Ron. Ronald Delia : Okay. Thanks, Larry Operator : We have our next question coming from the line of Nathan Reilly with UBS. Your line is open. Nathan Reilly : Hey, Ron, it's pretty clear that you are signaling the completion of the Bemis integration, which I guess gives you the bandwidth to go and pursue some of those smaller bolt-on M&A opportunities. But just given we haven't seen you too active in that space for the last few years, can you just remind us of your bolt-on M&A investment criteria? Just in terms of return metrics, but also where you'd be comfortable, taking leverage to. And also, where are you seeing the most attractive M&A opportunities right now? Ronald Delia : Yeah. I would say across our portfolio, there are going to be both opportunities pretty much throughout the business. If I had to put a priority list together, I would say flexibles to reinforce some of the higher value end-market segments that we're participating in or in Asia would be near the top of the list. I think in rigid packaging, the special space in North America outside of beverage, would be high on the list of -- that would be from a product perspective.  Returns are always going to be important. The Company is now generating a 15% return on capital. So, we need to be there or thereabout as we think about investments. From a leverage perspective, I wouldn't give you a number other than to say, we're going to be an investment-grade Company, always have been, and are committed to that. But within that, we have an ample capacity. If you think about the EBITDA now the business is over $2 billion. One turn, it would make for a lot of firepower for M&A. So, there's no constraint there. Nathan Reilly : Excellent. Thank you. Ronald Delia : Thanks. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Keith Chau with MSV. Your line is open. Keith Chau : Good evening Ron and Michael. So just a couple of follow-up questions on the adjusted free cash flow guidance. I take your point around step-up in CapEx, but obviously, you-all sitting thinking if what '21 was the time as a tax payment. So, Michael perhaps is from -- I don't want to stir you in a direction, but certainly feels like the low end of that range is probably unlikely and potentially getting more towards the top end. So, I'm just wondering if you can provide us with a bit more detail on where you think at this point in time, you'd be sitting with a net range, notwithstanding some of the moving parts? Michael Casamento : The range is there. It's a reason why range 1.1 billion to 1.2 billion. Obviously factored in that is the earnings guidance range so we've given a range [Indiscernible] 7% to 11% depending on where we end up in that range. We will drive the cash flow as well. And of the other key component is really the working capital movement.  I said earlier, we've had some raw material increases which we manage pretty well into the end of it by '21, that can be a factor as we head into '22. there can be some movement there to the upside or the downside. But that's really what's in the range. That said we've managed working capital really well. We had the last 2 years takin Michael Casamento : G cash out on that front. And as we move forward, we think this kind of be pretty stable. So, I mean there are drivers within that range. Keith Chau : Do you think Michael you can continue to improve that average moving capital to sales ratio, absent any other movements and raw material costs? I know you've done a good job, particularly in the [Indiscernible] '20. Any more opportunities to come from that? Michael Casamento : Typically, we'd say the working capital if you got back before the Bemis acquisition, the working capital content within that 8% to 9% range. And for us, we feel that's pretty comfortable, when we did the acquisition, it jumped up to 10.7, then we got it down to 9.5 and went down to 8. So, I think we feel pretty comfortable the way we are today. So, you shouldn't expect too much more to come out of working capital it'll be relatively stable. Keith Chau : Okay. Thank you. And then just a second question and forgive me if I've missed this one, but I think there were labor and transport costs called out for the rigid packaging business in part due to volumes growth that you're seeing within that business in North America. Is there an expectation for those labor and transportation costs to ease in the coming periods? Michael Casamento : The reason behind that was really -- we saw a significant increase in demand, which -- and basically the capacity is full -- the industry capacity is full. So, we didn't get a chance -- and opportunity to build inventory in the quieter months leading up to the summer. And so, what we experienced was increased costs just to manage the supply chain. So, we had shuttling costs, increased labor, and the like. And that's ahead of installing new capacity. Michael Casamento : So, we would be touched on today that we are installing new capacity in that off [Indiscernible] particularly. So, we'd expect over time they should start to obey as we get that capacity comes online. Keith Chau : And is its possible Michael to give us a quantitative estimate of what the headwind was in the fourth quarter? Michael Casamento : Yeah. It was about -- it was a few million in the quarter. Keith Chau : Okay. Okay. Fantastic. Thanks very much. Operator : We have our next question coming from the line of Scott Ryall with Rimor Equity Research, your line is open. Scott Ryall : Thank you. I just had one question. So, Ron you made some comments in your prepared remarks about the need for waste management infrastructure investments to pick up, which is -1 - that's very, very clear. Do you think that Amcor will have to invest in space? Obviously, you have to take an alliance approach at the moment. But do you think in order to control the development of that infrastructure that you will actually have to invest there? Thank you. Ronald Delia : Thanks, Scott. It's a good question. I mean, the short answer is no. I mean, we're going to be active in bringing responsible packaging to life in a number of different ways. But we'll also be -- and we'll have to be somewhat judicious and focused and disciplined about where we deploy our shareholder's capital and we think the best use of the capital is in developing packaging that is going to have a better end of life profile or uses more recycled material or less material in the first place. That's where most of our efforts will go. As far as waste management infrastructure, there's a number of different things and means to fund that, including extended producer responsibility regimes, bottled deposits, and things like that.  And when those are properly designed then we're very supportive of those, and that can likely be part of the answer, but I don't envision us putting capital to work in that part of the value chain on any extensive basis other than maybe just some pilots through a partnership or an alliance.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome. My name is Emma, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Amcor 2022 Half Year Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Tracey Whitehead, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Tracey Whitehead : Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Amcor's first half earnings call for fiscal 2022. Joining the call today is Ron Delia, Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Casamento, Chief Financial Officer. At this time, I'll direct you to our website, amcor.com, under the Investors section, where you'll find our press release and presentation, which will be discussed on the call today. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures and related reconciliations can be found in the press release and presentation on our website. Also a reminder that the call today includes some forward-looking statements, which remain subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Please refer to Amcor's SEC filings, included -- including our statement on Form 10-K and 10-Q to review factors that could cause actual results to differ from what we are discussing today. During the question-and-answer session once again we request the participants limit their questions to a maximum up two and then rejoin the queue for any follow-up. With that, I'll turn it over to Ron. Ron Delia : Thanks, Tracey, and thanks, everyone, for joining Michael and myself today to discuss Amcor's fiscal 2022 first half results. We'll begin with some prepared remarks before opening [Technical Difficulty]. I'll start with safety, which is where we start every meeting at Amcor. It's the first and most important of our values and keeping every one of our 46,000 employees around the world safe and healthy is our highest priority. In the last six months, we reduced the number of injuries across the Company by 10% compared to the prior year and 58% of our sites have remained injury-free for at least 12 months. Our teams have continued to make good progress on safety despite the complex environment, and we're proud of their focus, dedication and performance. However, our ultimate goal is no injuries, so there is more for us to do. We have four key messages set out today on Slide 4 for those following along with the webcast. First, we delivered a solid result through the first half, and we can confidently reaffirm our full year guidance. While we continue to navigate through the challenging and dynamic operating conditions affecting the entire industry, our teams are executing and performing exceptionally well. We continue to prioritize our customers and our scale and operational agility have enabled us to service demand and drive growth in priority segments, while also recovering higher input costs at the same time. We've also increased cash returns to shareholders, which is our second key message. We now expect to return more than $1.3 billion of cash in fiscal 2022 through dividends and share repurchases. Third, we built a strong foundation over the last several years, and we're focused now on investing for long-term growth, with an emphasis on priority segments and geographies and our innovation capabilities. And finally, for many years, we've made great progress against a broad range of sustainability goals, and we're raising our ambitions again with a commitment to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Turning to the financial highlights on Slide 5. We delivered double-digit net sales growth, which includes approximately $650 million of price increases. We remain incredibly proud of our teams and in the tools and capabilities we've developed over many years that enable us to continue recovering and increasing costs in an environment characterized by broader inflation that we've seen for some time. Excluding this pass-through impact, organic sales grew 2% on the back of higher volumes and favorable mix. Both segments in every geographic region contributed to organic sales growth and volume growth accelerated in the second quarter in both our flexibles and rigid packaging businesses. The Flexibles segment had a particularly strong quarter, generating high single-digit earnings growth and margins remain strong. In Rigid Packaging, our results for the half were in line with our expectations. The business continued to experience a particularly challenging environment in North America, which resulted in operating inefficiencies and higher costs, although we're encouraged by a number of favorable trends we've seen through the half and earnings improved as we exited the second quarter. EPS increased 9% for the half. Our financial profile remains strong and cash returns to shareholders are significantly higher. We've repurchased almost $300 million of shares in the first half, and we expect to repurchase a total of $600 million through fiscal 2022, which is $200 million higher than we anticipated last quarter. Combined with dividends, this means we anticipate returning more than $1.3 billion of cash to shareholders for the fiscal '22 year. With that, I'll hand over to Michael for some further detail on the financial performance. Michael Casamento : Thanks, Ron. Hi, everyone. And turning to Slide 6 and beginning with the flexibles, the business performed very well through the half year as our teams demonstrated impressive focus when it comes to recovering higher input costs and managing operating performance, whilst delivering growth in higher-value priority segments. Reported sales growth of 10% for the half includes recovery of approximately $480 million of higher raw material costs or 10% growth compared with last year. And in the December quarter, recoveries reached almost $1.1 billion on an annualized basis. Consistent with the outcome in the first quarter and as expected, the overall price cost impact in the first half was unfavorable, but remains manageable, given the diversity of materials we buy, the multiple regions in which we consume those materials and the implementation of a broad range of pricing actions. As a result, margins have remained strong at 12.9%, despite higher raw material costs and related pricing recovery. At $480 million through the half, the top line recovery alone had an unfavorable impact on margins of 130 basis points. Excluding this raw material impact, revenue growth of 2% was driven by favorable mix across the business, and reflects our long-term strategy of optimizing performance through the delivery of consistent growth in priority segments, including health care, coffee and pet food. Notwithstanding the dampening effect on volumes that supply chain disruptions had during the period in some categories, including health care and protein products, overall volumes across the business were in line with the first half last year, and we saw low single-digit volume growth in the December quarter. In terms of earnings, adjusted EBIT was up 7% for the half and reflects growth in high-value segments and strong operating cost performance. Turning to the Rigid Packaging business on Slide 7. Reported sales grew by 17% in the half, including 13% related to the pass-through of higher raw material costs. Excluding the raw material recovery, the business delivered year-to-date sales growth of 4% against a strong period of double-digit growth last year, and this included a 3% increase in volumes as well as a 1% price mix benefit. In North America, underlying demand in the beverage business remains strong, and year-to-date volumes were 3% ahead of the same period last year, accelerating to 6% in the December quarter and building on 13% growth delivered in the second quarter last year. Hot fill container volumes were broadly in line with the second quarter last year, notwithstanding we are cycling growth of almost 30% in the prior year. We have seen good volume growth in isotonics as well as iced tea categories, where customer demand for 100% recycled PET bottles has been strong. Specialty container volumes were lower against the prior year, which also benefited from higher volumes in the home and personal care category. And in Latin America, the business delivered double-digit volume growth reflecting strength in Argentina, Mexico and Colombia, and earnings were higher. From an earnings perspective, the business in North America was adversely impacted as we expected, by inefficiencies and higher costs resulting from industry-wide supply chain complexity and disruptions. As Ron mentioned, earnings performance improved as we exited the second quarter, and this was helped by a number of positive trends, including better availability of PET resin and new capacity coming online, which also supported our ability to build some additional inventories ahead of the peak summer season. Although the operating environment is likely to remain dynamic and somewhat complex, we anticipate conditions will continually improve, and earnings for the Rigid Packaging segment are expected to grow in the second half compared with the same period last year. Moving to cash and the balance sheet on Slide 8. First, as a reminder, our cash flow is seasonally weaker in the first half of the fiscal year, and this year, we delivered cash flow within our range of expectations for the half, particularly in light of a higher cost environment. First half cash flow was below last year, and this mainly reflects the timing impact of higher raw material costs on working capital across the business, along with planned inventory increases. We continue to maintain a strong focus on working capital performance, which is even more critical in an inflationary environment and our rolling working capital to sales ratio remains below 8% and in line with last year. As planned, capital expenditure is tracking higher than last year as we have stepped up organic investments in priority segments and geographies. And Amcor's balance sheet remains strong with leverage at 2.9x on a trailing 12-month EBITDA basis, which is where we'd expect to be at this time of the year, given seasonality of cash flows. Cash returns to shareholders in the first half were almost 50% higher than last year and we increased our quarterly dividend per share and repurchased a greater amount of shares. And as Ron mentioned earlier, we now expect to allocate a total of $600 million towards share repurchases in the 2022 fiscal year, which includes the additional $200 million announced today. Taking us to the outlook on Slide 9. The business has delivered a solid result for the half, in line with our expectations, and the outlook for our business remains positive. This enables us to do two things today. First, reaffirm the 2022 guidance we outlined in August and November, where we continue to expect adjusted EPS growth of 7% to 11% on a comparable constant currency basis, which represents an EPS guidance range of approximately $0.79 to $0.81 per share on a reported basis, assuming current exchange rates prevail for the balance of the year. And we continue to expect free cash flow in a range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. Secondly, our positive outlook leaves us well positioned to increase our share repurchase by $200 million in fiscal '22, as previously mentioned. It's important to note the majority of these additional repurchases are expected to take place in the fourth quarter. And due to the limited impact this will have on the weighted average number of shares outstanding in fiscal 2022, there is not expected to be any real benefit to EPS growth until fiscal '23. So with that, I'll hand back to Ron. Ron Delia : Okay. Thanks, Michael. Before closing and turning it over to Q&A, just a few minutes on the longer term, starting with our investment case on Slide 10. And we've maintained a consistent strategy for several years now that's guided how we've evolved our portfolio and developed our capabilities. And as a result, Amcor is better positioned strategically than ever before with a stronger foundation for growth and shareholder value creation. We've managed the portfolio so that we're now the global leader in most of our chosen segments within the primary packaging space for fast-moving consumer goods and health care products. We have absolute and relative scale advantages and a strong track record of performance, and that track record relates to our consistent earnings growth and margin expansion and the significant free cash flow we generate every year. And with a strong balance sheet, we're able to use that cash flow to step up investments for growth including in fiscal '22, where we expect CapEx will be about 15% higher than last year, and we can see that leading to increasing momentum across the business. At the same time, we're also returning a significant amount of cash to shareholders in the form of regular share repurchases and a growing dividend. Now organic growth has always been a key driver of our overall financial performance, and we're actively investing in several areas highlighted on Slide 11 that will continue to drive long-term growth. First, we're strategically focused on the most attractive segments, and this guides how we prioritize investments back into the business. We'll talk more about these segments in a minute. Second, we continue to see tremendous opportunities to invest and extend our competitive advantages in emerging markets. And we already have a leading emerging markets portfolio that generates roughly $3 billion in annual sales and we see no shortage of growth opportunities in these markets, where we expect mid-single-digit growth and good profitability over the long term. Third, innovation in our world-class R& D capabilities remain a clear differentiator for Amcor. Innovation will increasingly contribute to organic growth going forward as we partner with customers to develop more sustainable and high-performance solutions for their specific needs and those of their consumers. Slide 12 takes a closer look at some of those higher growth priority segments. And these attractive segments are expected to represent an increasing percentage of our sales mix and contribute to consistent margin expansion. And Amcor has a leading position in each of these categories, which collectively generate over $4 billion in annual sales today and would share a few common features. First, these are large addressable markets, each well over $1 billion and the growth rates are all higher than the average across broader consumer markets, meaning there's significant room to grow. There are also many opportunities to differentiate across these categories, given the need for higher performance features such as barrier, heat resistance and resealability, which in turn drives higher margins. And in order to fully capitalize on the great potential, we're increasingly allocating capital towards these segments. In health care, we're investing to add capacity and capability in Europe and Asia. In this quarter, we celebrated the opening of a state-of-the-art medical packaging facility in Singapore to service accelerating demand in the Asia Pacific region. We recently began ramping up production on new assets in Coffee segment, and we're adding hot fill capacity in our rigid packaging business in North America, given the sold-out environment and positive growth outlook. Over time, we expect mid-single-digit growth in these segments, which will drive continued sales mix improvement and sustainable margin expansion. Moving to Slide 13. Sustainability is increasingly embedded in everything we do, and we continue to believe this represents our greatest opportunity for growth and differentiation. We also continue to believe responsible packaging is the answer to addressing concerns around packaging waste. And by responsible packaging, we mean the combination of packaging design, waste management infrastructure and consumer participation. Amcor recently commissioned a global survey, which enabled us to hear directly from 12,000 consumers around the world and provided several powerful insights. Among them, recyclability is considered by far the most important environmental attribute of packaging, more important than which material is used or whether the package is reusable. 3/4 of respondents indicated they would like to recycle more and more than 2/3 said they're willing to pay more for a product for the package that's recyclable. Now our package design efforts have always had the consumer front and center, and we're making great progress innovating against those consumer needs. Across our own portfolio, over 95% of our rigid and specialty container packaging -- specialty carton packaging is recyclable today. But our most significant progress over the last two years has been in our Flexible Packaging segment, where multiple materials are often required to deliver the required functionality. Today, 76% of our flexible packaging portfolio has a recycle-ready alternative and this represents substantial progress from 56% just two years ago. An important contributor to this progress has been the launch and commercialization of new product platforms such as AmLite, AmPrima and AmSky. And last week, we announced AmFiber, a new platform of performance paper packaging. These technology platforms will be leveraged across our global footprint, across multiple categories and for multiple customers to provide the more sustainable and high-performing packaging consumers are looking for and to drive growth and margin expansion for Amcor. Responsible packaging is a critical element of our sustainability agenda, but every company's environmental footprint goes beyond the products it makes. And to lead the way and reach our own ambitious goals, we launched Amcor's EnviroAction program in 2008, and since then, we've reduced the environmental impact of our operations by continuously exploring new and more impactful ways to reduce emissions, waste and water at every location. The value created for our customers in the environment through our work on a range of ESG initiatives has been recognized by several independent organizations and Amcor is continuing to demonstrate industry leadership. Last week, we increased our ambitions again by committing to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, with near and long-term targets aligned with the science-based targets initiative. We're excited to step up our ambitions to further reduce the carbon footprint of our products and operations, and to support our customers as they strive to meet their own goals for functional high-performance packaging with the lowest possible environmental impact. And finally, on Slide 15 to summarize, Amcor delivered a solid result through the first half as we continue to perform well through challenging and dynamic operating conditions, and we've confidently reaffirmed our full year guidance. We've also increased cash returns to shareholders and expect to return more than $1.3 billion in fiscal '22 through dividends and share repurchases. And looking over the longer term, we've built a strong foundation for growth and value creation over the last several years. We're investing to capture that growth, and we're building on our sustainability progress as we use science-based targets to define our journey to net zero emissions. And with that, operator, we'll open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Your line is now open. Ghansham Panjabi : Yes. So for my first question, just the comments that you had in your press release about volumes being lower in certain categories like cheese, coffee, frozen food, and then up in health care, I mean, as you kind of step back around, is that just a function of mean diversion relative to pre-COVID levels? And maybe you could just talk about what's actually going on in the end markets, in terms of other like demand as the consumers in different regions such as the U.S. and Europe navigate extremely high inflation relative to the previous baseline in terms of purchasing patterns. Ron Delia : Yes. Ghansham, first, thanks for the question. Look, I'm not sure it's mean diversion. I think we've sort of been back to the more normal trading patterns now for at least five or six quarters. I think what we're seeing there is a good recovery in health care, which is have been going on now for a couple of quarters in medical and in the second quarter, we started to see better pharmaceutical volumes. So we had high single-digit growth across the businesses in health care. That one is, I'd say, more of a return to normal trading conditions. As far as the food categories go, the only thing that I would point out that's exogenous is some supply shortages we have on key inputs. We're still leaving some money on the table with sales that we can't realize in an order book that we can't completely fulfill, because we've got some materials that are just not as available as we'd like. That's the only thing I could point to. Otherwise, I think what you're seeing in the quarter and at the micro at the segment level is just the ebbs and flows that happen over any 90-day period. Ghansham Panjabi : Got it. And then for my second question, there's obviously an enormous amount of beverage can capacity being added in North America, which will start to hit this year in particular. As you sort of look at your rigids business and look at your backlogs, your share of new product introductions that the beverage customers may be introducing, et cetera, how do you see that dynamic kind of playing out for Amcor's rigid business? Ron Delia : Well, firstly, the demand in that business is super strong. And that's actually -- that's the big driver of the profit shortfall that we've had so far in the first half is that we're just oversold. And in the second quarter, we had volume growth of 6%, which comes on a year-on-year comp, which was quite strong a year ago. So the demand is really, really strong, would be the first point. We're adding capacity, as we've talked about to try to alleviate some of the bottlenecks. I think the second thing is that we've never seen the container, the plastic container really in direct competition with the metal can because we see different distribution channels, you see PET primarily through the cold chain and through convenience stores and more single-serve and you see the can historically through big-box retail and 12 and 24 packs. So we've not really seen competition in things like iced teas or sports drinks, our hot-filled juices. And when we talk to our customers, and we're as busy as ever on new product introductions, they're not really talking about a trade-off between one format or the other. It's more the format that's best aligned to their segment needs and their segment goals. So cans have been growing quite rapidly, the capacity has been added for several years now. It hasn't slowed our volume growth really at all. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Your line is now open. Anthony Pettinari : Ron, on rigids, given the supply chain issues and some availability issues that you've seen, would you anticipate getting back to sort of a normal level of profitability? Is that by the end of fiscal 3Q or the end of the fiscal year? I'm just trying to understand what your full year guidance sort of assumes on that front. And as you look back on the first half, understanding maybe you can't do this, but in terms of the total EBIT impact of these disruptions, is there any way to kind of kind of put a finer point around that on the rigid side? Ron Delia : Yes. Look, good question. I mean, first, the first question in terms of the outlook. The business has been improving. Profitability has been improving through the first half, it continues to improve as we go into the third quarter here. What we've said today is that we expect profit growth in the second half versus the second half last year. The pace of that is going to depend on a number of factors. So we're not calling out specific guidance for the third quarter. I do expect as we get towards the back end of this fiscal year, which is sort of May, June period, were the new high season. I'd like to think that we're going to exit this year at a more normal level of profitability. And the reason I say that is there's a number of things that are working in our favor here. Firstly, demand remains strong, and it always starts with that. To Ghansham's question, demand has remained very robust, particularly in the beverage space. So that's the first thing. Secondly, we've been increasing capacity, and we've been adding incremental capacity throughout the last couple of quarters, almost on a monthly basis. So we're going to end up adding around 5% to 10% capacity in the hot fill network. And then thirdly, we're entering the third quarter with inventory and with a reasonable amount of inventory, which is where you would typically expect to be at the start of the third quarter. It's a seasonal business, and you need to enter January, February with inventory. Last year, we didn't have any. And so that led to a bit of a ripple effect that we're still working our way out of. So those are the reasons why we feel pretty optimistic about the second half. And the pace will be determined by just how quickly we can bring capacity on-stream and our availability of inputs. As far as the second question about the drivers of the profit impact. I mean, look, it's really hard to parse them out. There's three things going on there, I would say. One is demand just really outstripping supply at a rapid pace, that's led to inefficiencies in a sold-out environment trying to service every last bottle of demand is, let's say, just inefficiencies in the system. The second thing is we do have inflation, and we're out recovering. You can see the price impacts on the sales line. And then the third thing is just the performance of the business, right? And as managers, you're always trying to isolate how much of it is the performance of the business. We think it's actually been quite good. But it's very hard to piece out the quantitative impact of those three different drivers. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. Okay. That's very helpful. And then just switching gears on the AmFiber platform. Can you give any more details there in terms of -- is there any sort of incremental CapEx investment, maybe percentage of your volumes that might be fiber-based either now or in the future? And then is this targeting sort of existing customers that are asking for a -- maybe a paper option? Or is it going to cannibalize existing sales? Are you going after totally new customers, new categories? Just any details there. Ron Delia : Yes. Look, it's rejuvenating categories, which historically have not been at the highest level of priority. So confectionery is an important category in volume terms for us. This is a differentiated product that we're going to start launching in that particular segment that just changes our outlook on the attractiveness of that space and the profitability. Firstly, what is it? It's a paper-based platform that really kind of threads the needle between the issues that pure paper solutions have, which is that there's no barrier or coated paper, which tends to result in much lower fiber recovery and therefore, at times is not recyclable. The AmFiber platform kind of threads the needle between those two extremes. So it's barrier, there will be barrier properties. The product runs on the customer filling lines at generally the same speed. So there's no productivity discount that the customer has to wear. And so we're really excited about it. And we're going to roll it out globally. I wouldn't expect any material change in CapEx specifically related to this platform. But we are investing behind these platforms generally and these growth segments. We've alluded to that several times. So we'll continue to deploy capital against the growth opportunity. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jakob Cakarnis with Jarden Australia. Your line is now open. Jakob Cakarnis : I just wanted to get a better understanding of the working capital build. I know that you mentioned that some of that does relate to some of the price increases that you're seeing across the raw materials. Just wondered how much of it is anticipatory as well just so to avoid some of the supply chain issues that you mentioned that the Company was facing in the second quarter? Michael Casamento : Yes. Jakob, thanks for the call. I can take that one. It's Michael here. Yes, look, as we outlined in the release, we've seen an outflow of working capital higher than the prior year. And really the key driver of that is raw material, both the raw material inflation and the timing of that flowing through the business. And then in addition to that, in the second quarter, particularly, we were able to take some planned inventory increases, both in the rigid and flexibles business. And Ron alluded to that on the rigid space versus last year, we weren't able to increase inventory at all. Whereas this year on rigids, we are entering the third quarter and have been able to increase the inventory, which is you'll see that flush through the system in the second half. And on the flexible side, yes, we've seen some increases on a cautionary basis, I guess to ensure we've got supply. And that's again going to flow through in the second half, which is why we're confident around the cash flow projection of the business in H2 and for the full year. Jakob Cakarnis : And then just the second part, maybe one for Ron. At the first quarter, you did mention that you expected the resin supply as it relates to the rigids business to improve into the second half. Is that still the case? Is there anything that you're seeing on the horizon that would bring that resin availability into question? Ron Delia : No, not anything that threatens the supply. And I would say, we did see a modest improvement through the quarter. That's one of the reasons for more positive outlook in the second half is that resin is generally more available. We're not all the way back to 100% supply, we're still at less than 100% of what we would like to source, but we're in a much better position now than we were three months ago. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Larry Gandler with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Larry Gandler : I'd like to ask a question or two on sustainability. Ron, it looks like you're very well through your major sustainability goal of 100% recyclability by 2025 with only flexibles now at 75% coverage. Is it trying to start looking towards the next milestone? You've got, I see you put the greenhouse gas emission target out. I am interested in that. So let me just interject with the question on that one is, I think most of your emissions are stage Scope 3. So the question becomes is would you guys invest collaboratively with your supply partners to reduce greenhouse emissions? And are there opportunities for doing that? And then the other area I wanted to ask about was not only GHD, but waste management. How do you articulate and established goals like you've done for recyclability for waste management infrastructure, which is one of your objectives as well? Ron Delia : Yes. Look, let me take the questions in order, Larry. So firstly, on the greenhouse gas emissions, this is the next logical step in our evolution and our journey. We've been on the greenhouse gas reduction path for over 15 years now. Back in 2008, we set our first public targets to reduce greenhouse gas intensity by 60%. And we're well on our way to doing that. That was a 2030 goal. And every few years, we set a new benchmark for each of these -- each of the areas of our EnviroAction program, greenhouse gases, waste and water. And so that's where we're at. We're at a moment in time where it's time to rethink our objectives and also speak in the same language as others. And the science-based targets initiative has helped I think, bring some standardization in a sense to the way companies talk about their greenhouse gas profile. And so we're jumping on board that and with that initiative, and we'll set some near-term targets over the next 24 months as we work with that group to validate and qualify our targets. We'll set and be -- and report out on what those targets are on the pathway to net zero by 2050. As far as the waste management part of the equation, firstly, you're right, we're making fantastic progress on the packaging design aspect of responsible packaging. And we're going to, without question, get to 100% of the portfolio with a recycle-ready option by 2025. We have no doubts about that at all. And the take-up and the interest and demand from customers has never been stronger. That just continues to intensify. Many of them have the exact same goals. The waste management piece of the equation is also one that we can influence, but not alone. And that's where some of the alliances that we're in, some of the work that we're doing with the alliance to End Plastic Waste, some of the work with the Consumer Goods Forum, the Minderoo Foundation, See the Future initiative. It's going to take partnerships. And I think, ultimately, what we want to see is that our packaging is not just designed to be recycled, but it actually is recycled. And we know and when we cited today this consumer research that we've done, that consumers want to recycle more. They would gladly recycle more if the infrastructure was more available. And so we all have a role to play, including government and Amcor and our suppliers and customers to make that happen, but that will not be Amcor alone. Larry Gandler : Yes, Ron, that's why I focused on those two areas because unlike recyclability, these two things are out of your control and may require investments, much more significant capital investments than the recyclability objective. So your Scope 3 emissions are your biggest part of your emissions, should you guys be paying dividends and buying back shares to the level you are, if the next sort of green -- if the next sort of sustainability objectives are going to be capital intensive and require partnerships that aligns then plastic waste? They talked about $1.5 billion of capital commitments by 2024. Their 2019 accounts, they did $8 million of subsidies. Maybe there's an invoice coming for some $200 million of infrastructure capital that's going to hit your desk, I don't know. But it sounds like you guys may need to put a stake in the ground in terms of the investment levels to reach those other objectives. Ron Delia : Look, I'm not anticipating that we're going to put real meaningful capital in that part of the value chain. I mean we are investing in pilots, and we're happy to help fund pilots that are proof of concepts, and we're also happy to supply demand in the form of off-take agreements. We've got lots of pilots underway with a number of our suppliers on chemically-recycled material, et cetera. But look, waste management, it's not a narrow exercise, right? So the waste management is a very local activity, and it's usually collecting all sorts of materials, some of which are packaging after it has been used, but only a portion. So I fully agree with the notion that it's going to take a lot of money to get the waste management infrastructure around the world where it needs to be. I'm just not sure that as a converter, it's the best use of our shareholders' capital. Larry Gandler : Yes, I know. It's definitely a debatable question. But okay, let's just move on to the next one, Ron. Just quickly, acquisitions, we haven't seen much from Amcor since Bemis. I'm just wondering if what you're seeing in terms of deals, is it businesses that don't really align? Or are the prices too high? Ron Delia : Yes, it's a good question. I mean, firstly, we would like to be active. I mean we clearly -- the industry has been acquisitive and a reasonably good track record of generating value out of acquisitions, and we would like to continue to do that. We will continue to do that. We're constantly in the deal flow. If there's a deal in our space that you're reading about, then you can rest assured that we've had a look at it. I think there's a couple of things going on. It's only probably the last nine months or so or six [Technical Difficulty] we've embedded down Bemis. Now remember, that was the largest acquisition the Company had ever done by a factor of three, and we were laser focused on making that a success for the first 2, 2.5 years, which is pretty much just bringing us to the last couple of quarters. I think that's well and truly behind us now, and we certainly have the capacity to take something else on. I think at the same time, we've got asset prices that are quite elevated, and we've got businesses that are particularly difficult to diligence right now. Increasingly, that will dissipate. The complexity that I'm referring to relates to the top line impacts that COVID has had on different businesses. And it's very difficult to assess that. So it's a challenging period. We're going to remain really disciplined, but we'll be active, and we'll get back on the acquisition bandwagon here sometime soon. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO. Your line is now open. Mark Wilde : I wondered for the first question. Ron, I just want to confirm kind of where we're at in terms of kind of the recovery in the medical device packaging area. I know Bemis has put a lot of money into a new facility up at Oshkosh, it sounded like with the drop-off in elective surgeries, that business was running kind of well short of capacity. Can you just update us? Ron Delia : Yes. Look, it's -- medical device packaging is as good a segment as we're participating in. And we've seen a steady improvement over the first half of this fiscal year. I would say that demand is not all the way back, but most of the way there, and the demand is driven by elective procedures, surgeries and the like. Demand has mostly recovered from its lows during the COVID period. There's also some resins that we use in that business, which are going to ensure supply. So that's also held us back a little bit. So we're probably 2/3 to 3/4 of the way back to the baseline that you'd expect in that business. But this is a business that's a high -- very profitable part of the business, a lot of differentiation and innovation and IP. And it's a business that historically has grown, at least at mid-single digit rates. Now in the first half, we've actually seen that. But we also realize there's more to be had there. Mark Wilde : Okay. And then the second one I had is another follow-on around M&A. A long-time entrepreneur in the premium carton market has a new private equity vehicle. So just kind of -- in my mind, there is a question about how you would assess the options around your carton business. It's a smaller piece of Amcor overall. So if somebody was out there looking for kind of premium folding carton assets, you've got them. How would you have us think about how you assess that business? Ron Delia : Well, the cartons business sits between 7% and 8% of our sales today, but it's an important piece of our offering. And I think even the AmFiber platform today that we've talked about speaks to the importance that we place on having a diversified substrate mix. It's a business that is a highly cash-generative business, and it has a clear leadership position in its market. So it's a pretty important part of the portfolio. I mean that said, we're economic rationalist, but there's no desire to make any kind of big shift in the portfolio at this particular point in time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Your line is now open. George Staphos : I guess, first of all, I'm not surprised by what you found from your study, Ron, in terms of recyclability being most important for the customer, for the consumer and really translating that into recycling will be key from here. I guess I had an operating question and then kind of a follow on bigger picture question. So in rigids, you had these operating issues and inefficiencies through no fault of your own, have taken away performance from where it otherwise would have been. What options do you have as contracts come up for renewal? What desire do you have or maybe building in additional clauses to your contracts to capture some of those inefficiencies when they're not in your control and you're doing what you can to service a customer? Relatedly, within flexibles, on operations, with the volume accelerating in the quarter versus 1Q and certainly all the pricing action that you're seeing, I would have expected maybe a bit more dollar traction in EBIT in the quarter. That's not a humor there, but if there's a way that you could quantify if inefficiencies in flexible maybe caused just some performance in 2Q, recognizing you're very happy with the performance? If there's a way that you could quantify that, that would be great. Ron Delia : Yes. I'll take the rigids question and Michael can comment on flexibles and the raw materials impact there. Richard, the contracts are quite robust. Ultimately, we always have to make a choice at the level of demand that we've seen in that business, and you run into this periodically, you're sold out when you're sold out, then the cost to produce the marginal unit are almost infinite, right? And so you end up in this conundrum, even with we would say are pretty water-tight contracts that have served us well over the years and have been quite fair, I think, with the customer as well. You end up in a situation where you probably would make more money if you didn't take the last order. While we're in this for the long haul, and we've got customer relationships that date back decades and we expect to maintain for decades into the future, so you sort of have to wear it a little bit. I would imagine that the customers are also wearing and we know this for a fact, they've got their own disruptions from trying to service their own peak demand. And I'm not sure that there's a contract mechanism to capture the uniqueness of the environment that we've just faced. I think the answer to it is to get out in front in terms of inventory build when you have a seasonal business like we have and to just make sure that we're keeping abreast of the capacity needs and adding capacity on a regular basis, which is what we're doing. Maybe Michael can comment on the flexibles profit impact and profit leverage? Michael Casamento : Yes, sure. Thanks, Ron. So look, on the flexible space, I mean we closed the half out, EBIT grew 7%, pretty consistent growth over both quarters, some improvement in volume in Q2, as you mentioned. We're still cycling some pretty high raw material costs. And in the half, we've recovered $480 million in the top line, it's about 10%. That said, there was still some price cost lag, which is manageable, but it is still a negative on the business. And as we look forward, we'd expect that, that starts to ease as we head into the second half and should abate somewhat. So really, that's the key difference on the flexible side. We're still seeing really good performance in the priority high-value segments that Ron touched on earlier. And margins overall have held really strong at 12.9%. If you take that top line recovery on the raw material out, margins would have been 130 basis points higher and in fact, 70 basis points ahead of prior year. So overall, we feel pretty good about where the flexibles business is at and particularly that recovery on the raw material and how that looks moving forward. George Staphos : I appreciate the thoughts, and then a quick one, just in terms of the increasing of the value return. I don't think anyone's complaining, but considering that you only maintained your guidance, and again, you're having a very solid year, it's in line with expectations, what prompted your ability to raise the value return recognizing going to happen at the end of the year? Thanks guys. And good luck the rest of the way. Michael Casamento : Yes. No, look, we -- as we said, we've got a really, really strong balance sheet right now. I mean, the cash flows are solid and the second half looks pretty strong on that front as well. So we've got flexibility in the system. We've announced $400 million back in August, based on where we sit today. And we can announce a further $200 million, and that's what we've done. We still have flexibility in there. So if the M&A transactions come along, we can do that as well. But the underlying performance of the business is strong and enabled us to announce that further buyback. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Reilly with UBS. Your line is now open. Nathan Reilly : Ron, just a quick question -- well not a quick question, but it's a question I've asked before over the last couple of years, just around Bemis. I know the focus over the last couple of years has been on the integration of that business and obviously delivering the cost synergies. But now that the heavy lifting is being done on that front, is your focus now able to shift to start realizing some of the potential revenue synergies from that acquisition? And I'm also curious to what extent is that related to potentially the growth that you're targeting in these priority flexible segments? Ron Delia : Yes. Look, I think the short answer is yes. I mean, I'd like to believe that we've been extracting commercial benefits from day one and different ways of managing mix and managing raw material pass-through and the way the capabilities that I think Amcor brings to the table, I think, have been accruing benefits over the legacy Bemis portfolio from the beginning. But as far as it relates to growth, YEs. I think no question. The organization is now oriented itself towards generating a bit more growth. We've got a number of tools at our disposal to do that. And I think you're seeing evidence already of things that you could label revenue synergies. If we look at some of these new product platforms that we've spoken about, in some respects, those are examples of revenue synergies, the AmLite platform, which is a recyclable pouch for human food or pet food is an example of an innovation that Amcor had developed, which will be leveraged over the legacy Bemis footprint. And on the other -- going the other way, the AmPrima platform, which is, again, recycle-ready, all polyolefin structure is a legacy Bemis platform that we're leveraging around the world on the legacy Amcor footprint. So I think you're seeing examples already. And there's a lot more sort of smaller examples where we supplemented capacity from out of the region, we've ceded some of the health care growth in Asia from some of the legacy Bemis assets that someone asked us about earlier. So I think short answer, Nathan, is yes. The agenda is evolving. But I think we're also seeing some benefits in real time here and probably have been for the last couple of years. Mark Wilde : Got it. And final question, just on the volume growth, 1% across the group this half, notwithstanding the supply chain constraints and challenges and raw material challenges you've been facing. What sort of volume do you think was that on the table because of those issues? Ron Delia : I would say another 1% or 2%. I'd say it's the delta between long-term average of low single-digit growth, which is a couple of percentage points and where we were. I think it's pretty -- it's as straightforward as up. This is a business that prioritizes mix, right? So, the mix is the thing that we're constantly trying to optimize. And when you do that, sometimes you don't satisfy a relapsed order. So I'd say it's a couple of percentage points. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kyle White with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Kyle White : On M&A, you have integrated Bemis, which was a large transformational acquisition as you mentioned. Would you have the appetite and willingness to complete another large transformational dealer in the near term and maybe increase your resin buying scale, if such a deal were to come to market? Or would you be looking at bolt-on deals or for specific technologies or end markets rather than just scale? Ron Delia : Well, yes, I would probably say that we would not be doing something just for scale. I'd love to -- and the Company has shown over the years that it's drived and really rallied around big transactions going back, obviously, Bemis, the Alcan transaction we did about 10 years ago. These have been company-defining transactions that have really seen us get to new levels. So we'd love to be able to fund something like that. But the target set is what it is, and it's the competition that we're dealing with in the market every day, and that means most of the deals, like 90-plus percent of the opportunity space out there are going to be what you probably characterize as bolt-ons. So it's going to be strategy first and scale second. We wouldn't do something just to get bigger. Kyle White : Got it. And then on Latin America, it seems like volumes are up nicely in that region. I guess are you just seeing any impact from maybe the slowdown in the macro economy in Brazil or the rise of COVID cases in that region? Ron Delia : Well, Latin America is a tale of a couple of different stories for us. In the Rigid segment, we had a fantastic half with double-digit volume growth and really good earnings growth. In the flexible space, we're exposed to some other categories, we're exposed to Home & Personal Care, for example, which had a really strong year one year ago. And so volumes are actually a little bit behind in the flexible space. So it's been a bit mixed. And I think the -- some of the segments in Food and Personal Care have been a little bit more impacted by the macro environment and some of the COVID impacts, whereas the beverage space, we've not had those impacts. So it's a bit mixed. It's still an important region for the Company. It's a business -- a set of business we've been in for a long time, and we're confident in the long-term outlook, but it's a bit mixed at the moment. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Purtell with Macquarie. Your line is now open. John Purtell : Look, just the first one on the flexible side. I appreciate it's only a 90-day period. But there was a slightly less incremental earnings uptick in the second quarter versus the sequential first quarter than what we've seen historically. So it looked like there was a bit of adverse effects in there. But was there a slightly larger -- I know you haven't called it out as a material item, but was there a slightly larger earnings drag from raw mats in the second quarter versus the first? Or anything else to call out there? Michael Casamento : John, it's Michael. I can take that one. Look, overall, it was a pretty consistent performance quarter-on-quarter. I mean it's a 90-day period. There's some minor puts and takes. In terms of the raw material price costs, that remained pretty consistent as the lag overall is pretty consistent and manageable, as I said earlier. So really, it's a 90-day period. It's been pretty consistent. We've got 7% for the half. We had 8% in the first quarter, 6% EBIT growth in the second quarter. So nothing really to call out on that front. John Purtell : Okay. And just the second one, just interested in what you're seeing on raw materials. You've made some comments there on supply chain and Rigids improving. But just in terms of raw mats, you're expecting any relief there in the second half. I think U.S. resin prices have come back a bit, but you've also announced that up to 15% price rise effective January. Michael Casamento : Yes, John. I mean on the raw material side, you're right. It's a little bit mixed across the globe as we exited the second quarter. We did start to see some easing in North America and Latin America on certain input sites, IP, et cetera. But then in Asia and Europe, you're still seeing some increases there. So as we look forward, I'd say it's reasonably balanced and stable as we look ahead, but there's some mix differences across raw material inputs and geographies. So -- but overall, we kind of see things reasonably stable and perhaps coming off slightly in Q4, but we'll see where we go with that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Salvator Tiano from Seaport Research Partners. Your line is now open. Salvator Tiano : Yes. So I want to come back a little bit about -- on the fiber packaging that you're investing new. And firstly, if you can talk a little bit about your view on plastics versus fiber, especially because we've seen some being really vocal that plastics are better and can be better from a sustainability standpoint. And generally, you're not -- you mentioned you're not really seeing any substitution or at least in a big scale in favor of paper. So how has your view changed? And are you seeing bigger threats to plastics in some regions? Ron Delia : No. We see a big opportunity here to -- there's a sweet spot in the fiber-based or paper-based flexible area that we think we have a good solution for. So somewhere between pure paper solutions, which typically have less functionality and no barrier or coated paper, which typically have lower fiber recovery and therefore, at times cannot be might not be recyclable. We think we've come up with a better miles shop that sort of split the difference, so to speak, and provides a paper-based solution for anyone who wants one. And there are certain categories where there are paper solutions out there now. Confectionery would be one of them. And we've got some paper in confectionery have for a long period of time. So this is more of a product-based opportunity that we see than anything else. I mean we continue to believe that plastic-based flexible packaging quite often is the best environmental solution to satisfy all the different criteria that our customers have and consumers have. So, there's no philosophical change other than opportunity to deliver to the market innovation that we think is unique. Salvator Tiano : Great. So essentially, it's more of an offensive move rather than defensive here? Ron Delia : Yes. Salvator Tiano : And the other question again regarding the fiber packaging option. Can you remind us a little bit, excluding obviously folding carton tobacco, which is kind of like a different category? What is your -- what paper converting opportunities -- sorry, businesses do you have in which regions? And how important would be M&A to expand your new innovations in fiber packaging? Ron Delia : Yes. So in the Flexibles perimeter, not including cartons, we have a big oil-based business, and we have a reasonable business that has got paper in the structure. And that's -- those are both global. So we have paper-based structures in medical packaging. We have paper solutions in protein. We have a platform called SkinNova, which is a combination of a laminate that peels off and a paper-based tray for meat. We have another one called Paperly. So we've always had paper solutions. It's probably -- it's not the largest part of our portfolio, but paper and foil collectively would be probably 20% of our flexibles portfolio. Salvator Tiano : Great. And just on M&A, would that be important strategy to expand here? Ron Delia : I'm not sure that M&A is really the answer here. I think that growth in this space largely come from innovations, and I think we've got capability. There's probably good ideas out there that we don't have that we can access maybe in a commercial sense, but I'm not sure that we'd be thinking about any sort of material M& A against this trend. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Adam Samuelson : Yes. A lot of ground has been covered this evening. So I'll discuss just one question on the demand side. And earlier speak to what you're hearing from your package food and CPG customers around demand elasticity, given all the inflation that they're absorbing and that's getting passed on to the consumer. Are you seeing any signs that that the consumer can't take anymore in terms of price increases and you're seeing that impact specific categories or shifts into value or things that would have an impact on your volumes and your mix as you look out over the course of calendar '22? Ron Delia : Yes. Look, it's a good question. I think it's on everyone's mind. Firstly, I would contextualize it by just reminding you that for -- in almost every category that we're participating in, the package is a very small part of the overall cost of goods that our brand-owner customers or our health care customers are bringing to market. So it's not the most material driver of their income statement January... Adam Samuelson : And Ron, I was -- just to speak here, I'm not trying to imply that it's your price increases that are driving and I think it's broader inflation economy broadly. Ron Delia : Yes. So no, I get that. I just wanted to make sure I make that contextual point. But that said, look, no, from the conversations we've had with customers, and I think also their public commentary through this earnings season and probably even the last one, they're not seeing the elasticity that they may have historically had modeled and anticipated. At this point in time, price increases seem to be going through across the categories that we're exposed to. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Chau with MST Marquee. Your line is now open. Keith Chau : First question, Ron, just following up on John's question earlier on price cost and completing that discussion point. So price cost was upside down in the quarter, and raw materials have now flattened off. You've got price increases in the mix now. Do you expect price cost to come out neutral in the third quarter and potentially right side up in the fourth quarter? Can you give us a bit more clarity on that? Michael Casamento : Yes, I can take that one. Keith, it's Michael here. Yes. Look, as we said, the first half, the price cost lag was unfavorable but manageable. As we said earlier, the raw materials appear as though on balance, they're starting to stabilize as we head into Q3. And we also see that the price cost lag should ease as we head into Q3 and perhaps get closer to neutral. And then as we look forward into Q4, let's see what happens with the raw material pricing. But at this stage, if raw materials do ease as the industry forecast would suggest then, perhaps that's a slight positive recovery in the fourth quarter, but let's wait and see what happens on that front. Keith Chau : So just to be clear, you're not expecting the price cost issue to get worse as the year progresses? It should be a lag on the second\u2026 George Staphos : Correct. Keith Chau : Okay. Excellent. And then just secondly, on cash flow, I know we've talked a lot about working capital unwinding. But the quantum of cash flow into the second half of the year is our target. I think in the last couple of years, it's been around 75% of target that you need to deliver in the second half. So will it purely just be the factors that you've called out, working capital unwind and slight improvement on capacity to generate more cash flows that will drive that outcome? Or are there any other factors that we should be considering outside of that? Michael Casamento : You pretty well commented, Keith. I think as you know, the cash flow is definitely seasonally weighted to the second half of the year and particularly Q4. And in the first half of this year versus last year, we did see some unfavorable impacts, particularly in working capital and inventory. We're expecting [Technical Difficulty] half and with the higher earnings, they are the two key elements that that will see us deliver within that range, and we feel pretty confident around that just based on past experience. If you look at the second half, last year's cash flow and then you take into account some of the unfavorable working capital impacts we had in the first half and then reversing then, it seems a pretty consistent view in terms of the second half delivery on the cash flow. So we feel pretty confident around that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Ryall with Rimor Equity Research. Your line is now open. Scott Ryall : So I just have a question on Slide 10. Could you give us an update -- the update is really helpful there that you've given us. Could you give us an update around your targets or using recycled material in your packaging, please? Just where you're up to on that? Ron Delia : Yes. So we have a target now to 10% of what we use to make packaging be recycled content by 2025. And we're making great progress. So predominantly, the predominant use of recycled content at the moment is in our Rigid Packaging business. And we've gone from 5% in that business in 2019 to over 10% last year. This year, we'll be well over 15%. And in terms of actual tons or pounds of material, that number is doubling just about every 18 months. So we're making really good progress. And then in parallel, we're pretty excited about some of the applications in flexibles as well as some of the projects that we're working on, on chemical recycling to get that number up even further. Scott Ryall : Okay. And are you seeing any difference in the pricing of recycled materials? I know you've... . Ron Delia : Absolutely. Yes, listen. The pricing... Scott Ryall : But can you comment about the pricing of raw materials versus virgin? Ron Delia : Yes. Absolutely. Look, they're at a premium in rigid packaging, which is the primary user of recycled PET in our business. The premium now for recycled PET is between 40% and 50%. That number ebbs and flows, but it's as much demand driven right now as it is supply and cost driven. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Richard Johnson with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Richard Johnson : Ron, just a couple of quick questions on back on rigid plastics. To what extent do you think that the business is in a strategic disadvantage and that may explain some of the profit impact that we're seeing at the moment? And what I mean is that your principal competitors have a far greater on-site presence than you do. And I was just kind of wondering whether that's having an impact? Ron Delia : Well, thanks, Richard. I mean, I think no one in this space is having an easy time of it. And you can see that yourself from the results that others have published. So I don't think we're in any kind of a disadvantage. I think we have some quite sizable on-site installations in the beverage side of the business, which is really where it matters the most. And then, we have scale from a network perspective and from a procurement perspective. So, I don't think the business is disadvantaged. I think it's just a combination of factors at the moment, starting with demand, which is a good problem to have, which have just conspired to lead to a rough profit outcome for a couple of quarters. Richard Johnson : Okay. So sort of following on from that, when you think about it strategically, given that pretty much everybody else in that space has moved to an on-site strategy, how do you think about your long term -- the long-term prospects of that business given that you've gone in the other direction? Ron Delia : I don't think we've gone in the other direction. I would say, over time, a lot of the capital that's been deployed in the Beverage segment of that business has been for on-site installations. But it's not necessarily a panacea. There are times when it makes sense to go on site and in times when it makes sense for everybody, including the customer, to supply from a different location. I wouldn't say that there's -- it's necessarily the one answer or one size fits all for everybody. So I think over time, our network has been more on-site than off-site in terms of our capital deployment, but I don't think that we have any kind of a disadvantage as a result of our footprint. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brook Campbell-Crawford with Barrenjoey. Your line is now open. Brook Campbell-Crawford: I'd just like to highlight on Slide 13, just the runway that needs to -- I guess, the portfolio on Flexibles that needs to be designed between now and 2025. Are you able to provide some of the large segments that the quarter roughly of that portfolio is remaining to be redesigned? That will be the first question. And then also, what does profitability look like for that 25% out of the business now compared to the proportion of the portfolio that's already been redesigned for fully recyclable? Ron Delia : Yes. Look, it's -- the structures that still are to be redesigned or some of the more sophisticated structures out there. I mean you wouldn't be surprised to hear me say that. And quite often, they are ones where we have something very different in the market and some sort of a competitive advantage. And that means that the science and the research required is just going to be more difficult and take some more time. There are segments in the certain medical segments or the health care segments, I should say, some of the protein structures, we're still working on alternatives for those would be something that come to mind, Brook. But generally speaking, what's left is the harder part of the portfolio, but on the other hand, some of the more profitable segments that we're participating in to. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to management for closing remarks. Ron Delia : Thanks, operator, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today and for your interest in Amcor. We've had a solid first half and our outlook is for a strong finish as well and a very strong fiscal 2022. So I think with that, we'll close the call. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day. My name is Savannah and I will be your conference operator for today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Amcor Third Quarter 2022 results. Today's conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise, and after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Tracey Whitehead, Global Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Tracey Whitehead : Thank you, Operator, and welcome everyone to our March quarter earnings call for fiscal 2022. Joining today is Ron Delia, Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Casamento, Chief Financial Officer. Before I hand over to them, let me note a few items. On our website amcor.com under the Investors section, you'll find today's press release and presentation, which will be discussed on the call. Please be aware that we'll discuss non-GAAP financial measures and related reconciliations can be found in the press release and the presentation. Remarks will also include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions. The second slide in today's presentation lists several factors that could cause future results to differ from current estimates. Please refer to our filings on the SEC website or on our own website for further details. During the question-and-answer session, we request that participants ask their question and then rejoin the queue for any additional questions. With that I'll hand over to Ron. Ron Delia : Thanks Tracey and thanks everyone for joining Michael and myself today to discuss Amcor's financial performance at the end of the third quarter. We'll begin with some prepared remarks before opening for Q&A. And since safety is our first and most important value we'll start on slide 3 with safety as we do in every meeting at Amcor. And we believe our ultimate goal of zero injuries is absolutely possible and we continue to make good progress. So far in fiscal 2022, we reduced the number of injuries across the company by 5% compared to the prior year and more than half of our sites have been injury-free for at least 12 months. Now of course this quarter our attention has turned to the tragic and devastating war in the Ukraine. We moved quickly to close our Ukraine site in Kharkiv before the start of the invasion to protect our local team. And we continue to support those coworkers and their families in any way we can, including through direct financial support and by assisting those who've been displaced. All up, we've contributed more than $1 million to vital humanitarian relief efforts. We also announced our decision to scale down our operations in our three Russian sites and to explore all strategic options for those plants. As always, our path forward will continue to be guided by our values and by our responsibilities to all of our stakeholders. I'd like to publicly thank all of my Amcor colleagues who are contributing from near and far to this challenging and upsetting situation. Your commitment, caring and generosity has been an inspiration. Turning to our key messages for the quarter on slide 4. First, the business delivered another strong result with the March quarter representing our strongest period of sales and earnings growth for the fiscal year so far. Second, our teams have continued to demonstrate an exceptional ability to remain focused on managing sales mix and inflation while delivering for our customers. Third, given the strong execution and consistently strong earnings growth through the year, we've raised our guidance for fiscal 2022 EPS growth. And finally, Amcor has established a strong foundation for growth and value creation over the last several years and we're increasing capital investments in priority segments and geographies as well as in our innovation capabilities. Turning to the financial highlights on slide 5. March quarter performance was strong across the board and I'll start with a few highlights. Net sales grew 16% in the third quarter including more than $450 million of incremental price increases related to the pass-through of higher raw material costs. Excluding this pass-through, organic sales growth was 5% in both the Flexibles and Rigid Packaging segments. Consistent with the first half, we continue to benefit from favorable mix as well as actions to anticipate and recover higher levels of inflation than we've seen for many years. This top line growth converted into adjusted EBIT growth of 9% in the quarter. The Flexibles segment delivered EBIT growth of 10% and in line with our expectations Rigid Packaging returned to earnings growth after experiencing a unique set of supply chain challenges in the first half. As you see on the bottom of the slide this strong March quarter builds on a solid first half, so that on a year-to-date basis, net sales have increased 13%, adjusted EBIT has increased 6% and adjusted EPS is up 11%. And our financial profile remains strong and we continue to increase cash returns to shareholders. We expect to repurchase $600 million of shares this year, which when combined with our annual dividend, means we anticipate returning around $1.3 billion of cash to shareholders in fiscal '22. Before I hand over to Michael, I want to come back to a slide we presented last quarter, which touches on our priority segments. Amcor has a leading position in each of these categories, which collectively generate over $4 billion in annual sales and share a few common features, including large addressable markets, higher-than-average growth rates and significant room for Amcor to grow and differentiate. By making deliberate choices to focus on these high-value higher-growth categories over time they represent a higher proportion of our sales mix, contribute to consistent margin expansion and become an increasingly relevant driver of earnings growth for Amcor. And we've seen this trend so far this year in both Flexibles and Rigid Packaging including in the March quarter and we expect this will continue as we allocate more capital and resources to these segments. You'll hear more about these mix benefits from Michael, as he provides some more detail on our financial performance. Michael Casamento : Thanks, Ron. So I'll begin with the Flexibles segment on slide 7. The businesses continued to perform very well through the year, executing to recover higher raw material costs, manage general inflation, improve cost performance and deliver increasing mix benefits. Reported year-to-date sales grew 11% and 14% in the March quarter. This includes significant recoveries of higher raw material costs which increased to $330 million in the March quarter, representing 13% of growth and $1.3 billion on an annualized basis. The overall price cost impact has remained a manageable headwind through this inflationary cycle given the diversity of materials we buy the multiple regions in which we consume those materials and the implementation of a range of pricing actions across the business. Excluding this raw material impact, sales grew 3% year-to-date and 5% in the March quarter. And as Ron mentioned, this performance reflects our continued focus on managing mix to drive growth, particularly in priority segments like health care pet food and premium coffee where we have seen mid-single-digit growth year-to-date. Supply chain disruptions have had a dampening effect on our volumes in certain high-value categories through the year. And in parts of the business, we have taken action to direct constrained materials to their highest value use, which further enhances mix. As a result, year-to-date and March quarter volumes across the Flexibles business were in line with last year. In terms of earnings adjusted EBIT growth of 8% on a year-to-date basis and 10% for the March quarter, reflects strong price/mix benefits and favorable cost performance. Margins also remained strong at 13.1% despite an adverse impact of 140 basis points from the mathematical impact of pass-through pricing for higher raw material costs. Turning to Rigid Packaging on slide 8. The key messages today are the underlying demand remains elevated and the business returned to earnings growth in the March quarter in line with our expectations. Year-to-date, sales grew by 19%, which includes favorable pricing to recover higher raw material costs of 14% and organic sales growth reflects 3% higher volumes and price/mix benefits of 2%. In North America, year-to-date beverage volumes were up 2%. Hot fill container volumes increased 6% in the March quarter and 2% on a year-to-date basis, which reflects continued growth in key categories like isotonics and juice. Hot fill containers is a high-value priority segment for Amcor, where we see significant opportunities to differentiate. And over a multiyear period, our ability to leverage technology, design and PCR handling capabilities, has enabled us to deliver compound volume growth of 4% and consistently improved mix. Specialty container volumes improved sequentially in the quarter, but remained below last year on a year-to-date basis with the prior year benefiting from a strong first half in the home and personal care category. And in Latin America, the business delivered strong double-digit volume growth on a year-to-date basis, reflecting strength in Argentina, Mexico, Colombia, and Peru. In terms of earnings the North America business was adversely impacted in the first half by inefficiencies and higher costs, resulting from industry-wide supply chain complexity and disruptions as well as capacity constraints. However, operating conditions and financial performance improved in the March quarter, where the Rigid Packaging business delivered adjusted EBIT growth of 4%. We expect this improved performance to continue through the balance of fiscal year '22. Moving to cash on the balance sheet on slide nine. Free cash flow in the March quarter was $75 million higher than last year, which was a pleasing outcome in the context of continued raw material inflation. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow of $263 million is below last year, primarily due to unfavorable working capital outflows, relating to higher raw material costs, as well as some planned inventory increases across the business. We continue to maintain a strong focus on working capital performance, which is even more critical in an inflationary environment and our rolling working capital to sales ratio remains below 8% and in line with last year. Notwithstanding current high working capital requirements, we have ample capacity to increase capital investment in strategic growth initiatives. Ron will provide some more color on this shortly, but for fiscal 2022 we expect capital expenditure will be approximately 15% higher than the prior year. And year-to-date we are tracking in line with that expectation. Our financial profile remains strong with leverage at 3 times on a trailing 12-month EBITDA basis, which is where we'd expect to be at this time of the year, given the seasonality of cash flows. And we continue to increase our cash returns to shareholders. So far this year we've repurchased $423 million worth of shares and expect this will reach $600 million by year-end and our quarterly dividend per share of $0.12 is also higher than last year's dividend. Taking us to the outlook on slide 10. Given our strong March quarter and year-to-date performance, we are raising our outlook for adjusted EPS growth to 9.5% to 11% on a comparable constant currency basis. This represents an EPS guidance range of approximately $0.795 to $0.81 per share on a reported basis, assuming current exchange rates prevail for the balance of the year. We expect significant free cash flow for the year of approximately $1.1 billion, which includes the adverse impact of higher raw material costs on working capital. It is also important to note our fiscal 2022 guidance assumes no further earnings from the business in Ukraine in the final quarter and takes into account a range of possible outcomes in Russia. As a reminder the four sites in Ukraine and Russia combined represent approximately 2% to 3% of Amcor's annual sales, approximately 4% to 5% of annual EBIT and approximately US$200 million to US$300 million on the balance sheet. So in summary from me today, the business has delivered another strong result, as we remain focused on driving value by delivering for our customers, managing mix and recovering general inflation and higher raw material costs. And this strong execution gives us the confidence to raise our guidance for the 2022 fiscal year. So with that, I'll hand back to Ron. Ron Delia : Thanks, Michael. Before turning over to Q&A, I'd like to spend a few minutes on the longer term starting with our investment case on slide 11. We've maintained a consistent strategy that's guided how we've evolved our portfolio over the years, so that we're the clear global leader in most of our chosen segments within the primary packaging space for fast-moving consumer goods and health care products. We have absolute and relative scale advantages and a strong track record of earnings growth, margin expansion, significant and growing free cash flow of over $1 billion each year and maintaining a strong investment-grade balance sheet. And that cash flow and balance sheet strength enable us to step up investments for growth to drive increased momentum in the business. At the same time we have the capacity to return a significant amount of cash to shareholders in the form of regular share repurchases and a growing dividend, which currently yields around 4% or double the average of the S&P 500. We continue to see no shortage of high-quality organic growth opportunities across the three areas that we've highlighted in previous quarters and which are shown on slide 12. I already mentioned priority segments and Michael's comments highlighted the mix benefits that are important -- are an important driver of earnings growth. We also have a leading and well-diversified emerging markets portfolio, which we expect will grow at mid-single-digit rates over the long term. And innovation is increasingly a clear differentiator and growth driver for Amcor, particularly as it relates to the development of more sustainable packaging, such as the groundbreaking global product platforms shown on this slide, including AmLite AmSky and AmFiber. And slide 13 is a double-click on AmPrima, another example of a global product platform that sets us up as the partner of choice for customers as we work together to meet our mutual sustainability goals. AmPrima is a family of packaging solutions that are designed to be recycled and deliver significant sustainability benefits without compromising critical performance features, including heat resistance, high barrier, transparency and run speed. Over time, we've introduced second and third generations of AmPrima, expanding the number of end market applications and adding recycled content options for certain products and the material structure is now pre-qualified by the How2Recycle program in the United States. Volume growth is now increasing rapidly, as some of the most recognizable global brands begin to move from qualification and trial into commercialization. And AmPrima is also a great example of a revenue synergy unlocked by the Bemis acquisition. Capacity was first implemented in Oshkosh, Wisconsin with some capacity allocated to other regions to see demand. And as volume commitments have grown, we've scaled out adding capacity in Europe and soon in Latin America as well. Moving to Slide 14 and to dimension the increasing investment we've referred to a few times and to bring it to life with some more examples. We've been stepping up CapEx by around 15% per year including in the current 2022 fiscal year, as Michael mentioned and we expect this will take our CapEx to sales ratio from the 3% to 4% range historically to 4% to 5% on an ongoing basis. We have a number of projects already underway or nearing completion, which will generate attractive returns and drive organic growth going forward and this slide showcases a few examples. In Brazil and in the United Kingdom, we're adding multilayer film capacity to serve growth in the priority health care and meat segments. In Ireland, we're adding new state-of-the-art thermoforming capabilities to strengthen our leadership position in medical packaging. And in Italy, we're adding production capacity for one of our global product platforms AmLite Heatflex. And since launching this recycle-ready pouch for retortable applications we've seen significant interest from a long list of customers and the majority of this new capacity is already sold out. Just a few words on our broader sustainability agenda on Slide 15. Better package design like AmLite and AmPrima which takes into account the full product life cycle is a critical element of responsible packaging. But achieving the type of lasting large-scale impact we envision requires broad cooperation with expert partners from across the value chain. One way we've been most impactful is by bringing our capabilities to the table as standards are developed to make circularity the norm. Through the consumer goods form Amcor recently contributed to the development of principles for advanced recycling technologies which can play a critical role in reducing the environmental impact of hard-to-recycle plastic waste. We're also actively contributing to the changes needed in waste management and recycling infrastructure by creating demand. In April, we announced a partnership with ExxonMobil providing us access to their advanced recycled materials which can be used in health care and food packaging applications. We have similar agreements in place with multiple suppliers and as we increase our use of recycled materials the carbon footprint of our products is also reduced. And that reduction combined with ongoing efforts to make our own operations less energy-intensive sets us up to achieve our net zero ambitions which we announced earlier this year. To summarize on Slide 16, Amcor delivered another strong result with the March quarter representing the strongest period of sales and earnings growth for the year. We continue to manage well through inflation and improvements in our sales mix while delivering for our customers. With strong year-to-date performance and good momentum, we've raised our guidance for fiscal 2022 EPS growth. And looking over the longer term, we've built a strong foundation for value creation and we're stepping up our investments to drive growth margin expansion and long-term value for shareholders. That concludes our opening remarks. Operator, we'll now open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Anthony Pessina with Citi. Please go ahead. Bryan Burgmeier : Hi. This is actually Bryan Burgmeier sitting in for Anthony. So you raised the EPS guidance, but free cash flow guidance moves towards the lower end of your range. Is that delta driven by working capital impacts from resin costs? And is there anything else that we should be mindful of in regards to your updated free cash flow guidance such as CapEx or payables or receivables? Michael Casamento : Yeah. I'll take that one. It's Michael here. Look the bottom line is it's all working capital related. And the impact -- the reason we're at the lower end of the range there and still holding to the range is really around the continued escalation in raw materials that we didn't see at the beginning of the year. And so through the year, we've seen that continue -- we're holding our working capital to sales ratio. So that's been really pleasing through the year, as we're managing working capital in a great way to some extent. But just from a pure sales revenue increase and an annualized basis, it's going to be like in that $1.5 billion range. That just means you've got $120 million impact on working capital outflow from that raw material increase. Other than that nothing else of note. Everything else is in line as we expected. Operator : And our next question will come from Keith Chau of MST. Please go ahead. Keith Chau : Hi Ron and Michael. Just a question with respect to guidance on the Russian-Ukraine issue. Ron you mentioned the range of outcomes for what could happen in Russia. Can you give us a bit more detail in that respect? And also if you could address some of your peers or at least customers are saying that they would forgo profitability in the region given what's happened. Is that part of the range of outcomes that you're exploring at the moment for Russia? Thank you. Ron Delia : Yes, just to dimension the Ukrainian position and Russian business, as Michael alluded to, we've got four sites in that region one in the Ukraine and three in Russia. We've got about thousand people working in those four sites. The Russian and Ukrainian businesses combined generated about 2% to 3% of sales, 4% to 5% of EBIT and as Michael pointed out, $200 million to $300 million of balance sheet. The Ukrainian site has been closed. Obviously, our first priority has been keeping our people safe as it always would be you'd expect. And so we closed the site in the Ukraine just before the invasion started and we're able to get our people safely out of that area. The Russian plants are continuing to operate. We're well aware there's a number of public announcements that customers have made. And I would remind you that our business in Russia is focused exclusively on a very small number of multinational customers, all of whom despite whatever the public announcements have been, continue to operate there. And so we continue to support them while we explore our own options and look our options range from continuing to run the business to every other possible extreme that you can imagine. Our tendency and our history has never been to be overly prescriptive about strategic moves like that. So, I think we'd ask you to wait and see and view our actions more so than anything that we might say in advance. And as far as the guidance impact, clearly, the Ukrainian site is not running, the Russian plants are running at different degrees of utilization and that's all factored into the EPS range that Michael outlined. Operator : Our next question will come from George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead. George Staphos : Thanks very much. Hi everyone. Good day. Thanks for the details and congratulations on the quarter. Ron I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the Flexibles business and go through a bit more of the drivers in the quarter. Overall, I think you said volumes were relatively flat even though it looks like European Flexibles accelerated in the quarter, while North America stayed in a low single-digit range. If I'm correct what drove the European acceleration? And it looks like Asia decelerated to maybe a flat or down, LatAm remained down, even the mix was good. Can you say whether that was in fact the case and talk about the drivers in some of the end markets in those regions and countries as well? Thanks very much. Ron Delia : Yes. Look, I think the business is performing really well. So, we had 5% organic growth -- sales growth across the business on relatively flat volumes and then converted that to 10% EBIT growth across the segment. So, we're really pleased with the profit conversion. North American business continues to grow. The sale organic sales growth is mid-single-digits with some volume growth in the low single-digit range. The European business in the quarter had a slightly higher organic sales number still in the mid-single-digits though on volumes that were modestly down which I'll come back to. And then the organic sales growth in the two emerging markets businesses was up. Now, with regard to North America and Europe, we're particularly pleased with the performance of both of those businesses, the two larger businesses in the quarter and in particular, because of their management of mix. Mix, as you know, from a long period of time in Amcor has been a key driver of profit expansion over many, many years. And it's a function of orienting our portfolio more and more towards higher-value segments and higher-value products and that's exactly what we've seen in the quarter. So, in Europe, we saw a trade out of lower-margin products that are more intermediate in nature into other converters and we used constrained raw materials to support some of our higher-margin segments in pharmaceuticals medical device packaging, pet food, coffee and some of the segments that have been focal points for us for many years. That's really the story of the quarter. It was really very much about mix. Operator : And our next question will come from John Purtell with Macquarie. Please go ahead. John Purtell : Good day, Ron and Mike how are you. A \u2013 Ron Delia : Hi, John Michael Casamento : Hi, John John Purtell : Just in terms of raw materials and any impacts on demand. I mean you continue to do a good job of recovering higher raw material costs and I think that's true of the sector as well. A lot of this has been passed on to the customer and now we've got another up leg in commodities. So just be interested in any demand disruption that you're seeing in end markets? And are you concerned about that type of event? A \u2013 Ron Delia : Well listen, John we're concerned about inflation generally like everyone else. In our space, given that we're exposed to consumer staples and health care products historically, we've not seen a high degree of demand elasticity. And I think, so far if you take the comments from other public companies through this quarter, there hasn't been very much demand impact from the prices that have been taken across the segments we're exposed to. I think most customers that have reported and have commented on the topic, have said that they've seen less demand elasticity than they expected and also less than they've seen historically. And so far we've not seen a demand impact. Operator : And our next question will come from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Yes. Thank you, good evening, everyone. I maybe hoping to dig a bit more on the mix benefits in the period. And Ron you talked -- just kind of alluded to prioritizing certain customers in the health care segment in particular. And just how do you think about the durability of those benefits? And if we -- raw material availability improves over the next year, do you think there's still net margin benefits from the volume you'd be recapturing, or how do we think about the margin tailwinds or headwinds that might present into fiscal 2023? Because you seemingly had a pretty notable shift in your product mix in the period. A \u2013 Ron Delia : Yes. Look Adam, it's a good question. If you go back and look over a long period of time at Amcor the margin expansion period-on-period has been very consistent. And this -- I'm talking about a five or 10-year view. You'd see consistent margin expansion regardless of the raw material cycle anywhere from 10 to 30 basis points in a given period when we're in a more steady-state environment absent any major M&A. And a big part of that margin expansion story has been the strategy we've had in place for a long time to constantly optimize the mix both the product mix, the segment mix and the customer mix. That's been the focal point for our commercial teams for a long period of time and that's going to continue going forward. As far as where to from here, we don't expect that mix improvement impact to slow. What we do hope is that raw materials become more plentiful and more available and we can satisfy all of the demand that we have. I mean we're still in an environment where certain materials are constrained and we still have probably forgone in the low single-digits of volume growth for lack of raw materials. So if we look forward, we would hope that that normalizes and the mix improvements will continue as they have for a number of years now. Operator : And our next question will come from Larry Gandler with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Larry Gandler : Hi, thanks, guys. My question is on the CapEx guidance Ron. I think you said 3% to 4% for the \u2013 was it 4% to 5% for the foreseeable future. And I can understand at the current point you're building quite a few factories there that it's 4% to 5% now. But I'm just wondering are you thinking that philosophically, the business needs to invest more organically and maybe you can roll up into that perhaps the acquisition pipeline for quite some time might be something you're thinking won't be too active. Ron Delia : Yes. Look, Larry, just to be clear we've pointed to the historical range of 3% to 4% of sales. And what we've said is that expect that that will be more in the 4% to 5% of sales range going forward. And it's a function of a couple of things. Firstly, the opportunity set is rich. As the portfolio has evolved and a lot of it is through what we picked up in the Bemis acquisition in Flexibles and as the rigids portfolio has evolved into the more specialty space, we just have more organic opportunities than we've probably ever had. So that's the starting point. And when I say good organic opportunities, I mean those where we could deploy capital and generate an attractive return for shareholders. So that's the starting point. Secondly, the business is generating more and more cash flow. It's increasing its cash generation capacity, especially as we come through the integration era if you will. And as we look at alternative uses of that capital, we have, we believe an ability to balance funding the organic growth that we see continuing to pursue acquisitions, buying back shares in the absence of acquisitions and then obviously maintaining a pretty healthy attractive dividend. So we just feel like the cash generation is sufficient now to support all of those potential drivers of shareholder returns and the organic growth opportunity set has just never been more robust. Operator : Our next question will come from Mike Roxland with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Roxland : Thanks very much. Hi, Ron, Mike, Tracey, congrats on the quarter. Just one quick question regarding volume growth. Given the material constraints, which obviously negatively impacted volume, can you comment on any potential reengineering or reformulation of your products to get the necessary finished products or revise these products qualified into customers? Anything that you pursued to or reformulated during the quarter or have been doing through year-to-date to adjust or to account for this material constraint? Ron Delia : Yes. It's a great question, a great observation. I mean you can rest assured we are doing everything we can to find viable alternatives when materials are just constrained. I think that \u2013 we have an advantage in that we're a large-scale buyer and we're buying materials in multiple regions. So the first thing we do when we run into any kind of a constraint is we look to source the material from another region. And so we've been able to tap into our global network and our global footprint to I think navigate the situation quite well. But there are times when there's just no material available globally. And that's why in parallel we're looking at reformulations wherever possible. Those typically do not happen quickly. And I think there's nothing I could point to in the quarter that's material enough but there is plenty of activity in terms of qualifying alternative materials and looking to reformulate away from materials that have been more prone to outages. Operator : And our next question will come from Nathan Reilly with UBS. Please go ahead. Nathan Reilly : Yes, thanks for taking my questions. I'm just interested Ron, how much headroom have you got in terms of your plant capacity utilization at the moment. Obviously, I appreciate you've been somewhat volume-constrained as well recently. But I'm also just curious to understand what type of volume uplift you'd be expecting to see from the increased investment in CapEx that you're playing going forward? Ron Delia : Look, Nathan, it's a broad network and the capacity utilization will vary across the business quite dramatically. So in the extreme you have our Rigid Packaging business in the beverage space, which has been sold out for a long period of time now for several quarters and we're adding capacity there which is just to satisfy the continued elevated demand we see in PET and beverages In the Flexibles segment, we see very high utilization for the assets that are directed to the more sustainable products that we make some of the global product platforms that I alluded to in the prepared remarks. But we will be adding capacity and that capacity will help support the volume growth expectations that we have going forward which have traditionally been in the low single-digit range. Operator : And our next question will come from Ghansham Panjabi from with Baird. Please go ahead. Ghansham Panjabi : Thank you. Good day, everybody. Just as a follow-up to some of the earlier questions maybe you can give us a sense as to which specific raw materials you're still short on. And how do you see that sort of evolving over the next couple of quarters? And then just bigger picture I mean the current environment is obviously extraordinary for the entire supply chain and no one really knows how the consumer is ultimately going to react all these inflationary inputs and so on. Just curious Ron, in terms of how you service your customers and how you go to market, is there anything that you noticed that's different in terms of what your customers are sort of asking you with now versus in years past just given the nature of the current environment? Thank you. Ron Delia : Yes. Look on the materials that are short, I mean, it's been a bit of a whac-a-mole game to be honest with you in terms of where we're short which material and which region in which month or which week, I guess, you could say. And more often than not it's been some of the specialty materials in Flexibles and rigids which are additive to the primary material. So it's not been -- to a large extent for quite some time now it's not been the base polymers that we buy the big commodities like polyethylene or polypropylene. We did have some shortages in PET for a while but those have abated. It's been more the specialty materials that are added to provide barrier or some other property that's required to deliver the full functionality of the package which have really been highly volatile. Aluminum to some extent, I guess, would be the other main commodity which at times has been in short supply. Look, I think, this too shall pass. I mean there's no reason why we should expect indefinite outages. But at the moment it's just been continued volatility. Operator : And our next question will come from Richard Johnson with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Richard Johnson : Thanks very much. Ron, my question is on rigid plastics. One of your major -- in fact your major competitor in the US talks about resin being something over 40% of the cost of sales. Is that the same for you? And probably more pertinently can you talk please about the 60% of non-raw material cost and give -- and provide whatever detail you can on the inflationary pressures in that part of your cost basket please? Ron Delia : Yes. I'll talk about the COGS in Rigid Packaging and maybe Michael can talk about the inflation we've seen generally because we've talked a lot about raw materials but inflation more generally is obviously front and center. Look the Rigid Packaging business I'm not sure who the competitor is but the resin component of COGS is actually higher in rigids than it is in Flexibles. And I would have said it's probably in the 60% to 70% range. And that's as you know a straight pass-through that's linked to the commodity index either PET or one of the olefins. But as far as general inflation goes Michael why don't you comment on what we're seeing. Michael Casamento : Yes. Look I think the general inflation across the globe I mean where we're seeing increases is predominantly in energy and freight and it varies by region. But in -- we're seeing inflation there in the range of kind of 15% to 20% but the point to remember is that those elements of our COGS are quite small low single-digits. So we're out in front of that. Some of that we can pass through to customers. Other parts of that we've got to take price. And we're out in front across the globe working our way through that to recover those increases that we're seeing in general inflation on those two items. In terms of labor it's been more supply than I guess labor wage rates for us. So we've had disruption in labor particularly in North America and Europe around COVID and the like which we've had to deal with. And we've seen some elevated over time and other labor costs associated with that. But it's again been manageable and we haven't seen the rate increases although we are expecting some of those to start to come through. Operator : And our next question will come from Kyle White with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Kyle White : Hey, thanks for taking the question. I know your exposure to China is relatively limited, but just curious what impact you've seen from the lockdown situation there on your production and demand in that region. And what did you assume in your outlook going forward from that situation? Ron Delia : Yes. Look China is a big important business for us about 5% of sales. It's a business -- it's our largest emerging markets business. We operate the Flexible packaging segment there. So there's not -- Rigid Packaging doesn't participate in China. And it's a business that's been growing at a pretty healthy rate for the last several years. First half as well we had kind of mid single-digit top and bottom-line growth. It's also a very profitable business. We have a national footprint there with 10 or 11 factories across the country. But importantly it's essentially a China for China business so we do very little importing or exporting in and out of China. The third quarter was a little bit slower I think primarily because we're cycling an incredibly strong third quarter last year, which probably had to do with the timing of Chinese New Year as much as anything else. But our business was flat to modestly down in the third quarter. April definitely slowed. In April, I would say is, where we started to see some impacts of the lockdowns and not so much on our operations. But in some of our customers' plants, where they weren't able to operate for periods of time we definitely saw a slowdown in April. And honestly, it's very difficult to tell what March or June portends. So our guidance range from an EPS perspective, includes a range of outcomes on China although bear in mind, we're down to two months we know the outcome for April. So I think we feel pretty comfortable with the range and the consideration we've given to the dynamics in China. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from James Wilson with Jarden Australia. Please go ahead. James Wilson : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. It's James Wilson standing for Jakob Cakarnis from Jarden. If we back out the $120 million of raw material impacts from your $200 million working capital field over the quarter beyond seasonality what's giving you confidence that this will unwind in the fourth quarter, especially given that your guidance remains unchanged? And also just on that, are you able to tell us what this inventory spill up is occurring more in recent or in Flexibles? Michael Casamento : Yeah. Hi, James, thanks for the question. I'll take that one. Yeah, look what we've seen actually year-to-date in working capital is about a $200 million outflow versus prior year and about half of that is price. The other half is building raw material and finished goods. This year, particularly, we've been able to build some inventory in the Rigid Packaging space, which we weren't able to do last year and that's ahead of the heavy season in Q4 which is typically what we would normally see. We would normally see inventories build leading into Q4. So that's part of it. In addition to that in the Flexibles space and across the board we've also conservatively increased in inventory particularly in some of the products we've had shortage of supply on. So we'd expect that that is going to unwind that component of the \u2013 the inventory increase. It's going to unwind in Q4 as we cycle through our busiest quarter of the year. So that's how we factored that into the full year guidance. Operator : And next we have a follow-up from George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead. George Staphos : Hi, guys. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks for taking the follow-on guys. You had talked about increasing your growth investments and you cited regionally where you're putting various products. Ron given some \u2013 and Michael some of the volatility that we've seen over the last couple of years would that perhaps change where you'll put the next growth investments in high-value investments, or really it doesn't really affect where you might put either a coffee line or a high-barrier line or personal care line? And are you at all raising the required rates of return given the volatility that we've seen in some of these markets again either for geopolitical or from macro reasons? Thanks guys and good luck in the quarter. Ron Delia : Yeah. Thanks George. It's a really good question. I mean, you're throwing intellectual property protection into the mix. And we've always had different criteria, or differentiated criteria I should say for where we put capital and differentiated return expectations for any capital project. The good thing about our business is that, the incremental capacity is small as a percentage of the total capital that we'll deploy in a given year. So if you can imagine that our capital spend will be $500 million, $550 million or something like that. A new \u2013 even a new plant to produce one of the platforms that I've talked about might be in the $20 million, $30 million range. So none of the projects that, I was alluding to earlier with the exception of the new plant we built in China, which is a little bit more none of them are a really substantial portion of our overall capital spend in any one year. And so what that does is creates a portfolio effect across the different investments that we make which in and of itself is a risk mitigation methodology, if you could think about it that way. Operator : And our next question will come from Larry Gandler with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Larry Gandler : Hi, Ron. Thanks guys. I'll ask my obligatory ESG question. But, Ron, the US the European Union is, I think reviewing the waste and packaging directives looking to table a new bill into the European Parliament. And I think it's going to involve end producer or end user recycling schemes like container deposit similar to that, but for Flexibles. I'm just wondering if you guys are sort of reviewing that situation. And what would those sort of schemes mean for a converter? Ron Delia : Yes. There's a lot of legislation in play in Europe and in the United States and elsewhere in the world. We're across all of it, Larry, as you could expect, where we provide comments. We're often consulted for perspectives, which we provide both directly and through the various associations and affiliations that we have. Generally speaking, we see these regulations as innovation opportunities and ways to further differentiate and add and create value to our customers. In many cases where there's an extended producer responsibility, regime or plastics tax or something of that nature, there's an eco modulation component, which means the fee that the brand owner ultimately the consumer will pay can be reduced if the package or the product overall has a lower environmental footprint. So that creates an opportunity for us to add more value to our customers as they deal with these regulations. And generally speaking, if it's a well-constructed EPR where the industry has some control over the framework and where the funding goes back to the waste management infrastructure, we're supportive. We're certainly not supportive of general revenue raising taxes and things like that, but where well structured frameworks are in place we're certainly supportive. Operator : And our next question will come from Andrew Scott with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Andrew Scott : Thank you. Thank you. Hi, Ron. Just a question on the Flexibles business. You've spoken about targeting or focusing your capacity towards your higher value customers, which obviously, perfect sense. Just interested as we go forward and capacity comes back, do you see all of those customers coming back into the mix, or do you for want of a better word see yourselves doing some bottom-slicing which is something you've done historically very well. Ron Delia : Yes. Look, I think, to the extent that we'll have better differentiated products then we'll be able to capture any portion of the market that we've not been able to satisfy more recently. There is an element of bottom-slicing in the mix outcomes that you've seen even in the most recent result albeit out of necessity for lack of raw materials. But look I think we're in the business to sell and sell more units than rather than less. And at the moment the limiting factor has been raw materials. That will ease over time. Operator : And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. And I would now like to turn the call back over to Ron Delia for closing remarks. Ron Delia : Okay. Thank you operator. Thanks everyone for joining today and for your interest in Amcor. We've had a strong quarter. We've had a strong first nine months of the fiscal year and have increased our expectations for the run home to the finish. And again, thanks for your interest, and we'll speak to you all next quarter. Operator : And this will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Tracey Whitehead, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Tracey Whitehead : Thank you, operator, and thank you welcome for joining Amcor's June quarter earnings call for fiscal '22. Joining the call today is Ron Delia, Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Casamento, Chief Financial Officer. Before I hand over, let me note a few items. On our Web site amcor.com under the Investors section, you'll find today's press release and presentation, which we will discuss on the call. Please be aware that we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures and related reconciliations can be found in the press release and the presentation. Remarks will also include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions. The second slide in today's presentation lists several factors that could cause future results to be different than current estimates, and reference can be made to Amcor's SEC filings including our statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q for further details. During the question-and-answer session, as the operator mentioned, we request that participants ask their question and then rejoin the queue for any additional questions. With that, over to you, Ron. Ron Delia : Thanks, Tracey, and thanks everyone for joining Michael and myself today to discuss Amcor's financial results for fiscal 2022. We'll begin with some prepared remarks before opening for Q&A. And kicking off with Slide 3, which covers safety, our first and most important value. Throughout fiscal 2022, we continue to make good progress on our long-term objective of eliminating injuries across our global operations.  The focus of our teams on implementing additional safety best practices resulted in a further 3% reduction in the number of reported injuries globally, and I'm pleased to report that well over 50% of our sites continue to be injury free for the past 12 months or more. We pride ourselves on making the well being of our 44,000 global employees our number one objective, and we'll continue to strive to achieve our goal of no injuries.  Turning to our key messages for today on Slide 4. First, FY '22 has been another outstanding year for Amcor. We could not be more pleased with how our teams have demonstrated remarkable perseverance and agility, continually adjusting to challenges in the operating environment from raw material shortages to high inflation, while remaining focused on driving value for our customers and our shareholders. As a result, financial performance was strong with growth across all key metrics. The business finished the year with good momentum, more than offsetting any external headwinds so that Q4 was our strongest quarter of sales and EBIT growth, and full year EPS growth of 11% was at the top end of our guidance range. Second, we expect the business to continue performing well and we anticipate sustaining strong underlying growth in FY '23. And finally, we have a resilient and compelling investment case, which has consistently delivered significant shareholder value through a combination of organic growth, value creating acquisitions, and cash returns to shareholders.  Turning to some financial highlights for the year as outlined on Slide 5. In short, we've added to our track record with another year of sustainable growth in the underlying business. Focusing on the strong June quarter, net sales growth was 13% and this included approximately $1.7 billion of incremental price increases on an annualized basis related to the pass through of higher raw material costs.  Excluding this pass through, organic sales growth accelerated through the year reaching 6% for the June quarter in both the flexibles and rigid packaging segments, and our strong performance reflects good work by our teams to recover broader and higher levels of general inflation, mostly through the second half of the year. It also reflects favorable volume and mixed benefits. And as we have in the past several quarters, we benefited from mid to high single digit growth in high value priority segments, which confirms that our focus on these faster growing markets is paying off.  This top line growth converted into adjusted EBIT growth of 9% in the June quarter and it's worth noting that this high single digit earnings growth was achieved in a quarter which clearly no longer benefited from any synergies, and while we continue to experience significant inflation and an unfavorable price cost lag related to raw materials. Flexibles delivered outstanding EBIT growth of 11% in the quarter and in line with our expectations, earnings growth continued to improve in rigid packaging.  For the full year, net sales growth was 13% and 4% on an organic basis, which represents our third consecutive year of accelerating top line growth. Adjusted EBIT of 1.7 billion was 7% higher than the prior year, and adjusted EPS of $0.805 per share was 11% higher than one year ago. Our financial profile remains strong with return on average funds employed at 16.3%. And we also returned more than $1.3 billion of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and a higher annual dividend. Now, before handing over to Michael for more detail on the financial results, let me provide an update on our business in Russia. As previously announced, we've been exploring all strategic options for our Russian business. And after a thorough assessment, we've decided to sell our three manufacturing sites in Russia.  Until completion, which we expect will occur in the second half of our 2023 fiscal year, we remain committed to supporting our employees and customers, while preserving value for shareholders through an orderly sell process. We're also practically undertaking initiatives to help offset the future impact of the divested earnings, including optimizing our European footprint and adjusting our regional cost base. With that, I'll hand over to Michael who will cover the estimated impact of this sale on fiscal 2023 guidance. Michael Casamento : Thanks, Ron. And I'll begin with the flexibles segment on Slide 6. Performance throughout fiscal '22 was excellent across several different dimensions as each one of our businesses responded quickly to the continued evolving market environment, implementing measures to recover higher raw material costs, manage general inflation, improve cost performance and deliver increasing mixed benefits.  Year-to-date sales of 1.2 billion includes significant recoveries of high raw material costs of 1.1 billion, the overall price cost impact has remained a manageable headwind through this inflationary cycle given the diversity of raw materials we buy, the multiple reasons in which we consume those materials and the leverage we get from our well developed and deeply embedded capabilities which have enabled us to implement a range of pricing actions across the business in a timely manner. Excluding this raw material impact, we are very pleased with the organic sales growth which was delivered across all flexibles business units as well as the momentum built through the year as we focused on successful recovery of rising general inflation and optimizing mixed benefits.  Organic sales growth was 4% for the year and 6% in the June quarter, representing the strongest quarter of growth for the year. The strong mixed benefits in part reflect continued growth in priority segments, including healthcare, pet food, meat, and coffee. We have made deliberate choices to focus on these segments and through the year have seen organic sales growth in the mid to high single digit range across these categories. More broadly, supply chain disruptions had a dampening effect on growth in certain high value categories through the year, including in the June quarter. As a result, year-to-date in June quarter, volumes across the flexibles business were in line with last year. Based with these constraints, we proactively took action in parts of the business to redirect constrained materials to their highest value use, further enhancing mix.  In terms of earnings, adjusted EBIT growth of 9% on a year-to-date basis and 11% for the June quarter reflects strong price mix benefits and favorable cost performance. Margins also remained strong at 13.6%, despite an adverse impact of 150 basis points from the mathematical consequence of pass through pricing of higher raw material costs. Turning to rigid packaging on Slide 7, the key messages today is the underlying demand has remained elevated across North and South America through fiscal '22, leading to continued sequential strengthening in our earnings growth in the June quarter in line with our expectations. On a year-to-date basis, reported sales grew by 20%, which includes approximately 16% related to the recovery of higher raw material costs. The 5% organic sales growth was driven by favorable price mix benefits of 2% and volume growth of 3%.  In North America, year-to-date beverage volumes were up 1%, hot fill container volumes increased by 2% for the year against the strong comparative period of double digit growth and were up 4% in the June quarter, reflecting continued strength in categories like isotonics and juice. By leveraging Amcor's highly differentiated technology, design and PCR handling capabilities, we are well differentiated in adding significant value for our customers in the hot fill segment, which over a multiyear period has resulted in compound volume growth of around 5%, helping drive consistent mixed benefits. Specialty container volumes continued to improve throughout the year, including in the June quarter, but on a full year basis remained below the prior year which benefited from a strong first half in the home and personal care category. And in Latin America, the business delivered double digit volume growth for the year supported by high volumes in all countries who operate in the region. And the June quarter marks the highest level of volume growth for the business this year led in part by strength in Brazil.  Turning to earnings. In line with our expectation, operating conditions and financial performance in the North American business improved through the second half of the year, after being adversely impacted by industry-wide supply chain complexity and disruptions as well as capacity constraints in the first half. As a result, the overall business delivered adjusted EBIT growth of 4% in the second half, with growth improving sequentially and reaching 5% in the June quarter. Moving to the cash and the balance sheet on Slide 8. We continue to generate strong free cash flow even as we step up our capital investments and compensate for additional working capital needs from higher raw material costs and supply constraints. Free cash flow was 1.1 billion, in line with the expectations and broadly in line with fiscal 2021. We're pleased with this result given we've the unfavorable working capital impact of higher raw material costs throughout the year and have also proactively increased inventories across the business to help offset some of the volatility created by supply constraints.  Our working capital performance remains a top priority, one even more critical in this inflationary environment. And despite these challenges, we've been able to maintain a 12-month average working capital to sales ratio below 8% and in line with last year. We also see ample opportunity to increase investments in strategic growth projects, which generate strong returns in excess of 20%. This led to a 13% increase in capital investments during the '22 fiscal year. And as we've previously communicated, we will continue to step up investments to support future organic growth.  We maintain an investment grade credit rating which gives us access to funding through the cycle of competitive rates and approximately 54% of our debt is fixed. Leverage of 2.7x on a trailing 12-month EBITDA basis was in line with our expectations at year end. And the balance sheet is extremely well positioned with only one maturity in the next 18 months being a \u20ac300 million bond in March '23. We continue to deliver on our investment case, returning meaningful capital to shareholders during fiscal '22 year through repurchasing 600 million worth of shares and raising our annual dividend per share to $0.48. In total, we are pleased to have returned more than 1.3 billion to shareholders in fiscal '22. Turning now to Amcor's outlook for fiscal 2023 on Slide 9. We expect adjusted EPS of approximately $0.80 to $0.84 per share on a reported basis. This includes growth of 5% to 10% from the underlying business and a benefit of approximately 2% from share repurchases, offset by three non-operating items. The first, the negative impact of approximately 4% from higher interest expense, which is based on the assumption that interest rates increased in line with the current market forward curve expectations. Second, an estimated 2% negative impact from the scale down and planned sale of our three plants in Russia. And third, a 2% negative impact related to a stronger U.S. dollar assuming current exchange rates prevail for the balance of the fiscal year.  In terms of cash flow, we expect to continue to generate significant adjusted free cash flow for the year of approximately 1 billion to 1.1 billion, even as we fund a further 15% increase in capital investment to capture organic growth opportunities. While Amcor's cash flows are typically weighted to the second half, in fiscal 2023 the seasonality is likely to be slightly more pronounced as we intend to maintain higher levels of inventory in the near term, before returning to more normalized levels later in the year.  As a result, free cash flow in the September '23 quarter is expected to be lower than first quarter of fiscal '22. Our strong cash generation enables us to continue paying a compelling and growing dividend and allocate approximately 400 million in cash to share repurchases during the 2023 fiscal year. So in summary for me today, the business has delivered another strong year of organic growth as we remain focused on executing for our customers, recovering inflation and higher raw material costs and increasing earnings leverage by managing mix. Our continued and consistent performance supports our confidence in delivering another year of underlying growth in fiscal 2023.  With that, I'll hand back to Ron. Ron Delia : Okay. Thanks, Michael. Before turning to Q&A, I want to refocus for a minute on the longer term and our financial performance continues to reflect consistent delivery against our strategy and a resilient investment case which is shown on Slide 10. We enter fiscal '23 with leadership positions in most of our chosen primary packaging segments and with over 95% of our sales for consumer staples and healthcare products.  We also have absolute and relative scale advantages in all key regions, and industry leading commercial and innovation capabilities. With this portfolio, we have a long track record through multiple economic cycles of delivering earnings growth, margin expansion and significant free cash flow, all while maintaining a strong investment grade balance sheet. Our cash flow and balance sheet strength is enabling us to step up investments for growth, and continue to return additional value to shareholders in the form of a growing dividend and regular share repurchases. The starting point in creating value for shareholders will always be the underlying organic growth of the business. And as we've continually strengthened the base business, including over the last few years with the Bemis acquisition, we've built sustainable organic sales growth momentum.  We have multiple drivers of organic growth that have contributed to that momentum and which are shown on Slide 11. We've been focused on these areas for some time and we're investing across each of them. First, Amcor has leading positions in higher growth, higher value priority segments, including healthcare, meat, cheese, premium coffee, pet food, and hot fill containers. Collectively, we generate more than $4 billion in annual sales across these categories. And they're growing at mid single digit rates and offer significant opportunities for differentiation, contributing to margin expansion. Over time, they'll represent a higher proportion of our sales mix and become an increasingly relevant driver of earnings growth.  We also have a leading and well diversified emerging markets portfolio generating more than $3 billion in revenue, which we expect will also grow in mid single digit rates over the long term, as has been the case for many years. And innovation continues to be one of the most critical drivers of differentiation and growth in the packaging industry. And Amcor is coming from a position of tremendous strength with deep R&D talent and capabilities.  And finally, sustainability is fundamental to everything we do from an innovation perspective, and remains at the forefront of discussions with global brand owners. As the sustainability leader in the packaging industry, we continue to be the supplier of choice to help our customers achieve their goals in a meaningful way and at scale. Organic growth has accelerated over the last three years, and as Michael mentioned, we're stepping up CapEx to around 4% to 5% of sales on an ongoing basis to maintain that momentum.  In our industry, there's also a rich pipeline of acquisition opportunities available to supplement our organic growth. We have a pragmatic and disciplined approach to M&A, and we've completed around 30 deals in the last 10 years and we continue to be active. Earlier this month, we acquired a world class flexible packaging plant in the Czech Republic. This plant features state of the art equipment and immediately increases our capacity in Central Europe to satisfy strong demand in priority segments, including coffee and pet food.  The acquired land and buildings also provide optionality to scale and potentially consolidate operations in that region, while giving us a highly efficient production hub in a strategically attractive lower cost location. We've also invested in several new opportunities through our open innovation and corporate venturing efforts. These typically start small, but we're very excited to have recently increased our strategic investment in ePac, a fast growing flexible packaging player leveraging digital technologies to offer smaller production runs and shorter lead times. This increased investment in ePac is an excellent example of our objective to partner with high growth, visionary companies to learn from and to leverage new innovations and business models. As you heard from Michael, we have a strong investment grade balance sheet and we expect another year of robust cash flow in fiscal '23, which means we can continue to invest in growth and return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders. We're committed to growing our already compelling dividend every year. And Amcor is one of a small number of companies included in the Dividend Aristocrats Index, which recognizes companies with a 25-year or longer history of consecutive dividend increases. Our current yield is especially attractive at approximately 4%.  And we've also been a regular repurchaser of our own shares, allocating $1.5 billion of cash to share repurchases since 2019. And over that time, we've bought back more than 8% of our outstanding shares, or roughly one-third of the shares that were issued to acquire Bemis three years ago. And looking ahead, we expect our strong cash generation to continue supporting regular share repurchases, including approximately $400 million in fiscal '23.  In summary, on Slide 14, Amcor had another strong year in fiscal '22, generating sustainable momentum and delivering earnings growth at the top end of our expected range. We expect to deliver another year of strong growth in the underlying business in FY '23, and we're committed to continuing delivering for shareholders by increasing investments in the business and returning value through a compelling dividend and ongoing share repurchases.  So with those opening remarks, operator, we can now turn the line over to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. In the interest of time, we would like to remind participants to limit themselves to one question and rejoin the queue for any follow ups. Your first question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Your line is open. Anthony Pettinari : Good afternoon. In rigids, you saw really good volume growth in North America bev and some of your packaging peers have talked about customers pushing price over volume and maybe reducing some promotional activity. I'm wondering if you could just talk about maybe the outlook for bev volumes in fiscal '23 and the dynamic that you're seeing there. Do you think that you're gaining share or maybe you're kind of overweight in some categories that are winning in the marketplace? Just any kind of further detail there would be very helpful? Ron Delia : Yes. Look, I think that the starting point would be that the demand has remained elevated. If we look across our business -- and we had a good solid year in '22 from a volume perspective, but what's really more compelling in our view is that over two years, our volumes across the beverage space are up 6%. In hot fill, which is a priority segment for us, they're up about 14%, over two years. And that includes growth in both of the years. So we had super strong growth in fiscal '21, little slower growth in '22 against that stronger comp, but the demand has remained elevated. I think over the long term, we continue to expect kind of low single digit volume growth across our end market segments. If we look back over the last five, six, seven years, we've had about 2% total beverage growth, but the hot fill space has grown closer to 3% to 4% and that's what we'd expect going forward. I think looking back over the last 24 months, there's been a bunch of ups and downs clearly, but we like our exposure, we're highly levered to the sports drink category, which has gone through a bit of a rejuvenation. Ice teas, some of the hot fill juices as well have performed well. So that's the expectation going forward, Anthony. It's low single digit growth with maybe a little bit more in hot fill. Anthony Pettinari : Okay, that's very helpful. And then just switching to flexibles. In terms of improving material availability, what inning do you think you're in there or at what point does that maybe run its course? And does the guidance assume maybe kind of a modest mix headwind in '23 as you kind of maybe go back to some maybe lower margin customers? I don't know if that's the right way to think about it, but any color there? Ron Delia : Yes, let me answer -- it's two separate questions. Let me try to answer both. As far as the raw material availability goes, I'd say we're in the middle innings. I think it's been a bit like a Whac-A-Mole game in terms of the availability constraints that we have dealt with over the last, say, 12 to 15 months. We still have constraints on some specialty polymers. I think the commodity raw materials that we source have been in ready supply for quite some time now. Where we've had constraints it's been more in specialty resins. At times, we've had constraints or limitations on aluminum supply as well, that seems to have abated a bit. But as far as the overall basket of goods, I would describe that we're in the middle innings. I think we would like to believe there's light at the end of the tunnel. As far as our guidance, we assume basically ready availability and low single digit volume growth in flexibles. Hopefully, we see the end of it by the end of the fiscal year in terms of the constraints. And then, look, as far as mix, the other part of your question, I think -- we would expect organic sales growth to be generally similar. But over time, as materials become more available, the contribution to that sales growth will balance out. So we might see a little bit less in a bridging sense from mixed and a little bit more from volume. But longer term, and this is important to note, making the distinction between the bridging of one financial year to the next and just the long-term strategic direction, which is to drive improved mix and drive growth in those higher priority segments that we talked about. Tracey Whitehead : Operator, we will take the next question please. Operator : As a reminder, we would like to ask participants to limit their questions to one and rejoin the queue for follow ups. Your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Your line is open. Ghansham Panjabi : Thank you. Good day, everybody. I just wanted to follow up on Anthony's question on the elasticity impact. Ron, maybe just a broader portfolio question, just rigids but flexibles as well. Have you seen any sort of impact as it relates to new product introduction activity or anything like that, because clearly a lot of your customers are talking about consumer elasticity taking hold? And then also just to clarify, the 3% price contribution in flexibles, apart from the 11% pass through impact, what exactly does that encompass? These market based price increases as you attempt to adjust for higher freight and labor costs or is there something else there? Thanks. Ron Delia : Yes, let me talk -- I'll answer the first question and Michael can come back on the second around the pricing. Look, we talked to our customers, as you'd expect, and we're close to our customers across the different markets that we're participating in. I think generally, the same messages come back. And that is what you hear them say publicly, which is, to date, in this part of the inflationary cycle, elasticities have been lower than they would have expected and lower than historical levels. But they're also quick to point out that there is elasticity of demand even across these more defensive end markets. And there's a potential for that elasticity to increase as we get deeper into this period of high inflation. There's a cumulative amount of inflation that builds up which could impact the consumer. All that being said, we really like our portfolio. We have no general industrial exposure. We're almost completely exposed to consumer staples and healthcare products, which have proven over a number of economic cycles to be quite resilient. And we've got no durables exposure of any kind also. So we feel like we're as well positioned as anybody. Certainly, if you go back, if you'd follow the company 5, 10 years ago, our portfolio now is more defensive than it's ever been, and as I said, essentially, all of our exposure into more defensive segments. You want to talk about the price? Michael Casamento : Yes, sure. In terms of the pricing, so as you've seen from the results, our teams have been out there working really hard to get not only the raw material increases back in the year, and when you see it, we put through about 1.5 billion in raw material related price increases through the year, so about 12% of revenue. And that kind of counted at 25% increase generally across the board in raw materials. But in addition to that, clearly we've seen pretty significant increases in inflation across things like energy and freight, and to a lesser extent some labor. And so clearly, our teams have been out in the marketplace recovering those non-raw material related items as well and working really hard to do that. And if you think about energy and freight as a component of Amcor's cost of goods, they're a smaller component, they're around about 3% of our cost of goods. And during the year, we've seen somewhere between 15% to 20% increases in those items. And that equates to around 100 million, 110 million. And then if you take labor and a few other things into account, the overall inflation for the year was somewhere around $150 million mark. And if you look at our price increases across the board, we had about a 1% price increase in non-raw material added, so 1% in sales growth. That's a pretty similar amount to the inflation that we saw. Ghansham Panjabi : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brook Campbell-Crawford with Barrenjoey. Your line is open. Brook Campbell-Crawford: Thanks for taking my question. Just one on Slide 9. The sort of 5% to 10% organic growth I guess based on organic volume growth of 1% to 2%, can you just sort of step me through that leverage? Are you expecting price increases to more than offset cost inflation? I'm sure there's a bit of mix in there. But it's just good leverage there from volume to EPS? Ron Delia : Yes. Look, I would describe it as basically the components that you just outlined. So we start with expectation of low single digit volume growth. We start with the expectation that that volume growth will be more heavily weighted towards the more differentiated higher value segments that we've called out. We would expect to continue to get inflation recovery. And we would expect to continue to drive cost productivity in the business. So those building blocks probably haven't changed much. In certain years, we've had acquisition synergies to contribute. We don't have that obviously in '23. But those are the building blocks. Brook Campbell-Crawford: But just on the restructuring costs taken below the line throughout the year, there was another 11 million in the fourth quarter. And I note there was no Bemis synergies in that period as well. So maybe you can just help us understand what are some of the examples of things that contribute to that 11 million in the June quarter and if we should expect some of that to continue into FY '23? Michael Casamento : Yes. Thanks, Brook. It's Michael. Look, that was just the end of the program, so there's some tail off on certain costs relating to -- mostly relating to footprint related items, the impairments and other things. So that's specifically on the Bemis program, which is now closed out. So you should not expect any more costs below the line for that program, which we completed this year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Gandler with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Larry Gandler : Thank you. Just making sure you can hear me. Ron Delia : Yes, sir. Larry Gandler : Thank you. Okay. First question, I guess, Michael, with regards to the cash flow guidance, I was hoping for at least raw materials inventory not to be a drag on cash flow in F '23. Given the cash flow guidance is not in advance of F '22, it does seem like there is a bit of a drag. Just wondering if you can walk us through that? And my second question is related to -- you recently appointed -- this is probably a question more for Ron. You guys recently appointed a Head of Global Sales I guess to harmonize some of those high margin categories and your presence across Europe and U.S. Ron, maybe you can just talk about the priorities there? Ron Delia : Sure, okay. Do you want to take the first one? Michael Casamento : Yes, sure. So I'll start with the cash flow. Look, we're looking forward to another strong year of cash flow in that 1 billion to 1.1 billion range. There are several factors that drive that. Obviously, we're going to have some -- we'll have higher EBITDA within that cash flow from a working capital standpoint. In FY '22, we had a cash outflow of around 150 million on the back of the raw material price escalation and holding more inventory on the back of the volatile and disruptive marketplace. So we're not anticipating an additional outflow as a result of that. But at the same time, you're going to see increased sales and further pass through. So there will be some working capital impact from that, albeit we'll be holding working capital to sales around that below 8 ratio, which we've been pretty consistent on over the last few years. So no real impact on the inventory side. It's also going to depend on what happens with raw material pricing and how the market supply chain works. But pretty much, we're looking for neutral [ph] working capital impact. Obviously, we're going to be spending more in CapEx. So we talked about a 15% step up in CapEx, which will -- that's included in the guidance. And then with the higher interest, that's an outflow that we didn't have this year. So when you put all that together, looking forward to another strong year in that 1 billion to 1.1 billion range. Ron Delia : And then, Larry, yes, you asked about the Head of Global Sales and Marketing, which is a role that we've had but we've elevated. And maybe just for context, we run the business in a very decentralized way through the business groups. We have a small number of resources in this center that drive leverage across the portfolio in areas that we think are the highest impact. And sales and marketing has been one of those for quite some time. We've had that role in this center. What's new is that we've elevated it. It's now a direct report to me. It sits on the leadership table. And there's a few things that really I'm expecting to get out of it. First and foremost is we just -- as we pivot increasingly towards generating higher levels of organic growth and top line growth, we just want the voice of the customer even more prominent around the leadership table. And so this person will help us do that. Clearly, we have some global customer relationships that have always required a degree of coordination. So she will pick that up as well. And then our commercial capabilities, which is an initiative called Value Plus that we've had in place for 15 years or so, it's a commercial excellence program inside the company. Think of it as sort of Six Sigma for the commercial side of the business. She will also take the lead in driving continuous improvement in that program as well. So that's the rationale for the elevation and increase in prominence of what's always been a very important role for us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Your line is open. George Staphos : Hi, everyone. Good day. Hope you can hear me okay? Ron Delia : Yes. George Staphos : Thanks for all the details. My question is going to be on Russia, Ron and Mike. So I wanted to understand the guidance for next year, you've mentioned it would be about a 2% effect, considering that you assume the business winds down and is sold by mid fiscal '23. Does that mean then that in fiscal '24, there will be a residual comparison? There will be the other half that you're comparing against in fiscal '23 from having the business in your result? And then more broadly, you mentioned footprint alignment, cost reduction. Can you talk to us about how you are going to best try to fill some of the earnings that will be leaving? And how much will acquisitions play in that effort for the company? Thank you. And good luck with the new year. Ron Delia : Yes. Thanks, George. And I'll take it. Michael can tag on here at the end. But we've decided to sell these three plants, which have historically produced around 4% to 5% of our EBIT. The planning assumption and the assumption that's embedded in our guidance for the year is that we complete that sale process at some point in the second half of the year. And between now and then, we're scaling back the operations, which is all consistent with what we had said back in March and I think on our call in May. Now as far as the difference between roughly a 2% headwind in FY '23 and whether or not there's any residual impact in '24, look, we're pedaling really hard to offset the gap. And so we don't expect any meaningful residual impact in FY '24. Clearly, we're losing 4% to 5% of earnings. We're going to take a hard look at the cost base in that part of the business. We'll be rightsizing, if you will, the cost base in that part of the company, looking at footprint as well. And so we expect to mitigate the remaining impact to the extent there is any. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thank you to everyone. I guess first question is just thinking about maybe the growth you've delivered in the quarter and your thoughts in fiscal '23, maybe a bit more regionally. I'm just wondering -- you gave some color regionally in the rigids business, but help us think about kind of what you're seeing in Europe, Asia. China had lockdowns in the most recent quarter that could have proven disruptive. And especially in Europe, as you look ahead, weaker economic growth, kind of how you -- and the impact of energy and power prices, how that's both impacting your view of costs but also your view of consumer demand? And I think high level, Ron talked about kind of low single digit volume growth outlook as a starting assumption for fiscal '23, and I'm just trying to build up to that a little bit more? Ron Delia : Okay. I'll handle that part, and Michael you can come back and talk about the energy point. Yes, well, that's right. The starting point is the assumption of low single digit growth. If we look backwards a bit in '22, because I would expect that we will have similar dynamics at work in '23, generally speaking across the developed markets, we had sort of flat to low single digit volume growth in North America. Europe was a little bit softer because we had even more acute supply shortages of certain raw materials, and we prioritized some higher value segments and customers. But in the emerging markets in '22, we had mid single digit growth. And that's been sort of a long-term trend. So that's the way we would expect FY '23 to evolve as well. You asked specifically about China. China has been volatile. It's been a really consistent grower for us for a long time. We had good growth across FY '23 as well. But clearly, in the fourth quarter, in particular, with some of the lockdowns, we had some very strong months and we had some very soft months. And I would expect those ups and downs to persist into the start of '23 at least as things normalize. But generally speaking, I guess the next level of detail beneath the low single digit growth across the portfolio would be kind of lower single digits in the developed markets, Europe and North America, mid single digits in the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America. I would point out as well, just because of some of the comments you made in asking the question, this has been a very resilient business through a number of economic cycles. And I can't emphasize that enough. And I also would point out to those that have followed the company for a long time that the portfolio has not been as defensive as it is now. We really have no general industrial and durables exposure. Michael, do you want to talk about energy costs? Michael Casamento : Yes. So look, in terms of energy, as I said earlier, we've certainly seen inflation in our energy costs around the globe and in Europe, and that actually in Europe accelerated in the second half. But we've been out there recovering it. And we're certainly anticipating there's going to be more inflation to come. But the teams are out there and covering it. And the level is dependent on where things get to in that marketplace. And obviously, we've factored that into the guidance range and the range of outcomes in that guidance range. So overall, we're expecting inflation to continue and the teams are out there recovering it. Adam Samuelson : All right. Thank you. I appreciate the color. Ron Delia : Thanks, Adam. Operator : Your next question comes from Jakob Cakarnis with Jarden Australia. Your line is open. Jakob Cakarnis : Good evening, Michael, and good evening, Ron. Just a question on the CapEx outlook. Obviously, the third quarter update, you upgraded the CapEx to sales guidance to be between 4% and 5% of revenue. And today, you've mentioned that there's a 15% increase in the CapEx guidance. Can you just give us some indication as to where that CapEx is being allocated? Is it going to allow Amcor to compete more in the sustainability and recycled materials space, or are we looking at kind of BAU investment back into the business? I'm just wondering how it sets you up strategically moving forward. Ron Delia : Yes. So look, the guidance is consistent. If you do the math, we're working our way up to that 4% to 5% of sales range, which means that for a couple of years, there will be larger increases on the order of the 15% that you referenced. Generally speaking -- well, as a general rule, it's going into business as usual in the sense that we are not allocating capital outside of our lane in the value chain. So what we're not doing is allocating capital in a major way to recycling infrastructure or things like that. That's a separate discussion, but we think we can contribute to the development of infrastructure in a different way. So from that perspective, you could call it business as usual. But I think what's exciting to us is that we're -- we see enough line of sight to good organic growth in some of the priority segments that we've referred to and some of the innovation platforms, which do have sustainability attributes that we can deploy more capital to drive higher levels of growth. A couple of examples. In healthcare, we've opened a new healthcare packaging plant in Singapore. We've also expanded a plant in Ireland in the medical packaging space. We've put money to work in Switzerland to supply Nespresso capsules. We've continued to invest in our innovation platforms, our sustainable innovation platforms. We've talked publicly about a platform called AmLite, which is a recycle-ready material that can be used for human food pouches and pet food pouches. So those are some examples of where the capital is being deployed. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Purtell with Macquarie. Your line is open. John Purtell : Good day, Ron and Michael? How are you? Ron Delia : Good, John. How are you doing? John Purtell : Very well, thank you. Just in terms of price and cost spread and how we should think about that, are you expecting a meaningful positive price/cost spread in '23? And we know that you won't have the benefit or incremental benefit of Bemis synergies for the year ahead. And I suppose as part of that, is that sort of price/cost spread, are you starting to see that come through in a positive way now or is it more a second half weighting, assuming it does? Michael Casamento : Yes. Hi, John. It's Michael. I can take that one for you. Look, throughout this year, we've seen pretty volatile and persistent increases in raw material mixed across the globe. If you remember, we buy a broad basket of raw materials and geographies, and they move at different times in different ways. But what we did see through the year was a recovery of that. But for the entire year, it was a headwind, a manageable headwind. I'd say it eased as we got into the second half and in Q4 certainly was a marginal headwind. Where raw materials are today and what we see moving forward, there are still movements upwards. Aluminum is probably one that's come down, but the marketplace is still, across the globe, volatile. But what we've included in guidance for now is that we think in the first quarter, things are going to be relatively stable based on what we see today, and we could start to see some marginal tailwinds as we get to December. But what happens in the second half, we'll see. It's all going to depend on where the raw materials move. But that's all been factored into our guidance, the guidance range that we've put out there in that 5% to 10% underlying business. Obviously, if raw materials come down fast, and that's one of the elements that could get us to the higher end of the range and if they continue to escalate, then as you know, we recover it but there is always a lag in that. And so that could be one of the factors that leads us to the bottom end of the range. But where we sit today, fairly neutral in Q1, perhaps some slight tailwind as we head into Q2. John Purtell : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Richard Johnson with Jefferies. Your line is open. Richard Johnson : Thanks very much. Ron, can I just quickly ask you a question on rigid plastics? Your major competitor in hot fill reported volume growth for the June quarter, which was slightly higher than yours. And the reason they gave for their growth was market share gain in sports drinks. And given how consolidated that category is between the two of you, I just wanted to clarify whether you'd lost any share in that particular area? And then just secondly, a quick issue for Michael, if I might. Michael, can you remind me how you account for interest hedging gains and losses? Thanks. Ron Delia : Yes. Look, on the hot fill space, in response to someone's question earlier, I pointed out over the last two years, hot fill volumes are up 14%. Across any of the categories that we're exposed to, there's not been 14% growth, I can tell you that. So I think that our share has improved over the last 24 to 36 months pretty meaningfully. Michael, on the interest --? Michael Casamento : Yes. On the interest rate swaps, Richard, yes, they're part of the interest expense. They run through that line. Richard Johnson : Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Kyle White with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Kyle White : Thanks for taking the question. Ron, a little bit more longer term question here. Just curious how we should think about the shareholder growth algorithm over the long term? You're still targeting a 10% to 15% shareholder return. I guess why shouldn't it be higher, given the increase to CapEx and organic investments, especially towards some of these higher value end markets that you're targeting? I guess, obviously, you're increasing CapEx now. It takes time to get those returns. But do you see runway for this algo increasing, especially as you include M&A to it? Ron Delia : Look, it's a good question. I think the short answer is, yes, you can see a path at some point. But as you pointed out, we need -- there's a bit of ramp up to get returns from the capital that we're putting to work. I think the other thing that will happen is that the mix in that algorithm will shift a bit over time. We've been grinding out the organic growth from margin expansion and cost productivity over the years, and then we've been quite acquisitive, although less so more recently. So I think over time, you'll see that organic growth come a little bit more from the top line overall and a little more commercial productivity. And I think you'll see us get back on the acquisition path again as we had been prior to the last few years. So I think we're comfortable with the algorithm at the moment, but there's reasons for optimism that the mix will evolve a little bit as we move forward. And that's why we're putting our money behind some of these growth projects that I outlined earlier. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Kang with CLSA. Your line is open. Daniel Kang : Good morning, everyone. I guess we've noticed in terms of resin prices, it's pulled back quite meaningfully in recent months. Can you talk us through your thoughts on the dynamics that's driving this and new PE capacity coming on board potentially providing a more medium-term tailwind? Ron Delia : Yes. Look, as Michael alluded to, the basket of resins that we buy have moved in different directions and at different paces. And so overall, we actually saw resins across our global basket go up a bit in the fourth quarter. But there's definite signs that things will ease. And in the medium term and even maybe a bit sooner, in certain regions of the world, there is more capacity coming on stream in some commodities, and that will certainly take some of the heat out of the pricing. Remember that supply/demand is one element. We also have the underlying feedstock prices playing a role as well, so oil and natural gas which have come off a little bit, and I'm talking very recently now. But it's really those two things that drive the prices in the polymers that we consume. And for the last period of time here in this more recent inflationary cycle, we've had pressure from both. We've had raws supply/demand working against us at times and we've had inflation in oil and gas. It's possible that in the near term or certainly in the medium term, both of those factors abate and we start to see some more meaningful softening and more sustained softening across the basket of raw materials that we're buying. Daniel Kang : Thank you, Ron. If there is a chance for a follow up, I just wanted to ask about potential M&A. Are you seeing more opportunities at potentially more attractive valuations, given the higher rate environment? Ron Delia : Not yet, but you would have to believe that as rates go up, as the high yield market maybe gets a little tighter and a little more constrained, that there will be maybe less competition for deals. That would be the theme that you would expect to emerge. It's a bit early in the interest rate cycle and it's a bit early generally in the asset pricing cycle for us to have seen that yet. But we're in a great position, because we know exactly where we want to go strategically. We know exactly the segments that we'd like to acquire in to advance our strategy. And we've got a great financial position to work from with a really strong balance sheet and lots of cash flow. So we'll certainly be in the deal flow to the extent assets do come to market. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal. Your line is open. Mark Wilde : Thanks. Good evening, Ron. Good evening, Michael. Ron Delia : Hi, Mark. Mark Wilde : Just curious about just any inventory destocking behavior that you're seeing? We've heard a lot of conversation about this with different retailers, but I think there have also been questions about whether upstream from them, whether some of the CPGs have taken on a little extra inventory over the last couple of years and whether they might be starting to bleed a little bit of that back out now? Just any thoughts around that, Ron? Ron Delia : Yes. Look, it's always difficult for us to have great visibility into where things stand from an inventory perspective down the value chain. I guess this is really anecdotally. I'd probably suggest that there is probably more inventory than there needs to be in some parts of the chain, as it's been particularly acute in any part of our business and really held things back. But I would say with the limited visibility that we have, you'd probably say there's a little bit more inventory than there needs to be in certain segments. But take that for what it's worth, which is just a bit anecdotal. Mark Wilde : Okay. And then if I could just follow on real quickly. Can you just update us on sort of where volume is at in both kind of healthcare and medical devices, because you did mention some incremental healthcare and device investments? I know earlier in the pandemic that some of those volumes were weak. I'm just curious about where you stand right now. Ron Delia : Yes, that's a good question. I'm glad you asked. Healthcare volumes generally, medical device packaging and pharmaceutical packaging have bounced back very strongly. So we had good mid to high single digit growth across both of those segments through FY '22. Pharma was a little bit slower to rebound. But the medical device packaging volumes for us now are back to where we were pre-pandemic. Now that's a segment that has grown in sort of the mid single digits for us for many, many years. It's a good margin business and innovation intensive, et cetera. So we expect that to continue. But we're back to where we were in 2019. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Your line is open. George Staphos : Hi, Ron. Thanks for taking the follow on. I want to come back to acquisitions and recognizing you're going to be very disciplined, as always, about the businesses that you look at. You mentioned that sustainability is core to everything that you do at Amcor clearly. How important will it be for the acquisitions that you look at to either give you a new technology, a new ability to promote sustainability and otherwise help your customers' products become more sustainable? Or it's important but really what you're looking at are the financial metrics, the improvement in return funds employed and so on. How would you have us think about how you're evaluating that? And if you could talk a little bit about the Czech facility and just provide a bit more color on that that would be great? Again, thanks and good luck in the year. Ron Delia : Yes, thanks. Look, it's a great question, George. I would say the two factors that you outlined are inextricably linked. As you think about doing an acquisition, especially anything of meaningful scale, you'd be thinking more beyond the first couple of years of ownership. And so you'd be thinking about the sustainable growth in a business that you'd be acquiring. You'd be thinking about the sustainable competitive advantage. All of those things in our universe are going to be linked to sustainability. So it's inconceivable that we would buy something that didn't further enhance our sustainability, the sustainability credentials of our product portfolio. That being said, we like our product portfolio as it relates to sustainability. We think that we've got the key to more sustainable products with the staple of product segments that we're in today. So we don't see any real need to step out. But anything that we look at will increase -- will be accretive, if you will, to the sustainability profile of our product portfolio. And because for no other reason then, it will lead to better financial outcomes over time and higher returns ultimately. Just really quickly to close off on the Czech plant, we bought a plant which is relatively new, and it was opened right at the outset of the pandemic so it's very low utilization, gives us instant capacity in Central Europe, and it happens to have assets that are easily directed towards some of our priority segments, including coffee and pet care. So it's essentially -- we're essentially buying a plant more so than a business. And we closed on that in early August, and we'll be working over the next couple of years to fill up that site. And if things go well, then we've got optionality to expand the site as well. So pretty excited about that little bolt-on in that part of the world. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions. I will now turn the call back to Ron for closing remarks. Ron Delia : Okay. Thank you, operator. Thanks everybody for joining the call today and your interest in Amcor. We've had a strong year in '22 and we're expecting another strong year in '23 and expecting that the resilient investment case we've built up over the years will be especially compelling in this environment. So thanks again, and we'll close the call there. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Amcor First Quarter 2023 Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Thank you. Tracey Whitehead, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Tracey Whitehead : Thank you, operator, and thank you everyone for joining Amcor's fiscal 2023 first quarter earnings call. Joining today is Ron Delia, Chief Executive Officer and Michael Casamento, Chief Financial Officer. Before I hand over, let me note a few items. On our website, amcor.com, under the Investor section, you'll find today's press release and presentation, which we will discuss on this call. Please be aware that we'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures and related reconciliations can be found in that press release and the presentation. Remarks will also include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions. The second slide in today's presentation lists several factors that could cause future results to be different than current estimates and reference can be made to Amcor SEC filing, including our statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q for further details. Please note that during the question-and-answer session, we request that you limit your question -- yourself to a single question and one follow up, and then rejoin the queue if you have any additional questions. With that, over to you, Ron. Ron Delia : Okay, thanks Tracy. Thanks everyone for joining Michael and myself today to discuss Amcor's first quarter financial results for fiscal 2023. We'll begin with some prepared remarks before opening for Q&A, and I'll start with Slide three, which covers our first and most important value, which is safety. The first quarter showed continued progress on our long term objective of eliminating injuries across our global operations. Our teams are doing a good job proactively identifying and addressing potential risks, and the results are evident with a further 31% reduction in the number of reported injuries globally compared to last year. This good work has also led to a solid increase in the number of our sites that have been injury-free for the past 12 months or more, which stood at 63% at the end of the quarter. Our top priority will always be the well-being of our 44,000 global employees and achieving our goal of zero injuries. Turning to our key messages for today on Slide four, first message to leave you with is the business has delivered another strong quarterly result highlighting the relative stability of our end markets, our relentless focus on recovering higher raw material costs and staying ahead of inflation, and our proactive approach to driving costs out of the business in a volatile and challenging operating environment. The result was another quarter of strong operating leverage with 10% growth and adjusted earnings per share on a comparable constant currency basis. Second, we're confident in our ability to sustain solid organic earnings growth from the underlying business in fiscal '23. We've reaffirmed our guidance ranges for comparable constant currency EPS growth and free cash flow while updating our reported EPS guidance to reflect further strengthening of the US dollar. We assume the macroeconomic environment will remain challenging, however, our continued focus on sustainability, innovation and higher growth, higher value add segments combined with our proactive approach to managing costs, supports our confidence in delivering against our expectations for the year. Third, our attention to sustainability is unwavering. We understand our role in supporting the circular economy and we continue to improve the sustainability profile of our products. And finally, we want to leave you with a good understanding of why we're confident that Amcor's strong resilient business will drive long-term shareholder value creation. Moving to some of the first quarter financial highlights on Slide five. We've had a strong start to the year. On a constant currency basis, net sales growth was 15%, which includes approximately $400 million of price increases related to higher raw material costs. Excluding this pass through impact, organic sales grew 3%, both the flexibles and rigid segments generated price mix benefits and have done an excellent job recovering general inflation of approximately $75 million as a result of non-material costs increasing at double digit rates. Overall volumes were marginally lower, reflecting somewhat softer and variable customer demand through the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, operating leverage was strong with solid top line growth and proactive delivery of cost efficiencies in both businesses, driving EBIT up 9% and adjusted earnings per share up 10%. We continue to expect to deliver strong cash returns to shareholders this fiscal year through approximately $400 million of share repurchases and a growing dividend, which increased to $0.1225 per share this quarter. And our financial profile remains strong with return on average funds employed at 16.5%. We're pleased with our first quarter financial performance and we'll now turn over to Michael to cover more of the specifics, including our fiscal '23 outlook. Michael? Michael Casamento : Thanks, Ron, and hello everyone. Turning to our flexible segment performance on Slide six, our flexibles business had another excellent quarter with all business units delivering solid organic sales growth while executing well on inflation recovery, cost initiatives and mix management. Net sales were up 6% on a reported basis, which includes recoveries of higher raw material costs of approximately $270 million, representing 10% of quarterly sales growth. The teams have continued to successfully manage the pass through of higher raw material costs, and as expected, the related price cost impact on earnings for the quarter was relatively neutral. Excluding the raw material impact organic, revenue growth of 3% was driven by favorable price mix benefits of approximately 4%, partly offset by lower volumes. Some business units experience lower demand in certain categories during the quarter. However, our broad market coverage and geographic diversification limited the overall volume impact. Sales across our combined priority segments grew high single digits for the quarter with healthcare a particular standout delivering, strong sales and volume growth across every region. In our Asian business, overall volumes were higher than the prior year, despite lower volumes in China, which was impacted by ongoing COVID related lockdowns. Adjusted EBIT was up 11% in comparable constant currency terms for the quarter, reflecting overall sales growth, price mix benefits and outstanding cost performance, including quick actions taken to flex the cost base in regions where the operating environment has been more challenged. Adjusted EBIT margin of 12.7% was comparable to last year notwithstanding the 130 basis point dilution related to increased sales dollars associated with passings through high raw material costs. Turning to rigid packaging on Slide seven, the key takeaway for rigids is the business delivered another quarter of solid sales and earnings growth. Reported sales were up 19%, which included the pass through of high raw material cost of approximately $130 million or 17% of sales. Excluding this pass through, organic sales growth of 3% was driven by price mix benefits of 2% and volume growth of 1%. In North America, we had positive product mix in the beverage business with hot fill volumes, up 6% reflecting growth across a range of categories, including sports drinks, juices, and ready to drink teas. From an overall standpoint, beverage volumes were lower than last year, reflecting a decrease in lower value cold fill and preform volumes. In the specialty container business volumes increased mid-single digits led by strength in healthcare, dairy and nutrition markets and in Latin America, volumes were up high single digits with strong performance in key countries such as Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. Adjusted EBIT increased 7% on a comparable constant currency basis, driven by higher overall volumes, strong inflation recovery and continued solid operating and cost performance. EBIT margins were 7%, and over the past several quarters have been negatively impacted by approximately 250 basis points due to a sharp increase in resin pricing being passed through the sales line and significantly increasing sales dollars as a result. In terms of the balance sheet, on Slide eight, we continue to maintain a strong investment grade credit rating, which provides us with flexibility to invest for growth and access to lower cost debt markets across key currencies. Leverage at the end of the quarter was three times and right in line with our expectations for this time of year, given the seasonality of cash flow. And as we highlighted in August, free cash flow was lower than the same quarter last year as we expected. Our cash flow is typically weighted for the second half of the year, and in fiscal 2023, this seasonality will be more pronounced given high raw material costs and the decision to increase inventory levels through last year to offset some of the volatility created by supply constraints. We have reaffirmed our four year cash flow guidance with cranes, which I'll come back to shortly. Notwithstanding the temporary increase in inventory levels, we remain highly focused on working capital performance, which is particularly critical in this inflationary environment, and we've maintained our 12 month average working capital sales ratio at 8%. In August, we announced an incremental investment in EPAC and the purchase of a flexibles plant in the Czech Republic and funded both of those investments in the September quarter for a total of around a 100 million US dollars. And while we did not repurchase any shares during Q1, we continue to expect to allocate approximately $400 million towards share purchases in fiscal '23. Turning now to Amcor's outlook for fiscal '23 on Slide nine, while we expect market conditions to remain challenging through 2023, we have had a strong start to the year and taking into account the relative stability of our end market exposures and our strong track record of consistent execution, we remain confident in our ability to deliver against the outlook we provided in August. We have reaffirmed our expectations for organic growth of 5% to 10% from the underlying business, and a benefit of approximately 2% from share purchases, while continuing to expect an impact from the following three non-operating items. Firstly, a negative impact of approximately 4% from higher interest expense after tax, forward curve expectations have continued to move higher, and interest expense is now expected to be in the range of $240 million to $260 million. Net of our expectations for a slightly lower effective tax rate, we continue to expect a 4% headwind to EPS as we know in August. Second, an estimated 2% negative impact from the scale down and scale of our three plants in Russia, which we continue to expect in the second half of the fiscal year and third, a negative currency translation impact of 5%, which is higher than the 2% we anticipated back in August due to the continued strengthening of the US dollar. As a result of this US dollar strengthening, we are updating our expectations for adjusted EPS on a reported basis to be $0.77 to $0.81 per share. In terms of cash flow, we continue to expect the seasonally stronger second half, and we have reaffirmed our adjusted free cash flow expectations to a range of approximately $1 billion to $1.1 billion. However, the stronger US dollar pushes our current expectation toward the lower end of the range. So in summary, for me today, the business has delivered another strong quarter of organic sales and earnings growth as we remain focused on executing for our customers, managing margins and taking decisive actions to rapidly recover inflation while flexing our cost base. Our ability to successfully balance these priorities supports our confidence in delivering another year of solid underlying growth despite persistent market challenges. And with that, I'll hand back to Ron. Ron Delia : Okay, thanks Michael. Before we open the call to questions, I'd like to cover some of the drivers that inform how we think about our growth over the longer term and are relevant for our fiscal 23 outlook as well. For several periods, we've highlighted multiple commercially oriented drivers that have enabled us to deliver solid and sustainable organic earnings growth over the last three years. These drivers include opportunities and priority segments, emerging markets and innovation, and they've not changed and when combined with our ability to deliver continual cost improvements by leveraging our scale advantages and capabilities, these drivers give us the confidence we'll continue to consistently deliver solid organic earnings growth from the underlying business, even in the face of continued challenging and evolving macroeconomic conditions. Our focus on priority segments, including protein, healthcare, premium coffee, pet food, and hot fill beverages will continue to be a driver of growth and mixed benefits with more than $4 billion in collective annual sales, we have leading positions in each of these large addressable markets that have been growing at higher than market rates for us historically. And over time, we expect they'll continue to grow at mid-single digit rates with higher than average margins. As Michael mentioned, healthcare was a particular standout in the first quarter with strong growth across all regions. Emerging markets also continue to be a focus for Amcor. We have a large scale diversified emerging markets portfolio, which generates annual sales of more than $3 billion, and this is another source of organic growth. And over the long term, we expect these markets collectively we'll continue to grow at mid-single digit rates. In the last quarter, several emerging market countries delivered double digit earnings growth, including India, Brazil, and Mexico. Innovation provides a third opportunity for us to drive growth and value, particularly as customers and consumers focused on the critical need for more sustainable high performance packaging solutions. Amcor has industry leading r and d in material science capabilities and expertise and when coupled with our unmatched scale and geographic reach, these capabilities provide unique ongoing opportunities to develop differentiated products to meet the needs of our customers. For example, we're winning new business by taking fresh protein packaging solutions initially developed by the legacy beams business into the Asia-Pacific market, including modified atmosphere packaging solutions in China and the ecotype high barrier recyclable films in Australia. And a cross-functional and import team came together to partner with Pfizer to develop packaging for the first commercial batches of packs, Levi in the US market. Leveraging technology developed by our teams in Europe and our global footprint, we were able to start production of living and base material at the same time in five Amcor sites across five countries in order to fully meet Pfizer's requirements in one third of the standard lead time. Looking ahead, the strategic choices we've made to focus on these organic growth drivers will guide how we prioritize investments back into the business. We see at a wide range of attractive growth opportunities across each of these areas, and we're actively investing to sustain the organic growth momentum we've built over several years before closing a few words on sustainability. Sustainability is fundamental to everything we do and is deeply embedded in Amcor strategy and risk management framework and the basic start within our own operations. Our 2022 sustainability report will be released in a few weeks and will highlight some of the important progress we've made through the year. This includes reaching a cumulative reduction in greenhouse gas emissions intensity of 35% since the launch of amcos and Bio action program in 2008. A critical journey will continue through our commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. In addition to carbon related objectives, we maintain robust targets for reducing water and waste and achieved significant milestones during the year. A few weeks ago, we also released our first TCFD report highlighting the important work we're doing to help ensure we make the right decisions on climate and packaging sustainability. Turning to Slide 12. We continue to make progress supporting the development of circular systems through the three pillars of our responsible packaging strategy, innovation, infrastructure, and consumer participation. Today, nearly a hundred percent of our rigid and specialty car and packaging portfolios are fully recyclable and in our flexible packaging segment, 83% of our product portfolio is designed to be recycled or has a recycle ready option available for trial. In fiscal '22, we used more than 130,000 metric tons of pcr, up 30% from the prior year, and representing 6% of our total re usage. And we're now building an increasing on our objectives with a new commitment that 30% of our total revenue use will be recycled material by 2030. In one example, to bring this focus on recycled content to life, we've worked closely with monies on the recent launch of packaging for several Cadbury Dairy milk products incorporate incorporating 30% food grade recycled content in both the UK and Australia. This is an important example of how a combination of strong relationships, differentiated capabilities, and a global footprint can translate into volume growth and mixed benefits. For Amcor, we've also continued to collaborate with others to support the development of recycling infrastructure. On October 12th, Amcor was the only packaging company to join 11 brand owners in the consumer goods forum to publicly signal a commitment towards further increasing the use of recycled materials and packaging. Together we express that our common interest in purchasing commercial volumes of chemically recycled plastic and our support for the development of credible, safe, and environmentally sound chemical recycling infrastructure. Our sustainability journey is ongoing and our long term strategy is helping to create a responsible packaging industry for the benefit of Amcor and its customers, but crucially for the environment as well. Turning to Slide 13, we've built a strong foundation to deliver growth and value creation, and we've consistently executed well against our strategy. We don't expect to be immune economic challenges and uncertainties, but we believe we're relatively well positioned with a defensive consumer staples and healthcare focused portfolio in multiple drivers of growth and cost productivity. And our consistently strong cash flow provides the ability to reinvest in the business, to pursue acquisitions or repurchase shares, and to grow the dividend and positions us well to generate strong and consistent value for shareholders over the long term. In summary, on Slide 14, despite a continued challenging economic backdrop, we've had a strong start to the financial year. Our consistent execution has enabled us to deliver solid sales growth and excellent operating leverage, resulting in double digit organic EPS growth. We're confident in our ability to deliver against our outlook for EPS growth and free cash flow, which we've reaffirmed today, and we're executing well to deliver long-term value for shareholders, including by making further progress against our sustainability agenda. And operator, we're ready to open the call for questions Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question comes in a line of Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Your line is open. Ghansham Panjabi : Thank you, operator. Good day everybody. I guess first off, Ron, many consumers stapled to customers of yours are aggressively raising prices and, you know, as a consequence of reporting weaker volumes along with de stalking, which I assume is part of the reason your volumes were sluggish in both segments for the developed markets. How do you sort of see that dynamic evolving as we cycle more fully through into your fiscal year '23? I guess what a customer sharing with you in terms of their own outlook at this point for next year? Ron Delia : Yeah, look, thanks. It's a tough environment out there as you, as you alluded to, you know, we had flat volumes basically across the business and relative to many who've reported, that actually feels like out performance, believe it or not. Things definitely slowed down through the quarter. Certainly through this September, the month of September, things got a bit more bit softer in, in Europe and North America in particular. I think it's a function of the two things you mentioned. One is obviously there is a bit of inventory built up in the supply chain in certain segments, and I think we'll see that come out relatively quickly given that this is fast moving consumer goods that we're talking about. So we don't expect that any inventory impacts on volumes will be long lasting, but I do believe there is some extra inventory in the supply chain. And then secondly, the cumulative effective inflation on the consumer, which eventually will lead to some elasticity. And I think you're hearing that from brand owners we're, we're hearing in directly from them, and I think they're publicly commenting on elasticity maybe being less than expected, but still there is elasticity in many of the categories that we're supplying into. So look, we have a pretty modest expectation for volumes from here for the rest of the fiscal year. Michael will talk more about that, I'm sure, but, you know, our, our guidance includes a range of outcomes and a part of that range is where we end up on volumes. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay, terrific. And then in previous quarters you've called out limitations on certain residents as it relates to availability and all sorts of disruptions and force. Can you just give us an update on that dynamic and some of the volume you've given up in the past as you internalize production and focused on higher mix? Is there an opportunity now to go and recapture that share for the rest of your fiscal year? Ron Delia : Yeah, well, look, I think the -- as far as availability goes, the raw material availability picture has improved. I wouldn't say that it's completely we're completely supplied, but certainly the constraints that we face through much of fiscal '22 many of those have abated. We're, we're down to a much shorter list of constrained raw materials. It probably held back cells more modestly on the first quarter than it, than it impacted us in fiscal '22. But certainly the situation is improving as far as recovery of lost sales. I think in these segments, it's very difficult to expect lost sales to be reclaimed from one period to the next. Again, these fast moving consumer goods. And, you know, if you, if a sale is missed in in one period, it's unlikely the consumer goes back and double purchases in a, in a future quarter. So I think you know, we've got to look forward at this stage. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America. Your line is open. George Staphos : Thanks very much. Hi, everybody. Good day. Thanks for the details. You know, Ron, you know, sticking with this topic that Ghansham teed up, can you talk about to the extent possible, what your customers were saying, where they're seeing the most negative effect from inflation on demand? And in particular, what are you seeing in the protein markets lately? You talk, you know, you talk broadly as you normally do in terms of being a priority area. What are you seeing real time in terms of that market in the first quarter? Ron Delia : Yeah, look, I think, from a -- the first part of your question about where is the demand, I guess the most elastic, where are we seeing it often the most, I would answer the question more geographically than, than at the segment level. I think firstly I would say our healthcare volumes globally have been very, very strong. So that's the other side of the discussion is that healthcare has remained very robust, particularly pharmaceutical packaging. And that's been true everywhere. I think as it relates to food beverage packaging, home and personal care to some extent. Where we've seen the most softness has, has been in the developed markets in Western Europe and in North America. Presumably, you know, that's where the inflation is biting the, the most, I mean, we've got act actually at the moment, more modest inflation in some of the emerging market countries we're participating in. So really where we've seen the most softness and the increasing softness has been in North America and western Europe. And then I guess I would also add China to that list, but we believe that the China softness is primarily a result of the COVID related lockdowns. We believe that based on the patterns across the global footprint or the national footprint we have in China. So I'd answer to the question that from a geographical perspective, more than a segment perspective, and then as it relates to protein, protein is a high priority segment for us. Without question, it's an attractive segment for a lot of reasons, a lot of innovation in that space in particular around the films and materials. And, we had a, a flattish quarter globally across the protein space, so that's not what you'd expect, and it's not what we've experienced over the last several years. We, we would expect mid-single digit mid to high single digit growth in that segment, and we were, we were more, more or less flat for the quarter. George Staphos : Thanks, Ron. And my follow on, just as we peer into the beverage business you saw very, very good bus trends in your higher margin areas, which it would be sort of counterintuitive with a consumer being pinched by inflation relative to would be the lower margin areas, which were actually weaker? Yeah, if you could talk to that, that'd be great. Thanks, and good luck in the quarter. Ron Delia : Yeah, thanks, George. No, it's a good observation and it's a good insight. I would, I would agree with your insight there that generally speaking the hot fill space is, is a space where there are more premium beverages being sold. A lot of that goes through the convenience channel. I think what we're seeing there, to some extent is function of our customer mix. It's a function of new product introductions. Some segments actually held up pretty well through the quarter as, as whole segments ready to drink teas sports drinks to some extent some of the hot filled juices. But I also think its 90 days, and I think in a 90-day period, you, you have distortions that relate to inventories and different customer performance. So I'm not sure I would read too much into that, other than our hot fill volumes have continued to grow at attractive rates. And it's one of the reasons we've prioritized that segment. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jakob Cakarnis from Jarden Australia. Your line is open. Jakob Cakarnis : Hi Ron. Hi Michael. Michael, can I just get you to give us a sense of where that inventory is at the moment in both a units and value perspective? Just noting, obviously it continues to build alongside the inflation. Just want to get a sense of how clean that might be given the volume outlook that we've just spoken to. Ron Delia : Yeah, that from Doug, as we said, I think we were, we were expecting, or we have been holding higher imagery levels or building higher energy levels, really as a, a contingency against the supply constraints that we've been experiencing for the last 12 months. And we guided back in August that we didn't expect that to come out of the system in q1, which it didn't, and we saw, we saw you know cash outflow as a result of that. As we look forward we'd expect, into Q2, things are going to stabilize. And then as we head into H2, we should start to see inventories come off you know, out of the system. And it's a combination of both volumes and value. I'd say the split, if I look year-over-year, it's probably 40% relates to volume and 60% is, is relating to the higher prices year on year. So you know, as we, as we look forward to the end of June part of our cash flow guidance includes a pretty neutral position in terms of working capital year over year. So we we're expecting working capital to be relatively flat versus the prior year where we had an outflow of 150 million. And that's largely on the back of that, that reversal in the inventory side in that helping us guide to that one to 1.1 billion in cash. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Keith Chau from MST Marquee. Your line is open. Keith Chau : Good gentlemen thanks for taking my question. The first one even for Ronald or Michael, could you be a bit more explicit about the raw materials benefit that you may receive given your coming off a price cost like neutral scenario in the first quarter? Just wondering if you could help us quantify what the potential benefit could be for the remainder of the year. And, you know, given there could be potential benefits, does that imply the volume outlook is probably more for more softness, And again, if you could be more explicit as to what the volume direction is and quantum for the full year, what your expectations are, that would be fantastic. Thank you. Ron Delia : Yeah, Keith, I'll touch on volume and then Michael can talk about the, the raw material side. I, I think they, I think to be very plain spoken about it, we do expect soft volumes the rest of the year. I mean, I think that's the cautious, more conservative approach to take. I think you can tell by the operating leverage we got in the first quarter, we've been really proactive at getting after cost. You know, cost performance in the operations in both segments was really strong in the first quarter, and we will continue to be strong, and that's because we expect a pretty soft volume environment, which I think is very consistent with what everyone else in our, in our value chain is experiencing as well, but maybe on the, on the raw material side? Michael Casamento : Yeah, no, it's on the raw material side cases, as you know, throughout FY 22, we've pretty much over the last two years really, we've pretty much had a, a manage manageable headwind on the, on the price cost lag in recovering raw material. As we exited, FY '22, we were getting to a more neutral position, and in Q1 we were relatively neutral. As we called out, as we look forward into Q2 we, we are expecting a, a modest tailwind on raw materials and, you know, as you know, we buy a basket of raw materials across the globe, and, and so they can move at different times, but based on what we see today, we'd expect some tailwind in Q2. And as we look into the, further out into the year, it's really volatile environment and difficult to say, but, in terms of our guidance, the 5% to 10% underlying performance you know, that takes into a can of range of factors around the raw material pricing. So, to get to the upper end, that would mean raw materials come off faster and we get, we get a bigger tailwind as we head into the second half you know, at the lower end of the range, obviously raw material spike again. But we'll see -- we'll see how things turn out as we head into, into Q3. Keith Chau : Michael, can I just quickly follow on with that? So you've got inventories from a volume perspective quite significantly high. So 40% of the total uplift, if you're winding back those inventories going into the balance of the year, what type of operating inefficiencies are we likely to see given you've had a period of actually efficiency benefit as you've ramped up inventory? So are we, should we expect a margin impact as you wind back those? Michael Casamento : Well, a lot of the inventory is raw material inventory. Ron Delia : Yeah, it's raw, it's raw material, Keith. So, so in that respect, I mean, it's going to flow through get passed through to the customer. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Kyle White from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Kyle White : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go to the beverage volumes down 3% in North America. I know it may be a little bit difficult to say, but is do you think that's a function of some of the destocking that we've been talking about, or is that more longer lasting volume weakness with customers choosing value over volume and, and the inflationary pressures impacting consumer demand? Ron Delia : Oh, look, it'd be really hard to read anything into the last 90 days. That's, that's long term to be honest, Kyle, I think there's been so much volatility and the volumes through the quarter were quite volatile. So I, I think there's a bit of destocking in there. I think, I'm sure when the dust settles, we'll see some, some shift towards, towards volume over value or toward, towards big packs. I mean, I think that's likely if we hit real soft economic patch, but I think in the first 90 days it's a function of inventories in the chain, it's customer mix. It's a number of different factors. Kyle White : Got it. And then you touched on it a little bit earlier, but I think the volume challenge in the fast moving good space, it's understood. But can you touch on what you're seeing in the healthcare space more specifically and how that trended through the quarter? And do you anticipate any challenges to, to volumes here from some of the economic challenges as well as the inflationary environment we have? Ron Delia : Yeah, look, I think healthcare was a real powerhouse for us in the quarter, and it was very consistent through the quarter. So we had high single digit volume growth across the global healthcare business. And that was -- that was consistent by month and it was consistent by region, and we would expect that to continue. I think you might recall that this segment is a mid-single digit grower for us over a long period of time. We had a little bit of a rough patch during COVID when there were less elective procedures and me medical procedures, less prescriptions written, etcetera. I think we're sort of back to roughly where we were pre-COVID and we would expect that business to continue to grow. We've put some investments on the -- into place, which we've yet to really see the benefits of, but that will also help propel the volumes going forward. We've got a new healthcare plant in Southeast Asia. We've got extension of a facility in Ireland as a number of film assets we've put into that business. And we expect that those will help power the business going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Adam Samuelson : Yeah, thanks. Good evening everyone. I guess I wanted to ask, just to be clear, in the five to 10% organic EBIT growth in for fiscal 23, what are the assumed volumes in, in in that, in that range and, and I guess associated with that the strong mix and non-resin price that you generated in the flexibles business in the quarter. Just do you see that level of mix potentially persisting through the year especially as raw material availability starts to improve, which I believe had constrained or had been created a mixed benefit for you because you were prioritizing certain market segments last year? Thank you. Michael Casamento : Yes. Thanks, Adam, for the question. Look, in terms of our guidance, obviously, we've got a range of outcomes in the 5% to 10%. I mean the base assumption is that volumes are going to be fairly modest. We're not expecting any major volume growth. Clearly, in the first quarter, we were flat and market conditions are pretty tight and tough out there. So where we are focused, obviously, is continuing to drive the business to recover inflation and the raw material costs and actively taking cost out of the business, which also supported the result in the quarter as well as strong mix through continued innovation and mix management driving the focus segments and the like. So in that 5% to 10%, clearly, there's a range of outcomes. If we do better on the volume side in some of the focus segments, then we'll potentially have better mix and end at the higher end of the range. if you see more recessionary impacts and softer consumer demand, that could drive us to the lower end of the range. Obviously, raw material prices, as I touched on earlier, can impact as well. So inflation is the other big one. We did well in the quarter to recover inflation through price and mix. And we are expecting more inflation as we head through the year and expect to recover that. But that's another factor that could drive a range of outcomes in that guidance. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Kang from CLSA. Your line is open. Daniel Kang : So just a question on the Russian process. Can you talk us through how it's progressing? I noticed that some of your peers have achieved a better outcome than expected. Ron Delia : Well, look, we're trying to exit in an orderly way. Just for context, we have 3 factories in Russia. Collectively, they've generated about 2% or 3% of sales over the last several years, about 4% to 5% of EBIT. We announced in August that we're pursuing the sale of those 3 factories. We said at the time we're going to pursue an orderly exit, meaning that we're going to look to preserve value for shareholders as well. So we're running what you -- to the extent you could call it a typical M&A process in that environment, that's what we're doing. And there's been a reasonable degree of interest. So we're still optimistic the process will run its course and complete sometime in the second half of this fiscal year. Daniel Kang : Great, Ron. And the proceeds would just go to debt repayment, I'm presuming? Ron Delia : Yes. Look, I think we'll deal with that when the time comes. I mean we are repurchasing shares this year. We've spent about $100 million in the first quarter on acquisitions. We'll continue to look for further acquisitions. So I think we'll see where we get to. But as a general rule, we're not of the view that paying down debt is going to be a very value-creating use of cash right at the moment, even with interest rates elevated from where they were a year ago. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Your line is open. Anthony Pettinari : Just following up on Dan's question, can you talk about ability and willingness to pursue M&A in fiscal '23 in what's probably going to be a tougher macro environment? You had a peer that announced a large acquisition today. And then in that context, maybe you could talk a little bit more about ePAC. Ron Delia : Yes. Well, look, I'd say the ability and the willingness are both high. But it always takes two to tango in an M&A situation. And we're actively pursuing deals. I mean that's part of our formula and has been for a long time. We think there are good bolt-on opportunities across our portfolio. I think what I would say is you can safely assume that anything that's in the market, in the packaging space or at least in our segments, we're having a look at and a close look at. So the appetite is there. The willingness is there. The balance sheet and cash flow are there. We're pretty clear on our strategy in terms of the segments we want to grow in, the geographies we want to grow in. So we'd like to try to be active. In some respects, a tough macroeconomic backdrop might not be the worst context, the worst setting for us. If you go back over a number of years, we've tended to be more active when asset prices were more modest or at least more in line with long-term trends. And we're going to remain disciplined and actually hope that's the case in this cycle. ePAC, just quickly on ePAC, it's more of a corporate venturing type investment. So we've got a minority stake. We've put some more money into it but it's still a minority position in a start-up -- relative new startup called ePAC, which has been around about five or six years. It's a digitally enabled flexible packaging company. They essentially rely on digital printing. The whole process is digitized. And it's a really exciting opportunity. It's a business that's targeting small and actually micro customers with quick lead times and very responsive service model. And it's been growing really almost by triple digits over the last five or six years. So we're pretty excited about that business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Richard Johnson from Jefferies. Your line is open. Richard Johnson : Just a question on Russia, if I may, please. I noticed you've got a $90-odd million restructuring program related to the sale of the three plants. Just intuitively, that feels like a very high number. And I was just wondering if you could help me understand what's behind it. Michael Casamento : Richard, that was just the impairment that we took back in -- well, at June 30 year-end, when we noted the asset as held for sale. So we had to impair the asset to an estimated book value -- market value. And so that was the adjustment for that one. Richard Johnson : Yes. But if you break down that $200 million, Michael, you talk about $62 million and restructuring costs was a further $30 million to go this year. So it's really that bit I'm trying to understand what that is. Michael Casamento : Right. Yes. Well, part of that was the -- we've obviously got to close the Ukraine and close that piece out. And then to relocate part of the business out of Russia, rightsize the footprint in Europe and also SG&A restructuring as well to help to mitigate the lost earnings from the Russian business, which we feel that we're taking a lot of action in that front to help recover some of that 4% to 5% in EBIT that we're going to end up losing as we go through the sale. Richard Johnson : And while you're on the line, just on the interest charge, very helpful guidance you've given. I was just trying to get a sense of what that number would be on a constant FX basis. Michael Casamento : It's pretty similar, Richard. It's not a material movement on that front. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde from BMO. Your line is open. Mark Wilde : Michael, along the same lines, what's the -- what's your breakout just fixed and floating on the debt? Michael Casamento : Yes. Look, the fixed and floating piece at the end of September was 50-50 fixed and floating. Since that time, we have taken some fixed rate swaps. And so we're -- today, we stand around about 65% fixed versus 35% floating. Mark Wilde : Okay. All right. And then, Ron, I'm just curious, what would you say the 3 biggest challenges are for you at the moment? Ron Delia : I think making sure that the teams stay focused on trying to drive growth in the segments that we've nominated as areas we want to grow and at the same time, being out there and really aggressively focusing on recovering inflation. I think that's the key. I think -- there's one other one I'll come to. But I think, generally speaking, we're trying to do two things at the same time, which you could consider to be contradictory. We're trying to grow the business and generate momentum on the top line. And we feel like we've never had more tools at our disposal to do that. And we're investing more CapEx and more R&D, et cetera, et cetera. But at the same time, we've got to be out front of inflation. And so just trying to manage that message internally and managing the balance between those two things is the real challenge. And then the second thing is just -- there's just been a lot of exogenous factors out in the operating environment over the last several years, starting with the pandemic and then the supply chain disruptions and then in the parts of the business impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. There's been a lot of different exogenous factors out there. And so I just want to make sure people have energy and they're renewed and they're pumped up and fired up to come to work every day. I think that's not an insignificant challenge when there's so many different things being thrown at them. They really have nothing to do with the base business of selling packaging. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Larry Gandler from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Larry Gandler : Just in terms of your cash flow guidance, do you need to take further price increases from here to expand that tailwind of price cost lag? Michael Casamento : Look, Larry, we're -- obviously, you're cycling through a kind of 12-month period. So we -- there will be still some further increase in pricing on the raw material side. We'll see how that plays out into the second half. But I would still be expecting some further increase as we roll through the year. Larry Gandler : That's further price increases that you guys take as opposed to cost increases, just to be clear. Michael Casamento : Yes. Larry Gandler : Yes. Okay. And I don't know, Mike or Ron, if you could just talk to the pet food category, maybe in Europe and U.S., how that played out over the last quarter and maybe recent trends? Ron Delia : Yes. Look, it's been a solid segment for us in terms of growth and margin as the pet food segment generally has premiumized or humanized, you'll hear the two words used to describe that segment. We transitioned over in many number of years from primarily dry pet food and bulk to essentially almost single-serve pet food in smaller pouches. And we benefited a lot from the increased packaging intensity and that segment is increasing sustainability requirements of that sort of packaging. And one of our innovation platforms, AmLite, is directed squarely at that segment in partnership with some of our big customers. So it's a pretty exciting space and there's a lot of innovation brought to the market, both by the brand owners and by us as a packaging supplier. And it's been a mid-single-digit sort of growth segment for us. The first quarter, quite frankly, was flat. We were pretty much flat globally. The Russian -- Eastern European sales were soft. We had some growth offsetting that elsewhere. So all up, we were more or less flat for the quarter. But we don't see any signs or cause for concern around the secular trends that have made it such an attractive segment going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Reilly from UBS. Nathan Reilly : Ron, a quick one. Just are you achieving any manufacturing efficiencies in the plants, just as raw material availability starts to improve some of those supply chain challenges start to stabilize? I'd also appreciate a bit of color on labor just in terms of cost and availability and just an idea of how that's all washing through your organic growth guidance. Ron Delia : Yes. Look, it's a good question. We're really pleased with the plant performance. So firstly, in terms of the availability of the imports, as I noted earlier, the raw material availability has improved. There are still some specialty materials that are in short supply, and I think that's going to continue for a while. But many of the constraints and bottlenecks we were dealing with over the last 12 to 18 months have abated. So that situation has improved. And generally speaking, the labor availability has improved across the network. Certainly, this time last year or even the earlier part of calendar '22, we had some real labor challenges, especially in North America and in Europe as COVID spikes rolled through those regions. That seems to be behind us at the moment. And we've not had real labor constraints for some time. So I think from a factor availability or input availability, the plants have been able to run more unencumbered. And then I think as far as the productivity and the efficiencies, we're really pleased. We think that's one of the highlights of the first quarter. If you look at our 9% EBIT growth, we'd say probably about 1/3 of that came from price and mix but two third of it came from the cost performance in the plants. And so that's where we got the operating leverage to turn really flat volumes, actually modestly down volumes into 10% EPS growth. So we're pretty pleased with the way the plants are performing. And it's important because we're going to need them going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brook Campbell-Crawford from Barrenjoey. Brook Campbell-Crawford: Just to follow up on an earlier comment around the restructuring in Europe. Are you able just to confirm, is the plan actually to close plants in Europe going forward? Or is it -- is this provision that was taken, I guess, 3 months ago now more relating to the closure of Russia and you're not actually planning to close plants in Europe? Ron Delia : Yes. Look, just to put some context on that, as I said, the Russian business is about 4% to 5% of global EBIT. Within Europe, it's obviously a much higher percentage. So we've got an -- we're going to sell that business and we're going to lose those earnings. We've got an obligation to try to protect the income statement and generate profit where we can. And so we're going to -- we're going to take some cost out. We're going to rightsize the part of the business that was most directly affected. So some of that cost is related, as Michael said, to just the transition of winding down operations in the Ukraine and migrating certain business out of the Russian plants that can be repatriated into other plants in the European network that will -- that's part of where that cost is going. There'll be some overhead reductions because we'll be operating a smaller business. And there may be a plant closure to be determined, but we haven't come to that conclusion yet. Brook Campbell-Crawford: Okay. Great. And I guess the free cash flow guidance this year is unchanged. But what's the expectation at this point for the cash significant items that, of course, sort of falls outside of that $1 billion to $1.1 billion guidance range? Michael Casamento : Yes. Look, it's a relatively smaller amount, maybe $20 million to $30 million. It's not significant. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of John Purtell from Macquarie. John Purtell : Just picking up on a couple of the recent questions. Coming back to you mentioned sort of protein volumes were flat in the quarter and pet foods flat as well and coffee was back a little bit. I appreciate it's only a quarter, but was that sort of destocking driving that sort of flatness? Or is there -- I know you sort of haven't seen -- or haven't called out a sort of material COVID benefit overall in recent years. But we have seen obviously strong coffee and pet food volumes over the last couple of years. So is there a little bit of a cycling effect there from that? Just trying to sort of understand that a bit more. Ron Delia : It's really hard to say. The only segment where you feel like there's more inventory and maybe got a little bit of a bump in hindsight is the coffee space. We do -- primarily our coffee business now is primarily single serve and systems -- coffee systems, which -- this is more intuitive or hypothesis than it is borne out by facts. But intuitively, more at-home consumption -- more people at home would have driven more at-home consumption of single-serve coffee and coffee system sales pods and the like. And so we may be seeing a little bit of the unwind of that. But I think the more important thing is that long term, these segments, the secular tailwinds that relate to greater packaging intensity to provide the consumer the convenience and functionality that they're now used to. And so we continue to be bullish on these segments over the medium to longer term. John Purtell : And look, in terms of the final question, sorry, I'm going to ask probably 2-in-1 here. But in terms of if we do see consumers trade down, Amcor's exposure to big brands versus home brands. Historically, you've had a pretty balanced exposure. So you pick up some home brand spend if that indeed does transition. And so the second part is we've talked obviously a lot about sustainability products in recent years. Are we now at a point where you're starting to see those new products really move the needle and make a material contribution to price and mix? Ron Delia : Yes. Look, on the private label versus branded mix, our mix kind of looks like the market. I think you have to get to the segment level. And certain segments have much higher penetration of private label than others and our mix kind of reflects that. And so I would say there's not a whole lot there in terms of what the impact will be as consumers shift potentially to private label from branded goods. On the sustainability platforms, look, we are starting to see some traction. The sales are in the tens of millions of dollars now, which is growing off a low base. So this is sales of the platforms that we talked about before, the AmPrima and AmFiber and AmLite and Sky. So we're starting to get there. I think it's just all part of the formula of continually driving mix benefits and margin expansion off of the organic volumes of the business. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Ron Delia for some closing remarks. Ron Delia : Okay. Thanks, operator. Thanks very much for your interest in Amcor today. We feel like we had a good strong start to the fiscal year. And we're maintaining our expectations for the performance of the base business for the rest of fiscal '23. And we look forward to continue to provide updates along the way. Thanks very much. And with that, operator, we'll end the call. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] In the interest of time, we would like to remind participants to limit your questions to one and rejoin the queue for any follow-ups. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tracey Whitehead, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Tracey Whitehead : Thank you, operator, And thank you, everyone, for joining Amcor's Fiscal '23 first half earnings call. Joining today is Ron Delia, Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Casamento, Chief Financial Officer. Before I hand over, let me note a few items. On our website, amcor.com, under the Investors section, you'll find today's press release and presentation, which we'll discuss on the call. Please be aware that we'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures and related reconciliations can be found in the press release and the presentation. Remarks will also include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions. The second slide in today's presentation with several factors that could cause future results to be different than current estimates.

Please note that during the question-and-answer session, we request that you limit yourself to a single question and one follow-up and then rejoin the queue if you have additional questions. With that, over to you, Ron. Ron Delia : Thanks, Tracey. And thanks, everyone, for joining Michael and myself today to discuss Amcor's first half financial results for fiscal 2023. We'll begin with some prepared remarks before opening for Q&A. And I'll start with Slide 3, which covers our first and most important value, safety. Safety is deeply embedded in Amcor's culture, and our management teams understand our collective responsibility to provide a safe and healthy working environment. Our dedication to eliminating injuries in the workplace continues to result in industry-leading metrics. In our first half, we improved further and made great progress with a 24% reduction in the number of injuries globally compared to last year. And 65% of our global sites have been injury-free for the past 12 months, with more than 30% injury-free for three years or more. Safety and a culture of caring for our people will always be our highest priority. Turning to our key messages for today on Slide 4. First, the business delivered a strong first half and second quarter despite ongoing challenges in the macroeconomic environment. Our teams are doing an excellent job driving value for customers while managing the many aspects of the business under their control. We've increased our focus on flexing costs as demand evolved, and we're proactively taking actions to drive further efficiency and productivity improvements while recovering general inflation and passing through higher raw material costs. The outcome was strong operating leverage, with an 8% increase in both EBIT and adjusted EPS in the first half on a comparable constant currency basis. Second, although not entirely immune in a weakening demand environment, our business remains resilient. 95% of our portfolio is exposed to consumer staples and health care end markets, which combined with our broad geographic footprint, positions us well through economic cycles. Our volume performance through the first half demonstrates that resilience and compares favorably to the mid-single-digit or higher declines reported by others in our value chain. Third, a solid first half, strong execution and a resilient portfolio gives us the confidence to reaffirm our guidance ranges for fiscal '23. We're confident in the ability of our teams to continue focusing on the controllables. However, we're also mindful that through the second quarter, the demand environment softened and became increasingly volatile. We expect this will continue in the near term. And as we enter the second half of the fiscal year, we're more cautious in relation to the demand outlook, and we currently expect to be toward the lower end of our EPS guidance range. And our final and most important key message is that we remain focused on executing against our strategy for long-term growth. The business generates significant annual cash flow, which allows us to invest in organic growth opportunities, pursue acquisitions, pay an attractive and growing dividend and regularly repurchase shares. We're confident in the strength of our underlying business, execution capabilities and capital allocation framework, all of which support our compelling investment case. Moving to a few financial highlights on Slide 5. First half reported net sales were up 6%, which includes approximately $670 million of price increases related to higher raw material costs. Excluding this impact, organic sales were up 2% on a constant currency basis, and volumes were 1% lower. Both the Flexibles and Rigid segments did an excellent job driving price and mix benefits, including recovering around $160 million of general inflation. We're making good progress on our commercial and strategic agenda and with our priority segments continuing to deliver high single-digit organic growth and several of our emerging markets businesses also growing at high single-digit rates in line with long-term trends. Positive price/mix performance more than offset modestly lower overall volumes, which reflected generally softer and more volatile demand as well as customer destocking in parts of the business. Operating leverage was strong as we continue to increase our focus on costs, and the business delivered an 8% increase in both adjusted EBIT and EPS for the first half. Looking at our December quarter financial performance. Reported net sales growth was 4% and 1% on an organic basis. Adjusted EBIT and EPS each grew 7%. So another solid quarter highlighting the benefits of geographic diversification and exposure to more defensive end markets even as we experienced softer demand. Through the first half, Amcor returned approximately $400 million of cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. And today, we've increased our planned repurchases for fiscal '23 by up to $100 million. Our overall financial profile remains robust with return on average funds employed at 17%. We're pleased with our first half and our December quarter financial performance, and I'll now turn it over to Michael to cover more of the specifics. Michael Casamento : Thanks, Ron, and beginning with the Flexibles segment on Slide 6. The business performed well in the face of challenging macroeconomic conditions, executing to recover higher raw material costs, manage general inflation, improved cost performance and deliver solid mix benefits. Reported first half sales grew 5%, which included recovery of higher raw material costs of approximately $460 million, representing 9% of growth. Our teams continue to do an excellent job passing on increases in commodity costs. And as expected, the related price cost impact on earnings for the second quarter was modestly positive after being neutral in Q1. Excluding the raw material impact and negative currency movements, sales grew 3% for both the first half and December quarter, driven by favorable price mix benefits of 4%, partly offset by modestly lower volumes. As Ron mentioned, sales across our higher-value priority segments, which include health care, pet care and protein, remained strong, collectively growing at high single-digit rates through the first half and contributing to positive price/mix. We also continued to see strong growth in our businesses in India and Southeast Asia, particularly in health care and media end markets. This helped limit the impact of lower volumes in some business units across categories, including coffee, dairy, condiments, confectionery and home and personal care, where we have seen varying degrees of customer destocking or lower demand. Volumes were lower in China due to COVID-related lockdowns and in Latin America, where inflationary pressures unfavorably impacted demand in several countries. In terms of earnings for Flexibles, we again demonstrated strong operating leverage. Adjusted EBIT grew of 8% for the half reflects ongoing price mix benefits and favorable cost performance. Margins remained strong at 12.6% despite the 120-basis-point dilution related to increased sales dollars associated with passing through higher raw material costs. Turning to Rigid Packaging on Slide 7. The business built on its first quarter performance with another solid -- another quarter of solid earnings growth. First half sales increased by 12% on a reported basis, which included approximately $210 million or 13% of sales related to the pass-through of higher raw material costs. Organic sales declined by 1% for the half, reflecting 2% lower volumes, partly offset by a 1% price/mix benefit. Looking at the December quarter, overall volumes declined by 5%, with the beverage business in North America and Latin America impacted by lower consumer demand and customer destocking. In North America, first half beverage volumes were down 5%. This included hot fill container volumes, which increased 2% in the half but were down 2% in the December quarter, which was in line with market. Cold fills were lower in the half and quarter due to a combination of lower consumer demand and customer destocking. In Latin America, volumes were marginally higher for the first half with growth in Mexico and Argentina offset by lower volumes in Brazil. Consistent with what we saw in the Flexibles segment, the December quarter was unfavorably impacted by softer consumer demand in the region. The Specialty Containers business delivered good performance with solid volume growth from health care, dairy and nutrition end markets. And overall adjusted EBIT for the Rigid segment in the first half increased 7% on a comparable constant currency basis with our teams being able to adjust to evolving market conditions and improve operating cost performance. Moving to cash on the balance sheet on Slide 8, we had a strong sequential improvement in adjusted free cash flow, which came in at $338 million for the December quarter, in line with last year. For the half year, cash outflow of $61 million was lower than last year, largely reflecting the unfavorable impact on the working capital cycle related to higher levels of inventory and higher raw material costs. These impacts also make our cash flow seasonality, which is typically weighted to the second half of the year, more pronounced for fiscal '23. Our financial profile remains strong with leverage at 2.8x on a trailing 12-month EBITDA basis. This is in line with our expectations for this time of year given the seasonality of cash flows and the receipt of proceeds from the Russia business sale. We repurchased $40 million worth of shares in the December quarter and expect to repurchase up to $500 million in total through the 2023 fiscal year. Prior to turning to our outlook, I wanted to provide a few more comments about the completed sale of our Russian business. We received sale proceeds of $365 million, in addition to $65 million of cash which was repatriated upon completion. In terms of the use of total proceeds received, we expect to do three things. First, we will invest approximately $120 million in a range of cost-saving initiatives across the business to partly offset divested earnings. This is in addition to approximately $50 million of cash we allocated back in August for similar initiatives. Second, we plan to allocate up to $100 million for additional share repurchases. And finally, the balance is expected to be used to reduce net debt in proportion with divested EBITDA, maintaining our leverage ratio. Taking us to the outlook on Slide 9, we are maintaining our guidance range for adjusted EPS of $0.77 to $0.81 per share, assuming current foreign exchange rates prevail through the balance of the year. As Ron mentioned, while we are taking aggressive action now to flex the cost base across the business, we expect the environment will remain volatile in the near term. And entering the second half of the fiscal year, we are more cautious in relation to the demand outlook and currently expect to be towards the lower end of our EPS guidance range. Our earnings bridge on this slide lays out the elements underlying our expectations. We expect earnings growth of approximately 3% to 8% on a comparable constant currency basis to be comprised of approximately 5% to 10% growth from the underlying business and a benefit of approximately 2% from share repurchases. This will be partly offset by a negative impact of approximately 4% related to higher estimated interest and tax expense. Our effective tax rate for 2023 is expected to be lower than last year in the 18% to 19% range. However, the year-over-year benefit this provides is more than offset by higher interest expense. Now that we have clarity on the timing of the sale, we expect a negative impact of approximately 3% related to the divestiture of our three plants in Russia. In addition, the U.S. dollar has weakened since our last update, and we now expect a negative impact of approximately 4% from currency translation movements. We are also reaffirming our adjusted free cash flow range for the year of $1 billion to $1.1 billion, although likely towards the lower end of the range, as noted on last quarter's call. So in summary from me today, the business has delivered another solid result, and we remain focused on supporting our customers and taking actions to continue recovering inflation and flex the cost base. Balancing these priorities will leave our business well positioned as we navigate through higher-than-usual volatility in demand and macroeconomic challenges in the near term. With that, I'll hand back to Ron. Ron Delia : Thank you, Michael. And in previous quarters, we've highlighted multiple drivers of organic growth, which you see on Slide 10, and include priority segments, emerging markets and innovation. Before we open the line to questions, I want to just take a few minutes to talk about one of our most important priority segments, which is health care. An overview of our global health care packaging business is shown on Slide 11. With more than $1.8 billion in annual sales in fiscal '22, our portfolio covers both Flexible and Rigid Packaging formats and is evenly split between medical device and pharmaceutical packaging. This is a truly global business with global customers and globally recognized products and technology platforms and it's one where we have scale in every region, including in emerging markets. This is not an easy market to enter because health care packaging is also highly complex with many functional demands, quality standards and regulatory requirements. This complexity provides ample opportunities to differentiate and add value through our industry-leading product innovation, material science and global regulatory capabilities and makes health care a strong contributor to Amcor's growth profile from both a volume and mix standpoint. It also supports strong collaboration with customers, leading to a book of business that tends to be more consistent over the medium and longer term. Moving to Slide 12. Globally, health care packaging is a substantial market with significant headroom and growing at mid-single-digit rates over time, and we're investing to capture more of that growth. As an example, in the December quarter, we localized thermoforming production in Europe at our medical packaging site in Sligo, Ireland. This is an exciting project that leverage the experience and technical know-how of our sites in Minnesota and Puerto Rico. As a result, our European business and customer base will now benefit from local access to a broader range of specialized health care packaging solutions. In another organic growth example, we opened a world-class dedicated health care greenfield plant in Singapore at the end of calendar 2021, enhancing our ability to serve the rapidly growing Asian market. M&A also plays a role in supplementing organic growth in this segment. A few weeks ago, when we announced the acquisition of Shanghai-based MDK, a leading provider of medical device packaging in the China market, this is a great acquisition that enhances our leading position in the broader Asia Pacific medical packaging market by adding product capabilities and a complementary customer base. Drilling down a little more on sustainability and moving on to Slide 13. Across all substrates and end markets, the sustainability of packaging solutions continues to be a critical consideration for customers, consumers and regulators. Our collective objective is to create a truly circular economy for the packaging industry. And the solution is responsible packaging, including package design, infrastructure development and consumer participation. In terms of package design, Amcor is well positioned as a leader in the industry. Today, nearly 100% of our rigid packaging and specialty cartons products and more than 80% of our flexibles products are designed to be recycled or have a recycle-ready alternative. This matters because as deadlines to meet previously established goals rapidly approach, customers are increasingly adopting more sustainable solutions. As an example, this quarter, Mars adopted AmFiber performance paper for part of their confectionery range in the Australian market, and Ferrero Rocher launched an AmFiber pilot in the European market. These two companies joined Nestle, who initiated a global transition to paper-based packaging for one of their core brands in 2022 and are now adding a pilot for the KitKat brand. We've also seen important progress in the development of the infrastructure and technology required to produce recycled materials. While the use of food-grade recycled PET is growing rapidly, including in our rigid packaging business, the ability to produce recycled content for and from flexible packaging will be a critical ingredient to creating circularity. Significant strides are being made in advanced recycling technologies, which enable use of recycled content and flexible packaging applications where mechanically recycled material may present regulatory or technical challenges. To meet ongoing demand for more recycled material and to support infrastructure and technology development, Amcor continues to increase our long-term off-take commitments. In December, we announced a five-year extension of our partnership with ExxonMobil to purchase certified circular polyethylene, giving us line of sight to significant quantities of recycled material that can be used in health care and food-grade packaging applications. We also recently announced a partnership with Licella to further explore an investment in one of Australia's first advanced recycling facilities. These agreements provide another point of differentiation and value, which can be applied across all end markets for customers like Mondelez, who've incorporated 30% advanced recycled material into their packaging for the Cadbury Dairy Milk brand in the U.K. and Australia. These capabilities also position Amcor to meet the sustainability goals we share with our customers and to contribute to a truly circular economy for the packaging industry. Turning to Slide 14. The opportunities and investments I've outlined today in our health care business, our innovation across a range of substrates and our increasing access to advanced recycled materials are just a few examples of the initiatives we have underway, giving us confidence that we have built and continue to build a strong foundation for growth and value creation. We don't expect to be immune to macroeconomic challenges, but we believe we're well positioned with a resilient portfolio and multiple drivers of growth, including cost productivity. Additionally, our consistently strong cash flow provides the ability to reinvest in the business, to pursue acquisitions, repurchase shares and grow the dividend, all of which positions us well to generate strong and consistent value for shareholders over the long term. And finally, in summary, on Slide 15, we've delivered a strong first half in a macroeconomic environment that remains challenging. We're more cautious on the demand environment entering the second half, but our portfolio leaves us well positioned. And most importantly, we remain focused on executing against our strategies for long-term growth. Operator, with those opening remarks, we're now ready to open the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Anthony Pettinari : Ron, a lot of CPG companies and packagers have talked about a drop in December volumes, but kind of a meaningful improvement and maybe a strong start in January. Just wondering, have you seen this? Or did you see kind of December weakness continue into January? I'm just trying to square what sounds like maybe a weaker view on fiscal second half demand. And then maybe specifically, you talked about restocking and lower demand for Rigids. I'm just wondering where you think restocking stands now. Ron Delia : Yes. Sure. Thanks for the questions, Anthony. Look, maybe I'll just back up a step and talk about the chronology of volumes that we saw through the second quarter. Very much a mixed picture in October and November, depending on the business and the geography, the story was relatively mixed. But across the business, our volumes were relatively flat in those two months. December, we definitely saw things softened. We had volumes across the group down mid-single digits. I think that's a function of softening demand but also destocking in a number of segments. We know that because customers took more shutdowns than normal and longer shutdowns than normal. As we worked our way into January, we did see some improvement. I'm not sure that we would call it a trend, but we definitely saw some improvement in January, albeit mixed. And so, the word I would use with regard to our outlook is cautious and it's caution around this demand outlook from here given the volatility, which really had swung quite considerably from month to month and almost week to week. I'd say that despite the improvements in January, we just remain cautious on the demand side of the equation. As it relates specifically to Rigids and destocking, I think it's clear there has been some destocking in that -- in the beverage segment in North America and also Latin America to a certain extent. We have also seen demand soft generally. If you look at the scanner data for the quarter, the market generally in North America for beverages was down mid-single digits. We also know that our mix is more exposed to the convenience channel. Convenience store sales were down even further than the broader market. So I think that our volume performance in Rigids through the quarter is a function of a softer market, probably some destocking and then offset by some business wins that we picked up, particularly in the hot fill side. So, that's the way we see it as it relates to volume. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's very helpful. And then just in the release, I think you talked about maintaining the full year EPS and free cash flow guide. In your comments, you said you could be at the lower end. Without putting too fine a point on it, is there any reason not to sort of formally lower the guidance range? Or are there may be circumstances that could get you maybe to the higher end of the guide? Is it just completely dependent on volumes? Or is there any way that we should think about getting to maybe the higher end or the lower end of the guide? Ron Delia : Yes. Look, I think the primary reason for not changing the guidance is we have half year lap. We've got two quarters. We've got a relatively wide range when you consider that we've got two quarters left, and we've maintained the full width of the range. The swing factor really will be volumes. It really will come down to volume -- the volume outlook for the second half. I think we also feel pretty good about the execution capabilities of the business and the ability to continue to take cost out, which was a real highlight for us in the first half. We believe we'll continue to do that in the second half. But the swing factor will be volumes. And what could lead us to the high end of the range? We could have low single-digit volume growth. We could get out front of raw materials as they come off at a faster pace than we're assuming, and a weaker U.S. dollar would help as well. And the inverse would be true for the lower end of the range. I think it's also fair to say that at this point in the year. We have a wider range of demand outlook than we normally would or a wider range of possible scenarios for volume than we ordinarily would. Our view would be volumes could be anywhere from up a couple of points to down low single digits, and it's unusual for us to have a forecast that could include a decline in volumes. So for all those reasons, we've decided to express some caution here. But what we think with two quarters left and with some strong cost performance that will continue into the second half, we thought it was prudent to maintain the range at this stage. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Purtell with Macquarie Asset Management. John Purtell : Just in terms of price and mix, so that's been a benefit for you over a sort of long period of time. We saw that continue in this half with a 4% benefit in flexibles and presumably health care, which you called out there, Ron, as sort of a key part of that. The question is sort of how you see that price mix profiling through the second half. I mean would it be fair to say that you're expecting slightly less price and mix benefit in the second half relative to the first? Michael Casamento : Yes, John, I can help you with that one. So you're right. We -- the teams have done a good job on price and getting out there ahead of inflation and recovering that. And you saw in the -- we commented in the half, we've recovered about $160 million in cost inflation during the period. But we also had really good mix benefits, particularly from the strong health care performance, particularly in the half where we saw a double-digit growth, which is above average growth for that part of the business and a bit of rebound versus the prior year. So as we look forward into the second half, there will still be the price/mix benefit there. But inflation is still there. We've got to recover that. And on the health care side, you -- comparatively, you're not going to see the same level of growth and, therefore, the mix benefit. So although we're still expecting that, we would say that it will be lower than what we saw in the first half. Operator : We'll take our next question from George Staphos with Bank of America. George Staphos : My question on -- for the call is on cost saves. Ron, you talked about aggressive actions. I forget exactly how you phrased it. But two, to obviously offset some of the headwinds that you're seeing, can you talk a bit further about what those actions are? Can you size them either in relation to, I don't know, the volume weakness that you're seeing or the ability to offset the dilution from Russia? And how can cost saves build into both calendar '23 and fiscal '24 to offset that further dilution you'll have from Russia, at least in the first half of the upcoming new year? Ron Delia : Okay. Thanks, George. Look, let me respond to the question and Michael will respond to the question in two parts. I think the cost savings activities that we've been undertaking through the first half in the face of softer volumes and then there's, the offsets to the Russian, the divestment of the Russian earnings. So look, we got out front, I think, very proactively and fairly aggressively on cost in the first half. I mean, I think the way to think about it is we had really strong operating leverage with 2% organic sales growth, really flat to minus 1% on the volume line, and we had 8% EBIT growth. And if you think about the drivers of that EBIT growth, price and mix sort of offset and we recovered inflation. So -- and really, the profit growth was driven by cost-outs. And so where did the cost-outs come from? We did a really good job of flexing labor. We cut shifts. We reduced over time. Several hundred people are out of the business. There's a reasonably meaningful headcount reduction across the business. We've also pulled the procurement lever pretty hard and cut back on discretionary spending. And we got out front early on those actions given the volatility that we saw and just reading the tea leaves from discussions with customers on the demand environment. Those initiatives, those actions will continue into the second half, and they underpin the outlook that we've reaffirmed today. I think Russia is almost a separate topic, if you will. And just to level set, Michael can talk about some of the specifics. But we had a business in Russia with three plants that represented about 2% to 3% of our sales and roughly 4% to 5% of our EBIT in any given year. So essentially $80 million to $90 million of EBIT, which we've now divested, and we are resolute in trying to replace that EBIT as fast as we possibly can, and so with the proceeds exceeding our expectations, we generated a pretty healthy profit on the sale of the business as well. And then the proceeds of over $400 million, $430 million, as Michael alluded to, a bit ahead of our expectations, we think it's a good use of cash to reinvest in the business and take cost out, structural cost-out, to help offset the $80 million to $90 million of EBIT that we've divested. And Michael, maybe you can talk a bit more about the financial profile of what we're planning to do. Michael Casamento : Sure. Thanks, Ryan. Yes, I mean just following on from that, so we announced today we're going to use part of the proceeds to help divest -- to help offset the divested earnings, and we announced today around $120 million of cash will be put to work in cost-saving initiatives, things like footprint and SG&A and the like, and that's in addition to $50 million cash that we allocated back in August as well. So in total, about $170 million of cash is going to be invested in cost-out initiatives over the next kind of 12 to 18 months. And we'd expect to get kind of a 30% return on that at full run rate. But if you think about the timing of that, those initiatives are only starting. We'll start to work on those this financial year. So, there is no impact factored into -- no upside factored into the guidance range in FY '23. But certainly, we're expecting benefits from this program in FY '24 and then into FY '25. And if you think about that, bear in mind, in H1 in FY '24, we will have a headwind. These programs will kick in but weighted more to the back end of the year. So on that $170 million investment, if you call a 30% return, it's roughly a $50 million potential impact to offset the Russia earnings. I would say that 2/3 of that we think we can achieve in FY '24. So over the course of FY '24, we feel that we can pretty much minimize any headwind from the Russia earnings in the first half of FY '23, and then you'll get the full run rate as we head into FY '25. Operator : We'll take our next question from Larry Gandler with Credit Suisse. Larry Gandler : I might as well just continue on that last comment. Can you just talk about some of the specifics about how to achieve that 30% return, $50 million savings from those Russia cost-saving actions? What are you guys doing there? Ron Delia : Yes. As Michael alluded to, Larry, we're going to close some plants. And as we think about it and take some overheads out, if we think about this environment that we're in with the demand backdrop being as uncertain as it is and the fact that we're also already increasing our CapEx to pursue growth, particularly in our priority segments, we feel like that's pretty well in trained. So then the next -- the fastest way to generate earnings to offset the divested earnings is through cost reduction, and cost reduction in a structural sense, which means optimizing the footprint. And it's a business that -- we've got 220 plants around the world. There are always opportunities to optimize further, and so that's largely what we'll do. And we will -- as I said, we also will reduce overheads in parts of the business as well to rightsize the cost structure. Larry Gandler : Okay. That's pretty clear. And one other thing that caught my attention is you guys repurchased only $40 million of stock in the first half and then the target for $500 million now for the full year. So I'm just wondering, was there anything that kind of gave you some hesitancy in the first half? I'm interested if on the M&A pipeline, if you guys might have been looking at something that caused some hesitancy. Michael Casamento : Well, look, Larry, I think ultimately, we started the buyback in Q2. We spent $40 million. If you think about the cash flows in the first half, we also invested in some M&A activities. So we acquired the plant in the Czech Republic. We spent a little more on APAC. And at the same time, we were managing the cash flow as we start to release some of the inventory that we built up on the back of supply chain constraints over the past 12 months. So, we started to see that come out of the system toward the end of quarter two, which gave us the ability to start to do the buyback. And then as we look forward into H2, we will start to see more -- as I mentioned in my comments, we'll see the cash flow more weighted to the second half, particularly as we start to get through the inventory and working capital impacts from that. In addition to that, you've got the proceeds from the Russia sale, which we're allocating $100 million to the buyback. So really, it was around the timing of the cash flow and just managing that through and we can get the buyback done in the second half as we've done in the past. So we feel like we can get the $500 million done. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Ghansham Panjabi : I just want to go back to the, Anthony's question on the caution, Ron, you referenced. Can you elaborate on whether this is a caution on any specific region between Europe and the U.S. and Latin America? Or is it just universal? I'm just trying to get a sense as to maybe some of the -- just the moderation of volumes that we're seeing is really a function of perhaps just catching up over the last year or so from previously depleted inventories, and now we're just approaching a more normalization phase and an adjustment related to that. Ron Delia : Yes. Look, I don't think we know the answer to that is a short response to your question. The caution is based on the volatility that we've seen in demand patterns globally. Now if we look specifically in the second quarter, it's more segment-specific in North America and Europe. And then we had some geographies where things got even more volatile as we went through the quarter, in particular, Latin America, where we saw some destocking but also just, we think, some softer demand in light of the deteriorating macroeconomic environment in several countries down there. China would be another one where we saw demand soften considerably in the second quarter, really concurrent with COVID lockdowns. Now obviously, those are behind us, we'd expect the business to bounce back. But how strongly it bounces back is an open question. And look, as far as the drivers of volume in the quarter and even into January, how much is related to the consumer pushing back on prices that have been put through versus how much is destocking, it's just -- it's difficult to read. So generally speaking, there's been volatility across the business, and that adds up to a degree of caution on our part. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay. Understood. And then just given the increase in interest rates, I mean, obviously, it's a big headwind between fiscal year '23 and fiscal year '22, just for everybody, really. How are we thinking differently, if at all, in terms of allocating cash flow towards buybacks versus debt paydown? Michael Casamento : Yes. Look, the interest rates where they are for us, the buyback still makes sense. It's EPS accretive. We have strong cash flows, and we regularly been doing buybacks, and we'll continue to do that where the interest rates are. It still makes sense from that perspective. Operator : We'll take our next question from Daniel Kang with CLSA. Daniel Kang : Just interested on the impact of destocking, I know it's quite difficult to quantify. But can you estimate how much it contributed to the volume softness in both Flexibles and Rigids? Are you seeing any green shoots at this point in terms of the destocking cycle coming to an end? And just wondering what you're assuming in terms of destocking in your guidance. Ron Delia : Look, Daniel, it's a difficult one to estimate. I mean I think you'd have to triangulate a few different data points. If you look at the scanner data and look at the results of other public companies that have reported, volumes were down considerably. And in light of those comparisons, our volume performance was actually good. But when we know anecdotally in certain segments, particularly in coffee, single-serve coffee in Europe, some of the dairy segments in the U.S. meat in Europe, we know in some of those places, including Beverage and the Rigid Packaging segment, that there was excess inventory in the system. And we know that because customers took shutdowns in a way that they haven't in the past, meaning longer shutdowns. So, it would be very hard to parse out the volume performance of the half. The volumes were down 1%. I think that probably compares favorably to the other external markers out there, but it would be really hard to parse that 1% in terms of what was destocking versus what is just a softening consumer environment given the price increases that have been put through in pretty much all segments and all regions. Operator : We'll take our next question from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : I guess I want to come back to this question on mix. And Ron, earlier, you alluded to maybe health care, which has been a strong growth driver moderating as we go into the back half of the year. Can you just maybe calibrate that a little bit more, just in the context of broadly cautious kind of volume outlook, kind of when you see the health care business settling out? And kind of help us think about how -- what happens into fiscal '24 as you start lapping some of the growth there. Ron Delia : Well, health care has been a good grower for us over many, many years. And it's grown -- both the medical packaging side and the pharmaceutical packaging side have grown kind of mid-single digits globally, obviously a bit higher in the emerging markets, and that's been consistent over a long period of time. I think we saw extraordinary growth in the first half coming off of actually quite a strong fiscal '22 as well. A few drivers there that we think have been fueling that growth. Obviously, our market position is quite strong, and the innovation that we've been bringing to the market is quite strong, and we're investing behind that as we've highlighted today. I think there's -- to be clear, there's been some pent-up demand because some of the supply chain constraints that we've talked about and others have talked about really hit the health care segments for us in a pretty acute way. Those are unwinding, and some of that pent-up demand is being satisfied. And I think it's also not a secret that on the pharmaceutical side, there's been a relatively big cold and flu season. So those are some of the things that really fuel double-digit growth globally across both the medical device and pharmaceutical segments for us in the first half, and we believe that the business will continue to grow at healthy rates but will revert more towards long-term trends that we've seen over a long period of time in the kind of mid-single-digit range, and that would apply going into FY '24 as well. Adam Samuelson : Okay. That's helpful. And if I can just squeeze another one. In the context of maybe on the food and consumer goods side, but slowing demand and some of destocking on the part of customers, have you seen their engagement on new products and new form factors for packaging change at all as bid activity or RFPs maybe that kind of activity different than 6 or 12 months ago? Ron Delia : No. If anything, it's accelerating, particularly around the sustainability side, where many of the brand owners that we work closely with have the same commitments that we have and have made similar pledges around recyclability or recycled content. Those commitments are fast approaching and the dates are fast approaching. And if anything, we're seeing an acceleration in that dialogue, and we're seeing good take up. Some of the examples we cited today with our AmFiber performance paper platform, which is getting good take-up in the marketplace. We're seeing good early take-up of advanced recycled material and products that contained that off-take. And so look, I think at the moment, it's not slowed down at all. I think also brand owners are looking for ways to differentiate as they try to scratch out whatever growth they can. Operator : We'll take our next question from Nathan Reilly with UBS. Nathan Reilly : Ron, would you mind just talking about how the latest round of general price increases have been received by customers just given that lower demand outlook, particularly with those December volumes takes to notable turn down? I'd imagine it's getting even harder to recover inflation on costs, but I also note your comment on managing manufacturing capacity. So just interested on any views on pricing. Ron Delia : Yes. Look, I mean we've been at it now for a while. We put about $670-odd million of price into the market in the quarter just to recover higher raw material costs, another $160 million or so to recover general inflation. It's certainly not getting easier, but we are passing it through, and we're recovering, and I think you can see that in the margins. The margins have expanded -- excluding the dilution effect of the raw material prices going through the top line, the margins have continued to expand and not shrink. And I think that's -- it should give some confidence that we are out there recovering. It doesn't mean that the conversations are getting easier. I think the consumers are probably starting to get a bit tired. Elasticities, if they haven't already are likely to increase. I think that's what we're hearing from most of our brand owners -- brand owner customers. But at this stage, we're still recovering, and we expect to continue to fully recover our inflationary costs in the second half. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Roxland with Truist Securities. Mike Roxland : I appreciate taking the question. Just first one, just on the $120 million in cost takeout in SSG&A removal. Ron, can you comment on what regions you're looking at and whether there are any particular end markets that you're looking to restructure? And just quickly, on your Asian business, especially with China eliminating its color restrictions, have you seen any type of improvement recently in the volumes there? And was that a fact that you considered in your recent MDK acquisition? Ron Delia : Maybe I'll address the second question first, and then Michael can come back on the $120 million. Look, it's relatively recent that China has reopened and then we went into the Chinese New Year in January. But we do expect that business to bounce back. More importantly, the China business has done an outstanding job managing costs. So despite the volume declines that ran alongside the COVID lockdowns, the business grew earnings in the first half, which was just an outstanding outcome. It's been a business for us that has grown at least mid- to high single digits over many years. What's really important in China is to be very focused in our participation strategies. Health care is a place we want to participate, and we want to go deeper in China. And we're doing that both organically, and we're doing that through M&A., and the MDK acquisition that we announced last month is a good example of that. It's a small business, one plant outside of Shanghai, complements very well, another medical packaging plant that we have near Shanghai as well. It brings us some complementary products that we didn't have local production of in China, and it also expands our book of business with a new set of customers. So we're pretty excited about that, and we think that's all part of the long-term secular growth that we've experienced and will continue to experience in China. On the $120 million, do you want to comment on where we are at that? Michael Casamento : Look at $120 million, I mean we see opportunities across the business. As Ron mentioned, there's under 220 plants around the globe. It's going to be focused on taking some plants out of the network and as well as SG&A opportunities to rightsize the business. So there is some focus in Europe. But generally speaking, we'll see opportunities across the globe. So that's to come. Ron Delia : Wherever we can find EBIT -- to offset the EBITDA we've sold is where we'll be looking. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jakob Cakarnis with Jarden Australia. Jakob Cakarnis : Michael, just a question for you. I was just wondering if you could talk through some of the fixed variable cost structures across both of the divisions. And just noting you did talk about some plants downtime, which is a little bit higher than expected. Can you just talk about how that's flowed through to some of the cost benefits in the half whether that will occur into the second half of the year if the volume environment remains weak? Michael Casamento : Yes. I think you got to think about it in the context of just our cost of goods and the breakup of the cost of goods where we focused on taking some of that cost out. Of our COGS, about 60% to 70% of it is the raw material. You then get into labor, which is around that 10% to 15% and then things like energy and freight. So where we really focused was around just managing the labor in the half, particularly flexing downtime to match our customers where they were down, managing the overtime to take that out as well. So we -- if anything, we've recovered inflation. We talked about that, the $160 million. But within the performance in the half, we absolutely took some cost-out. We haven't specified the exact amount. But to Ron's point earlier, there was a few hundred heads as well from a direct labor standpoint that came out as well as just generally managing and flexing that cost in line with the demand. Operator : We'll take our next question from Kyle White with Deutsche Bank. Kyle White : Just curious, given the kind of customer elasticity that you've talked about, have you seen any shift in your customers' go-to-market strategies on pricing as volumes have started to decelerate? Any sign of increased promo activity that could drive volumes? And I understand it might be hard to give a general statement given your diversification within Flexibles. So I guess I'm most interested on hot fill and cold field beverages within rigid packaging, but any details would be appreciated. Ron Delia : Yes, it's a good question. We have seen some shifts in the consumer and some of that driven by actions that the brand owners have taken. In the beverage space, and if we just focus on North America, some of these points would hold in Latin America as well, but in the beverage space in North America, when the consumer is under pressure, they tend to revert to multipacks and smaller unit sizes, right? And so if they're going to buy a soft drink, they're likely to buy it in a pack of 12, where the unit price is lower than buying it through the convenience store in the cold chain. So we have seen some of that. That's probably contributed to the softness, particularly on the cold fill side. I think we've seen some other examples in other segments in Europe in the coffee segment. We've definitely seen soft volumes in the more premium end than the single-serve system sales, and we've seen higher sales in the segments that are multi-serve. So think about capsules in a system versus ground coffee or instant coffee. The instant coffee is what's being pushed at the moment. So we are seeing a little bit of that sort of behavior. It's maybe just a different degree of emphasis across their product mix as they help the consumer through a high inflationary environment. Operator : We'll take our next question from Cameron McDonald with E&P. Cameron McDonald : Just a question for me. Just on coming at it a different way with regards to the outlook on the volumes and the demand environment. Can you sort of delve into what the order cycle actually looks like with the -- particularly the products around FMCG and the comments made by customers and how much visibility you've got on that order cycle? So obviously, your products get put into their production facility and then it sits on a shelf, and then they've got to sell it. So you get further visibility on what the customers are expecting. So have you got good visibility into the rest of the third quarter? Or can we see into the fourth quarter at this stage? Ron Delia : The business is exposed really to consumer staples and fast-moving consumer goods and health care. And typically, we'll have visibility a few months out. Obviously, we have a long -- we have planning discussions with our customers over a longer period of time. But as you get near and near those discussions get more and more granular and you get more -- a greater degree of accuracy as you get closer, so I would say our degree of forecast visibility extends a few months. And that's about the extent of it. And right now, those forecasts are moving around quite a bit and have been now for the last few months. The volatility has increased and the variability in forecast has increased. I think on the positive side, to the extent that there is any destocking that's gone on in our value chains, we would expect that to work itself through reasonably quickly. And in a matter of a quarter or two, we should be through whatever destocking needs to occur. Operator : We'll take our next question from Richard Johnson with Jefferies. Richard Johnson : Ron, I just got a question on strategy. Your shareholder value accretion model has sort of been at the forefront of your strategy, very much the foundation of your strategy for a very long time now. I'm conscious of the fact though that TSRs really struggle to keep pace with the value-add in more recent years. And really, my question is around the sort of long-term numbers because you're about to lose the big benefit of Alcan in your 10-year numbers. And I was just wondering how we should think about that, how you think about it and whether the model is still appropriate. Ron Delia : Yes. Look, it's a good question, Richard. We certainly believe the model is still appropriate. If you go back and look over a 10-year period post the Alcan acquisition, which is about 13 years ago now. The last 10 years, we've been well above from an intrinsic perspective, well above the 5% to the 10% to 15% sort of shareholder value creation model that we talk about. We still believe the business will generate low single-digit top line growth. It will convert that with operating leverage like we've seen in the first half. And then with the excess cash flows of the business, we're going to continue to acquire or buy back shares and continue to grow our dividends. So all up, we think the model still makes sense. It's held us in good stead, and we'll continue to do so going forward. Richard Johnson : Great. And just a quick one on Russia for Michael, if I may. Michael, it looks like you've booked, I think, off the top of my head, it's about $15 million of costs related to Russia below the line in the quarter. Can I just check whether that's correct? And secondly, what it might be? And thirdly, now you sold the business, there's no more to come below the line. Michael Casamento : So below the leverage we took a $215 million gain, obviously, on the sale transaction. And then there were some costs just in relation to transferring a business. Some of Ukraine costs still to just transfer equipment, et cetera, in that. As we look forward, you'll see the restructuring costs start to come through that will run through that line. But generally, the costs in relation to Russia are finished, yes. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brook Campbell-Crawford with Barrenjoey. Brook Campbell-Crawford: Just on CapEx. It looks like a larger CapEx quarter. The December quarter, it looks like it's about $94 million. Can you just remind us, I guess, what the expectations are for the full year? I think at the last result, it was $550 million to $600 million of CapEx was the expectation. So just an update on that one would be great and any reasons for the lighter investment period in the December quarter? Michael Casamento : Yes. Sure. In terms of the half, we're in around that $250 million. There's a bit of FX in there as well versus prior year. So versus prior year, we're running about 3%, 4% ahead. For the full year, the number of $550 million to $600 million still in the range of outcomes, we're likely to be kind of that 5% to 10% ahead of prior year. And we've got -- we continue to invest in the focus segments and the innovation platforms, which is where we've been focused on that investment. So no real change on the CapEx outlook, perhaps a little lower than where we were at three months ago, but pretty similar. Brook Campbell-Crawford: And a follow-up, if I could, just around capital and the M&A strategy. Ron, if you wouldn't mind just reminding us of the M&A strategy as it is today? And has it changed at all over the last couple of years. I guess I asked just because more recent investments seem to be focused on sort of fiber paper-type smaller deals like pull back in the one in China. You seem to be becoming a bit more substrate-agnostic. But just an update really on your M&A strategy will be fantastic. Ron Delia : Yes. Well, look, I mean we are substrate agnostic. That's been true of the Company throughout its history. And in fact, about 25% of what we do is either fiber or aluminum. But as far as M&A goes, no change, I mean we think there's going to be good bolt-on opportunities across the portfolio. I think you see some examples this year with this health care acquisition in China MDK. Michael referred earlier to a plant we bought in the Czech Republic earlier in the year to bolster our Eastern European footprint. So we think there'll be deals like that. I mean those are the deals that are out there because many of the companies in our space are small, and so we've got to be comfortable bolting on small businesses to our footprint. That will be part of the mix. And then where we can supplement the portfolio, we would like to do that, too. I mean, certainly, in the priority segments that we've nominated, we'd like to continue to grow, health care being the one we've talked more about today. In Rigids, obviously, the hot fill space is one that we have a strong position in. But outside of beverage, there are opportunities for us to continue to grow as well. So, there's a number of areas where we think the portfolio could be bolstered, but they'll be bolt-on opportunities across the Flexibles and Rigids segment. So, no change to note. Operator : We'll take our next question from [Ben Karidis] with NST. Unidentified Analyst : Just wondering if you are able to give any insight into what the interest rate impacts could be in FY '24? And also with tax, I note that there was a lower rate in the period, but wondering what we should expect for the balance of FY '23 and what we should consider to be a more normalized rate. Michael Casamento : Look, I mean if you think about interest and tax, together this year from a full year guidance standpoint, we've called out. They're going to be a headwind of around 4%. And tax, we've called out, is going to be more in that 18% to 19% range. And that's really on the back of the mix of earnings and particularly where our interest expense is, which is in higher cost -- higher tax cost countries. But when you put that together with the interest increase, that's more than offset by the increase in interest, so for this year, 4%, we haven't called out any guidance for FY '24 at this stage. But obviously, in the first half, depending on where interest rates go, there could be some headwind, but we're yet to see where that ends up. So at this stage, I'll -- we'll come back to you on that one. Operator : We'll take a follow-up question from John Purtell with Macquarie. John Purtell : Just a quick follow-up. Michael, just on the raw material side, you obviously saw a modest benefit there in the second quarter. I mean it looks like the raw mat indices have retraced a fair way. So the question is what have you baked into guidance because it looks like there should be a pretty material raw material benefit in that second half. Michael Casamento : Yes. Look, you're right. As we mentioned, we started to see some modest benefit in Q2 from raw materials as they've come down. Obviously, we're still holding higher inventories. So they're working their way through the system, which you're still going to see some impact from in Q3 as we work those down. We're expecting guidance -- raw materials right now, they're pretty benign across -- remembering, we will have a broad basket of materials across broad geographies. So when we see that pretty benign outlook for raw materials, so in Q3, we're again expecting some modest tailwind from the raw material side. Beyond that, it's really going to depend on what happens to the raw materials and how quickly we can get the inventory out of the system also linked to the demand environment, John, as well. So clearly, if demand improves, and we get stronger than -- we got stronger demand and then inventories will come down faster, you might get a little high tailwind. The opposite is true if the demand stays off -- if demand is softer, and we can't get the inventory out of the system as quickly then that will impact. But the guidance has a range of outcomes built into it, and that's all factored into the guidance range at this stage. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ron Delia for any closing remarks. Ron Delia : Okay. Look, we would just like to thank everybody for their interest in Amcor, operator. We feel like we've had a very strong first half and we're looking forward to closing off another strong year for the Company for fiscal '23. So, we'll close the call there. Thanks very much. Operator : And that concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

With that, over to you, Ron. Ron Delia : Thanks, Tracey, and thanks, everyone, for joining, Michael and myself today to discuss Amcor's March quarter and year-to-date results for fiscal 2023. We'll begin with some prepared remarks, starting as we always do with safety on Slide 3. Safety is our most important value at Amcor, which means our commitment to keeping our coworkers safe is unwavering. We're highly proactive in our approach to continuous safety improvement and our results continue to be rewarded. On a fiscal year-to-date basis, we reduced injuries globally by 23% compared to last fiscal year and 64% of our global sites have been injury-free for 12 months or more. While these are excellent industry-leading results and a reflection of our commitment to mitigating risk and protecting our people, the journey towards zero injuries continues. Turning to our key messages on Slide 4. First, Amcor's portfolio is well positioned and is primarily exposed to consumer staples and health care end markets. We have leadership tons in several strong underlying businesses, a compelling customer value proposition and differentiated execution capabilities, all of which contributed to solid financial performance for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. That said, we're not completely immune to broader market challenges, and we were cautious heading into the third quarter. Market dynamics led to increased volume softness and volatility throughout the quarter, particularly in the month of March, and our updated outlook assumes this continues through the balance of the fiscal 2023 year. Against this backdrop, our teams remain laser-focused on supporting decisive price and cost actions. The recovery of higher input costs remains a top priority, and we're also taking a range of actions to flex and reduce operating costs while advancing structural cost reductions. These actions give us confidence that earnings growth will build as we progress through fiscal '24. Importantly, we remain focused on executing against our strategy for long-term growth and value creation. We have a strong, well-positioned business, and while we navigate short-term challenges, we'll continue to reinvest for organic growth, pursue M&A opportunities and/or repurchase shares and pay a compelling and growing dividend. Moving to Slide 5 for a summary of our financial results. Reported net sales for the first nine months were up 4%, which includes an unfavorable currency impact of 4% and approximately $750 million of price increases related to higher raw material costs. Organic sales were up 2% on a comparable constant currency basis and volumes were 2% lower. For the March quarter, sales were up 1% on a comparable constant currency basis, with volumes down approximately 3.5%. In both periods, price/mix benefits of around 4% included recovery of general inflation, which has totaled approximately $240 million on a year-to-date basis and approached $100 million for the quarter. Year-to-date adjusted EBIT of $1.2 billion and EPS of $0.541 per share were both up 4% on a comparable constant currency basis, benefiting from strong operating leverage in the first half of the year. In the March quarter, adjusted EBIT of $382 million was down 2.5% on a comparable basis versus the prior year. A modest decline as proactive cost actions helped offset significant headwinds related to a challenging operating environment. We continue to execute well on our capital allocation priorities, returning approximately $745 million of cash to shareholders during the first nine months through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We ramped up our share repurchases during the third quarter, and year-to-date, we've bought back 18 million shares for a total cost of $200 million and our overall financial profile remains robust with return on average funds employed above 16%. Now turning to Slide 6. I want to provide a bit more color on what we've seen through the third quarter, and more importantly, the decisive actions we're taking and will continue to take. Three primary factors influenced our performance in both the Flexibles and Rigid Packaging segments in the quarter. First, the general market remains soft and more volatile, leading to lower volumes from a combination of weaker consumer demand and further destocking. Last quarter, we highlighted that demand would be a critical driver of our financial performance, and we expected Q3 and Q4 volumes could be in the range of plus or minus low single digits. In January and February, volumes were tracking at the lower end of those expectations down between 1% and 2%, then weakened through the month of March to be down on 7%. Volatility in customer order patterns also increased throughout the quarter, most notably in our Rigid Packaging North American beverage business. Our teams are adept at flexing the cost base to match anticipated demand although more volatility in orders is compromises the ability to pull the appropriate cost levers quickly enough in response, leading to operating inefficiencies. Second, mix trends were unfavorable across much of the business. Destocking continued in higher-value premium coffee and protein categories. And although health care continued to contribute solid growth, it was at a slower rate as we begin to lap a very strong prior year. Our North American beverage business also experienced unfavorable product and customer mix. And third, cost inflation is ongoing as we expected. While the rate may be moderating in some areas, inflation remains elevated in most of our markets. So these impacts are not entirely new, and we saw the need for caution at the back end of last quarter and have been out in front, proactively managing the controllables and taking decisive pricing cost actions, which continued in Q3. First, we've successfully driven more than $1 billion of price on a year-to-date basis to compensate for higher raw materials and general inflation, and we'll continue to take further actions where inflation persists. Second, we continue to actively flex and reduce operating costs. We've reduced our global headcount by more than 1,000 positions, lower discretionary spending, increased the number of full or partial plant shutdown days and extracted more procurement benefits. Year-to-date, these efforts have lowered costs by approximately $140 million. We expect to drive additional cost savings of approximately $50 million to $60 million across the business in Q4, including a further reduction of approximately 200 positions. And third, as we've previously announced, we're also pursuing a range of structural cost savings initiatives. And to date, we've announced three plant closures and one partial closure, and we could add more depending on how the demand environment evolves. We expect to deliver at least $50 million in cost savings from these structural initiatives, which will begin to benefit earnings in fiscal '24, primarily in the second half. We expect current market conditions will persist in the near term, so we remain laser-focused on controlling what we can control and responding with actions. I'll now turn it over to Michael to cover more of the financials. Michael Casamento : Thanks, Ron, and hi, everyone. Beginning with the Flexibles segment on Slide 7. Year-to-date reported sales grew 2%, which included a recovery of higher raw material costs of approximately $490 million, representing 6% sales growth. Excluding the raw material impact of negative currency movements, sales grew 3%, driven by favorable price/mix benefits across all Flexibles business units, partly offset by 2% lower volumes. Our strategic focus on higher-value priority categories has continued to drive year-to-date sales growth, particularly strong volume growth in the health care and pet care categories has helped limit the impact of lower volumes in other categories such as protein and premium coffee. The business has continued to show solid operating cost performance and recovery of inflation, resulting in a 5% year-to-date increase in adjusted EBIT on a comparable constant currency basis. Margins remained strong at 12.4% despite the 80 basis point dilution related to increased sales dollars from passing through higher raw material costs. In terms of the third quarter, if we call out worth touching on. Net sales on a comparable constant currency basis were 2% higher, reflecting positive price/mix benefits. Volumes were down 3% in the quarter, as market conditions led to a combination of lower consumer demand and customer destocking to varying degrees across all Flexibles businesses. This compares to a 1% reduction in volumes in the first half of the year, with the greatest sequential declines in Europe and North America, where compared with the same quarter last year, volumes were down mid-single digits and low single digits, respectively. In both regions, the overall trends towards lower volumes and month-to-month variability is consistent with retail scanner data with categories such as premium coffee and protein being incrementally impacted by customer destocking. This also contributed to unfavorable mix in the quarter, along with expected slowing of growth rates in health care as we cycled strong growth in the prior year. Adjusted EBIT for the quarter was broadly in line with the prior year on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting unfavorable volume and mix trends and ongoing cost dilation. This was offset by continued pricing actions and benefits from cost productivity and cost reduction initiatives, which increased as we progress through the quarter. Turning to Rigid Packaging on Slide 8. On a year-to-date basis, net sales were 8% higher than the same period last year, including approximately $260 million or 11% of sales related to the pass-through of higher raw material costs. Organic sales declined by 2%, reflecting 3% lower volumes, partly offset by 1% price/mix benefits. In North America, overall beverage volumes for the first nine months were down 5% volumes were up 2% and up significantly up over the past two years, with growth in key categories, including isotonics, juices and ready-to-drink tea. Offset by lower container volumes, which reflects a combination of lower consumer demand and customer destocking. Specialty container volumes were comparable with last year, and Latin America volumes were down 2% with challenging economic conditions leading to lower consumption across most of the region. Year-to-date adjusted EBIT was in line with last year as strong earnings growth in the first half was offset by a more challenging March quarter. Adjusted EBIT margin of 7.2% includes an adverse impact of approximately 8 basis points from the increased sales dollar related to passing through higher raw material costs. Looking at the March quarter, Comparable constant currency net sales were down 4% with continued soft consumer demand and customer destocking driving volumes lower in both North America and Latin America. Adjusted EBIT for the quarter was down $7 million on a constant currency basis, reflecting unfavorable volume and mix trends and ongoing cost inflation. This was partly offset by benefits from cost reduction initiatives. And as Ron mentioned earlier, volatility has been particularly notable in North America beverage business, with order patterns changing on a week-to-week basis, significantly impacting our ability to flex costs quickly enough in response. Combined with mid-single-digit volume declines and unfavorable customer and product mix trends, this has had a meaningful impact on operating leverage for our beverage business than we have seen in other businesses. As market-driven consumer demand remains soft and customers continue to reduce inventories, the business took a range of actions to lower costs, including reducing headcount. Across the network this year, the business has also taken temporary plant shutdowns to better align production with lower demand, where possible and to prioritize our inventory reduction efforts. Looking ahead, the June quarter is typically the seasonally strongest quarter for North America beverage business. This year, based on continued challenging market dynamics, we expect volume weakness with increased volatility mix challenges and ongoing inflation to persist through the U.S. summer and we anticipate need to continue reducing inventories through the June quarter. As a result, relative to what we have seen in the March quarter, we expect this combination of factors to have a larger unfavorable impact on June quarter earnings compared to the same quarter last year. Moving to cash on the balance sheet on Slide 9. Our financial profile remains strong with leverage at 3.1x on a trailing 12-month EBITDA basis, broadly in line with last year and where we would expect it to be at this time of year. Year-to-date cash flow remains below last year, mostly related to lower accounts payable balances as we moderate our purchasing activities, partly to reduce inventories, but also to reflect the soft demand environment. This is a timing impact, which will abate in the coming quarters. We are already making good progress on inventories with balances coming down over the last several months, and we expect a further reduction in the June quarter. Our cash flow is typically weighted to the fourth quarter, and we expect adjusted free cash flow in Q4 to be broadly in line with last year. This brings me to our outlook on Slide 10. Given our expectation that current market conditions will persist in the near term, leading to a mid-single-digit overall volume decline in the fourth quarter, we are updating our guidance range for adjusted EPS of $0.72 to $0.74 per share assuming current foreign exchange rates prevail through the balance of the year. We also expect full year adjusted free cash flow in the range of $800 million to $900 million, which includes our updated expectations on timing for working capital improvements. The slide lays out the elements making up our guidance. We expect a benefit of approximately 2% from share repurchases and earnings from the underlying business to be in line with last year, notwithstanding the significant market challenges we faced and will continue to face through the balance of fiscal '23. As Ron mentioned, we have already passed through more than $1 billion in price related to raw materials and general inflation and delivered $140 million of -- and we expect to deliver a new $50 million to $60 million in cost savings across the business in the fourth quarter. Throughout the year, we've also highlighted the significant non-operating headwinds we faced from higher interest expense and invested around our three plants in Russia, which will be absent or significantly reduced in the second half of fiscal '24, with the benefits from the proactive actions we are taking in response to current market conditions, we are confident that earnings growth will build as we progress through the 2024 fiscal year. With that, I'll hand back to Ron. Ron Delia : Okay. Thanks, Michael. While we navigate a challenging environment in the short term, we have a strong foundation, and we remain committed to our strategy of driving long-term growth and profitability. And that strategy consists of investments in both organic growth and strategic M&A. On previous calls, we've highlighted the importance of our priority categories, emerging markets, innovation and helping deliver organic growth and better mix over the longer term. And our financial results over the years have demonstrated the success of that focus. For the longer-term comments today, I want to highlight how M&A complements each of these areas and spend a little time outlining our approach to delivering additional growth through acquisitions. Turning to Slide 12. Disciplined M&A has been part of Amcor's playbook for a long time. Our history of successful deal execution and integration has helped us establish or build industry-leading positions, support earnings growth and drive consistent value creation. Our model starts with strategic fit. We look across a number of factors when prioritizing opportunities, including businesses where Amcor or the Target is a leadership position, where the target can complement our existing footprint or where we gain access to a new customer base or new technologies. Second, in terms of financial strategy, we have been and will continue to be highly disciplined. We target all deals to deliver a double-digit return on the cash investment and well above our cost of capital within three to five years. And third, our investment-grade balance sheet and strong annual cash flow provide ample capacity and access to financing to continue to pursue M&A or share repurchases in addition to investing in the base business and funding the dividend. And we've been quietly active on the acquisition front. Last week, we signed a deal to acquire Motor Systems, a New Zealand-based manufacturer of high-performance vacuum and packaging equipment for the fresh meat, poultry and dairy markets, with machines currently installed in a number of geographies, including North America. This is a small but important acquisition, which will complement Amcor's existing strength in film enabling us to offer a total system solution for automated protein packaging. Other recent deals over the past nine months include the acquisition of Shanghai-based medical packaging company, MDK in January, a deal that checks all the boxes to reinforce a priority category, expand an emerging market and broaden our product technology offering. And in August last year, we completed the acquisition of a state-of-the-art Flexibles packaging plant in the Czech Republic which increases our capacity to service strong growth in end markets, including pet care and coffee from a highly efficient, scalable production hub in a low-cost region. On the corporate venturing side, our team has done an excellent job identifying opportunities to help funds, support and learn from new external developments that have the potential to become smart, functional and sustainable packaging solutions in the future. M&A and corporate venturing are integral parts of our growth agenda and looking forward, we'll continue to be active, but also strategic and disciplined. Before we turn to questions, just a minute on sustainability on Slide 13. We continue to advance our sustainability agenda on a number of fronts, and our success in supporting customers transition their own portfolios to more sustainable solutions and reduce their carbon footprint has recently been acknowledged by several important industry third parties. Early in 2023, our innovation and sustainable product design leadership was highlighted by the World Packaging organization with Amcor's Am Prima and AM Sky recycle-ready product platforms named as winners in three categories. In February, the CDP or carbon disclosure project awarded Amcor and A- as part of its annual ratings. And this superior grade recognizes Amcor's ongoing sustainability commitment and achievements, including our pledge to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and our new target to use 30% recycled material across Amcor by 2030. And also in February, Amcor's leadership in responsible packaging and overall commitment to ESG was recognized by MSCI with a AA rating, marking the fifth consecutive year that we received the ranking. In summary, on Slide 14, the market remains challenging, but we're well positioned and confident in our ability to manage through this short-term period while continuing to generate value for our customers and shareholders. Most importantly, we believe the actions we're taking now will result in earnings growth building as we progress through fiscal '24, and we remain focused on delivering against our strategies for long-term growth, including executing well on M&A, and expanding our leadership in sustainability. Operator, with those opening remarks concluded, we are ready to open the call to questions. Operator, we're ready to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Ghansham Panjabi : Ron, maybe you could just build up your comments and just touch on which specific categories do you expect incremental volume weakness in the June quarter? I think the March quarter was down 3%, you're getting towards down mid-single digits and then also expand a bit more on the dynamic order patterns that you're calling out from your customers? Ron Delia : Yes, good way to get started here again, volume story has been quite volatile. I mean if you go back even to the end of our second quarter, we had flagged that demand or volumes had softened coming through the back end of calendar '22, and that certainly continued. In the first couple of months of the year, January and February, we were down about 1% or 2%, March, down almost 7% with the heightened volatility, which I'll come back to. As we look forward to the fourth quarter, we just are extrapolating what we've experienced in March and to some extent, already through the month of April to get to that mid-single-digit decline, certain categories. And we've seen destocking continue to see destocking in a number of categories, particularly ones that were affected by some of the supply chain constraints over the last 18 to 24 months where we know there is a lot of over ordering in some cases to buttress against those challenges. So segments like meat certain part of the coffee space, premium coffee, healthcare to some extent which is cycling a stronger comp. That's what we expect for the fourth quarter. As far as the volatility, it's really just week-to-week order changes and schedule alterations and things of that nature, which just make it a little bit harder to take as much cost out as you'd like. It's just a particularly volatile period out there. North American beverage, in particular, for a number of reasons, including the seasonality of that business has continued to be particularly volatile. So, we're expecting that to continue along with the demand weakness in the fiscal fourth quarter here. Ghansham Panjabi : And then on that, Ron, for my second question, just given the operating environment that your customers are facing with faced with at this point. Is that starting to impact their new product development cadence? And how does that compare to previous slowdowns, i.e., recessions in the past? Ron Delia : It hasn't necessarily slowed the dialogue with customers on new product development. I would say almost universally, our new product development agenda is with our big customers are oriented around sustainable packaging and delivering a package that's more sustainable than the one that's in the market today. That has not abated at all. That has not slowed. If anything, it's accelerated as we came out of COVID, our brand owners have the same public commitments that we have to make their packaging recyclable or compostable or reusable mostly by 2025 and to use more recycled content. And so we've not seen any slowdown to date in the product development side. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Anthony Pettinari : Ron, I'm wondering what the full year guidance might assume for kind of where price cost could shake out for fiscal 4Q? And then just maybe directionally what that price cost trajectory could look like early next fiscal year? And maybe if you could just give us any kind of additional color on resin or labor or any other cost buckets that are impacting you? Michael Casamento : Yes, it's Michael here. I can take that three for you. Thanks for the question. Yes, look, I mean, Q4, where we see raw materials right now, we've seen a relatively line environment in Q3. Q1, we saw raw materials come off in Q2, a more modest reduction. And then in Q2, Q3, relatively flat remembering that we have a broad base of raw materials we purchased angiographies across the globe. So as we look forward into Q4, relatively benign environment, we'd expect. So from a price/cost perspective, -- you've seen it actually come down as we progress through the year. So in Q4, it's going to be a very modest price increase or flat thereabouts. From an inflationary standpoint, we continue to see inflation in things like labor. I mean we've reset labor rates as of the 1st of January. So you've seen mid-single-digit increases there continue. Things like energy we continue to see increases and spikes in places like the West Coast of North America and Europe, still seeing significant increases in energy in that space. So, you saw us talk about the recovery of around $250 million in price year-to-date on general inflation and $750 million on raw materials. As we look forward into Q4, I think from a general inflation standpoint, we'd expect to see a similar number as we saw in Q3, which is around that $100 million mark. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's very helpful. And then just one quick follow-up on the $50 million structural cost reduction. Is there any view in terms of that being weighted more towards '24 or '25 million it seems like it could be pretty sizable if that fell to the bottom line? Ron Delia : Yes, sure. I mean, just to remind people the structural benefits program, we're investing around $170 million in cash to help offset the disposed Russia earnings. The expectation is that the benefits from that will be around 30% on the cash investment. We've already made some initial inroads into those projects. We closed three plants and a past closure as well. So we'd expect the benefits start to build on that through FY '24, albeit weighted to the second half of FY '24. And so we'd expect 2/3 or a little more of the benefit of that $50 million to come through in '24 and then the balance is '25. But we've made a good start on that, and you'll start to see those benefits build through the year in '24. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Chau with MST. Keith Chau : Just a couple of questions. First one is on destocking versus underlying weakness. Just wondering if you can give us a sense of that 10% decline in March in particular and then the mid-single-digit decline for the fourth quarter. Can you give us a sense of what you believe makes up those numbers, whether it is destocking or underlying demand weakness? Ron Delia : Yes. Sure, Keith. Look, it's hard to parse out too specifically, but a couple of things to think about. One is that the scanner data in Europe and North America that's tracking sell-through at retail has been in that mid-single-digit decline range now for a period -- for a reasonable period of time a couple of months at least. And so we're not anticipating that that's going to improve at all on top of which then you have some destocking in certain segments. Some of them are pronounced destocking we see is in the premium coffee space. We see destocking in protein we've seen destocking to some extent in the medical packaging space, again, places where there may have been some over ordering in light of supply chain constraints. So that's additive then to the demand deterioration on the consumer side of things. And then the offset is that we pick up some share along the way as well. So those are the three components of what we expect to be a mid-single digit decline in Q4. Keith Chau : Okay. And then in terms of the timing of the destock, do you expect that completely finished by the end of 4Q? Is there any anything to suggest that your customers might destock for longer into FY '24? Ron Delia : Given that we're talking about fast-moving consumer goods, any destocking should be relatively short-lived. The caveat to that is as consumer demand comes down, that means more inventory needs to come out of the system. And so my sense is that, that's prolonging the destocking here a little bit because it's been going on now for a couple of quarters. And best estimates that probably will continue for another couple of quarters, particularly in some of the businesses that are more seasonal, where the calendar second quarter and third quarter tend to be stronger, we're likely to see more inventory come out of the system through that time period. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Kang with CLSA. Daniel Kang : First question, probably to Mike, in terms of cost-out initiatives. Just wondering if the scope of the plans have actually changed from 2Q where you mentioned $170 million spend for a 30% return. Can it be expanded is the next question? Ron Delia : Yes. Well, Ron, I'll start the answer, and Michael can build on it. Look, the scope is global. And we've announced three plants that are going to come out of the system already and another half of the plan, a big department that we're going to reduce and it's a global program. Could it be more? It could be. We're going to wait and see how the demand environment evolves from here, but we're off to a good start and those plants will be coming to them over the next several quarters with the benefits flowing through the second half of -- well, building through fiscal '24, as Michael outlined already. Daniel Kang : You also mentioned in the prior question in terms of market share -- incremental market share gains. Can you talk about the categories where you are seeing more success in terms of market share gains? Ron Delia : I think we see some good examples in the beverage business, in particular, in the hot fill space. Our hot-fill volumes were up about 1%, which is ahead of the market. And I think it's, I think, a testament to the different lightweighting products that we've been able to bring to the market. That's one. I think in health care is another one where our growth has been really strong, particularly in the pharmaceutical side of things over the last several quarters, probably going back into last year as well. So, those two come to mind is places where we're likely to have picked up a bit of share. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Yes. I guess the first question, Ron, you talked in the prepared remarks about earnings growth building through fiscal '24. And I know you're not giving earnings guidance at this point. But as you would sit here today and you would look at kind of where the exit rate is after the June quarter and some of the headwinds you still have from Russia in September and the December quarters. Would you expect to grow EBITDA and EPS in fiscal '24 or help us think about some of the key variables to actually growing in fiscal '24 as you look today? Ron Delia : Yes. Look, I think we're going to have a couple of non-operating headwinds dissipate as we get into fiscal '24. So certainly, we won't be cycling the absence of the Russian earnings in the second half. We sold that business right at the end of our fiscal first half this past year. So by the end of this calendar year or the end of our fiscal second quarter, that headwind will go away. Interest rates really started to rise around this time last year. And so that's going to be -- interest will be more of a in the first half. But certainly, based on the forward curve and the expectations we have for rates going into calendar '24, we would expect that headwind abates. And then the third building block is the structural cost reductions that we've talked about a bit. And as Michael said, it's roughly $50 million of benefits that we see at this point in time. Roughly 2/3 of those benefits, we would expect in fiscal '24, with the momentum building through the second half of fiscal '24. So those are some of the big components. And the other piece, obviously, is just what happens to underlying demand and how does that evolve through the rest of the year. And we're certainly not in a position today to forecast that. I think we'll wait until we come to market as we do each year in August and provide guidance for the coming fiscal; year. Adam Samuelson : Okay. That's helpful. And then as you think about some of the mix tailwinds that you've had in the business, I mean, we're still quite strong in the in the March quarter, specifically in Flexibles. How does mix kind of progress from here, especially raw material kind of constraints and supply chain, I think have magnified some of those or those are easing some of the comps get a little bit harder on the mix side? And how do we think about that being a contributor prospectively from the book of business that you have today? Ron Delia : Yes, it's a good question. I think about mix, and I think about a much longer time period and a much longer time horizon. Mix has been part of our algorithm and an important part for almost. And we know that these markets, particularly the consumer staples and the health care markets that we're exposed to are going to grow collectively in the low single-digit range when things normalize. And when I say when things normalize, it means when the consumer adjusts to inflation and when the inventory destocking is completed through the value chain. We're going to have a base amount of growth in the business that's at low single digits. Then we have certain priority segments and categories that we've been doubling down on and investing disproportionately. And so health care, both medical and pharmaceutical packaging, protein, coffee, pet care. These segments and the packaging intensity in these segments has been growing at higher than general market rates, those are all mix accretive to us. And so if you take a longer-term view, mix has been an important driver of earnings growth for this company for over a decade. We would expect that, that will continue going forward as soon as we get through this short-term set of short-term market dynamics that we're facing right now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Purtell from Macquarie. John Purtell : Just as a follow-up to that, in terms of the price/mix was actually sort of similar that 4% for the nine months versus the first half. So within this price was up, but mix was down, is that the sort of correct read? And is there any sort of trading down effect in that mix as well? Just to understand that. I know that -- we've talked to this before, I mean, effectively, you pick up if there is some trading down, you pick up some of that volume, but maybe it has a mix effect as well. Michael Casamento : Yes. So John, I'll start there. And absolutely, we had price benefit in the period, which I touched on earlier. We recovered over $100 million in inflation during the period. I mean the mix -- what we have seen is some unfavorable mix around areas like the protein and premium coffee where we've seen some softness in demand, both from a consumer but also some destocking. So that's impacted mix negatively. On the offset to that, you still had in Q3, reasonable health care performance, albeit lapping a stronger comp. But some mix benefit coming through there. Pet food is another one in the in our focus categories where we've seen good growth there, which is driving mix. But as we look forward, I think that was really what we saw in the quarter, a bit of a tale of two stories. And then Ron touched on how we will think about things moving forward. John Purtell : And just a second one on the cost saves you made. I think you've called out $140 million there. Has that flowed through fully to P&L, so it's in the numbers that we see? Or is there a lagged impact from that? Ron Delia : No. Look, that's flowing through already. That's the year-to-date cost savings that have come out of the business. If you think about the year, we've had pricing to compensate for inflation, and then we've taken cost out to compensate for volume and mix going the other way. And the business through nine months has grown its EBITDA by 4%, roughly $50 million in EBIT growth. And the building blocks are as I just outlined. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Richard Johnson with Jefferies. Richard Johnson : Ron, I just wanted to ask you -- I'll go back to the subject of price. I mean if you look at the last five quarters, by far, the biggest contributor to operating profit growth, has been net price realization. I mean given the nature of the industry prices by definition, really cyclical. So, I was just wondering how we should think about price over the next few quarters, particularly in a very weak demand environment. Ron Delia : Yes. Look, price in the industry, I think you have to break down into the two components that the two main components. So, the raw material pricing in the industry is certainly cyclical. It ebbs and flows with the commodity cycle. We've come off a period while we believe that we're coming off a period of prolonged raw material increases as those abate, then the pricing that we need to put into the marketplace to compensate will start to come down. The other part is pricing just around general inflation. And that's something that the industry hasn't seen in 40 years. We have not seen inflation above the rate of normal productivity growth. And I think our view would be we're pretty pleased with the amount of pricing that we've been able to realize to cover the general inflation, the non-raw material price or cost increases that we've had to wear. It's demonstrated to us that there is pricing power in our value proposition, and we've been able to fully compensate. So I think it remains to be seen where inflation goes from here. Hopefully, there are some positive signs that maybe the rates of increases are slowing. And if that's the case, then our rate of pricing will slow as well. Richard Johnson : That's helpful. And then you mentioned premium coffee a few times and certainly commentary from your customers would sort of echo what you're saying. But really, what I wanted to ask about is the market leader at that end of the coffee market seems pretty determined to put in place a more sustainable substrate for their pods. And there is a competitor out there with the product already. I just wanted to try and catch up with where you are with that -- in that regard. Ron Delia : Yes. Look, we believe and we think that the customer would agree that aluminum capsule is as sustainable as any other alternative out there. It's fully recyclable, and we're making it with recycled aluminum content. And they've -- that customer has invested a lot in the infrastructure to actually make that a fully circular system. So, we're pretty comfortable with the sustainability credentials of that particular format. But nevertheless, we're active on the fiber side as you would know, with the fiber line, and we're making good traction on that side of the business as well. If that's the direction customers want to go, I think we're going to be well equipped to meet them where they are. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kyle White with Deutsche Bank. Kyle White : I wanted to follow up on that comment earlier regarding the rate of inflation kind of moderating obviously, been a lot of news regarding food and beverage inflation on the consumer. It seems like consumers are starting to push back with respect to that elasticity? Are you seeing or expecting any shift from your customers regarding promotional activity or pricing that could start to drive some sequential volume improvement? Ron Delia : I think a couple of things, Kyle. One is we're still out there pricing for inflation. So it's still out there. It's real. Maybe the rates of increase have slowed, but prices or costs are well elevated well above where they were a year or two years ago for sure. So we're still out there recovering. There is a lag. There's always a lag. It's no different to any other cycle around pricing. And there's always a little bit of a time lag as we work through contracts and contracts mature, et cetera, we're resetting at higher prices, but we are recovering. I think as far as the residual impact or the impact on demand. There are some examples of shifts. So what we see in the beverage business, in particular, in North America is a shift more towards value packs. We see a lot of smaller containers that go into 12 packs or 24 packs. We see volumes in that side of the business growing much more rapidly than larger sizes. We see channel shifts as well. So, we see less sales going through the C-store channel. Gas station sales are way down compared to club stores, et cetera. So you do see some more of a shift -- you do see a bit more of a shift towards value by the consumer. Kyle White : Got it. That's helpful. And then I was just curious, did you experience any headwind or impact from the lag of the pass-through of resin in the quarter on your P&L? And then are you anticipating any impact from this in the fiscal 4Q quarter? Michael Casamento : As I said earlier, the raw material environment in Q3 was relatively benign after some drop in Q1 or modest drop in Q2. So in Q3, we still have a modest benefit in the P&L on the base cost lag. As we look forward into Q4, as I said earlier, that right now the environment looks relatively benign across what we see across the globe. So, I think the benefit in Q4, if anything, will just be a modest price, price cost lag benefit similar to Q3. So as you think about the full year, it's really just been overall, it would be a relatively modest benefit from the raw material price position. As we look into '24, it's too early to tell, we'll wait and see where it's going from here. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jacob Cakarnis for Jordan. Jakob Cakarnis : Just one for Michael. Just on the free cash flow outlook for fiscal '23. Please. Can you just talk through some of the expectations for fourth quarter inventory unwind maybe the go forward as you carry into fiscal '24 and what needs to happen, perhaps to get that unit balance equal out to get back to the free cash flow levels that we're used to with you guys, please? Michael Casamento : Yes, sure. I can touch on the cash flow. So, I mean, what we've seen this year is the cash flow is behind prior year. And it's largely on the back of working capital outflows. And particularly in the first half, we were building inventory on the back of supply constraints in the system. We kind of peaked inventory in November have started to see that come out of the system. And if you think about the quarter we've just gone, we took about $100 million out of inventory. But we didn't get the benefit of that coming through the cash flow in the way that we'd expect it because what we're seeing on the back of the lower demand environment and also trying to take inventory out of the system is our payables are much lower where they were as well. So, the payables and the temporary position we see, the payables are lower than we would normally expect. As we continue to take inventory out of the system and also work our way through a softer demand environment. As we look into Q4 and what we've included in the guidance is Q4 is typically our strongest quarter of cash flow seasonally. I mean we do have a seasonal cash flow really on the back of the fact that Q4 is our strongest earnings. We also typically build inventory during the year and then that releases in Q4 as we get into the busy period, particularly in the beverage business. And we also have some favorable commercial terms with our customers and suppliers, which help drive the cash flow. So what we're anticipating for Q4 is that we will continue to see some reduction in inventory -- we've probably got another $100 million, $150 million to go to get back to a more normal level. So, we're expecting to see that start -- continue to come through in Q4 and realistically, based on the guidance, deliver the same cash that we delivered last year in Q4, and that was in a period last year where inventories were still increasing. So, we feel pretty confident in the guidance range that we've given in that $800 million to $900 million for the full year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brook Campbell-Crawford with Bar & Joy. Brook Campbell-Crawford: Can you just talk about the potential EBIT benefit in FY '24 from the investments and acquisitions over, I guess, the financial year-to-date, it's probably close to spend. So, I would have thought that will be a benefit to EBIT, but you didn't call it out earlier on as something they consider in that sort of EBIT bridge into next year? Ron Delia : Yes. Look, Brook, we've done really great so far, and these are all very small deals. The Mota deal that we announced today is a small one. It's really one with an eye towards the long term. It's a small business with less than 30 people sales around 20 million. It's not a business that's going to materially change the EBIT trajectory of the business going forward. And similarly, MDK in China is a business that's around $50 million in sales. The plant in Eastern Europe is just that. It's a plant. It's very -- running at a very low utilization. And what we're going to do is fill it by moving business from Western Europe into the low-cost hub that we've acquired in Eastern Europe. So all of these are relatively small, they all help incrementally move the ball forward, but none of them are going to have a meaningful impact on FY '24 earnings, which is why I didn't call them out. Brook Campbell-Crawford: Okay. And can you talk about your European business, volumes staying sort of mid-single digit in the March quarter. Your key competitor and number two player there can start here, talked about pretty solid growth actually volumes in the fourth quarter -- or sorry, the March quarter rather? And is there anything you can call out there to expand the gap performance between yourselves and the number two player there? Ron Delia : Well, I'm not going to comment on anybody else's performance. I can tell you, from our side, when we look at the market, we assess it through the lens of the scanner data at retail and what our customers are reporting. And we would say that certainly coming through this earnings season, that all stacks up with our performance is kind of like right on line with the average of what customers have reported and probably a little bit ahead of the retail scan data, which might suggest that some of the larger customers are taking some share. Michael Casamento : Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Reilly with UBS. Nathan Reilly : Ron, just a question on general cost inflation recovery, insist on core has been very good at recovering general cost inflation with customer price action over the last year or so. But just given the volume situation you're facing in terms of those declines and customer destocking, I just imagine those conversations with customers on price recovery are getting a little harder. So can I just confirm a successful in fully recovering general cost inflation in the third quarter and what you've baked into the fourth quarter guidance? Ron Delia : Yes. No. As I think I alluded to in response to one of the other questions, if we think about it from a year-to-date perspective or the third quarter, however you want to look at it, we've been fully recovering, general cost inflation. And that's about $250 million of price that we put into the market this year on a roughly equal amount of inflation. I wouldn't say it's harder. I would say that there is always a bit of a lag. If you think about our business, about 70% of it is contracted, 30% not contracted, right? So, we're certainly fully caught up with very little lag on the un-contracted portion of the business. On the contracted portion, as we roll contracts as they mature and we renew them, we reset pricing and we also expand the inflation coverage and shorten the time between price adjustments. That's just a function of the book of business and the customer or the contract book contract portfolio that we have. So, there's always contracts that need to be reset, and we'll have several that reset over the next 6 to 12 months. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Stahos with Bank of America. George Staphos : I hope you guys are doing well. Thanks for the details, Ron and Michael. I guess the one question I had relates to the Rigid business, relative both between cold fill and hot fill and then in turn versus other substrates. Ron, what are you seeing weaker performance in cold fill and in pre-forms relative to hot fill, when the hot fill product would be typically for a higher-end product and one that if the consumer is hunkering down, might be less predisposed to be buying versus traditional soft drinks or water? And then relatedly, your customers are seeing volatile order patterns, we empathize what you're seeing. Nonetheless, your volumes are weaker, certainly so far in beverage packaging than what we've seen from some of the other substrates, particularly cans. Do you think there's any sort of share shift occurring there? And if not, why not? Ron Delia : I think the starting point is where is the consumer right now at this point in time. And I think there's always been really strong alignment between the package format and the channel and the usage occasion. And if we go back over a long period of time, the pet bottle generally, whether it's cold fill or hot fill, has been predominantly through the cold channel. It's been predominantly single-serve whether it's hot fill or cold fill, soft drinks or sports drinks and the can has tended to be the value pack. And whenever times are tougher for the consumer and when they're gravitating more towards value and buying things in units of 12 or 24, that tends to be through the warm distribution channel and tends to be through retail, big box retail, and conventional retail and not through the convenience channel where most of our products go through. So, I do think that -- I wouldn't call it a substrate shift as much as I would just say, it's a consumer thinking with their pocketbook at this point in time and buying things at the lower price point per unit. Operator : We have time for one last question. And the last question comes from Cameron McDonald with E&P. Cameron McDonald : Just wanted to go back to the comments you made about the scanning data. And I was wondering if you could put that in context given your history of volumes? And what do you think that -- where does that fit relative to how bad it could actually be during your recession? And then a separate question for me just around when we talk about seeing channel shifts and more value oriented, can you talk about what's happening perhaps in some of the confectionery market exposure that you've got as well close? Ron Delia : Look, Cameron, I would say that generally, we're going to be reasonably well positioned in a recession because the end market exposure of the business now is as defensive as it's ever been. Basically, all of our sales are going into consumer staples fast-moving consumer goods or health care. And those through past economic cycles have held up reasonably well. I think we've got a softer consumer environment at the moment. At the same time, that were coming off a number of different dynamics that have led to lots of inventory in the system. And I'm talking about COVID and then the supply chain complexities and constraints that followed. That work itself through. I think to the extent there are recessionary conditions in some of our larger markets. I think that we would expect to continue to be well positioned if I think back to the global financial crisis, which is some time ago now. Our volumes were down low single digits through that period, and we were able to hold our earnings. So, I feel pretty good about where we're positioned, but we're not sitting around waiting or hoping. I mean that's point of the cost outs, the cost-out initiatives that we've described today and the pricing actions that we've taken to really make sure that we're that we're not expecting the consumer to return and volume to start to grow more robustly than it has been. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Ron for closing remarks. Ron Delia : Okay. Thanks, operator, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call today and for your interest in Amcor. And with that, we'll close the call. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's Amcor Third Quarter 2023 Results Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the call over to Tracey Whitehead, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Tracey Whitehead : Thank you, Mandeep, and thanks everyone for joining Amcor\u2019s fiscal \u201823 earnings call. Joining today is Ron Delia, our Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Casamento, Chief Financial Officer. Before I hand over, let me note the few items. On our website, amcor.com, under the Investors section, you will find today\u2019s press release and presentation, which we will discuss on this call. Please be aware that we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures and related reconciliations can be found in that press release and the presentation. Remarks will also include forward-looking statements that are based on management\u2019s current views and assumptions. The second slide in today\u2019s presentation lists several factors that could cause future results to be different than current estimates. Reference can be made to Amcor\u2019s SEC filings, including our statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q for further details. Please note that during the question-and-answer session, we request that you limit yourself to a single question and one follow-up, and then rejoin the queue if you have any additional questions. Over to you, Ron. Ron Delia : Thanks Tracey, and thanks everyone for joining Michael and myself today to discuss Amcor\u2019s fiscal 2023 and June quarter results. We\u2019ll begin with some prepared remarks starting as we always do with safety on slide 3. Safety is our most important value at Amcor and throughout fiscal 2023, we again made strong progress on our journey for continuous safety improvement across the Company. 69% of our sites remained injury-free for at least 12 months, and we reduced injuries globally by 31%. While we\u2019re pleased with these results, ultimately, it\u2019s not just the number of injuries we\u2019re focused on, but also the severity of the injuries that do occur. Tragically, in June, a contractor\u2019s employee lost his life at our Pondicherry site in India after falling from a roof. We immediately conducted a detailed investigation and we\u2019re deploying the learnings across all Amcor sites with the goal of eliminating the risk of similar accidents in the future. We\u2019re relentlessly focused on safety globally, and this tragic incident is a stark reminder of the importance of those efforts. Moving to our key messages on slide 4. First, Amcor delivered solid operating performance for the 2023 fiscal year. Adjusted EBIT was up 1% and we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and our industry-leading dividend. Across the organization, our teams demonstrated agility by taking action to navigate highly challenging and volatile market dynamics characterized by ongoing inflation, softening consumer demand and customer destocking, particularly in the second half of the fiscal year. Our ability to modestly grow adjusted EBIT under these circumstances was the result of proactive and decisive actions to effectively manage the areas under our control, which is our second key message. Our teams did an excellent job prioritizing pricing to recover increases in raw materials and general inflation. And as we entered the 2023 calendar year, we stepped up the intensity of our cost reduction efforts to drive productivity benefits. Additionally, we invested in structural initiatives including strategic plant closures that will deliver meaningful cost savings in fiscal \u201824 and \u201825. Third, as a result of these comprehensive actions, Amcor\u2019s well positioned to return to solid mid-single-digit earnings growth in the second half of fiscal \u201824, which also leaves us well-placed to grow at our long-term trend of high-single-digit rates thereafter. While we expect current market conditions to persist over the near-term for the entire industry, we\u2019ll continue to recover inflation and are confident the benefits from our cost reduction and productivity initiatives will have a sustainable positive impact on earnings leverage. Additionally, we\u2019ll be cycling weaker volume comparatives in the second half, and the headwinds we\u2019ve faced from the sale of our Russian plants and significantly higher interest expense are largely limited to the first half of fiscal \u201824. All these known benefits are largely within our control and underpin our expectation of a return to solid earnings growth in the second half without having to rely on a significant change in the demand environment. And finally, as we and the entire CPG industry continue to navigate a dynamic operating environment, Amcor remains laser-focused on executing against our long-term growth and value-creation strategy. We\u2019re well positioned as a recognized industry leader and we continue to pursue opportunities to invest in our strong underlying business, particularly through innovation and sustainability initiatives in faster growing higher value markets. We\u2019re also actively pursuing value-creating M&A such as a deal announced last week to acquire Phoenix flexible packaging in the high growth Indian market, and we\u2019re committed to returning cash to shareholders through a compelling and growing dividend and share repurchases. Moving to slide 5 for a summary of our financial results. Fiscal \u201823 and June quarter financial performance was well within our May guidance range as proactive cost and price actions helped counter ongoing inflation and increasingly soft and more volatile volumes as we progress through the year. Reported net sales for the year were up 1%, which includes an unfavorable currency impact of 3% and approximately $775 million of pricing to recover higher raw material costs. Organic sales were flat on a comparable constant currency basis as volumes were 3% lower, offsetting a price/mix benefit of around 3%. Full year adjusted EBIT of $1.6 billion was up 1% on a comparable constant currency basis, benefiting from strong operating leverage in the first half of the year and accelerated cost actions in the second half. Adjusted EPS of $0.733 per share was down 2% on a comparable constant currency basis. For the June quarter, sales were down 5%, positive price and mix of approximately 2% included recovery of $100 million of general inflation and volumes were at the lower end of our expected range, down 7%. Last quarter, we referenced accelerated demand weakness in March and April, and this persisted broadly through the June quarter due to a combination of lower consumer demand and continued customer destocking, including in priority categories, which also impacted mix compared with last year. While earnings were in line with our guidance, the June quarter is historically Amcor\u2019s strongest of the year, making it more difficult to flex costs. As a result, weaker volumes had a more pronounced impact on earnings and adjusted EBIT of $436 million was 7% lower than the prior year on a comparable basis. We continued to execute well on our capital allocation priorities, returning approximately $1.2 billion of cash to shareholders during the year through a combination of dividends, which the Board increased to $0.49 per share, and the repurchase of approximately 41 million shares or 3% of shares outstanding for a total cost of $431 million. Since 2020, we\u2019ve repurchased approximately 11% of our outstanding shares, and our industry-leading dividend currently yields around 5%. Our overall financial profile also remains robust with return on average funds employed at 15.4%. Slide 6 highlights the proactive actions we continue to take to manage the areas under our control. We\u2019ve been successful in pricing for inflation throughout the year, passing through a total of $1.1 billion to compensate for higher raw materials and general inflation, including labor, energy, and freight. We also delivered more than $200 million in annual cost savings through productivity initiatives, including a reduction of more than 1,200 full-time employees. And we\u2019re investing in structural initiatives that will deliver approximately $35 million in savings, primarily in the second half of fiscal \u201824 with an incremental $15 million benefit in fiscal \u201825. And importantly, we expect the benefits from these fiscal \u201823 cost actions and structural initiatives to have an ongoing favorable impact on earnings leverage. I\u2019ll turn it over now to Michael to cover more of the financials. Michael Casamento : Thanks, Ron and hi everyone. Beginning with the Flexibles segment on slide 7, fiscal \u201823 reported sales were in line with last year, which included recovery of higher raw material costs of approximately $515 million, accounting for 5% sales growth. Excluding the raw material impact and negative currency movements, sales grew 1% for the year, driven by price/mix benefits of 4%, reflecting our ability to continue to price to recover inflation across all Flexibles business groups. This was partly offset by 3% lower volumes. And while volumes in all regions were impacted by slower demand and destocking, particularly in the second half of the year, our strategic focus on higher value priority categories continued to drive solid sales growth for the year. Volumes in the pharmaceutical and pet care categories were especially strong, helping to limit the impact of broad-based lower volumes in other categories. As Ron mentioned, throughout the year, the business did a good job aligning operating costs with challenging market conditions, while pricing to recover inflation. This focus resulted in a 1% in adjusted EBIT for the year on a comparable constant currency basis. Margins remained strong at 12.8%, despite 100 basis-point dilution related to increased sales dollars from passing through higher raw material costs and general inflation. In terms of the fourth quarter, net sales on a comparable constant currency basis were down 5%, with positive price/mix of 2% more than offset by a 7% decline in volumes. This represents an accelerated volume decline compared with the March quarter, and was consistent trend across most regions. The greatest sequential declines continue to be seen in the North America and European markets, where overall June quarter volumes were lower by high single digits, consistent with softer retail scanner data, and with categories such as premium coffee, protein and healthcare also being incrementally impacted by customer destocking. Adjusted EBIT for the quarter of $387 million was 7% lower than the prior year on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting the impact of lower volumes, unfavorable mix and ongoing inflation, partly offset by benefits from continued pricing and cost actions. Turning to Rigid Packaging on slide 8. Fiscal \u201823 reported net sales were 4% higher than the same period last year, including approximately $260 million or 8% of sales related to the pass-through of viral material costs. Organic sales declined 3%, reflecting 4% lower volumes, partly offset by a price/mix benefit of 1%. In North America, overall beverage volumes for the year were down 6%. Hot fill volumes were in line with the prior year as new business wins in key category offset unfavorable consumer demand and customer destocking. In specialty containers, volumes were lower than last year, with growth in the healthcare, dairy and nutrition categories offset by weaker volumes in food, home and personal care. And in Latin America, volumes were down low-single-digits versus last year, which reflects challenging macroeconomic conditions across the region. Fiscal \u201823 adjusted EBIT was down 7%, as strong earnings growth in the first half was more than offset by challenging market conditions that accelerated through the second half of the year. Adjusted EBIT margin of 7.5% includes an adverse impact of approximately 80 basis points from the increased sales dollars related to passing through higher raw material costs and general inflation. Looking at the June quarter, comparable constant currency net sales were down 4%. Price/mix benefits of 2% were more than offset by a 6% volume decline, as lower consumer demand and customer destocking continued to impact the business, particularly in North America. On a comparable currency basis, adjusted EBIT for the quarter of $73 million was down $22 million against the strong comparative period. As Ron mentioned earlier, the June quarter is typically the seasonally strongest of the year, and together with volatility in customer order patterns, this limits the ability to fully flex costs. In an environment where production volumes are weaker, fixed cost absorption is also significantly lower, and the combination of these factors amplifies the impact on earnings. The team continued to manage the cost under their control well with additional headcount reductions and more plant shutdown days, and we continue to focus on cost actions as we manage through this cycle of softer demand and destocking. Looking ahead to the September quarter, we do not anticipate market challenges to materially improve, which will have an unfavorable impact on earnings compared with the same quarter last year. Moving to cash and the balance sheet on slide 9. Our financial profile and investment grade balance sheet remain strong. Leverage of 3 times on a trailing 12-month EBITDA basis is modestly up from last year, but is aligned with our expectations given the software demand and broad-based destocking through the supply chain. Adjusted free cash flow of $848 million was in line with our updated outlook, though below last year. This reduction mostly reflects lower accounts payable balances as we moderated our purchasing activities, partly to reduce inventories, but also in response to the soft demand environment. This is a timing impact which we expect will abate as we progress through fiscal \u201824. And whilst we have made good progress bringing down our inventory balances, with the reduction of more than $400 million from the peak levels in November \u201822, we will continue to focus on reducing overall working capital to support increase in cash flow. Turning now to the outlook for fiscal 2024 on slide 10. For the \u201824 fiscal year, we expect adjusted EPS of approximately $0.67 to $0.71 per share. This includes expectations that organic growth from the underlying business will be in the plus or minus low-single-digit range, as volumes are expected to remain weak, particularly in the first half. Share repurchases will result in benefit of approximately 2% and currency translation is expected to add a further benefit of 2%, assuming current exchange rates prevail for the balance of the fiscal year. This is expected to be offset by a negative impact of approximately 3% related to the sale of our three plants in Russia in December 2022, and a negative impact of approximately 6% from higher interest and tax expense. As U.S. dollar and euro interest rates have continued to rise, we expect interest expense for fiscal \u201824 to be in the range of $320 million to $340 million. In terms of cash flow, we expect to generate significant adjusted free cash flow in the range of $850 million to $950 million in fiscal \u201824, which represents growth of up to a $100 million over fiscal 2023. We have planned to repurchase at least $70 million of Amcor shares in \u201824, and we have been active on the acquisition front and we\u2019ll continue to pursue M&A opportunities. And as always, we\u2019ll evaluate our uses of cash as we progress through the year. Slide 11 shows that Amcor has a long history of delivering solid and consistent earnings growth, and the phasing of the earnings across the year has also been relatively consistent year to year. For fiscal \u201824, it\u2019s important to call out that phasing of comparable earnings growth is not expected to align with historical trends. We do not expect the challenging market dynamics we\u2019ve seen in the last two quarters to meaningfully improve in the near-term. And in the first half, we assume mid to high single digit volume declines. Given this demand outlook and the unfavorable impact related to higher interest expense, which is expected to moderate in the second half, we anticipate adjusted EPS in the first half of fiscal \u201824 to be down in the high-single-digit to low-double-digit range on a comparable constant currency basis when compared to the prior year. While it\u2019s more difficult to predict consumer demand, we do expect customer inventories will have largely normalized by the time we enter the second half of the fiscal year. Additionally, we have a number of tailwinds in the second half, all of which are within our control, including the benefit of approximately $35 million from structural cost saving initiatives building through the year, increased earnings leverage, resulting from ongoing benefits from price and cost actions, a reduced interest headwind and favorable prior year volume comparatives. The combination of these known factors supports our expectation that adjusted EPS grows mid single digits in the second half of fiscal \u201824 on a comparable constant currency basis. It also gives us confidence in resuming our long-term trend of high-single-digit earnings growth shortly thereafter. It\u2019s also important to highlight here that we do not need to see a significant change in the demand environment to return to solid earnings growth in the second half and beyond. So in summary, we believe the current industry and Amcor specific challenges will primarily be limited to the 2023 calendar year. We remain laser-focused on doing all we can to mitigate the impacts of these challenging conditions while continuing to execute our long-term shareholder value-creation strategy, and we expect to return to our historic high-single-digital organic growth trajectory as we progress through calendar year 2024. So, with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Ron to provide some longer term comments. Ron Delia : Thanks, Michael. Turning to our long-term commentary. Slide 12 highlights our strategic areas for investment where we see faster growing higher value opportunities to drive sustainable growth. On prior calls, we\u2019ve covered opportunities in healthcare and in M&A. And today I\u2019ll take a few minutes to talk about protein and the opportunities we see to deliver strong growth in the high-value protein category. Moving to slide 13, the protein category for Amcor includes packaging solutions for processed and fresh beef, pork, poultry, and seafood. And we like this category because it\u2019s a large addressable market, which historically has grown globally at attractive rates, driven mainly by an increasing percentage of the world\u2019s population able to afford to add protein to their diet. We also like the fact that there are many ways to differentiate and add value for customers, since protein packaging requires specialized, more sophisticated and increasingly more sustainable solutions to preserve and protect these premium products. Amcor\u2019s unique product offerings have enabled us to successfully grow our participation in the meat category over several years. Annual revenue from the sale of processed and fresh meat packaging now exceeds $1 billion. While inflationary impacts are currently creating challenging market conditions, looking forward, there are several reasons we believe Amcor can drive growth at a mid-single-digit CAGR over the medium term with margins accretive to our overall average. First, Amcor is well-positioned with a comprehensive product portfolio for processed and fresh meat applications, underpinning our development of better products, our strong capabilities, and significant investments in innovation, sustainability, and technical service. These are critical in an industry that relies on durable, high barrier solutions to preserve shelf life while providing convenience for the consumer in environmentally friendly formats. Second, we have a strong presence in North America, but our global scale and reach enables us to leverage our R&D network and installed capacity to transfer technical and process knowledge across regions as we actively pursue global growth opportunities. And third, there\u2019s a unique go-to-market model in some parts of the world where equipment purchases drive the subsequent sales of packaging films and technical services. Our recent acquisition of Moda positions us well because we\u2019re now able to provide a wholly-owned turnkey equipment solution aligned with this model, where efficiency and the ability to automate are some of the highest priorities for customers. With the recent investments to enhance our offering and go-to-market strategy, we\u2019re well-positioned to grow in this high-value market, and we\u2019re excited with the many opportunities to firmly establish Amcor as a preferred provider of fresh and processed meat packaging solutions globally. I just want to spend a minute on sustainability on slide 14. We continue to make excellent progress supporting the development of circular systems through the three pillars of our responsible packaging strategy, package design, waste management infrastructure and consumer participation. And we\u2019ve made significant advancements on the innovation and design front by developing more sustainable packaging solutions and increasing our use of recycled materials. We\u2019ll provide a more detailed update in our sustainability report, which is expected to be published in October. And we\u2019ve continued to collaborate with other industry leaders in various ways across the value chain to help support the development of the infrastructure required for a circular economy. For example, in May, Amcor, Delterra, P&G and Mars formed a strategic partnership to help reduce plastic waste in the Global South by providing access to waste management and recycling systems and by enhancing consumer education. We\u2019re also partnering with Licella and Mondel\u0113z to help promote a circular economy by bringing on stream one of Australia\u2019s first chemical recycling facilities. This is an exciting development in a market where Amcor\u2019s portfolio of recycle-ready flexible packaging solutions is already well above 90% and will provide local access to food-grade recycled material. So closing on slide 15, our teams are doing a good job navigating challenging industry dynamics by continuing to recover inflation and proactively taking actions to align costs with market conditions. We\u2019re confident in our long-term growth strategy. We have good visibility to factors well within our control that will see us returning to earnings growth aligned with our historic performance and our shareholder value creation model. And operator, with those opening comments, we\u2019re now ready to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instruction] Our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Please go ahead. Ghansham Panjabi : Hey guys. Good day. You mentioned that volumes for the first half of fiscal year \u201824 will be down mid- to high- single digits on a year-over-year basis. I think Michael mentioned that. But what are you assuming at this point for fiscal year \u201824 in context of the 3% decline that you reported in fiscal year \u201823? Ron Delia : Yes. So look, we\u2019re setting the business up to assume that the current market conditions essentially continue through the first half. So, we\u2019re expecting first half to look a bit like the fourth quarter with volumes down mid to high single digits. That\u2019s continued softening of demand and continued destocking pretty broadly across the geographies and segments that we participate in. But the second half, we\u2019re expecting more normal rates of volumes, more like flat to up low single digits. And that\u2019s really just assumes no more destocking and the fact that we\u2019ll be cycling easier comps. So, we\u2019re not baking in any big improvement in demand. And so all up, that would see volumes for the full year down sort of flat to down mid-single digits. That\u2019s the sort of midpoint of our guidance range would see us down kind of low single digits for the full 12 months. Ghansham Panjabi : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then in terms of the destocking, maybe you can just give us some insight as to the micro nuances between the major regions you have exposure to. And the categories that first started to see destocking, are you starting to see any sort of green shoots, if you will? Ron Delia : Yes. Look, the destocking has been relatively broad, and it\u2019s -- we\u2019ve been at it now -- we\u2019ve been living with it for a couple of quarters. The earliest categories where we started to see some signs of excess inventory in the system were those that were impacted the most acutely by the supply chain challenges over the last 12 to 18 months. So, we saw -- we\u2019ve seen destocking in the meat space. We\u2019ve seen it in the premium coffee space in particular. More recently, in the fourth quarter, we started to see a little bit of destocking in the medical packaging space. And then, certainly, in North America, in the beverage part of our Rigid Packaging business, we\u2019ve seen pretty pronounced destocking at a point -- at a seasonal high point in the year. Now we don\u2019t have a crystal ball, but we do anticipate that the destocking will be largely behind us by the time we exit this calendar year. And certainly, it will have a less meaningful impact as we head into calendar \u201824. If you think about it, our volumes for the quarter were down 7%. We would estimate that about two-thirds of that volume decline is the market and our customer performance and the remaining one-third is we would attribute to destocking. So certainly, as we move forward, and destocking starts to abate through the rest of this calendar year, certainly, that will have less of a negative headwind on our growth rates going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America. Please go ahead. George Staphos : Hi. Good day, everybody. Hope you\u2019re doing well. Thanks for the details. I guess, the first question is just a quick one on net interest. And I know qualitatively, what you said higher global rates, foreign exchange and the like. But the step-up even from the fourth quarter rate, which was $70 million, so $280 million run rate to the -- I think you\u2019re saying $320 million to $340 million for fiscal \u201824 is pretty steep. And so, is there anything specific we should be understanding in terms of what\u2019s behind that, Michael? Michael Casamento : Yes, sure. Look, I think overall, interest rates have continued to rise from this time last year, all through the year. So, we will be lapping higher rates as we exit. Using Q4 as a proxy is not the best quarter to use as a property for interest because that\u2019s our highest cash flow quarter, obviously. So, our interest expense is lower in that quarter, typically in comparison to the rest of the quarters as the cash flow comes through. So, that\u2019s really what we see. We are lapping some higher interest just by the way the rates increased as the year progressed. And there may be one or two further rate increases that we\u2019ve factored into the range. So that\u2019s where we get to that $320 million to $340 range. George Staphos : Understood. That\u2019s helpful, Michael. And Ron, back to demand and the consumer. To the extent that Amcor produces high-value, high-quality packaging for -- maybe one could argue, sure, they\u2019re staples, but more like affordable luxuries, if you will, premium coffee, protein, premium pet. I think we\u2019ve talked about it in the past, but do you think there\u2019s maybe a little bit more of a negative effect for your customers and therefore for you, given the environment we\u2019ve been going through with inflation? Why? Why not? And are you seeing any signs at all from your customers now asking you to somehow find cost reductions give back so that they in turn can maybe be a little bit more competitive at retail and drive their volume? Thank you. Ron Delia : Yes. Look, George, I think that we still believe the portfolio is really defensive and the categories are, for the most part, consumer staples. Now there are subsegments within segments where things might be a little bit more discretionary because of the premium attached to things like single-serve coffee systems or some of the premium pet food. But overall, across the portfolio, we still believe these categories are defensive. They\u2019ve proven that out over a number of economic cycles. But I think that we\u2019ve got a dislocation here that we haven\u2019t seen in 40 years around inflation. And we convince ourselves of the defensiveness of the portfolio at large by looking at the scanner data, and it\u2019s very broad-based, the weakness, in particular in Europe and in North America in the food business, where you see mid-single-digit declines. And I think generally speaking, others who\u2019ve reported publicly have experienced the same sort of volume effects that we have. So I think, yes, we do aspire to play at the high end of the market, and many of our products are at the premium end. But generally, we\u2019re in stable segments that will grow consistently through economic cycles. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brook Campbell from Barrenjoe. Please go ahead. Brook Campbell : Just one on the buyback. Obviously, there\u2019s $70 million left on the existing program. But what\u2019s the thinking about potentially a new program at some point through FY24? Is that the priority once you get through the $70 million, or are you leaving some cash flow there for M&A, or is the priority to sort of pay down some debt and reduce that leverage ratio? Thanks. Michael Casamento : Yes. Thanks, Book. I appreciate the question. Look, I think if you look at what we\u2019ve done over the last couple of years, we bought back over $1 billion of shares. And in addition to that, we\u2019ve certainly started to get back on the M&A approach as well. So, we\u2019ve done three deals this year and in \u201823 and also announced another deal just recently. We\u2019re planning to do the $70 million this year. So, we\u2019ll close out that buyback. And I think if you think about our capital allocation approach, I mean, clearly, the priority is to invest back in the business through the CapEx for organic growth, which we\u2019ve stepped that up over the years, and we\u2019ll continue to do that this year. We grew the CapEx, and we\u2019ll have a similar amount as we head into \u201824, taking into account the demand environment. Next year, we obviously pay the dividend and then that growth over time. And then we\u2019ve got $300 million or $400 million left over for -- ideally to put the work on M&A or buyback. And so, think about the last couple of years, we\u2019ve certainly covered that capital allocation on the buyback side and now putting a little bit more into M&A. So, we\u2019ve got $70 million in the outlook for \u201824. As always, we\u2019ll continue to model cash flow as we work through the year and we\u2019ll get back to you if that changes. Brook Campbell : And just a question on espresso. Your customer there seems pretty keen to move product into, I guess, fiber compostable pods. Could you just confirm if you have the capability and products to perhaps offer that format as well, given, I guess, you\u2019ve got already a lot of capital put into those plants that are co-located, I believe. And if that\u2019s the way that that customer goes, can you sort of participate and offer a different format? Thanks. Ron Delia : Yes. Look, we have a broad offering of fiber-based options for a number of different categories. And so, I think we\u2019re going to be well covered as products move between substrates, whether it\u2019s aluminum or plastic or plastic to fiber or whichever direction the segment evolves. But I would say that that is a niche at the moment. It\u2019s about expanding the pie. Not every consumer will be willing or capable or interested in composting. And we know as well as our customer that the sustainability profile of the aluminum capsule is as attractive as any. It\u2019s a product, it\u2019s a capsule that can be made with 100% recycled aluminum and can be recycled over and over again. And there\u2019s been a lot of investment in the recycling loop for that particular format. So, we\u2019re not concerned about the long-term viability of that format. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Cameron McDonald from E&P. Please go ahead. Cameron McDonald : Can I just ask a question around the destocking that you\u2019re talking about? And my understanding is also that not only are we getting destocking and consumer weakness, but we\u2019re also seeing down trading in -- from sort of more premium products to more home brand type products. Is that having an impact on the packaging demand profile as well and -- either the price or margin that you generate from that premium product in more of the home brand space? Ron Delia : Yes. Look, thanks for the question. It\u2019s a different story in North America from Europe. So, the private label in general has picked up a few percentage points of share broadly across the European market. It\u2019s been -- it\u2019s just slightly now ahead of where the share for private label was in 2019. In North America, we\u2019re not -- we\u2019re still not quite back to the share that private label had in 2019 at large. And ultimately, as products or as sales migrate to private label from branded or vice versa, we\u2019re pretty well exposed. And so, we\u2019ve got a reasonably broad participation in the store brand side of the business, such that those share shifts are not really going to have a material impact on our volumes. And the packaging is essentially the same. That\u2019s part of the private label formula. And so from a margin profile perspective or differentiation perspective, we\u2019re sort of indifferent. Cameron McDonald : Okay. Great. And just coming back to the previous question on sustainability of packaging, there seems to also be move to potentially be sort of fiber-based and alternative packaging for beverages. What work are you doing around that, please? Ron Delia : Yes. We have a pretty extensive platform that we call AmFiber, which is fiber-based packaging for a range of product categories, we see the opportunity, particularly in the confectionery space to move from plastic-based products to fiber-based products, culinary, some formats like spices and food additives. So, our work on the fiber side is pretty extensive. There\u2019s a little less activity in the beverage space, to be quite honest. But generally speaking, AmFiber is a big platform for us, and we\u2019re optimistic about the growth outlook. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : Yes. Thank you. Good evening, everyone. I guess, the first question is I think about the quarter and then moving into \u201824. I just wanted to ask a question on mix. And I look at it in the Flexibles segment, mix is still a 2% positive contributor in the quarter, less than it had been earlier in the year, but still positive year-on-year, although I look at kind of some of the parts of Flexibles that I\u2019ve historically thought had contributed to that mix in terms of healthcare and protein and pad and premium coffee. And those all were down kind of consistent with the overall segment volumetrically. So, just help us maybe dissect kind of what\u2019s happening in mix and kind of where you see that trending through fiscal \u201824? Ron Delia : Yes. Look, we had unfavorable mix in both segments in the fourth quarter as you -- and you pointed out the reasons why. I mean, some of the categories that you would expect to be positive contributors to mix, were softer in the fourth quarter, in particular, pet care even slowed a bit in the fourth quarter as did medical. What you\u2019re referring to is price and mix together. And I think you\u2019ve got to bear in mind that we\u2019re still experiencing reasonably high levels of inflation, and we still have been and continue to be actively pricing to recover inflation. So for the fiscal year, we priced up about $1.1 billion between raw materials and general inflation, about $300 million to $340 million of that was general inflation. And so, you\u2019re seeing price and mix combined. So, you\u2019ve got positive price offset by [Technical Difficulty]. Adam Samuelson : Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. And if I could just ask a follow-up on your -- kind of the move or just the focus on proteins and the investments in equipment. I mean you\u2019ve got some pretty large incumbents when you think about that market, especially on the fresh meat side with equipment. I mean, what do you think the business needs to scale and grow more significantly there where you\u2019ve got -- you do have a competitor who has a pretty significant incumbent market position? Ron Delia : Yes. Look, that\u2019s clear. And most of our markets are pretty competitive, including that one. What we needed as a starting point was a full system offering, which we didn\u2019t have. And so, the Moda acquisition allows us to offer the primary packaging equipment. It will offer -- will allow us to offer technical services and parts. And that all combines with what we believe is industry-leading film technology, including in that space. And the films in the protein space are amongst the most demanding of any that we produce. If you think about the functional requirements for meat packaging, there\u2019s obviously a barrier that\u2019s required to preserve shelf life. There also tends to be the need for function resistance. You got to run these packages through the lines, the packaging lines at high speed, so the processing requirement is quite high. And we believe we\u2019ve got some advantaged film technology and the ability to now go to market with a full solution, including equipment and aftermarket service just completes the puzzle for us. So, we\u2019re really excited about the market. It\u2019s also one that we can leverage over our global footprint. And it really represents a pretty visible revenue synergy from the Bemis acquisition of several years ago now. So, we\u2019re pretty -- we\u2019re excited about it. And look, every segment is competitive, and we just have to -- we have to compete and earn the business, obviously. But we\u2019re pretty optimistic we\u2019ll be able to do that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sam Seow from Citibank. Sam Seow : Just I wanted to follow up on some earlier comments that you\u2019ve got [Technical Difficulty] volume growth assuming in the second half of \u201824 kind of growth expectations. So just to confirm, you\u2019re saying if volume growth starts to come back, you\u2019d expect upside to that mid-single to high single digits in the second half? Ron Delia : Yes. We\u2019re not banking on a much improved demand picture. We think it\u2019s more prudent for us to set the business up to assume that volumes are going to be challenged through the year. So for the first half of the year, we\u2019re expecting volumes to continue to be down mid single digits, mid to high single digits. Second half of the year, we would expect volumes to be flat to maybe up low single digits. And we believe that\u2019s possible without much of an improvement in the underlying demand profile because we are pretty confident that we\u2019ll be through the other end of the destocking cycle by the time we get to calendar year 2024. So yes, there\u2019s no expectation of a dramatic improvement in the overall demand environment that\u2019s baked into our guidance. Sam Seow : That\u2019s helpful. And just a follow-up on potential volume growth. Looking through the year, it looks like Rigid [Technical Difficulty] decline followed by Flexibles as we think about potential [Technical Difficulty] logical to expect Rigid to come back quicker than Flexibles, or is there something to call out there? Ron Delia : Look, we would expect the volume trajectory to be roughly comparable. Now Rigid has got another strong -- another seasonally strong quarter to get through. And we\u2019re not expecting the business to be all the way back from a demand perspective in the fiscal first quarter. In fact, we expect continued softness and continued destocking in the North American beverage business in particular. But generally speaking, if we take a 12-month view, our expectation is that the volume trajectory would be similar across the two segments. And look, as you pointed out, this is the swing factor in our guidance range. So, to the extent that the volume picture improves, that would be a driver of us getting to the higher end of our range or beyond. We\u2019re just not setting the business up to expect that. We\u2019re taking the cost actions that you\u2019d expect us to take, and we\u2019re going to be really prudent before we anticipate demand coming back. Operator : Our next question comes from Daniel Kang from CLSA. Please go ahead. Daniel Kang : First one, maybe to Mike. Just in regards to your FY24 guidance. Can you talk us through your assumptions and maybe expectations on price/mix and any input cost tailwinds? Michael Casamento : Yes, sure. I think if I take the raw material side first, we experienced in Q4, we saw raw materials pretty well across the board come down in that mid-single-digit range after a pretty benign Q3. And in Q4, we saw -- we just saw a modest tailwind as we\u2019re still cycling through the higher inventories and also reduced purchases. So, as we look forward on the raw materials side, what we see into the first quarter really is a pretty benign environment, basically flat raw material, maybe slightly down, but that would translate into a relatively modest tailwind in the first quarter. After that, we\u2019ll see where things go on the raw materials side. Look, on the price/mix, we\u2019ll continue to price for inflation. So, as we\u2019ve said in the remarks throughout, we expect to continue along the price and cost initiatives that we\u2019ve already been taking. So inflation, albeit we\u2019re still expecting inflation, perhaps maybe at slightly lower levels than we\u2019ve been experiencing. But we will continue to see inflation as we work through \u201824. So we\u2019d expect to see some price to offset that as well as cost. And then on the mix side, look, I think initially, we would expect some negative mix really as we saw in Q4, which we touched on the call already today. So things like healthcare, pet food, coffee, et cetera, as we\u2019re just cycling, some stronger parities on that front, we would expect mix to be perhaps a negative particularly as we start the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Johnson from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Richard Johnson : Ron, one of the things we\u2019re hearing quite consistently now from a lot of your major customers is some very significant SKU rationalization programs that they\u2019re having. In particular, I believe I\u2019m right in saying that Unilever taking the SKU is down by 25%, which is a huge number. I was just interested in getting your opinion on what that means, if anything, for yourselves. Ron Delia : Yes. Look, it\u2019s maybe not as pervasive as it might seem from some of the public comments. But to the extent that SKUs can get rationalized, it\u2019s generally a good thing for us. There\u2019s two things going on. There is a bit of SKU rationalization. The other thing that\u2019s happening is the continued evolution towards more sustainable formats and more sustainable SKUs. And I think SKUs have proliferated across all the categories that we service. You think about the variety of the store shelves certainly here in the U.S., it\u2019s really been explosive growth over a long period of time and the number of SKUs that are available. So, anything that simplifies the business and takes out unnecessary or non-value-adding complexity is generally a good thing. And then at the same time, helping that process along by introducing more sustainable formats is also advantageous to us, too. So I think we\u2019re in lockstep with the customers that you probably have in mind, and on that journey or both of those journeys at the same time. Richard Johnson : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then just finally, you referred to your volume pressure\u2019s being more skewed to developed rather than emerging markets, which, of course, is pretty understandable. I was just interested if we get a bit more detail on where you sit in EM because others and there are reports that there\u2019s been significant down-trading in emerging markets as well away from multinationals to local brands in particular, and then obviously for many large packaging company or global packaging companies, that might be unhelpful. So, I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of why you may have outperformed in EM relative to others? Thanks. Ron Delia : Yes. Look, it\u2019s a good question. It feels more like the underperformance in the DMs relative to the EMs is the thing that\u2019s not easy to understand. I mean we saw volume declines in Europe and North America, kind of high single digits in the fourth quarter, again, entirely consistent with what others have reported and the scanner data, et cetera. But the EM business has held up, but we had volumes in Asia, in the emerging part of Asia, basically flat in the quarter. Latin America was down mid-single digits. So both of those regions had better volume performance than the two big developed markets. Look, I don\u2019t know. I think we have a pretty compelling value proposition in emerging markets generally as an innovation leader and a sustainability leader. And then our participation in our customer mix generally looks like the market. So, if I take a business like China, we actually have more of our sales to local customers than to multinationals. And basically, that reflects the market shares of those respective customer groups. So, I think we\u2019re well balanced for the differential growth rates that you\u2019re referring to. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Purtell from Macquarie. Please go ahead. John Purtell : I just had a couple of questions. Just first one for Michael, just in terms of interest expense. What percentage is fixed and floating now? And are you looking to fix more to essentially kind of lock in your interest expense? Michael Casamento : Yes. Look, John, so -- traditionally, we\u2019ve been in that 50-50 fixed-floating mix but more recently, so over \u201823 and looking into \u201824 a more 70-30. So, would take a bit of the volatility out of the mix there on that front. So, that\u2019s where we sit today in that 70-30 range, fixed-floating. John Purtell : See that is pretty stable. Michael Casamento : Yes. John Purtell : And just a second question, Ron, on acquisitions. Are you seeing more opportunities now that fit your criteria? And obviously, valuations are generally coming down. And will you sort of naturally play at the smaller to medium end? Obviously, we saw Constantia recently sold to private equity. Ron Delia : Yes. Look, we have been more active. So we\u2019ve done four deals in the last 12 months. They\u2019re all of the small variety and single plant deals. So, the first comment I would make is, yes, there are more things that seem to be coming to market. I mean we went through a period of pretty pronounced market dislocation through COVID and then the supply chain constraints and now some softer volumes, but I think sellers are more likely to bring things to market now than they would have been, let\u2019s say, two years ago. So the pipeline is relatively robust, and we\u2019ve been able to convert four small deals in the last 12 months. The second part of your question about the size really just reflects the nature of the participants in our space. There\u2019s just by number, and I hold a lot more smaller single plant businesses than there are large multibillion-dollar businesses like the one that you mentioned. So I think just generally, you\u2019re going to see us execute more smaller deals. It doesn\u2019t mean for a second that we would not love to deploy bigger amounts of capital. So, we would be on the lookout for medium and larger sized deals as well. I just think by the law of numbers, will suggest that most of the deals will be the smaller variety. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Reilly from UBS. Please go ahead. Nathan Reilly : Question about just the cost out program, how much flexibility you might have around that just in terms of whether that destocking trend continues a little bit longer than, I guess, what you\u2019ve currently forecast, how much flexibility you might have just to sort of go a little bit harder around the cost base? Ron Delia : Yes. Look, we\u2019re getting after it pretty good would be the first thing I would say. So we\u2019re going after it reasonably hard. You have to remember also that the business has been optimized through the last several years, I mean, through the Bemis integration, we took a number of plants out of the network. A couple of years before that, we took a few out of the rigids network as well. So the business is reasonably well optimized. But that being said, there\u2019s more opportunity. And we\u2019ve announced 3.5 plant closures already. There\u2019ll be more. The common with demand remains depressed, then there is the opportunity to do a little bit more, although I would also point out that the ultimate path to value creation for the Company is to grow, and we want to make sure that we\u2019ve got the productive assets available when demand normalizes. We don\u2019t see any of the demand challenges that we\u2019re experiencing right at the moment, we don\u2019t see a secular. We believe this is a cycle, and we believe it\u2019s an inflation induced cycle and that volumes will return. And I mean, certainly, the destocking impact will abate. But we do preserve the flexibility here if we need to go after it harder on the cost side, we certainly will do that. Adam Samuelson : Okay. Thank you. And I guess, just following through in terms of historically, you\u2019ve managed cost inflation quite well. But I guess -- and I\u2019m talking about the general cost inflation in terms of being able to pass that through to customers with higher pricing. But in a period that\u2019s characterized by a high level of destocking and lower demand, can you give us an update on how you\u2019re going just in terms of recovering the general cost inflation and just around that, maybe just a comment around just how that sort of inflation has been trending recently? Ron Delia : Yes. Well, as far as the trend, I think we are starting to see inflation moderate. I\u2019m not sure that we\u2019re seeing prices fall anywhere, but we\u2019re seeing the rate of increase certainly decline across most of the cost buckets. I\u2019d say labor is still -- increase in kind of mid-single digits. We still have higher energy costs than we had a couple of years ago. Freight might be one area where we\u2019ve seen some declines off of the peaks. So, it\u2019s still a real fact of life, number 1. Number 2, I think we have been successful in pricing to recover. We remain kind of fully recovered, if you will. Last year, the general inflation running through the business was over $300 million, and we offset that with price. We\u2019ll expect to continue to do that as we go into fiscal \u201824. We also reset prices with new contracts. And as you expect that probably two-thirds of the business is contracted, maybe three quarters of the business is contracted. The average duration is 2 to 3 years, maybe 4 years. So every year, you\u2019re turning over a portion of the revenue base and having an opportunity to reset pricing to reflect the current dynamics in the current inflation conditions. So, it remains a fact of life. But I certainly feel like we\u2019re coming out the other end of the inflationary cycle. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of James Wilson from Jarden Australia. Please go ahead. James Wilson : I was just wondering if you could give us maybe a little bit more color firstly on how your inventory and working capital management is progressing heading into \u201824. Michael Casamento : Yes, sure. I can take that one there. Look, we were obviously building inventory this time last year, and that was back on -- there was supply constraints in the marketplace. A lot of different activity happening, and we certainly built inventory during that period as well as putting through over the last two years, put $3 billion roughly through the top line in terms of price to recover raw material and inflation. So, both of those factors have impacted working capital. But from November, we really worked down our inventory levels. And from the peak in November, we\u2019ve taken nearly $400 million out and $200 million of that was just in Q4. We haven\u2019t seen the full benefit of that really come through from a cash flow standpoint yet because at the same time in this -- particularly in the second half of the year, we\u2019ve seen a much lower payables position. So our -- although our inventory has come down kind of point-to-point over the year around $200 million, our payables have also actually come down about $500 million. So, if you look at our working capital performance during the year, we had a cash outflow of around $230 million. Really, that\u2019s the payables impact. So, as we\u2019ve seen the lower demand signals we\u2019ve started to reduce our purchasing in addition to that, taking inventory out of the system. And so, we did see a negative impact on working capital as a cash outflow in the year. As we look forward, we\u2019ve still got work to do on the inventory side, and we\u2019ll continue to focus on that. And I think the payable side will start to normalize as we work through some of this softer demand. So, as we work through \u201824, certainly not anticipating a cash outflow at the level that we had in FY23. And we hope to be able to get to a more neutral position by the year-end. From a working capital sales standpoint, we\u2019re about 9.5% working capital sales at the moment. Typically, we would be more in the 8% to 9% range. So I think we\u2019ve certainly got some opportunity there as well as you look forward over the next couple of years. James Wilson : And guys, just in terms of how much of that is sort of baked into your free cash flow guidance for next year, am I right in seeing that as sort of a buffer on the downside, or is that potentially already baked into what you\u2019ve come out with today as guidance? Michael Casamento : Yes. So the cash flow guidance for \u201824 is $850 million to $950 million. So, it\u2019s a $100 million range, which is really the working capital range in there. So, at the midpoint, probably still going to see a little bit of cash outflow, but we\u2019ve obviously got some opportunity to do better than that, and that\u2019s really the working capital is the key factor there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Ryall from Rimor. Please go ahead. Scott Ryall : Hopefully mine are quite quick questions. I was wondering if you could comment on what you\u2019ve seen in terms of the changes of your customers in terms of their price expectations around responsible, sustainable packaging, please, and the willingness to pay a premium, I guess, over the virgin products? How that\u2019s changed over the last 12 months, that\u2019s what I\u2019m asking. Sorry. Ron Delia : Yes. Look, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s changed much. I mean I think customers understand that there\u2019s more value to be ascribed to a product that\u2019s got a better sustainability profile. And I think consumers understand that as well. It\u2019s another element of functionality that is now expected in consumer products. And that is the environmental profile is at least neutral, if not positive, overall. And there\u2019s value associated with that. And so, most of these products do have a premium. There\u2019s also the scale curve that we need to work through. We\u2019re introducing new products and like any new product with less volume and less scale benefits typically tends to start out at a higher price point. It will evolve over time. But I think as brand owners look to meet their own commitments and you take the full range of different costs, including regulatory costs into consideration, the more sustainable products offer higher value and therefore, they tend to carry a bit higher price, particularly at the outset. Scott Ryall : Okay. Great. Thank you. And then secondly, I just wanted to ask a bit more about the Licella plant in Australia. And just for a bit more detail, am I right, firstly, that you\u2019ve invested directly in Licella, then can you just give us a few stage gates or timings around when that plant will come into operation? And I guess, thirdly, just discuss in the U.S. market where we\u2019ve got a lot of advanced recycling facilities being built or already built. They tend to be linked with one of the major petrochemical companies. How do you think about the risk around using effectively the solution with a start-up, please? Ron Delia : Yes. Look, there\u2019s a lot there, and it\u2019s a pretty exciting project. So I\u2019m glad you asked. I mean, the investment we\u2019ve made, firstly, I would just make sure it\u2019s clear, it\u2019s a modest investment, several million dollars that\u2019s in the single digits of millions of dollars. We\u2019re co-investing with Mondel\u0113z and we\u2019re investing in Licella as the technology provider for this particular plant that\u2019s going to be built in the western suburbs of Melbourne and Altona. We\u2019re pretty excited because it will bring recycled content -- chemically recycled material to the Australian market with local production, which is great because the collection of soft plastics as they\u2019re referred to in Australia through the REDcycle program needs an outlet. This plant will be a perfect outlet for the recycled plastics that are collected. And then the brand owners in Australia are differentiating and are really advocates for more sustainable packaging, including packaging made with recycled content. So, there\u2019s a captive supply of the primary input, which is waste plastic. And there\u2019s a captive market, which is the brand owner and the Australian consumer looking for more sustainable packaging. So, we\u2019re really excited about this. In terms of stage gates, look, it\u2019s a pretty extensive build, as you\u2019d imagine. It\u2019s -- the site has been selected. If there\u2019s a chance, the plant could be operational by the end of calendar \u201824, but it\u2019s really an 18- to 24-month project. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America. Please go ahead. George Staphos : Ron, I was asking earlier, just are you seeing any signs from your customers at all as they\u2019re trying to find ways to stimulate growth? Maybe they\u2019re considering more promotional activity at the request of their customers that they\u2019re now coming back to their packaging suppliers and looking for your and other companies\u2019 support perhaps with givebacks cost reductions, productivity, what\u2019s happening there, if anything, on that front? Thanks. And good luck in the quarter. Ron Delia : Yes. Thanks, George. Look, others have talked about potentially increased promotional activity. We really haven\u2019t seen much of that of any great consequence. I mean, you see it a little bit more in the beverage space in the summer season. But really, I mean -- and there are pockets of promotions here and there, but nothing that\u2019s pervasive enough that we would point to that\u2019s got a material impact on our volume outlook. I mean, it would be great if it happens. That would be upside. We\u2019re certainly not banking on increased promotional activity leading to higher volumes for Amcor. If it happens, as I said, it would be great. And the pricing dynamic is, as we\u2019ve discussed on this call, I mean, there\u2019s continued inflation recovery that\u2019s necessary. And while it\u2019s moderating, it\u2019s still a fact of life that we\u2019ve got to recover continued inflation through our cost base, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re busy doing. Operator : I would now like to turn the call over to Ron Delia for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Ron Delia : Thanks, operator, and thanks for everyone\u2019s interest in Amcor and for joining our call today. We appreciate it, and we\u2019ll speak to you at the end of the first quarter. And we\u2019ll end the call there. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our [Technical Difficulty] today\u2019s call. Please disconnect.",

After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] I\u2019ll now turn the conference over to Tracey Whitehead, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Tracey Whitehead : Thank you, operator, And thank you, everyone, for joining Amcor's Fiscal '24 first quarter earnings call. Joining today is Ron Delia, our Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Casamento, our Chief Financial Officer. Before I handing over, a few items to note. On our website, amcor.com, under the Investors section, you'll find today's press release and presentation, which we'll discuss on this call. Please be aware that we'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures and related reconciliations can be found in the press release and the presentation. Remarks will also include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions. The second slide in today's presentation with several factors that could cause future results to be different than current estimates. Reference can be made to Amcor's SEC filings, including our statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q for further details. Please note that during the question-and-answer session, we request that you limit yourself to a single question and one follow-up and then rejoin the queue if you have additional questions. With that, over to you, Ron. Ron Delia : Thanks, Tracey, and thanks everyone for joining Michael and myself today to discuss Amcor\u2019s first quarter results for fiscal 2024. We'll begin with some prepared remarks before opening for Q&A. As seen on slide 3, Amcor continues to be an industry leader in safety with a recordable case frequency rate that has trended significantly downwards over many years. In our first quarter, 65% of our sites around the world were injury-free for the past 12 months, with more than 30% injury-free for three years or more. Safety is deeply embedded in Amcor\u2019s culture, and providing a safe and healthy working environment is the number one focus for our global teams. Turning to our key messages on slide 4, first, we delivered a first quarter result in line with our expectations despite a challenging demand environment characterized by continued weak consumer demand and ongoing customer destocking. Against this backdrop, our teams executed well and remained focused on managing the areas under their immediate control. Second, the first quarter performance puts us on track to deliver against our full-year guidance, which we are reaffirming today. Our expectations for phasing through the two halves of the fiscal year have not changed, and we continue to expect adjusted EPS for the second half of fiscal \u201824 to grow by mid-single digits over last year on a comparable constant currency basis. As a reminder, there are several reasons why we expect a stronger second half, including continued benefits and increased earnings leverage from ongoing price and cost actions, additional benefits from structural cost initiatives building through the year, a reduction in interest expense headwinds, and favorable comparisons to the prior year's volume performance. Our third key message is we're making significant strides in our sustainability efforts within our own operations and in the design of our products. Our commitment to sustainability and the creation of a circular economy for packaging represents one of our most promising avenues for growth as we enable our customers to meet consumer demand for more responsible packaging. And fourth, we remain confident in our long-term growth and value creation strategy. The strength of our market positions and underlying business, our proven execution capabilities, and our consistent capital allocation framework collectively make a compelling case for investment in Amcor. Moving to slide five for a summary of our financial results. September quarter financial performance was in line with our expectations as we continued to take proactive cost and price actions to align the business with market dynamics, including ongoing inflation and continued weak and volatile volumes. Sales were 6% lower than last year on a comparable constant currency basis, which reflects price mixed benefits of approximately 2% offset by an 8% decline in volumes, which was within the range we anticipated for the first half of fiscal \u201824. As expected, volume weakness persisted and was broad-based through the September quarter due to a combination of lower consumer demand and continued customer inventory destocking. Fiscal first quarter adjusted EBIT of $358 million was 5% lower than last year on a comparable constant currency basis. Benefits from ongoing cost actions and price and mix benefits were more than offset by the weaker volumes. And our teams drove working capital improvements which resulted in free cash flow being well ahead of the same period last year. We expect to deliver strong cash returns to shareholders this fiscal year with returns of approximately $200 million in the first quarter, up more than 10% over last year through a combination of share repurchases and a growing dividend, which the board increased to $0.125 per share. I'll turn it over now to Michael to provide some further color on the financials and our outlook. Michael Casamento : Thanks, Ron, and hello, everyone. Turning to our flexible segment performance on slide 6, net sales were down 8% on a reported basis, which includes a favorable impact of 3% related to movements in foreign exchange rates and an unfavorable impact of 2% related to the pass through of lower raw material costs. On a comparable constant currency basis, net sales were down 6%, reflecting 8% lower volumes, partly offset by price mixed benefits of approximately 2%, as the business continues to take pricing actions to recover inflation. First quarter volume trends remain similar to last quarter with all regions continuing to be impacted by lower consumer demand and destocking. Volumes across North America and Europe were down high single digits with Europe a little softer than North America. Volumes in Latin America were also down high single digits and in Asia volumes were broadly in line with last year as continued growth in India in a return to positive volume growth in China offset lower overall volumes in Southeast Asia. The impact of destocking across the flexible business was similar to last quarter, accounting for approximately one-third of total volume declines. By end market, we continue to see stock demand and destocking impact categories, including protein, coffee, liquid beverage and healthcare. Pet care and confectionary categories remain strong in key markets with volume growth delivered in the quarter. Adjusted EBIT was down 5%, incomparable constant currency terms for the quarter, reflecting favorable operating cost performance and price mixed benefits offset by the lower volumes. Turning to Rigid Packaging on slide 7, reported sales were 6% lower than last year, including the favorable impact of 1% related to movements in foreign exchange rates and the unfavorable impact of 1% related to the path to a lower raw material cost. On a comparable constant currency basis, net sales were 6% lower than last year. As price mixed benefits of approximately 1% were offset by 7% declining volumes. In North America, volumes in both the beverage and specialty containers business continued to be impacted by lower consumer demand and similar levels of custom destocking as experienced last quarter. In the beverage business, overall volumes were down 9%, although mixed trends were favorable. In specialty containers, volume growth in food was offset by weaker volumes in health care and home and personal care. In Latin America, while market demand was somewhat softer across the region, our business is benefiting from new business wins and overall volumes were up mid-single digits compared with last year. The businesses in Brazil and Colombia delivered strong volume growth, offsetting lower volumes in Mexico. Adjusted EBIT was 6% lower than last year on a comparable constant currency basis. Reflecting lower overall volumes partly offset by price mix benefits and favorable cost performance. In terms of cash flow and the balance sheet on slide 8, our adjusted free cash flow performance was in line with our expectations and meaningfully better than last year, enabling us to reaffirm our full year cash flow guidance, which I will come back to shortly. The cash flow improvement of more than $170 million compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2023 mainly reflects our focus inventory reduction efforts, which have resulted in a decrease of more than $500 million since the peak in November 2022. We remain highly focused on working capital performance, which is particularly critical in this environment of continued inflation and rising interest rates. We also continue to return cash to shareholders, purchasing approximately 3 million shares during the first quarter for a total cost of $30 million. And consistent with our comments in August, we expect the allocated total of at least $70 million towards share repurchases in fiscal 2024. In terms of the balance sheet, we maintain a strong investment grade credit rating with leverage at 3.3 times, in line with our expectations at this time, taking into account the usual seasonality of cash flows and the short-term impacts of cycling the divestiture of our Russian business earnings and higher working capital levels. We expect leverage will decrease to approximately 3x by the end of the fourth quarter. Turning to our outlook on slide 9, our Q1 performance was in line with our expectations, and we are reaffirming our full-year guidance for adjusted EPS of $0.67 to $0.71 per share. We continue to expect the underlying business to contribute organic earnings growth in the plus or minus low single-digit range, and share repurchases will result in a benefit of approximately 2%. The US dollar has strengthened slightly since August, and we now anticipate currency translation to result in a benefit of up to 2%. This is expected to be offset by a negative impact of approximately 3%, related to the sale of our three plants in Russia in December 2022. And we also expect a negative impact of approximately 6% from higher interest and tax expense. Our expectations for interest and tax expense for the full year remain unchanged, with interest in the range of $320 million to $340 million and a tax rate in the range of 18% to 20%. In terms of cash flow, we are training better than the first quarter last year and we continue to expect significant adjusted free cash flow in the range of $850 million to $950 million in fiscal \u201824 representing growth of up to $100 million over last year. Our plan to repurchase at least $70 million of Amcor shares in 2024 is unchanged and we continue to pursue value creating M &A opportunities. Turning to slide 10, Amcor has a proven track record of strong and consistent long-term earnings growth. As noted on our call in August, it is important to call out that fiscal 2024 phasing of comparable earnings growth is not expected to align its prior years. Consistent with our comments from last quarter, we anticipate challenging market dynamics will persist in the near term resulting in similar mid to high single digit volume declines through the December quarter. Combined with the unfavorable impact of higher interest expense, which is expected to moderate in the second half, our guidance for the first half is unchanged. Compared with last year, we expect that adjusted EPS for the six months of fiscal 2024 will be down in the high single digit to low double digit range on a comparable constant currency basis. For the second quarter, this implies adjusted EPS and EBIT in absolute terms will be broadly in line with or marginally lower than the September quarter just finished. As Ron mentioned earlier, our confidence in delivering mid-single digit comparable constant currency earnings growth in the second half of fiscal 2024 and resuming our long-term trend of high single digit earnings growth shortly thereafter is supported by visibility to several known second half factors. First, we have the benefit of approximately $35 million from structural cost-saving initiatives that builds through the year. Second, we have increased earnings leverage resulting from ongoing benefits of price and cost actions taken. Third, as I noted earlier, a reduced interest headwind. And fourth, we expect that customer inventories will have largely normalized as we progress through the second half and we will benefit from favorable prior year volume comparatives. Finally, and also consistent with our comments in August, we do not need to see a significant change in the demand environment to return to solid earnings growth in the second half and beyond. So with that, I'll turn the call back for Ron to provide some longer-term comments. Ron Delia : Thanks, Michael. Before we open the call to questions, I want to provide a few words on the building blocks that inform how we think about growth over the longer term and then finish with a brief preview of our 2023 sustainability report, which will be released in the coming days. Looking at slide 11, we have multiple drivers that have enabled us to deliver solid and sustainable earnings growth over the longer term, including opportunities in priority categories, emerging markets, and through innovation. These have not changed and collectively give us confidence in our ability to deliver future growth in line with our historic trend rates. Turning to slide 12 and some highlights from our forthcoming sustainability report, which covers the significant strides we've made in product development and operational sustainability. Sustainability provides meaningful opportunities to differentiate and drive growth and value. This is particularly important in today's landscape as consumers focus on the critical need for more sustainable, high-performance packaging solutions, and as customers increasingly look to work closely with responsible, sustainability-focused partners. Starting with our own operations, since launching Amcor\u2019s EnviroAction program 15 years ago, we've diligently worked towards reducing our greenhouse gas emission intensity and have achieved a cumulative reduction of more than 40% against our 2006 baseline. Along the way, we've also increased our ambition and committed to net zero emissions by 2050 in line with the science-based targets initiatives. In fiscal 2023, we delivered an annual reduction in absolute emissions of 10% through a range of measures, including an increasing focus on the use of renewable electricity. In addition to carbon-related objectives, we maintain robust targets for reducing water and waste. 100% of our sites have a water management plan in place, and 143 of our sites have achieved zero waste to disposal certification, which is an increase of around 20% in the last 12 months. Transitioning to slide 13, we also continue to make significant progress in supporting the development of circular systems and what we believe are the three requirements for responsible packaging. Package design, waste management infrastructure, and consumer participation. Amcor\u2019s industry-leading innovation capabilities position us well to develop the more sustainable and high-performing packaging consumers are looking for, and we believe this is one of our greatest opportunities for growth and differentiation. Today, almost all of our rigid packaging and specialty carton portfolios are fully recyclable. Looking at our flexibles portfolio, 61% fiscal 2023 sales were recyclable ready, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation definition, meaning these solutions are designed to be recycled using current technologies where infrastructure is available. Additionally, another 28% of sales had recyclable-ready alternatives available, providing a meaningful growth opportunity when our customers are ready to transition more of their portfolios to sustainable solutions. In total, 89% of our flexible packaging portfolio is designed to be recycled or has a recycle-ready alternative, a six percentage point increase over fiscal 2022. Our use of recycled content also continues to grow, increasing by 29% over fiscal \u201822, reflecting our commitment to work closely with customers to reduce the use of virgin materials. Over the past four years, we've more than tripled our use of recycled material, and we're confident we'll achieve 30% recycled content across our portfolio by 2030. We also continue to leverage our position as an industry leader and trusted resource to help our customers navigate their sustainability journeys. As an example, in fiscal \u201823, we hosted several Amcor webinars which were attended by hundreds of customers and covered topics such as the use of recycled content in food contact and healthcare packaging and the impact of evolving regional regulations on packaging options. Through these efforts, we're reinforcing our value proposition and helping customers accelerate conversion of their packaging portfolios to comply with emerging regulations and to meet their own sustainability goals. We take pride in the strides we've made across all aspects of our sustainability journey. We eagerly anticipate the opportunities ahead, which will continue to differentiate Amcor and also advance our growth objectives, all while contributing to the creation of a circular economy for the packaging industry. In summary on slide 14, fiscal \u201824 has started in line with our expectations. We have reaffirmed our earnings and cash flow guidance today as we continue to have confidence and visibility to solid earnings growth in the second half. We're making good progress on our sustainability agenda, and we remain focused on our strategy to deliver long-term growth and value creation. Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Ghansham Panjabi : Thanks, operator. Good day, everybody. Ron, could you give us a bit of a sense as to what your base case is for volumes for fiscal year \u201824? And I'm just trying to get a sense as to the sequencing beyond the first quarter, which was down 8%. Would it be sort of 4Q before you hit that inflection point on a year-over-year basis? Ron Delia : Thanks for the question, Ghansham. Look, firstly, as we entered the year, we flagged that we expected volumes to be down mid-to-high single digits for the first half. And that's exactly what we saw in the first quarter. And we expect similar trajectory for the second quarter as well. As we look forward to the second half, we do expect a trajectory to improve. So we would expect that the destocking will abate as we get past yearend and as we start to cycle several quarters of inventory reductions, we would expect that impact to start to moderate. And we would expect for the second half volumes more reasonably or flat to up to plus or minus low single digits. I think it's more reasonable to expect that the trajectory will improve now exactly the rate at which that trajectory improves in the second half is difficult to predict. But certainly as we get into the fourth quarter, the comps get a lot easier. And we would expect things to be improving as we exit the year. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay, thanks for that, Ron. And I'm just trying to understand the divergence also between volumes which are quite a bit lower against improved price mix as you've established over the last couple of quarters and sustainability of that dynamic. And typically during periods of weaker volumes, there tends to be some sort of a trade-down and you actually are showcasing the opposite. So more color on that, please. Ron Delia : Well, look, mix over a longer period of time over multiple years is a major source of earnings leverage for us and has been over a long period of time. As we emphasize higher value segments, both product segments and market categories, mix is a very important part of our playbook. For this year, on a full year basis, we expect mix to be more or less neutral. We've had a reasonably good start in the first quarter with positive mix in both segments. We would expect that probably will continue in the second quarter, but for the full year, we would expect that might normalize a little bit. The reason for that is some of the segments that are higher value have declined at a lower rate than some of the lower value categories. But as we look forward into the second half, we think that the healthcare destocking will continue and ultimately that will balance out the positive first quarter. So all up relatively neutral for fiscal \u201824, but on a multi-year basis, mix is absolutely part of the earnings algorithm going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Kang with CLSA. Daniel Kang : Good morning, everyone. I guess the first question for me is on destocking cycle please, persist in the quarter. Are you seeing any evidence or signs of destocking easing as we walk into the second quarter? Perhaps you can comment on what you're seeing on customer stock levels as well. Ron Delia : Yes, look, I think we're using the term destocking. I think what we're seeing is more broadly is just inventory reductions. Destocking might imply that inventories started at a higher level. And I think that's certainly true in some categories that were subject to more of the supply chain constraints and raw material shortages over the last 12 to 18 months. There certainly were some inventory accumulations, but I think we've got a few different dynamics that are driving the inventory reduction trend. The first is for those categories that started at a high level, obviously they're working down the excess at a time when consumer demand has softened. And also carrying cost of inventory is now much higher than it's been in a long period of time. So I think that we're seeing a number of companies including Amcor try to drive inventories down to lower levels than they've been in quite some time. I know that we are certainly on that path. So I don't expect that trend to be beyond to be passed us in the second quarter, particularly as we're heading towards a yearend and cash flow at yearend becomes an important metric that companies are driving towards. So we would expect that the destocking will abate in the second half but not in the second quarter. Daniel Kang : Got it, thanks Ron. Secondly, I'm just interested in the progress of the new packaging products AmLite, AmFiber, et cetera. Realize it's early days, but can you comment on the volume growth and customer adoption that you're seeing and the pricing premium that you're achieving? Ron Delia : Yes, look, we're really excited about some of those platform products that you mentioned, AmLite, which is a recyclable ready retortable structure, AmFiber, which is a paper based solution, AmSky, which eliminates PVC and PVDC from blister packaging. We think that we've got some really special products there with a really compelling value proposition for customers that are trying to drive their own sustainability agenda. It is early days. Several of those products though are generating real sales. So AmPrima which is also a recyclable-ready alternative, AmSky, AmFiber, they're all each generating sales in the tens of millions of dollars, low tens of millions of dollars, but real meaningful sales. AmSky, it's early days and it's primarily oriented to the pharma industry, so the qualification period is a bit longer. But we are in active trials with a whole range of customers on that one as well. So we continue to be really excited about those platforms that you've asked about. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. I was hoping maybe first talk about just the performance in the quarter from the difference between volume and comparable constant currency operating profit growth and this very little volume you leverage in the period and to contrast the fiscal \u201823 experience, maybe just Ron still more color kind of how are you able to now that gap and volumes on down, mid to high single digits, kind of keeping the profit declines that narrow. Ron Delia : Got it. Look, it's just been really aggressive pulling the cost lever really aggressively. And we continue to do that through the back end of fiscal \u201823 and into the start here in the first quarter of fiscal \u201824. So you might recall in August, we talked about the cost actions that we took in fiscal \u201823 where we reduced costs by over $200 million. We reduced headcount by over 1,200 people. We had pulled the procurement lever really hard. We cut overheads. All of that continued in the first quarter and actually accelerated. So in the first quarter coming off a year where we took $200 million of cost out, in the first quarter we took another $70 million of cost out versus the first quarter of the previous year. And so that's really resulted in improved earnings leverage and much, I'd say a much more dynamic ability to flex costs in the face of weaker volumes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. George Staphos : Hi, everyone. Good morning. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I just want to make sure it's two questions per or one question per. I don\u2019t want to overdo the quota here. Ron Delia : George, for you, it's two. George Staphos : Okay. I'll try to keep them good then. So I guess the first thing I wanted to ask is, in an environment where we're still to some degree waiting for customers, your customers, to begin promoting more aggressively to try volume, if you agree with that premise, are you starting to see that? And how does that reconcile with your wanting this to push more innovative new products, new product sustainability, which are typically going to have a higher price point? Who's winning that tug of war right now as you think about it? And are we seeing more promotional activity? Ron Delia : Look, it's anecdotal at best, George. I mean, there's, I think a general recognition across the customer base that the price lever has been pulled really hard. And you see that from the results of a range of consumer companies that price has been a real driver of revenue growth more so than volumes. And maybe that, maybe those two variables can be brought back into better balance over time. And you do hear anecdotally, more customers talking about reprioritizing volume or balancing their mix a little bit more towards volume. We need to see it, and we haven't seen it yet. And so we're not setting the business up on the expectation that happens. In fact, our second half earnings uplift that we're expecting is not at all levered to an improved demand environment and is not at all predicated or dependent on consumers taking more active approach to promos. George Staphos : Thanks Ron. And the second question, broadly, can you talk a little bit about the momentum you apparently are seeing in protein packaging? You have a new high barrier when that you highlight on one of the slides. You have your recycle ready ecotype package. Is there a way to put a quantum size? What kind of momentum you're seeing? What kind of incremental revenue you're getting and broadly why you are gaining this momentum in the market given that you're the smaller player in the market. Thanks, and I'll be back if there's time later on. Ron Delia : Okay. Look, I think it's the early innings of our journey on protein, in particular our journey as a full service solutions provider in meat and protein packaging, which includes the ability to offer. equipment now as a result of the acquisition that we made earlier this year in Moda. It's early innings. I think that we are picking up some modest pieces of business along the way, but I would also point out that meat sales have been weak. We're in a down part, a down cycle, or a trough, let's say, a low point of the cycle in beef in particular. And so meat sales have actually been weak across the company in the first quarter. It's a long game, and we're in the early innings. And so I would say that we're really confident in the value proposition that we have and that we're building. We think we've got some really special films, and we think we've got a really special comprehensive offering that includes now equipment and service. But it's very, very new, very recent. The Moda acquisition is only a few months old. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sam Seow from Citi. Sam Seow : Good morning, good evening, all. Thanks for taking my question. Just a simple one on the balance sheet. Just wondering if we guide, get back second half volume stabilization. Would that result in net debt outside your range or would there be enough in the seasonality and the unwinding of working capital to bring that debt irrespective of [inaudible] continued to decline? Michael Casamento : Yes, thanks for the question, Sam. I can take that one. Yes, look, I mean, we finished the quarter with net debt kind of $6.5 billion $6.6 billion and leveraged at 3.3 times, which was right in line with where we expected it to be. And that takes into account the relatively normal seasonality of the cash flows from fourth quarter to Q1. We typically see a tick up in leverage versus we were at 3x in June. The other factors impacting leverage are really on -- through temporary impacts. Firstly, we're lapping now three quarters of the vested Russia earnings and that's being reflected in the last 12-months EBITDA and that's ahead of us getting the benefit of the restructuring which is going to start to come through in H2. So you'll start to see that improve absolutely. And then the other one is really the higher than normal working capital levels. We've been driving inventory down but at the same time payables have come down at a faster rate really just on the back of the lower demand environment. So again we'd expect that to start to normalize as we get into the second half and we'll get the leverage back to 3x by the end of June. So that's kind of the way we see it and as we look forward from there, there'll be further opportunity for improvement particularly in the working capital as it continues to normalize and as we cycle through the full 12 months of the Russia and the benefits from the restructuring that we're going to get into the P&L. So we're on track there. Sam Seow : Got it. And just maybe a follow-up. You talked at length about your volume expectations of the year. Maybe thoughts on pricing kind of expires through given end mark weakness and ongoing destocking. Ron Delia : Well, look our pricing strategy has been first and foremost to compensate for inflation and that's our approach, simple as that, we've had inflationary pressure on the cost base for 12 to 18 months now and as a result we've taken price as a high priority from an industry leadership perspective and certainly prioritized price and inflation recovery over volume. Rates of inflation are starting to ease. We haven't seen large parts of the cost base go through experience decreases yet, but the rate of inflation has eased and so our pricing, the pace of our pricing will ease as a result and beyond that our pricing approach is really just a price for value. If we have a differentiated value proposition, there's an opportunity to generate a positive price but that's something that needs to be earned every day in the marketplace. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Roxland with Truist Securities. Mike Roxland : Thank you, Ron, Michael Tracey and David for taking my questions. Actually, just question just had one question really. The company has made solid progress, streamlined the portfolio, another $70 million, sub saving this quarter, closing plants, realigning production, headcount reduction. If when volumes begin to improve, should we expect to see a reversal of this and you putting more capital to work in new plants, increasing headcount? Or really does your existing footprint, as it stands today, have enough excess capacity to absorb incremental volumes without any additional investment? Ron Delia : Yes, it's a great question. I think the short answer is we're going to be well set up when volumes come back and I think we're going to get even stronger earnings leverage as volumes return. We're taking really two sets of actions on the cost side. So the first, the $70 million that I referred to earlier that you just referenced is really ongoing productivity oriented benefits where we're taking shifts out, reducing headcount, driving procurement, optimizing the overhead and SG&A part of the business, kind of steady state but aggressive belt tightening, I would say. That's one form of cost reduction and I don't think a lot of that, some of it will come back obviously as volumes come back you need to add. You might need to add shifts. But we will be in a much better position from a leverage perspective as volumes return. So that's on that side. The second stream of cost takeout relates to more structural initiatives, which are more of the restructuring type, which are plant closures and more permanent and more deep cutting overhead reductions. We really haven't seen the benefits yet from those initiatives. Those will start to build in the second half, as Michael referred to earlier. We expect to get about $35 million of benefits from more structural initiatives in the second half. And those also will be long lasting and sustainable, because we're going to be taking out several plants in the network that we can compensate for with the remaining footprint. And in many cases, when we close a facility, we relocate the productive assets into another facility, and we don't really take capacity out necessarily. So I think we're going to be well positioned when and if volumes return. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Richard Johnson with Jefferies. Richard Johnson : Thanks very much. Ron, can I just return to the subject of price, and in particular, the US protein market? I mean, I'm interested in the comments you make, and I'm just trying to reconcile that with what others in the market are saying, and they're referring to significant overcapacity in that market, which makes sense given how weak the end market is, which is leading to acute price pressure because of that unused capacity. Just be interested to get your thoughts on that. Ron Delia : Yes, I don't know that the pricing pressure or the intensity of the competition is any more so at the moment in that segment than it has been in the past, or that it will be in the future. You have to remember as well that the assets that are deployed against that segment are fungible across a range of categories. So we have film assets that produce into the protein market, also produce specifications for dairy and a number of other segments as well. So it's certainly not a market that we look at as being overly capitalized or having much excess capacity. Richard Johnson : And then as you sort of spread that through the US around the different categories, I mean, can I extrapolate from your comments around how that you think positive price makes trend, that's really across all the categories or are there any areas where price is starting to give back price, which inevitably you would expect given how far price has gone at some point that will normalize, correct? Ron Delia : Look I think it's going to be a function of inflation. The rate at which pricing changes in this industry I think from this point forward will be primarily a function of the rate and the direction of travel of inflation. It's not been an industry over the years that's had positive price in the absence of value, it's been an industry that is compensated for inflationary cost pressures and I think that's kind of where we're at right now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Cameron McDonald with E&P. Cameron McDonald : Good morning, Ron, Michael. And can I just ask a question on slide 10? So you've got the average of high single digit of 8% from \u201814 to \u201823, but if we think about the environment, we had interest rates collapsed to zero during that period. You've had a significant transformational acquisition with Bemis. You've had the buybacks, et cetera. When you then talk about the high single digits expected long term, how do we marry that up? Or do you still think that there are significant M&A opportunities and the synergies that will create? And then but I suppose I come back to that interest rate environment; you've got a significantly higher interest rate that's going to be impacting that EPS. Ron Delia : Yes, look, it's a good question because it's really a segue into why we're confident that we're going to get back to kind of high single digit growth rates going forward. And we just believe in the conviction of our formula that served us well over many years and that is that volumes in a normal environment will grow sort of low single digits. We will get leverage in terms of higher rates of profit growth than that because the mix will improve over time and as we generate more productivity in our operations. So low single digit volume growth will translate into higher rates of profit growth. And then the business generates a substantial amount of cash and really excess cash, excess to the needs of the business from a CapEx perspective and to fund the dividend. And with that extra cash, our first priority will be to do acquisitions as we've done over a long period of time and short of acquisition opportunities will buy back shares. And so you go from low single digit volume growth to something higher than that mid-single digit type profit growth organically and then the cash flow and balance sheet optionality to generate further EPS growth through either acquisitions or share repurchases. So that's the formula. That's the formula that's delivered the 8% over almost a decade. And that's the formula that we'll expect to deliver the same types of earnings growth rates going forward. Cameron McDonald : Thanks. There's a follow up to that just on the M&A. When you think about the industry at the moment, you've spoken about the industry doesn't really have real price power without value. You've got a changing expectation around sustainability. We've obviously seen WestRock and Smurfit get together. Do you think the industry needs to more significantly and aggressively consolidate to change some of those industry dynamics? Ron Delia : Well, look, we have been big beneficiaries and we've driven a lot of consolidation over the years. I think what's important is industry structure and industry dynamics at a segment level. The fact is that there are a lot of players that are very small in the industry. So when we think about our M&A agenda, it's largely going to be bolt-on. We've been quite active even in the last 12, 15 months or so. We've done four small deals and you can continue to see, you can expect to continue to see us do that. Look, a lot of the value that comes out of those deals is cost synergies. I think that's where most of the value is going to come from in this, particularly in this type of environment and we're going to be active participants in the M&A space. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Reilly of UBS. Nathan Reilly : Thanks, Ron. Just a follow-up in terms of free cash allocation point. Can you talk about where deleveraging sits in the context of the allocation of excess free cash flows? Michael Casamento : Yes, I mean obviously we're committed to an investment-grade balance sheet. And so for us, that kind of, we've had been in the range of 2.5x to 3x leverage for a long time and that's where you should expect us to sit as we move forward. So to Ron's point, as the earnings grow, the cash flow grows and we can reinvest that in the base business. So you should expect CapEx over a period of time to increase as well. So we've been increasing our level of CapEx to grow organically. That's been in that 3% to 4% range. It's now, as we look longer term, that's probably going to be more in that 4% to 5% range. That's going to drive the organic growth and we still have cash left over to invest in the M&A agenda as a priority and again grow earnings through that, create value and then do buybacks. And so as you look at all that, that we would continue to maintain that leverage in that 2 .5x to 3x range. So that's how you should think about it. The excess cash will be deployed in that way. Operator : The next question from the line of John Purtell with Macquarie. John Purtell : Good morning, Ron and Michael. Hi, Tracey. Just a couple of questions, if I could. The first is on BOP1, obviously there's been concerns across the sector and it's obviously all still sort of long term in terms of potential impacts on food consumption and packaging demand but still very early days but do you have any general observations, Mike? Ron Delia : Yes, I do, John. I think firstly I would just yes, I just want to reinforce that we have seen no impact whatsoever on demand in our segments from reduced consumption resulting from these drugs so the first point I want to make is that we've seen no impact as of yet. I think in terms of trying to estimate the future impact, I think there's some things that we, there's plenty of things we don't know and there's some things that we do know based on history. I think what we don't know is the rate of adoption of these drugs. We don't know what the impact on total consumption will be. We don't know what will happen when people go off the drugs in large numbers so there's a number of unknowns that I think totally time will tell. What we do know is the food and beverage industry over many, many years over decades has been fantastic at innovating to address consumer needs as they change and evolve over time. Think about the evolution towards lower fat, low sugar, less salt, organic. The food and beverage industry has navigated those trends really successfully through innovation and through adapting product portfolios to suit whatever consumers are prioritizing at that point in time. So we know that that's been the history and that's been the track record and I expect that would be the same going forward. And the other thing that we know is to the extent there's reduction in portion sizes or serving sizes, it tends to and has historically been very good for packaging intensity. And units of packaging have tended to go up as portions have gone down and as serving sizes have been reduced. So I think it's early days, as you said. I would lean more on the things that we know to have been true historically and probably put more emphasis or more weight on those factors than the things that we don't know at this stage. John Purtell : Got it. Thank you. And just second question for Michael, if I could. Page 11 of the news release shows that reconciliation between reported and adjusted earnings. We can see that hyperinflation impacts were higher than last year and Russia-Ukraine costs were higher as well. So what were the key drivers of that? And should we expect to see those Russia-Ukraine costs reduce going forward? Thank you. Michael Casamento : Yes, sure, John. I can take that one. Look, the Russia-Ukraine costs are really the, that's the cost of the restructuring. So we've moved into the program and Ron touched on the program earlier, the structural program where we've committed to spend about $170 million in cash from the Russia proceeds across some plant closures, so there'll be 7 to 10 plant closures, some SG&A rightsizing. And we've, so they are the restructuring costs there and they're going to continue through the year. You'll see those continue on. It's, and obviously from that restructuring, we're going to generate the $50 million in EBIT benefits, $35 million of which will come in H2 and then a further $15 million into FY25. So you should expect to see a continuation of some cost in that line. In relation to Argentina there was, Argentina is a hyperinflation economy and we have to account for Argentina certain ways and really that's just, there was a devaluation in August and that's the devaluation impact on the monetary assets, which was higher than it was in the prior year. But again that seems to have eased at the moment, but we'll see where that goes as we work through the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brook Campbell-Crawford with Barrenjoey. Brook Campbell : Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. Ron, just earlier on, you mentioned about the destocking in healthcare segments likely to continue in the second half. Correct me if I'm wrong, I think you mentioned that. Just what, can you provide some color there on why you think that's going to play out and why you might have more visibility on destocking in that part of the market versus other categories that you serve? Thanks. Ron Delia : Yes, good question. You've got that right. I did refer to destocking accelerating really through the first quarter in health care, especially in the medical device side of the business. And it really comes down to the fact that there were some real supply constraints over the last 12 to 18 months in that segment or in these products that we supply into medical, predominantly, but also pharma in some product categories where we and the rest of the industry live through some real raw material shortages, which I think led to some stock buildup. in some segments. And so we're now on the other end of that and the raw materials are now more available. There's no longer a shortage and we can supply in real time. And so customers are sitting on a reasonable amount of inventory that needs to be worked down. And I think we started to see that in the first quarter. I think we'll see that continue into the second half fiscal year. Brook Campbell : Okay, thanks. And just one quick follow-up on slide 13. You may just talk to some progress you're making on designing the packaging to be recycled and great progress there over the years. But in flexible packaging, there's still 11% of the portfolio that isn't designed to be recycled and there's no trials underway at the moment by the looks of that graph. So can you just talk to that part of the portfolio? What's the plan? And do you have a commitment still to have it 100% of that portfolio designed to be recycled by 2025? Thanks. Ron Delia : Yes, look, we're going to continue to shrink that part of the graph. So the 11% you're referring to is 6% lower than it was a year ago. And we've been making really good progress. It's substantially improved over even three, four years ago. And we're going to continue to close that gap. Look, are we going to get all the way to 100 %? I'm not sure. I think we're going to get really close. Some of the more sophisticated structures where the material is providing multiple types of functionalities, whether it's barrier or sealing strength or physical strength is a number of different components that go into some of the more sophisticated materials that we make. Those will take the longest, but we're still at it. We're hard at it and we haven't wavered in our ambition to get to 100%. And so we've got our sights on closing that gap. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. George Staphos : Thanks for taking the follow on. I'll make it quick guys. So Ron, if we think about the $200 million last year of temporary savings, if that's where you framed it and then the $70 million so far this year, at in a day, how much of that truly will be temporary and how much you think will be structural? I know it's hard to say, we won't hold you to the basis point, but if you were in our seat trying to model Amcor, what would you try to bake in? And then just a minor question. I thought I heard you say, or Michael maybe with you, that 2Q in terms of earnings and EBITDA might be flat to slightly down versus 1Q. I just wanted to make sure I heard that correctly. Thanks guys and good luck in the quarter. Michael Casamento : Yes, so I can take the second point there, George. Yes, you heard that correctly. I mean Q2, Q1 and Q2 typically are pretty similar. If you look over the history of Amcor, they're pretty similar. We're not expecting anything to be different in this dynamic. I mean, Q2 is going to be broadly in line with Q1, perhaps marginally less. But H1, as per our expectations that we've outlined, so no change there whatsoever. Ron Delia : Yes, look, on the cost side, George, I'm not going to parse it down and give you a number. What I would say is most of the cost that's come out is come out of the operational side. The overhead portion of the cost reduction is certainly going to stay out. On the plant side, to the extent we've driven procurement benefits, those will be sustained. And then to the extent that we've taken costs out by removing shifts, then obviously we'll put those shifts back on as volumes return. So, I would just describe it more in terms of the buckets of costs that have come out. We don't think about that whole quantum of cost as being temporary necessarily. We do think there's some that stays out of the business, even as volumes return. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question and answer session. I will now turn the call back to Ron for closing remarks. Ron Delia : Okay, thanks again to everyone who's joined the call today. Thank you for your questions, and thanks for your interest in Amcor. And, operator, with that, we'll close the call. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your line.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Amcor's First Half and Second Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tracey Whitehead, Head of Investor Relations. Tracey, you may begin your conference. Tracey Whitehead : Thank you, operator and thank you everyone, for joining Amcor's fiscal 2024 first half and second quarter earnings call. Joining today is Ron Delia, our Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Casamento, Chief Financial Officer. Before I hand over, let me note a few items. On our website, amcor.com, under the Investors section, you'll find today's press release and presentation, which we will discuss on this call. Please be aware that we'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures and related reconciliations can be found in the press release and the presentation. Remarks will also include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions. The second slide in today's presentation lists several factors that could cause future results to be different than current estimates and reference can be made to Amcor's SEC filings, including our statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q for further details. Please note that during the question-and-answer session, we request that you limit yourself to a single question and one follow-up and then rejoin the queue if you have additional questions. With that, over to you, Ron. Ron Delia : Thanks Tracey and thanks everyone for joining Michael and myself today to discuss Amcor's second quarter and first half results for fiscal 2024. We'll begin with some prepared remarks before opening for Q&A. As seen on Slide 3, our focus on safety remains unwavering, and our significant commitment to providing a safe and healthy work environment continues to be rewarded. 70% of our sites have been injury-free for the past 12 months or longer, and we've experienced a 17% reduction in injuries when compared to the first half of fiscal 2023. Safety is deeply embedded in Amcor's culture and is the number one priority for our global teams. Turning to our key messages on Slide 4. First, our reported earnings per share for the second quarter and first half were modestly better than the expectations we set out in October and improved working capital performance helped drive a year-over-year increase of more than $100 million in adjusted free cash flow. Second, our financial performance through the half was supported by strong and proactive, focus on controlling costs. This helped us offset second quarter volumes that were a couple of percentage points lower than we anticipated. Our teams around the world continue to respond doing an excellent job proactively taking further cost actions. Third, our first half financial performance puts us on track to deliver against our full year guidance, which we are again reaffirming today. Relative to the first half, we believe Q2 was the low point for earnings growth and we continue to expect the trajectory of adjusted EPS growth to improve through the second half of fiscal 2024, including delivering mid-single-digit adjusted earnings growth in the fourth quarter. Our confidence is supported by our improved earnings leverage as well as a number of known factors we'll cover in more detail later that will benefit earnings through the second half of the fiscal year. Additionally, our volume trajectory has improved generally through January and this underpins our confidence that Q2 marked the low point for volumes. Finally, we remain confident in our long-term growth and value creation strategy and in our ability to deliver a combination of strong earnings growth and a compelling and growing dividend. The strength of our market positions, execution capabilities, and consistent capital allocation framework collectively continue to make a compelling investment case for Amcor. Moving to Slide 5 for a summary of our financial results. Organic sales on a comparable constant currency basis were down 8% for the half and 10% for the quarter. Price/mix benefits were around 1% for the first half and flat in the second quarter, reflecting moderating inflation, which resulted in reduced pricing actions by our teams. Volumes were down 9% for the first half and down 10% for the December quarter. Second quarter volumes were modestly lower than our October expectations, with the main difference being an acceleration of destocking, especially in the month of December. First half and December quarter adjusted EBIT was $709 million and $352 million, respectively, modestly above our expectations. On a comparable constant currency basis, declines of approximately 6% in both periods reflect lower volumes, partly offset by benefits related to decisive and proactive cost actions taken across our businesses in response to evolving market dynamics. In total, our actions reduced costs by more than $200 million in the first half compared to last year, with a reduction of more than $130 million achieved in the second quarter. Adjusted EPS was $0.313 and $0.157 per share respectively, also modestly above our earlier expectations. For both periods, this would count 10% on a comparable basis, reflecting lower adjusted EBIT and the unfavorable impact of higher interest costs. Working capital improvement remains a focus and helped drive free cash flow for the first half, well ahead of the same period last year and in line with our expectations. And we returned approximately $390 million of cash to shareholders in the first half through a combination of share repurchases and a growing dividend, which has increased to $0.125 per share. I'll turn it over now to Michael to provide some further color on the financials and our outlook. Michael Casamento : Thanks Ron and hello everyone. Beginning with the Flexibles segment on Slide 6. Year-to-date, net sales on a comparable constant currency basis were 8% lower, which largely reflects weaker volumes. Volumes were down 9%, mainly due to lower market and customer demand and accelerated destocking. In North America, first half net sales declined at high single-digit rates, driven by lower volumes in categories, including meat, liquid beverage and healthcare, which more than offset growth in the condiments, snacks and confectionery categories. In Europe, net sales declined at low double-digit rates, driven by lower volumes, partly offset by price/mix benefits. Volumes were lower in snacks, coffee, healthcare, and in unconverted film and foil. This was partly offset by higher confectionary volumes. Across the Asian region, net sales were modestly higher than the prior year. Volume growth in Thailand, India, and China helped offset lower volumes in the Southeast Asian healthcare business. In Latin America, net sales declined at high single-digit rates, driven by lower volumes mainly in Chile and Mexico, partly offset by growth in Brazil. First half adjusted EBIT was 5% lower than last year on a comparable constant currency basis, as a result of lower volumes, partly offset by favorable price/mix benefits and ongoing actions taken to lower costs, increased productivity, and strengthen operating cost performance. EBIT margin of 12.6% was comparable to prior year despite a 50 basis point unfavorable comparison related to the sale of our Russian business last year. For the December quarter, reported sales were down 9% on a comparable constant currency basis, and price/mix was relatively neutral compared with last year. Volumes were down 10% in the quarter, reflecting continued soft market and customer demand. Destocking also continued through the quarter, accelerating in the month of December and was particularly impactful in healthcare where volumes were lower than last year by double-digits. In response to market dynamics, the business continued to take decisive cost actions, focusing on operating efficiencies, delivering procurement benefits, limiting discretionary spend, and advancing structural cost reduction initiatives. This resulted in another quarter of strong performance, partly offsetting weaker volumes with adjusted EBIT declining 5% on a comparable constant currency basis. Turning to Rigid Packaging on Slide 7. Year-to-date net sales on a comparable constant currency basis were 8% lower, with price/mix contributing around 1%. Volumes were down 9% for the first half, with lower volumes in North America, partly offset by growth in Latin America. In North America, overall beverage volumes for the first half were 14% lower than last year, including a 13% reduction in hot fill beverage container volumes due to lower consumer and customer demand and added levels of destocking through the first half. In Latin America, volumes grew mid-single-digit rates with new business wins in Brazil, Peru, and Colombia, partly offsetting lower volumes in Mexico. Adjusted EBIT was 9% lower than last year on a comparable basis. reflecting lower volumes, partly offset by price/mix benefits and favorable cost performance. For the December quarter, net sales were also down 10% on a comparable constant currency basis. Price/mix contributed around 2% and volumes were down 12% for the quarter, reflecting lower volumes in North America, partly offset by new business wins, driving mid-single-digit growth in Latin America. Overall, North American beverage volumes were 19% lower for the quarter, reflecting a high single-digit decline from destocking as some of our customers took action to significantly reduce inventories in both hot fill and cold fill categories. Volumes were also impacted in the high single-digit range by incrementally softer consumer and customer demand in Amcor's key end markets. In addition, we had net new business wins in the hot fill category, which partly offset a loss in cold fill as we elected not to retain volumes that fell short of our profitability threshold. Second quarter adjusted EBIT declined by 12%, reflecting lower volumes, partly offset by benefits from continuing to proactively manage costs, including realizing labor savings by taking more plant shutdown days to better align capacity with market dynamics, as well as driving procurement benefits. Moving to cash and the balance sheet on Slide 8. As Ron covered earlier, adjusted free cash flow for the half came in more than $10 million ahead of last year with our teams continuing to make progress against our priority to reduce inventories and driving capital increments across the board. Our financial profile remains solid with leverage at 3.4 times, and broadly in line with the first quarter and where we expected it to be as we cycle through temporary increases in working capital and given trailing 12-month EBITDA now fully reflects the divestiture of our Russian business. Looking ahead, we continue to expect leverage will decrease to approximately 3 times at the end of our fiscal year, supported by seasonally stronger earnings and cash flow in the second half. This brings me to our outlook on Slide 9. As Ron mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our full year guidance for adjusted EPS of $0.67 to $0.71 per share. We continue to expect the underlying business to contribute organic earnings growth in the plus or minus low single-digit range, with share repurchases adding a benefit of approximately 2%, and favorable currency translation contributing a benefit of up to 2%. This is offset by a negative impact of approximately 3% related to the sale of our Russian business in December 2022, the impact of which was all in the first half. We also expect a negative impact of approximately 6% from higher interest and tax expense, which takes into account our estimate for full year net interest expense of between $315 million to $330 million, which is modestly lower than where we were forecasting last quarter. Our full year tax rate expectations are unchanged in the range of 18% to 20%. In relation to phasing, we believe that December quarter marks the low point in terms of Amcor's earnings growth and volume declines. January volumes have improved, following heavy customer destocking in December and while we expect market dynamics to remain volatile in the near-term, our volume trajectory is expected to continue to improve through the balance of the year. We anticipate Q3 volumes will be down in the mid-single-digit range and expect fourth quarter volume declines in the low single-digit range. Taking into account offsetting benefits from cost reduction initiatives and a reduced headwind from higher interest costs compared with last year, we expect third quarter adjusted EPS to be down mid-single-digits on a comparable constant currency basis and for the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted EPS to increase by mid-single-digits over the prior year. And Ron will talk through the factors that support this return to growth shortly. Adjusted free cash flow continues to trend better than last year as we expected and we are again reaffirming our guidance range of $850 million to $950 million for our fiscal 2024 full year, which will be up to $100 million higher compared with last year. Our plan to repurchase at least $70 million of Amcor shares in 2024 is unchanged and we continue to pursue value-creating M&A opportunities. With that, I'll hand back to Ron. Ron Delia : Thanks Michael. Prior to opening the call to questions, I want to provide additional insights into our outlook for the balance of the year as well as a reminder of the key components comprising our longer-term model for driving shareholder value. Looking first at the balance of fiscal 2024. As I referenced earlier and as highlighted on Slide 10, there are a number of key factors already known to us that give us confidence our earnings trajectory will improve through the second half of the fiscal year. First, the earnings headwind related to the sale of our business in Russia is now fully behind us, eliminating an unfavorable comparative that impacted reported earnings throughout calendar 2023. Second, while second half interest expense is expected to be higher than last year, the magnitude of the headwind from the rapid rate increases over the past 18 months begins to abate as we move through the balance of the year. Third, we have benefits from structural cost savings of $35 million in the second half with an additional $15 million to benefit fiscal 2025. These savings are primarily related to plant closures as we optimize our global footprint. And fourth, earnings leverage has improved due to our commitment to take proactive actions to align our cost structure with evolving market dynamics. This includes eliminating shifts to take out labor reducing over time, driving procurement, and maintaining tight control of discretionary spend. In total, over the last 12 months, we reduced headcount by more than 2,000 full-time employees or approximately 5% of our workforce with more than 1,000 of these reductions taken out in the first half of fiscal 2024. From an earnings perspective, operating costs were lower by more than $200 million in the first half of fiscal 2024 compared with the prior period and more than $100 million of this cost reduction was delivered in the second quarter, which is almost double the approximately $70 million delivered in the first quarter. The result has been and will continue to be improved earnings leverage, which we've achieved this financial year-to-date despite significantly lower volumes. As Michael mentioned, we are off to a better start in January and are confident Q2 marks the low point for earnings growth and volume declines and with our overall trajectory expected to improve as we move to the balance of the year. To sum up, we're confident the positive earnings impact from multiple known factors will drive improved momentum in the second half of fiscal 2024, including delivering mid-single-digit earnings growth in our fiscal fourth quarter. Importantly, we're not assuming an improving consumer demand environment and we'll continue to be proactive in taking actions to ensure our cost base and pricing strategies reflect market conditions. Moving to Slide 11. As we look beyond the second half of this fiscal year, these known factors will serve as important building blocks supporting a return to delivering against our shareholder value creation model, through a combination of strong earnings growth and a compelling and growing dividend, currently yielding 5%. The starting point in creating value will always be growing the business and over the last 10 years, we've averaged 8% growth in adjusted earnings per share. As you can see on this slide, we have multiple drivers of margin accretive growth, each with significant opportunity over the longer term. We will also continue to enhance our ability to grow in these areas through stepping up CapEx over a multiyear period and executing on strategic M&A. As volumes normalize and improve, these generally faster growing and higher value growth areas will represent a larger proportion of sales becoming increasingly stronger contributors to earnings. And when we return to a more normalized volume growth environment, this combination of improved mix and the proactive steps we've taken to optimize our cost base, positions Amcor well to again deliver strong earnings growth in line with our long track record. To close on Slide 12, we're executing well to deliver against the earnings and cash flow expectations we set coming into fiscal 2024. Our teams are being proactive as market dynamics evolve and focusing on the controllables to take additional cost out where appropriate. We have line of sight to mid-single-digit earnings growth in Q4 and our commitment to our longer-term growth and value creation strategy positions us well to deliver on our shareholder value creation model when the volume environment normalizes. Operator, with those opening remarks, we're now ready to turn the line over to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Please go ahead. Ghansham Panjabi : Hey guy, good day. I guess, first off on the volume declines across the portfolio, which looks like it's about six quarters of negative year-over-year volumes at this point. Obviously, you're not the only ones, but there's been quite a bit of chatter on your customer set all the way down to retailers about increased promotional spending. Just curious as to whether you're starting to see direct science of that at the point? And if so, which categories, food, beverage, consumer staples, et cetera? Ron Delia : Yes, Look, Ghansham, thanks for the question. Maybe I'll just mention the volume declines at a high level first and then come back to your question about signs of promotions or more aggressive commercial activity on the behalf of the customers. Firstly, I think where there's overlap, we're not really seeing any differences compared to others. So, that would be the first thing I would say. I think our 10% total decline in the quarter is about 2% worse than we expected going into the quarter. So, we weren't actually expecting a much different outcome. Things did track according to those original expectations in October and November, where we were kind of declining high single-digits. December, we saw a really accelerated destocking, which accounted for the incremental softness in which we more than offset to deliver the profit. So, that's kind of the starting point. Now, January, as we've alluded to, was much better. We've seen improvement in most of our businesses versus H1. And it really underpins our view that Q2 was the low point and it really underpins our Q3 and Q4 expectations. And maybe just to continue and round it out a bit in terms of unpacking the decline roughly by driver, roughly half of our 10% decline, sort of mid-single-digits was related to market impacts. This is a combination of consumer demand, customer, and segment mix. And roughly half or another mid-single-digit contribution was from destocking and that's pretty much the same in both the Flexibles and Rigid Packaging segments. By geography, emerging markets broadly flat. Asia up modestly, Latin America down modestly. But the developed markets is where we've been especially soft with Europe a little bit weaker versus North America. And another way to think about it, just to sort of close off here is of the 10% decline in the quarter, more than 50% of that decline comes from our global healthcare business and our North American beverage business, both of which have experienced the most significant destocking. So, we've had a concentration of impact from those two parts of the business. On the other hand, there are categories growing in some regions, confectionery in North America and Europe; condiments and cheese and coffee in North America and Latin America; beverage in Latin America. So, there are places where the business is growing. Now, to your point, specifically about signs of promotional activity or changing pricing strategies, there is a lot of talk about that. As you rightly pointed out, we hear that from a lot of customers, both publicly and privately and we're seeing a little bit of that start to take place in the marketplace. But to be honest, we haven't seen that as any kind of a tailwind yet for our volume performance. And our outlook doesn't infer, it doesn't imply, or it doesn't assume that we're going to see any benefit from the market in the second half either. And so we'll sort of wait and see on whether or not the pendulum swings a bit between price and volume. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay, terrific. And just for my follow-up on that, on the healthcare destocking, is that just a function of having been destocked? Are you seeing it now versus a little bit later than the other categories? Or is there something unique to the time line associated with the healthcare destocking? Ron Delia : Yes. Look, I think it is a bit unique. It's really -- the markets have been soft, but the healthcare weakness is really a story of destocking and it's been significant in both medical device packaging and pharmaceutical packaging. And it's been pervasive and consistent around the world, the stocking in healthcare. It's really a multiyear story. It's been a multiyear journey here for healthcare, which is ironic because it's been one of the most consistent businesses we've had for a long period of time, and we would expect the returns to that level of consistency. But over the last several years, going back to even COVID, where we had really constrained demand, then very strong demand on reopening, but severe supply constraints, severe supply constraints and raw material shortages on things ranging from specialty foils and resins and papers. So, coming out of what would have been our fiscal 2022, which led really to customers building stocks to ensure supply during our fiscal 2023. And we had extraordinary volume in fiscal 2023 as a result of customers really buttressing their supply chains and derisking their supply chains by building up stock. Now, we have customers sitting on substantial inventories of a range of products from medical gloves to device packaging and pharmaceutical packaging, et cetera. And we started to see destocking, which actually really started in Q1. We flagged it last quarter, but accelerated significantly in Q2. And we would expect that it's likely to continue certainly through Q3 and possibly into Q4. So, it is a bit later stage. I think in some other categories, we've seen signs that there might be that destocking has abated and we're closer to the end of the beginning. I think in healthcare, it's been a later-stage story. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Longo from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Anthony Longo : Good day Ron, good day Michael. Just a quick one on the cost savings. So, in the face of the volume declines that you did see throughout the first half and particularly that last quarter, and do take your comments on January and thereafter. But I just want to get a sense as to what the outlook looks like for cost savings going forward? And how you're still going to manage that declining volume environment with margin growth? What you have tabled thus far, but is there anything over and above that, that you can achieve? Michael Casamento : Yes sure. I'll take that one, Anthony. So, look, on the cost out, there's two things that we're really doing here. So, -- the first is in response to the soften underlying volume demand. So, on that front, we've clearly taken proactive and aggressive approaches to the cost flexing and really focusing down on productivity gains and discretionary spend. So, for the first half, we took out more than $200 million in cost in relation to that and it accelerated through the half. In the first quarter, it was about $70 million in the second quarter, kind of $130 million. And we're achieving that by taking out really flexing the cost base in relation to the volume and demand environment. So, we're able to take out entire shifts. We're able to take out labor, reduce over time. We're driving the procurement benefits, particularly in this low demand environment and really tightening up on the discretionary spend. So, that will continue as we continue to flex through the volumes. But obviously, as volumes improve, some of that cost -- and it's difficult to say, but some of that cost will go back in as we build the shift patterns up. But we wouldn't expect that to be linear. I think you'll see us have better leverage there as we work through the second half because of the way we've learned to operate with some of that lower cost and improve the efficiencies there. So, that's really on the operating cost side. And then secondly, we are taking cost out structurally. So, in parallel, we're advancing the structural cost reduction initiatives that we've talked about on the back of the divested Russia earnings. That's mainly plant closures and it's around up to 10 across the globe and in both segments. To-date, we've announced seven closures and two restructures. And recently, actually, two to three of those plants have closed. So, we did start to see a little bit of benefit from that program as we exited the first half. But we're right on track to deliver the $35 million benefit in the second half from that program and then a further $15 million in FY 2025. So, really, that's the approach we've taken to the cost-out agenda and part of it is structural and part of it's ongoing. Anthony Longo : Thanks Michael. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America. please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Yes, hi. This is actually [Indiscernible] sitting in for George. He had a conflict this evening. So, just going off that, are you able to comment at all how much of that temporary cost saving might ultimately end up being permanent and structural costs that are taken out of the business? Michael Casamento : Look, it's difficult to say, as I just mentioned, -- what I can tell you is that things like procurement, there will be permanent savings. The operating cost out that we've taken out of the fixed base will be permanent. And the structural program is obviously permanent cost savings that come out of the business. On the flexing of the cost base, again, it's really dependent on the volume. We think we're much more efficient today. We've been able to proactively act to take labor out of the business overall versus prior year. We've taken nearly 2,000 heads out of the business and about 1,000 since June. So, in total, that's about 5% of the works. As the volumes come back online, as I mentioned, we will have to increase some of that, but it's not going to be linear. And we will manage that really tightly and we feel we've got good leverage out of that today, and we are more efficient. And so you'll see us continue to get leverage as we move forward in that. And really, that's going to contribute to the long-term margin benefits that we've typically gained of 20 to 30 basis points a year in our business. So, you should see that continue to contribute to that on the longer term. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, got it. And I appreciate all the color on that and on the volumes. But I guess you said volumes kind of came in lower than you were anticipating. So, what ultimately gives you comfort in the guidance for the year? Is it really that cost-out component and some of the other factors you talked to? Ron Delia : Yes. Look, it's a couple of things. Firstly, on volumes, we're not anticipating any rebound in the consumer or any big improvements in the market. But we do expect that destocking will abate as we work our way through the half. I mean, certainly, a portion of the destocking that we saw in December was certainly year end optimization, that's not going to repeat, right? We do believe we're going to see continued destocking in healthcare and North American beverage. But for the other categories, we're starting to see some evidence that the destocking is abating. So, that's one thing. January also was much better. So, we had much better January relative to the first half from a volume perspective. And so we feel like -- we feel pretty confident in underwriting the growth -- the volume assumptions for the rest of the year. And then in terms of the profit, as Michael alluded to, we're going to continue to -- we've got a number of known benefits, which I rattled through in the opening remarks, but it starts with better operating leverage because we've gotten a lot of costs out of the business and as volumes come back, we're not going to add that cost back one for one, plus the buildup and the momentum on the structural cost side, which, again, will build through the second half with the benefits from plant closures and the like. So, several things that give us confidence in the improving trajectory of earnings through the second half, but none of them have to do with the real dramatic improvement at the consumer level. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sam Seow from Citi. Please go ahead. Sam Seow : Morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. But you talked about some of your volumes coming in modestly below expectations and just thinking about your balance sheet, I'm not saying it's going to happen, but just trying to get a feel of what kind of fourth quarter volumes lead you outside of your range at the full year, assuming all other things equal? Ron Delia : Sam, are you still there? Sam Seow : Yes. Can you hear me? Ron Delia : Yes. You broke up there for a second. You broke up right at an important part of your question, which is about fourth quarter volumes. Sam Seow : Yes. Just try to get a feel of what kind of fourth quarter volumes there would leave you outside in your range at the full year, assuming all other things equal. Michael Casamento : You mean the guidance range of $67 million to $71 million, is that right? Sam Seow : No, no, the 3 times leverage? Ron Delia : Okay. So, look, we're confident in the cash flow trajectory of the business in the second half. So, we're going to be delevering from here will be at approximately 3 times at the end of June. We're pretty comfortable that, that's the path we're on here. In terms of volumes, the expectation for volumes that underwrites the EBIT growth in the second half or the EBITDA delivery in the second half is for mid-single-digit decline in the third quarter and a low single-digit decline in the fourth quarter. There's a bit of -- there's a range around that. And the impact on EBITDA and then therefore on leverage is pretty broad. So, we don't anticipate volumes being a major driver of us not getting to approximately 3 turns at the end of June. Sam Seow : Okay. Thanks for that. And I guess just following on -- I mean, looking forward, generally, you have lower cash flow in the first half due to seasonality. I think if you do finish at that 3 turns like your guidance, would you expect to be outside of your range again in first half 2025? Is that the new norm now going forward? Michael Casamento : Look, I think just to answer your question on that front. If you take where we are right now at this particular point in time, it's a pretty unique point in time because there's two factors that are really impacting the leverage right now. We're at 3.4 times, which is right where we expected to be at this time of the year in this situation. And it's really driven by the divestment of the Russia business. So, we're now fully lapping 12 months earnings out of the business from that. So, from here, we don't lap that anymore. We head more into more normal earnings trajectory and growth. And that's about 0.2 turn of leverage. And then the second point is really around elevated working capital levels. So, we have been carrying elevated working capital levels over the last 12 to 18 months. We've started to work our way through that. And the teams have done a good job in the last 12 months of inventory where we've taken inventory out of the system about $500 million. And that certainly contributed to the cash flow improvement in the first half of this year where we're $100 million ahead of prior year already. But we are still being impacted. We're not getting the full benefit of that inventory reduction because our payables are much lower. So, in this environment, where we've seen demand softness and destocking, clearly purchases are well down and in turn, our payables are down. So, we -- probably, we've still got another sort of $200 million to work through from a cash flow improvement on the back of working capital. And we're really targeting a working capital to sales range of in between that 8% to 9% working capital to sales and right now, we're at 9.8% on a trailing 12-month basis. So, when you put those two items together, leverage at this time of the year would normally be in the more of the 3 times range. And typically, in the second half, the seasonality would take kind of a 0.25 turn of the leverage. So, we'll get us back into that 2.5 to 3 times range. So, as we look forward, that's where we would expect to be in a more normal base. But as I said, we're in a little bit of a unique period of time and from here, we do expect improvement. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thank you. Good morning everyone, or evening I should say. Ron Delia : Hey Adam. Adam Samuelson : Hey. So, I guess the first question just going on the volume side and just thinking about some of the end markets. And Ron, you gave some good color in the prepared remarks. One of the areas where Amcor has been investing more aggressively has been in the protein space. Can you talk about kind of incremental business wins that you're actually achieving there relative to maybe some end markets that are still pretty challenged on the red meat side, certainly in North America? And how much you can kind of grow in spite of that and take market share in that opportunity? Ron Delia : Well, yes, it's a good question. And you're right, the market is challenged. And so if we think about meat across the Flexibles businesses, it's been a mixed story. We've had meat declining in North America through the half. There's soft market, there's destocking in the meat space as well. But we've seen that stabilize more recently. So, that would be one of those categories where we're not calling an end to the destocking cycle, but we certainly see signs that it's stabilizing a bit. Similarly, in Europe, we've seen a bit of a stabilization in meat volumes in the last couple of months. And in Latin America, we started to see some growth as well. So, I think meat is, as a general category globally, meat is one that feels like is coming out the other end of the packaging cycle, at least for us or at least there's some green shoots that give us some reasons for optimism would be the first point. Certainly, as we exited January as well, that would be the case. The second part of your question is a bigger picture question, and I think it's going to be a little bit longer dated, which is around our aspirations to win share in this space. You're aware that we made an equipment -- a purchase of a machinery company less than 12 months ago, which should be a part of that total system solution that we're going to market with. And we're optimistic that we've got the right consumables, the right film structures and the right technical service staff to support the equipment offering. And we think over time, that's going to be a combination and we'll take share not just in North America but around the world. There's not any evidence I can point to yet of that, Adam, because the near-term dynamics are well and truly overcompensating for any modest share pickup that we might be enjoying. Adam Samuelson : Okay, I appreciate that color. And if I can ask just a quick follow-up. You do have a business and presence in Argentina, both for Flexibles and Rigid on the beverage side. I think you strip out all the inflation accounting for the deval, but you talked about the volume environment in Argentina and how you're thinking about that over the next couple of quarters given what I would imagine it's a pretty challenged consumer environment? Ron Delia : Yes. Look, Michael can talk about maybe the accounting that you referenced. But from just a business perspective, first thing I would say is we've been in Argentina for the mid-90s, over 30 years. It's a business that's about 2% of sales and about 2% of EBIT. And we have five plants there actually across the two segments as you alluded to. And having been there for 30-odd years, we've been there through multiple economic cycles and crises, I guess. And the business is relatively local. And we have maintained total control over the business. So, it's still a business that's functioning more or less normally. But in terms of how we manage it, we continue to drive localization. It's essentially a local business. Already, there's no exports, but to the extent there's anything imported by way of raw materials, we're continuing to drive more localization of the key inputs. Most importantly, probably, we continue to price ahead of inflation. It's always been a hallmark of that business in that country and continues to be. And then we continue to focus on cost because our expectations are that demand will continue to slow as consumers adjust to the new macroeconomic realities in that country. So, that's a little bit about the business and how we manage it. Michael, do you want to talk a bit about the accounting that Adam-- Michael Casamento : Yes. Yes. Just on the accounting are you referred to, obviously, Argentina has been designated a hyperinflation economy since 2018. So, consistently, since that time, we've been -- if there's been a devaluation that we see that impacts the monetary assets on hand, and that's being created at NSI. We -- this quarter, there was a change of government, clearly. And in December, we saw a 55% devaluation. And you see the chart of $34 million to the P&L in the quarter in the SI bucket, and that's really the outcome of that on our monetary assets only and that followed Q1 where there was a 20% devaluation. So, really, that's the treatment of the accounting. It's been consistent all the way through into the 2018 approach. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Richard Johnson from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Richard Johnson : Thanks very much. Ron, I just wanted to ask a question about Rigid Packaging and how you're thinking about the business now strategically. I was just trying to remember whether I've seen volume declines in the December quarter in the past, anything like that we saw in the December quarter, particularly in hot fill, and that's even if you adjust out destocking. So, just interested to get your view on how you think the business is placed at the moment? Ron Delia : Well, yes, listen, Richard, you don't remember seeing volume declines at that level because you haven't seen them at that level. I mean it's just the reality of it. It's a business that's -- it's been a good business for a long period of time. It suffered really from a volume perspective, from the same drivers as the rest of the company, right, so -- although with higher impacts. So, we've had market impacts that we would say, attributed to a high single-digit decline in volumes. That's inclusive of consumer demand down kind of low to mid-single-digits in some segments that are important to us, maybe down some more, some customers lagging the market. And that all wraps up to kind of a high single-digit impact on volumes for both North American beverage at large and hot fill, specifically that we would attribute to market impacts. Then the bigger impact actually for us in the quarter was the destocking. And the destocking is really being driven by a couple of things here, which are working in opposite directions. First is that traditionally, in this business, you'd have some inventory prebuild in what is our fiscal second and fiscal third quarters in advance of the high season, the beverage season in North America. There's historically a bit of inventory buildup, that's not happening this year. So, there's no prebuild this year. And at the same time, we have some customers and big customers with very, very aggressive inventory reduction targets. So, rather than building, we're reducing. And there was a significant acceleration in that activity to reduce inventories in the month of December, which ultimately led to a high single-digit impact on North American beverage at large, but a high teens impact in hot fill. And while we saw some modest improvement in January, we do believe that we're going to continue to see a destocking impact in the third quarter. So, that's really what's going on there. That's unprecedented. We still believe in the business. The business is well-positioned in terms of its market stature. It operates in a in a reasonably well-structured market. It has world-leading technology. Its footprint is reasonably optimized. We are taking a couple of small lands out as part of the restructuring program, but it's reasonably well optimized. It needs to just weather the storm. And that's on the beverage side. And then let's not forget that outside of beverage, we have a reasonably sized specialty container business which looks and feels almost like a Flexibles business because of its end market exposure and that business has room to grow. And Latin America also is -- continues to be a very good business, including in the first half and in the second quarter, where we saw volume growth new business wins in Latin America, too. So, it's a portfolio of businesses. At its core, it's a beverage business in North America that gets a lot of attention to shouldn't forget about the other parts as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brook Campbell from Barrenjoey. Please go ahead. Brook Campbell : Yes, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Can you just confirm what the level of volume growth or decline was in January? And then as a follow-up to that, is there not a risk here that you sort of extrapolate January volumes for the rest of the quarter when perhaps there was a benefit in Jan because Costco has effectively delayed orders in December and push it into January. Therefore, January might not be a good indicator for the rest of the quarter? That's the question. Thanks. Ron Delia : Yes. We won't give a number on January other than to say it was an improvement over December and an improvement, not everywhere, but in most parts of our business. We did have some parts of the business even that grew modestly. So, -- that's probably as much as I would say in terms of trying to dimension January. I understand the nature of your question is particularly the second part as to whether or not we're being overly optimistic on the back of one month. It is one month, and we're well aware that it's one month. We are flagging that we will see continued destocking impacts in healthcare globally and in North America beverage. That no matter what happened in January, we know it will be the case certainly in Q3 and potentially into Q4. And we're also not banking on any improvement in the consumer. So, I think that we're being relatively conservative and not reading too much into one month, but it is a month, and it does suggest as we sort of expected that the low point for us from a volume point of view and earnings growth as well was the second quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jakob Cakarnis from Jarden Australia. Please go ahead. Jakob Cakarnis : Hi Ron, hi Michael. I just want to build on Brook's question there, though. Obviously, December was significantly weak. So, January improvement might not necessarily move you guys back to increase. So, I just want to square some of the commentary still where you're saying that you'll see a mid-single-digit volume decline in the third quarter and then low single-digit in the fourth quarter. Can you just help us the commentary around the January improvement, is that relative to the negative or the decline that you saw through the month of December specifically? Ron Delia : Yes, it's relative to the performance in the whole first half and in the second quarter and in December. So, when we -- we're talking about improvements in January in most parts of the business, where that's relative to the first half. That's the first part. I think the other thing to keep in mind is as we work our way through the balance of the fiscal year, a couple of things will also underpin those growth assumptions that we've outlined. One is that we do expect outside of healthcare and North American beverage, we do expect the year-end destocking that we saw in December to not repeat. And some continued abatement or continued destocking runoff or reduction in much of the rest of the business. That's the first thing. And the second thing is, particularly as we get to the fourth quarter, the prior period comp gets a little bit easier. Our volume challenges really started in a of last fiscal year. And so as we get to Q4 this year, we've got the benefit of a comparative period, which wasn't so strong. Jakob Cakarnis : Just one more for Michael, if I can. Just on the net interest guidance, obviously, a little bit lower than where you were guiding to initially, how much of that's the movements in forward curves and expectations for rate or interest rate declines or cash rate declines in the US through the balance of the year, please? Michael Casamento : Yes, sure. So, we -- you saw that we brought our guidance just slightly down from kind of a range of $320 million to $340 million down to kind of $315 million to $330 million. That's really all on the back of the forward curves and the interest rate hike would appear been reached its peak now, and potentially, you might see one rate reduction late in our fiscal year. But really, that's the slight improvement is really on the back of that forward curve. And after tax, it's a pretty minimal impact on the full year guidance. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Cameron McDonald from E&P. Please go ahead. Cameron McDonald : Hey good morning guys. Question for Mike, just in terms of -- well, the tax rate and then the capital structure. So, the tax rate sitting sort of around sort of under 19%. And where -- what jurisdictions are you getting a tax benefit from given the corporate tax rate in most of your jurisdictions is in excess of certainly of that number, but in excess of sort of $20 million? Michael Casamento : Yes. Look, I think we operate across a broad range of countries globally. And in addition to that, the mix of earnings can be different in every geography and location. And then the overall underlying performance of the business can change. So, when you wrap that all up for our business, we're guiding to 18% to 20% tax rate. We've typically been around that 20% range for a long period of time. So, it's really just the combination of the earnings, the country mix and the underlying performance of the business. Ron Delia : And the differences in deductibility of different expenses by jurisdiction, right, which then, obviously, you have to factor in, in addition to the headline tax rates in those jurisdictions. Cameron McDonald : Okay. Thank you. And then just in terms of the capital structure, comments earlier about the balance sheet and the leverage. Part of the investment thesis has been EPS growth, a big chunk of that has been undertaken through share buybacks. What -- how -- what's the sort of leverage ratio that we should be expecting before we would start to see a discussion around the buyback being reimplemented? Is it -- do we have to get back down to sort of the mid-2s? I think the last time you had a buyback active was sort of 2.7 times leverage? Ron Delia : Well, listen, we've bought back -- remember, it's buybacks and MA is the way we think about the discretionary cash flow for the business. And we bought back over the last. We will have bought back over three fiscal years and acquired to the tune of about $1.2 billion. So, we will have done over $1 billion in buybacks, and we will have invested somewhere close to $200 million in investments and acquisitions. So, that's essentially three years of discretionary cash that's been invested in the business. It's a little bit lumpy. It's not exactly even over the three-year period, but that's been what we've done. I think from a leverage range perspective, more often than not, we're going to be between 2.5 and 3 times. Obviously, we're comfortable being above that, particularly when there's good reasons for it as there is at the moment. And we'll be continuing to evaluate capital management or buyback opportunities in conjunction with M&A opportunities on a go-forward basis, and that includes now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Roxland from Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Michael Roxland : Thank you, Ron, Michael, Tracy for taking my questions. Actually, just one question because a lot of material already was covered here. Quickly on just protein packaging, Ron. I know it was discussed earlier in response to a question, I think you discussed it, I think, last quarter. Can you just describe whether there are any nuances in your business, maybe around equipment, for instance, that would make you unable to compete with some of it with a large player in the industry or some of the -- some of your larger peers? I know are you intentionally participating in different parts of the market to avoid going head on with some of the larger players. And just lastly, where do you think this -- where would you like this business to be on a revenue basis, let's say, in five years or 10 years? Ron Delia : Yes. Look, it's a great question. The biggest challenge we have at the moment is the lack of installed base. So, there's a massive installed base that got a lot of legacy behind it. in the industry as -- given the way the industry has evolved over several decades. And from an equipment perspective, we're -- well, firstly, I would say we're more open source -- we bought Moda, obviously. So, we've -- we're prioritizing Moda equipment, but we're more agnostic to the actual equipment installation. And we think we've got great -- and the primary basis of competition here, we think, ultimately, will be on the film. And that's what we're aspiring to do is to grow the film business, enabled and facilitated with a full-service offering, which includes not only the machinery but the technical service that is so important in this industry to the customers to help them optimize their operations. So, it's really a total system solution that we're going to go to market with now and we're starting to go to market with really for the first time. And as far as how big can the business get and what are our aspirations for it? I mean, look, I'm not going to dimension it here, it's a big, important business for us already. It's a tough time to be asking for a lot out of the business as it weathers some of the destocking and some of the softness in the general beef cycle, in particular or meat cycle, I should say. But it's a that we have aspirations to grow at sort of mid- to high single-digits and good margins for the foreseeable future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Purtell from Macquarie. Please go ahead. John Purtell : Good day Ron and Michael, I hope you will. Just a couple of questions, please. In terms of your second half EPS guide, previously, it was up for the second half, up mid-single-digit in constant currency, think you mentioned Q3 EPS down mid-single-digit, were your expectation in Q4 up in single-digits. So, it looks like the Q3 guide is weaker. Is that reflecting a lower volume starting point? Michael Casamento : Look, overall, John, I guess we actually held our guidance. So, -- and you're right, we've guided to volumes mid-single-digit down in Q3 and EPS down mid-single-digit. And in Q4, we're expecting trajectory to improve through the half on the volumes, volumes down low single-digit. And just on the back of some of the things that Ron touched on earlier and also the earnings trajectory of our business Q4 is our biggest quarter, that's why we're expecting mid-single-digit EPS growth in Q4. So, really not a lot of change. I guess what we have seen is that the volume trajectory is perhaps a little softer than we previously anticipated. And that was really on the back of that destocking, particularly in healthcare and North America beverage, where we're expecting that to continue through Q3 and perhaps into Q4. We are offsetting that with continued cost out and we have confidence in the underlying performance of the business with the structural initiatives that we've put in place and touch on already getting $35 million in the second half, the ongoing cost agenda and discretionary spend management. So, not a lot of change really to our guidance overall. I think we -- perhaps we did a little better in H1. But generally speaking we're holding the range and we feel pretty good about the drivers behind the $0.67 to $0.71 range. John Purtell : And just the second one, just to be interested in what you're seeing from the consumer. Obviously, elasticity of demand has been an ongoing factor, and it looks like the FMCG companies are still pushing price. Ron Delia : Yes. Look, I mean, the best proxy is probably the scanner data that we look at, and I'm sure you look at it as well. I mean, we still see a generally consumer environment. And -- that's true across the staples that we're supplying packaging for. You still see in the US general scan data, which, obviously, there's a lot of nuance that you need to unpack. But generally speaking, kind of low single-digit declines in the calendar fourth quarter that's just passed, Europe may be modestly better overall, but at a sub level, you still see lots of softness and lots of modest declines. You see some evidence of down-trading in some parts of the business. You see on the margin, maybe some modest shift, and I wouldn't make too much into this, but you see some modest shifts in some categories like pet food and maybe even in coffee where you might see different formats doing better. We certainly see it -- we believe we see it in the beverage business. In the case of carbonated soft drinks, where we know that the value pack has historically been the can, if you're going to buy 12 or 24 cans or units of a soft drink, you're likely to buy it in a can and that has continued. So, I think generally, John, the consumer environment is pretty soft. There are some reasons for potential optimism if the brand owners toggle the dial a little bit between price recovery and maximizing volume, but we are absolutely not baking that into our assumptions on volumes going forward. But that will take as nice to have if it happens. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Kang from CLSA. Please go ahead. Daniel Kang : Morning everyone. So, you spoke about protein turning a corner in January. Can you just elaborate on how you're seeing stock levels and the potential for an end in destocking in other product categories? Ron Delia : Yes. Look, I think as it relates to the trend on destocking from -- sort of break it down in a couple of buckets. Firstly, we'd say the really pronounced end of year destocking that we saw in December, we don't expect will repeat with the exception that -- or we don't expect will continue with the exception of globally in healthcare and the North American beverage. We know that in those two segments for different reasons that we've mostly covered we're going to see continued destocking certainly through Q3 and likely into Q4. So, we're not expecting a big bounce back there. Other than those two segments, other places where there was really accelerated destocking in December, we're not expecting to see a repeat of. And so therefore, on a general basis, we would expect that we're going to start to come out the other end of this inventory cycle that we've been weathering for the last several quarters. We see some signs of that. Already, I mentioned I mentioned meat as one place that seems to have stabilized, premium coffee in Europe is another. So, there are some reasons for optimism. But again, we're not getting ahead of ourselves here, and we recognize we have two important parts of the business in healthcare and beverage, which you're going to continue to go through some more destocking from here. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Chau from MST Marquee. Please go ahead. Keith Chau : Hi there gents. Just an extension of Daniel's question on destocking and part of my ignorance, but how can you actually tell what is destocking, what is underlying volume trend? Can you specifically quantify that with data that you're seeing internally? Or is it based on discussions you're having with customers a bit of an approximation internally? Can you just give me a sense of how you work out what is underlying consumer weakness? What is destocking? What is cyclical? What is structural? Ron Delia : Yes. Look, it's part art and part science. So, firstly, there's a lot of discussions with customers and remember in some parts of the business where even co-located with customers. So, there's a high degree of customer intimacy across the business. And the starting point is the discussions and the joint planning dialogue that we have with our customers around the world. So, that's arguably the most important input. But then we also try to triangulate with data. And what do we look at? We look at things like in categories where there is scanner data, which is not the case across our portfolio, certainly not in healthcare. But in food and home and personal care and places where there's good retail scanner data, we take a close look at that. We also look at the scanner results for individual customers, individual companies and try to determine if there's any difference between the overall market performance and the performance of our specific customers. And then we look at our volumes and try to triangulate between those three data points to see what's the difference. Is there -- if there's sell-through or not and whether or not we're seeing an inventory drawdown or buildup. So, it's like it's an approximation, but it's a reasonably informed approximation, both with input from the customer directly as well as data and quantitative inputs. Keith Chau : Okay, thanks Ron. That's great color. And then just a quick follow-up on the point in January, and I appreciate it's only a month. But when you talked about an improvement, are you talking about a positive growth comp in January or less bad January versus the last six months? Thank you. Ron Delia : Yes. Look, we're talking about it relative to the first half. So, it's a little bit of both. But generally speaking, we're talking about the comparison to the first half. And so we're not talking about -- we had some parts of the business that grew, but we're not talking about general growth across the board. What we're talking about is a general improvement relative to the first half and certainly the second quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to Ron Delia for closing remarks. Ron Delia : Thanks operator and thanks everyone for joining the call today. We're, as you can hopefully pick up, pretty optimistic about our second half. We believe that the second quarter was the low point for us in terms of volumes and earnings growth and the business will build momentum from here. So, thank you for your interest in Amcor and we'll speak to you next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Amcor Third Quarter 2024 Results Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Tracey Whitehead, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. Tracey Whitehead : Thank you, operator and thank you everyone for joining Amcor\u2019s fiscal 2023 third quarter earnings call. Joining today is Peter Konieczny, Interim Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Casamento, Chief Financial Officer. Before I hand over, a few items to note. On our website, amcor.com, under the Investors section, you\u2019ll find today\u2019s press release and presentation, which we will discuss on this call. Please be aware that we\u2019ll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures and related reconciliations can be found in that press release and the presentation. Remarks will also include forward-looking statements that are based on management\u2019s current views and assumptions. The second slide in today\u2019s presentation lists several factors that could cause future results to be different than current estimates. Reference can also be made Amcor\u2019s SEC filings, including our statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q for further details. [Operator Instructions] With that, over to you, P.K. Peter Konieczny : Thank you, Tracey and thank you to all who have joined us for today\u2019s call. Prior to discussing our third quarter performance, I want to spend a few moments recognizing my predecessor, Ron Delia, and his many accomplishments at Amcor. In the last few years alone, Ron led us through the transformational acquisition and integration of Bemis, the largest acquisition in the company\u2019s history, successfully and safely guided the business through a pandemic and made the difficult and correct decision to divest our business in Russia. And most recently, Ron directed our teams in navigating that particularly challenging economic period. I now will speak for the Board, our global management team and our employees around the world and thanking Ron for his leadership, guidance and dedication during his 18 years with Amcor and 9 years as CEO. I\u2019ve worked closely with Ron, our board and the other members of our executive team over many years to help shape and execute our strategy, and I am honored to take the leadership reigns in an interim capacity at this time. Today, Amcor is the established industry leader in our key markets and geographies, has world class talent and clearly differentiated commercial innovation capabilities, all providing us with multiple opportunities to capture high value growth. Importantly, the business is also well positioned to continue benefiting from the proactive steps taken by our leaders across the company to align the cost base with recent challenging market conditions. The results of those decisive actions were again evident in our third quarter financial performance as we showed strong earnings leverage across the business. Third quarter year-over-year volume performance also improved on a sequential basis, and we expect this trend to continue driving stronger earnings growth as we close fiscal year \u201824. My role right now is to ensure we stay focused and on track and that we capitalize on the strong position we are in to maintain momentum and further accelerate earnings growth. It is a team effort and will drive success. And I am surrounded and supported by credible leaders and talented team players throughout our organization. As seen on Slide 3, my near-term priorities are simple. First, ensure Amcor continues to provide a safe and healthy work environment for our global workforce. Second, stay close to our key stakeholders, including our employees and customers and finish our 2024 fiscal year strongly. After an improved third quarter performance, we are well positioned to do so and we\u2019ve raised our full year guidance today. Third, build on the momentum we have worked hard to deliver across the business and as we work through our planning cycle for fiscal \u201825 set clear priorities to ensure our momentum continues. And fourth, provide stability for the business and keep our teams focused on delivering for all our stakeholders by reinforcing that. Our strategy has not changed, our agenda has not changed, and our priorities have not changed. Moving to Amcor\u2019s Q3 performance, starting with safety on Slide 4. Our commitment to health and safety of our teams remains our number one priority, and we continue to focus on providing a safe and healthy work environment. 72% of our sites have been injury-free for the past 12 months or longer, and we experienced a 19% reduction in injuries compared to the first 9 months of fiscal \u201823. Safety is deeply embedded in Amcor\u2019s culture and is a critical cornerstone of our success. Turning to our key messages for today on Slide 5. First, outperformance in the underlying business resulted in adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter that exceeded the expectations we set out in February. Our Flexibles and Rigid Packaging segment each delivered adjusted EBIT growth, leading to Amcor returning to year-over-year earnings growth a quarter sooner than we anticipated. Improved working capital performance through the year also resulted in a year-to-date increase in adjusted free cash flow. Second, as I mentioned earlier, our third quarter volume trajectory improved significantly on a sequential basis as destocking abated across most end markets, and we experienced higher customer demand in several of our businesses. While this is clearly an encouraging and positive trend, our teams remain highly focused on continuing to control costs and this helped us deliver a third consecutive quarter of improved earnings leverage and a return to earnings growth. Third, our March quarter financial performance and expected further momentum in our fourth quarter gives us the confidence to increase our full year adjusted EPS guidance range to $0.685 to $0.71 per share and reaffirm our guidance for adjusted free cash flow between $850 million and $950 million for the fiscal year. We believe we have turned the corner after a challenging calendar 2023, and we expect our sequential volume and earnings growth trajectories will continue to improve, which is supported by the demand trends experienced across the business in the first weeks of April. Finally, we remain confident in our capital allocation framework and strategy for long-term growth. We believe the strength of our market positions, our opportunities for investment and our execution capabilities, along with our commitment to a compelling and growing dividend, make a convincing investment case for Amcor. Moving to Slide 6 for a summary of our financial results. The first 9 months of fiscal \u201824 continued to reflect significant benefits from our proactive cost actions. Three consecutive quarters of strong operating leverage helped offset the unfavorable impact of 7% lower sales \u2013 lower year-to-date sales, leading to a decline in adjusted EBIT of 3%. We believe we\u2019ve reached an inflection point in the trajectory of earnings and volumes with our Q3 results, and we are pleased with our financial results in the March quarter. Better-than-anticipated demand trends and continued strong cost performance resulted in EBIT and earnings per share ahead of our expectations entering the quarter. The underlying business saw a return to profit growth in the third quarter with adjusted EBIT of 3% compared with last year. Volume trends improved as the broad-based destocking experienced in the December quarter abated and customer demand strengthened. Our teams also continue to focus on cost reduction and productivity initiatives and delivered another quarter of outstanding results with approximately $130 million in total cost savings, including approximately $15 million of benefit from structural cost initiatives. These benefits, combined with improving volume trends, resulted in another quarter of improved earnings leverage. Interest and tax expects were modestly higher than the prior year, in line with our expectations and adjusted earnings per share of $0.178, grew by 1%. Q3 net sales were down 6% on a comparable constant currency basis, which primarily reflects overall volumes 4% lower than the prior year. This is predominantly related to expected ongoing weakness, including further destocking in healthcare categories and in the North American beverage business, which collectively represent approximately 3% of Amcor\u2019s total sales. Across the remaining 70% of our business, overall net volumes were relatively flat with last year, a significant improvement compared with the December quarter and the business delivered volume growth across several categories and geographies. Outside of healthcare, we believe destocking is now largely behind us. Price mix for Q3 had an unfavorable impact on sales of approximately 3%, which is a result of greater volume declines in high-margin healthcare categories, which we anticipated and called out last quarter. We continue to return significant cash to shareholders through a compelling and growing dividend and share repurchases, which totaled approximately $570 million through the first 9 months of the year. I\u2019ll turn it over to Michael now to provide some further color on the financials and our outlook. Michael Casamento : Thanks, PK, and hello, everyone. Beginning with the Flexibles segment on Slide 7 and focusing on our Q3 performance. Net sales for Q3 were down 6%, reflecting an unfavorable pricing impact of 4% and a 2% decline in overall volumes, which was a significant improvement of 8 percentage points compared with the December quarter. As we anticipated and called out last quarter, volumes for healthcare products remained weak and destocking continued, particularly in North America and Europe. In total, healthcare volumes were down double digits, and this had an unfavorable impact of approximately 3% on overall segment volumes and was the primary driver of the 4% unfavorable mix in the quarter. Across the balance of our flexibles portfolio, net volumes grew approximately 1% in the quarter, with growth in several end markets, including meat, pet food, cheese and unconverted film foil, and we also saw growth across a number of emerging markets. Across North America and Europe, third quarter net sales decline a high-single-digit rates and favorably impacted by a mid-single-digit lower volumes and unfavorable price/mix related decline in healthcare categories. Excluding healthcare across these two regions, we saw mid-single volume growth in cheese and a strong sequential improvement in meat and pet care volumes, which were flat and up low-single digits for the quarter, respectively. Across the Asian region, net sales were modestly higher than the prior year. China grew volumes for the third consecutive quarter. And volume growth in Thailand, India and the Philippines also helped offset lower volumes in South East Asian healthcare business. In Latin America, the business delivered good volume growth in Brazil, Mexico and Peru. Q3 adjusted EBIT of $358 million, was 5% higher than last year on a comparable constant currency basis. Strong cost performance through the quarter, including from restructuring initiatives, combined with broadly improving demand trends, led to another quarter of strong earnings leverage, and EBIT margins increased by 170 basis points to 13.8%. Turning to Rigid Packaging on Slide 8. Q3 net sales were 8% lower on a comparable constant currency basis, mainly reflecting lower volumes. While overall volumes were down 8% for the quarter, this represents a meaningful improvement over the December quarter. In North America, overall beverage volumes continue to be impacted by soft consumer and customer demand in Amcor\u2019s key end markets, along with some lingering destocking. Total beverage volumes were down 11%, improving sequentially from the 19% decline we experienced in December quarter, which was impacted by significantly more destocking. Latin America volumes were in line with last year with growth in Brazil and Colombia, offset by weaker demand in Argentina. We are pleased to see the Rigid Packaging business return to earnings growth, with adjusted third quarter EBIT up modestly over last year. Strong earnings leverage resulting from a continued focus on cost reduction and productivity measures and the realization of benefits from restructuring initiatives more than offset lower volumes, leading to an 80 basis point increase in EBIT margins to 8.7% for the quarter. Moving to cash and the balance sheet on Slide 9. Adjusted free cash flow for the first 9 months was approximately $100 million ahead of last year, mainly driven by improved working capital performance and successfully reducing inventory levels for the fifth consecutive quarter. Leverage at 3.4x is broadly in line with the first half and within the range of expected outcomes for the third quarter. As a reminder, the business is cycling through temporary increases in working capital, and trailing 12-month EBITDA remains at lower than historic levels, reflecting the divestiture of our Russian business in December 2022. Looking ahead, we continue to expect leverage will decrease to approximately 3x at the end of our fiscal year, supported by seasonally stronger earnings and cash flow in our fiscal fourth quarter. This brings me to our outlook on Slide 10. As P.K. noted earlier, we are raising our full year guidance for adjusted EPS to $0.685 to $0.71 per share to reflect our performance in the underlying business in the third quarter and our expectation that volumes will continue to improve through the balance of the year. We also remain focused on controlling costs and expect to deliver further savings in Q4, including from our structural initiatives. For fiscal 2024, we continue to expect the underlying business to contribute organic earnings growth in the plus/minus low single-digit range with share repurchases adding a benefit of approximately 2% and favorable currency translation contributing a benefit of up to 2%. This is offset by negative impact of approximately 3% related to the sale of our Russian business in December 2022. The impact of which was all in the first half. We also expect a negative impact of up to 6% from higher interest and tax expense, which takes into account our updated estimate for the full year net interest expense of between $310 million to $320 million. We are confident, we will build on our third quarter performance, and adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter is expected to grow over last year by mid-single digits on a comparable constant currency basis. And overall volumes in the fourth quarter are expected to be down in the low single-digit range, primarily due to ongoing destocking in healthcare categories and continued weak consumer and customer demand in North America beverage. We expect the volume improvement we experienced in the third quarter to continue as we progress through the fourth quarter, which will position us well as we enter fiscal 2025. We have also reaffirmed our guidance range for adjusted free cash flow of $850 million to $950 million for the year. So with that, I\u2019ll hand back to P.K. Peter Konieczny : Thank you, Michael. In closing, on Slide 11, our Q3 financial results guidance for the balance of the fiscal year and our expectation that we will continue to build earnings momentum in fiscal \u201825 will highlight that Amcor is a very well-positioned business. Amcor\u2019s industry leadership across the globe is well established. Our differentiated innovation capabilities are assisting the world\u2019s best known brands and smaller companies in achieving their objectives to protect, preserve and promote their products while enabling them to meet the sustainability commitments they have made to the stakeholders. And Amcor\u2019s talented employees around the world are capitalizing on growth opportunities in priority categories, emerging markets and through sustainable offerings while also continuing to closely focus on cost controls. We\u2019re confident we will continue to see positive momentum given the actions we have taken and continue to take across our operations to invest in growth, reduce cost and improve productivity. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, my role right now is to ensure we stay focused and on track and that we capitalize on the strong position we are in to maintain momentum and further accelerate earnings growth. The continued safety of our goal will always be at the top of Amcor\u2019s agenda. But a very close second for me right now is to keep our teams focused on delivering for all our stakeholders by reinforcing that our strategy, our agenda and our priorities have not changed. Our Q3 volume trajectory and financial performance underscores our confidence in stronger earnings growth momentum as the challenges we faced in calendar \u201823 are put further behind us. We have raised our full year EPS guidance, and we anticipate delivering mid-single-digit earnings growth in Q4. Our performance in the first few weeks of April supports this expectation. And our commitments to our longer-term growth and value creation strategy gives us line of sight to a return to growth in line with our shareholder value creation model. Operator, we\u2019re now ready to turn the line over to questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi of Baird. Your line is open. Ghansham Panjabi : Hi, guys. How are you? I guess first off, it just sounds like volume surprised you to the upside during your third quarter. Do you think that\u2019s just a function of 2Q coming in lower than forecast just given aggressive year-end inventory destocking by your customers? What do you think this is more of a sustainable improvement that you\u2019re going to build upon as you look out to your fiscal year \u201825? Thanks. Peter Konieczny : Yes, thanks. It\u2019s a great question. I mean there is a couple of things to take away here from the discussion of the quarter. The first one really is that the volumes improved. The second one is that we had great cost performance. And the third one really is that we believe the momentum carries over into the Q4. But let me get back to the volume question. So significant improvement sequentially on volumes from the second to the third quarter, to remind ourselves, second quarter, we were down 10%. Third quarter, we were coming in 4% down versus prior year. And when you look at the 4% that we were down, it pretty much equally split between two drivers. That\u2019s the market impacts. And by that, I mean consumer demand and our exposure to categories and customers. And then the second one is destocking. So that made up the 4% decline. And when you \u2013 and another way to look at that is the 4% decline was pretty much all driven by destocking in healthcare and North American beverage. That also means that the balance of the portfolio ended up being pretty flat. And we\u2019re pretty much pleased with this outcome because when you think about it, healthcare and North American beverage is about 30% of our business, that means the balance of the portfolio, 70% came in flat. Now when I take a step back and we look at the third quarter volume performance, now there\u2019s a few things that we take away. The first one is, we saw a bit of unwind of a very strong destocking in the December month. And when we discussed the second quarter, we talked about a pretty strong January. And there was a bit of a question mark around how much of that performance was driven by unwind of the December month. And as we sort of left Q3 behind us, we can confirm that the volumes in January and also February, to a certain extent, benefited from a bit of an unwind in an unusually low December month. So that was the first one. But the second thing that we\u2019ve seen is that our customers perform better. And we talked about that also in the last quarter. The background here is that customers are \u2013 particularly large customers are talking more and more and responding more and more towards turning the dial a bit towards a better balance between volumes and margins. So we\u2019ve seen that come through. And then the third one is pretty much what we expected to a certain extent that the destocking would abate. And that pretty much happened with the exception of healthcare and some lingering destocking in North American beverage. So look, that\u2019s pretty much the discussion of the third quarter. But as I have the floor on volumes, let me just make two more comments and breaking it down into the segments here because I think the color is important. In Flexibles, we came from being 10% down in the second quarter to being 2% down in the third quarter. And again, the customer performance sort of drove improved market impact performance and then the destocking significantly abated. And when you look at the Flexibles segment, it was all made up by the healthcare impact in terms of the decline, the balance of the portfolio is flat to even slightly up. And then just one more comment on Rigid and then I\u2019ll stop. Rigid went from 12% down in the second quarter to 8% down in the third quarter, so also an improvement. We continue to see a soft market, but the destocking as significantly rated in Rigids also. So across the board, really, really good improvement. And when you think back to what I discussed, there\u2019s components in where the \u2013 that we believe to be sustainable, no question. And that relates to one further abatement of the destocking and second, to good customer performance that we continue \u2013 that we believe we will continue to see people. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Kang of CLSA. Your line is open. Daniel Kang : Good morning, Peter. Good morning, Michael. Just a question on healthcare. You mentioned healthcare continued to fall double digits in 3Q, which from memory sounds quite similar to the December quarter. Can you comment on whether there was any sequential improvement in 3Q? And just from the visibility of customer stock levels and given the low comps that you should be working with going forward, is it reasonable to expect that first half fiscal year \u201825 to show some improvement in healthcare bond? Peter Konieczny : Let me help you with healthcare a bit. So the main driver of the healthcare performance really has been the destocking and the destocking sort of abating from Q2 to Q3. I would say, overall, the demand situation has not really changed much in healthcare. So you would see overall healthcare is marginally better between the second and the third quarter. We do expect further improvement in healthcare though because the destocking will further sort of reduce in the fourth quarter. As a matter of fact, when we guide to low single-digit volume decline in the fourth quarter, we would believe that most of that is driven by healthcare \u2013 all of that is driven by healthcare. And we don\u2019t really know exactly when the destocking will come to an end. It will certainly sort of stretch into the fourth quarter. Maybe we\u2019ll see a bit of an \u2013 we see a bit of an impact also in the first quarter of fiscal \u201825. But that would be as far as I would go with everything that I know at this point in time. Maybe one more thing that I would want to add to is that, again, we\u2019re talking about low single digits decline in volumes in the fourth quarter. But with a further improving trajectory, we\u2019re expecting to exit the fourth quarter flat on volumes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Adam Samuelson : Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. I was hoping to maybe talk a little bit about the operating leverage in the business or lack thereof on the deleverage side just given the profit performance, especially in Flexibles relative to the volume and mix declines you still saw in the period. And hoping to maybe just aggregate a little bit the amount of fixed cost reductions actually realized in the period versus the variable cost kind of efficiencies and productivity gains in the quarter and how kind of durable you think those variable costs and productivity improvements proved to be if volumes start to normalize or how much cost would have to leak into the system to serve incremental volumes from here? Michael Casamento : Thanks for the question, Adam. I\u2019ll take that. It\u2019s Michael here. Yes, look, on the cost side, we\u2019re really pleased with the cost performance of the business in Q3. We took another kind of $130 million out of cost, which included some benefit from the restructuring program that we\u2019ve got in place. So we now are now starting to see that come through. So that was about $15 million, as expected. And if you just take a step back and think about the cost work we\u2019ve been doing, what are we actually doing? There\u2019s two things that we\u2019re focused on. Firstly, the operational side of the business, the cost productivity and cost flexing in a lower volume environment. And then the second is that structural program that we\u2019ve talked about in response to trying to offset some of the divested Russia earnings. So in the quarter, we saw benefits from both, and we saw that in both the Flexibles and Rigid segment as well. So that was pleasing. And look, on the operational side, what have we been doing, we\u2019ve been really both proactive and aggressive in flexing the cost base. And that\u2019s into account the lower demand environment. So we\u2019ve been certainly eliminating shifts to take labor out where we can, reducing the overtime to take that labor cost out, taking extended shuts when we\u2019re aligning with some of our customers, so we\u2019re going to take extended shuts over long weekends and other things to get the plants fully closed and get the cost out that way. We\u2019re driving procurement. Obviously, in a lower volume environment, that\u2019s also an opportunity for us to drive procurement savings and we\u2019ve been really focused on that, and the team has done really good work there. And we\u2019ve been tightly controlling our discretionary spend. So that\u2019s kind of on the operating side. And then on the structural side, that\u2019s more about plant closures. So we\u2019ve announced seven plant closures and two restructures. And more recently, we\u2019ve actually completed the closure around three or four of those. So we\u2019ve now started to see that benefit flow through as we anticipated. And that program was going to deliver about a $50 million EBIT benefit over the program, $35 million, predominantly in the second half of FY \u201824 and then another $15 million into FY \u201825. And we\u2019re pleased to report that we are now seeing those benefits come through. And in Q3, that contributed $15 million. The majority of that was in Flexibles, but also a few million in Rigid. So again, good cost control in both of those areas. And it\u2019s difficult to determine how much of that is going to stick with the business long-term. But I guess what we would say is that we\u2019ve taken a pretty significant head count out of the business. If you think about the structural cost out, I mean, those structural costs that have come out and they\u2019re permanent. So the $50 million over time that comes through will be permanent. I mean on the procurement benefits, they\u2019ll be sustained. The productivity we\u2019d anticipate over the last several quarters, we\u2019ve improved productivity, improved efficiency, being able to do more with less. So again, we\u2019d expect that to continue. But as the volumes come back, we will have to put labor back into the business, rebuild shifts, but it\u2019s not going to be linear. So we expect that we will continue to see margin improvement. And this will just contribute to Amcor\u2019s ongoing margin enhancement. We typically, over a long period of time, have added 20 to 30 basis points in margin a year. And this program \u2013 we\u2019d expect to continue that through the cost measures that we\u2019ve taken here, and you saw that in the quarter. I mean we delivered a 120 basis point increase on the back of volumes improving, but cost take out really strong and the performance there across the business was great. So we feel pretty good about where we\u2019re at. There\u2019s still more cost to come out. You\u2019ll see further benefits from the structural programs in Q4 as well as some ongoing efficiency benefits from the actions we\u2019ve already taken. Peter Konieczny : And I would add that we\u2019re particularly pleased with the work that\u2019s been done in the Rigid segment here because we acknowledged that the business returned active profit growth in the third quarter on the back of a pretty soft environment still. So that speaks to a good leverage in that business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Purtell of Macquarie. Your line is open. John Purtell : Good afternoon, Peter and Michael. I\u2019ll just ask my one. The sequential volume pickup in Flexibles, just from the commentary and the release, so that appeared to mainly come from emerging markets rather than developed markets. So was there much sequential volume improvement in North America and Europe, for example? Peter Konieczny : Yes, that\u2019s also a great question. So in terms of our country sort of performance or the different regions, you\u2019re right, we saw low single-digit growth in emerging markets in the third quarter, which was obviously pleasing and positive. And on the developed markets, we saw a bigger sequential improvement while we\u2019re still negative in terms of our volume performance versus prior year. Now you got to keep in mind that the bigger markets were the ones that were more heavily hit with inventory builds and now with a normalization, therefore, the destocking. And that would also make sense, particularly with our exposure to healthcare in those markets. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Richard Johnson of Jefferies. Your line is open. Richard Johnson : Thanks, very much. PK, I think I\u2019m right in saying you pretty much worked in every part of the business, except Rigid. I\u2019d be really interested just to get a sense of how you feel about the strategic positioning of the group overall at the moment, but also particularly focusing on Rigid Plastics, which is perhaps in a slightly different position. And with the backdrop of in the beverage market anyway, other substrates appearing to be recovering a lot quicker than plastics. Peter Konieczny : Yes, Richard, thanks for the question. I mean there is we\u2019re in a particular situation right now with the business. We\u2019ve had a couple of tough quarters behind us with volume weakness. And we\u2019ve worked really hard to position the business as well as possible to take advantage of the volumes improving again. And we believe that\u2019s exactly the situation we\u2019re in right now. So we said in discussing \u2013 after discussing the second quarter, we said we feel like the second quarter for the business was below point. And particularly now as we\u2019re having the third quarter an hour back, I think we can confirm that. That\u2019s where we stand. And we believe that we will see a better volume performance in Q4. So that\u2019s the starting point. In that environment, we felt we want to get, first of all, back to the earnings capacity of the businesses that we have without asking strategic questions about the businesses. And we believe, particularly to Rigid Plastics, you\u2019re right. I\u2019ve been around in Amcor a bit, Rigid Plastics, I\u2019ve not managed myself. But when we look at Rigid Plastics, we think it\u2019s a good business strategically. And I\u2019ll give you a couple of views here from my side. First of all, it\u2019s a scale business. It\u2019s business for Amcor. There\u2019s no question about it. And secondly, when you look at the portfolio of the business, it\u2019s actually a number of different businesses under one roof. We \u2013 often, we focus very strong in discussing North American beverage, but it\u2019s more than that. We have a specialty containers business. So where we started to diversify, we have a Latin American business and we have a closures business with our [indiscernible] business. So it\u2019s a portfolio of businesses. We have really good industry positions. And across Rigids where we participate, we like the customer relationships that we have with good solid customer relationships. And on top of that, also in the overall context of plastic, we have a strong sustainability profile, particularly in that business, which is really important. And finally, I\u2019ll come back to what I said at the beginning. We\u2019ve done a lot of strengthening in the business and the restructuring, for example, with the footprint optimization that we\u2019ve gone through when we\u2019ve generated a leverage that has enabled us to return the business back to profit growth. So I think where we stand right now is we want to see the volumes come back and then we want to see what the business can deliver. There\u2019s no question that we want the business to deliver more and that\u2019s where I would leave it for now. By the way, I think \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you said it\u2019s the Rigid Plastics business or the Rigid Packaging business. Actually, we call the Rigid Packaging business, and it\u2019s just a little clarification. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Wilson of Jarden Australia. Your line is open. James Wilson : Hey, guys. Good morning. Would you be able to just talk us through the net interest guidance that you guys have put out, particularly what\u2019s driving the lower net interest given that leverage looks unchanged in your guidance? I understand that you\u2019ve had some working capital improvements, but are there anything else that\u2019s driving that? Michael Casamento : Yes. No, thanks for the question. You saw us we reduced slightly the guidance. Our guidance prior to this quarter was $315 million to $330 million, and we reduced that down to $310 million to $320 million. And look, that\u2019s really just on the back of the timing of the cash flows and the working capital improvements. We saw a little better timing of cash coming into the business, which, as we look at the forecast for the fourth quarter, we can see that and see that there\u2019s a little bit of upside there on the interest cost. So we adjusted the guidance range accordingly. But outside of that, there\u2019s not a lot of to it. No real change in the rate profile or the mix of debt. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos of Bank of America. Your line is open. George Staphos : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. PK, could you give us a bit more color in terms of some of the trends you\u2019re seeing in Flexibles, in cheese and protein and some of the other key markets. And relatedly, are you seeing your customers perhaps pushing back some of their sustainability targets one of the larger branded companies and what are the implications for you in terms of growth as well? Thank you. Peter Konieczny : Sure. So in Flexibles, again, a pretty significant improvement in volumes between Q2 and Q3. I did make a comment earlier in terms of the two main drivers here : market impact. We are pretty much \u2013 were flat in the third quarter and the destocking sort of went to low single digits, and it pretty much is the healthcare impact of destocking that drove the volume decline versus prior year and the balance of the portfolio is pretty much flat to slightly growing. Now in terms of the category performance against that, you would remember that we\u2019re driving a couple of priority categories here in the business where we believe we have really differentiated products and a good position in the market and where we like the market dynamics. And those would be healthcare need. You have heard us talk to that protein, protein breaks out and cheese and meat. Hot-fill beverage, obviously, would be one pet food premium coffee. And those are really the five focused categories that we drive. And we have seen, particularly in pet care, meat and cheese, we\u2019ve seen growth in the quarter, which we are pleased with. Now I will say these are green shoots and don\u2019t walk away from the call believing that this is like significant growth numbers. These would be low single digits. So we got to stay bolted here. But we like what we see, and we\u2019d love to see a little more. Maybe a little more color here on cheese, as you particularly asked North America and Europe, we would be up also on the basis of less destocking. Meat, also less destocking and some regional wins that we have seen. Sorry, I just want to take the other part of the question, which was just check my notes here on the sustainability side and targets being pushed out and the effect on our business. Look, we follow the discussions closely. Actually, we are part of the conversations. And of course, we noticed that some industry participants have started to think about resetting their targets for their sustainability initiatives. At the end of the day, we are talking about essentially putting circularity in place, a circular economy for plastic, which will be the critical initiative to keep plastic waste out of the environment. That requires a lot of things that have to come together, and we are going to have to work together. Nobody can do that alone. And I think the understanding in the industry right now is after having worked very closely on the topic that it may make a little \u2013 take a little more time to get to the targets that we have set years ago. I mean I don\u2019t know if you particularly think about Unilever, who has come out with pushing the targets backwards. But they were the first ones to come out and make a commitment, and that was sort of in 2017, if I have that correctly in my mind. And over the years, they have learned a lot, and the industry has learned a lot. So, I think it\u2019s a matter of additional realism to just simply [Technical Difficulty] what they are saying. Now, in terms of Amcor, we have made a pledge in 2018, we are the first packaging company out there to pledge that will make 100% of our packaging recyclable and reusable or compostable by 2025, and we are pretty much around the corner. We do not have the need to push our targets out at this point in time. We are making really good progress because we have, at this point in time, roughly 90% of our packaging portfolio in recycle-ready structures or we have those alternatives available, and we are ready to sell them to customers when they want them. So, everybody needs to do their piece. We are holding on to our targets right now. We don\u2019t think that it means anything to us that others are pushing their targets out. We are very committed to our sustainability targets. Like the industry is, particularly our big customers are particularly Unilever is. So, we continue to drive that with full force. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brook Campbell of Barrenjoey. Your line is open. Brook Campbell : Yes. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Just with respect to trajectory in the business, this financial year has been better than expected. In the third quarter, you saw some EPS good versus back in Feb, the expectation was for the third quarter to be down a bit at EPS. And despite this, you have kept your fourth quarter EPS growth at mid-single digits, which is unchanged. So, my question really is, why wouldn\u2019t the better performance for the first three quarters continue into the fourth quarter? Any reasons what\u2019s holding you back from upgrading that fourth quarter expectation would be great? Thanks. Michael Casamento : Yes. Thanks. Brook, it\u2019s Michael here. I can take that one for you. So yes, look, we finished Q3 with EPS growth, which was really pleasing. And that was on the back of a couple of things, slightly better volumes really coming out of that December period as P.K. touched on earlier. When we look our way through January, clearly, we saw an improved performance and some of that was relating to some of the unwind out in December. We weren\u2019t 100% sure on how that might translate for the rest of the quarter. And what we saw in February was some more unwind clearly from December, which helped improve the performance in the March quarter and led to us being able to deliver EPS growth, which was really pleasing. So, you have seen us increase the full year guidance. We have taken the full year guidance to $0.685, $0.71, so an increase there. That\u2019s really on the back of that improved performance in Q3. In Q4, we are still expecting sequential improvement, both in volumes and profit. And clearly, the driver of that, we are going to see that sequential improvement in the volume really held back by the continued destocking in healthcare. That\u2019s really the key point that\u2019s holding the volumes back in Q4 as P.K. touched on. That in itself has some unfavorable mix, which we have talked to in the past. So, that will continue into Q4, although start to abate and certainly down favorable mix from healthcare will unwind as volumes start to normalize into the future there. But Q4 is still expecting good cost out, good leverage through the P&L from that cost initiative as well as the structural piece, adding through there. And we are also expecting the earnings trajectory to improve to that mid-single digit. We get benefits from the Q4, the absorption in Q4, which is seasonally our biggest quarter as well. So, we feel pretty good about where the outlook is for Q4. We have confidence in delivering within that range. What we have seen in the early parts of April confirmed the volume outlook, so we feel confident there. And we just felt that we didn\u2019t need to get ahead of ourselves at this point in time. Clearly, we have given you a range. We have given the marketing range. So, that\u2019s a reasonable range in Q4. And if the volumes come in a little better than what we are expecting, then, clearly, that\u2019s one way that the outcome for the full year could get towards the upper end of the range, along with cost and let\u2019s see where raw materials impact as well. So, overall, I would say we feel pretty good about where we have landed in Q3 and what\u2019s ahead of us in Q4 to deliver a good year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Chau of MST. Your line is open. Keith Chau : Good afternoon Peter and Michael. Peter, a question just around the PPWR that was voted into European Parliament earlier in this month, can you give us a sense of what Amcor is planning with respect to any changes to the regulation around plastics in the European Union? I know there is some impacts that are expected to the, I guess a headwind for the plastics industry in Europe by 2030. But just we came to hear your views on whether you think there is a headwind for the Amcor flexibles business? And if there are any mitigation strategies that are being put in place or whether Amcor is planning ahead to mitigate those headwinds? Thank you. Peter Konieczny : Yes. It\u2019s also a great question and obviously falls into our sustainability strategy. Look, I will start out by saying that we are very supportive of regulatory and legislative developments that sort of drive the whole industry to this circular economy for plastic. And as such, the PPWR is actually welcomed from \u2013 by Amcor and from Amcor because I think we are making \u2013 we are creating an environment that allows us and the whole industry to make more progress into that direction. Again, everybody has a role to play. We are sitting in the value chain at pretty much the start. Our job is to come up with structures for plastic packaging that are recycle-ready that can be recycled. And I said a little earlier that we are making really good progress in hitting our targets by the end of 2025. So, when customers want to have these structures, we are ready to provide them to the extent we are not doing that already today, right. So, these \u2013 many of these cycle ready structures are commercial. And by creating a regulatory environment, everybody gets level set. And we can work with certainty in certain directions in order to support the business and help the very efficient and high-performance packaging substrate, find its place also in the context of sustainability. I mean there is a place for plastic here. And we got to remind ourselves why we have so much plastic packaging. It\u2019s because it\u2019s a very efficient and high-performing substrate. The challenge is end of life. The circular economy addresses that and regulation that gets us into that direction is welcomed. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Cameron McDonald of E&P. Your line is open. Cameron McDonald : Good morning. Question for Michael, if I can, just going back to the interest rate guidance. Can you remind us of what your hedging profile actually looks like? There was \u2013 obviously, last year, you had some significant interest rate exposure. And my understanding is that, that was mainly due to hedging and the exposure to floating rates. So, as interest rate expectations have been rather volatile in the last month or so, how do we think about your hedging profile in that and the exposure to that changing interest rate environment into FY \u201825, please? Michael Casamento : Yes, sure. I think \u2013 look, the first point we could start, the debt profile today is about 70% fixed, 30% floating. With that, we have no maturities coming off now until the middle of 2025. So, from that respect, we have got a bit of flexibility in how we can manage the debt book and the interest exposure. As you look forward, we haven\u2019t provided any guidance for FY \u201825. But clearly, we have given you some guidance for \u201824. If you look at our debt profile and then you look at some of the forward curves over the next 12 months or so, we are not expecting a material movement in our interest expense just based on the debt profile we have and the maturities that we have got coming. So, we have got some flexibility to work through how we manage that debt book and that currency exposure as well. So, when you put all that together, we don\u2019t see any material change or impact on the interest expense as we look forward into \u201825. But we will provide you further guidance on that in August when we provide the full year guidance for FY \u201825 at that time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Longo of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Anthony Longo : Hey. Good afternoon Peter and Michael. Just a quick one on destocking you spoken about that a fair bit already. But how are you ultimately thinking about the restocking cycle in light of as some of the early positive customer discussions that you have had to-date? And ultimately, what does that inform the top line growth expectations from here? I appreciate there is no guidance, but just how you are thinking about that and philosophies around your customers\u2019 inventory management from here as well? Peter Konieczny : Look, I will start and then maybe Michael wants to build on it. The way that we look at this is the destocking that we are seeing currently is really a correction of the industry of holding too much inventory after a pretty volatile environment, which was driven by partly supply chain shocks that we have seen in the industry sort of de-risking and protecting their top line by building inventory and then there are other reasons. But anyway, what we are seeing right now is that the industry is normalizing across the categories. We see healthcare a little bit delayed because that\u2019s a very conservative industry, and they probably built more because of the dynamics over the last couple of years. And now they have \u2013 they are starting to be confident, again, in the environment so that they can also reduce their inventory levels again to a normal level. Now, the new normal is probably different from what it was before holding cost of inventories because of interest rates drive that down further. The industry is looking at new efficiency levels in terms of running inventories, and that\u2019s what we are going through right now. Going forward, we will see changes in inventory, but those will be tactical or they will go along with the seasonality of the business. So, I would not think about it as there was a trend to restocking. The industry is coming down to a new normal and everything that we see from there is going to be tactical or following the seasonality of the different businesses. So, that\u2019s how I think about it. And therefore, once we have this extraordinary impact behind us, and we will see with our category and customer exposure and then also \u2013 hopefully going forward, also a renewed and stronger consumer interest and demand, we will see top line growth. Tracey Whitehead : Operator, we have time for one more question, please. Operator : Thank you. Your last question comes from the line of Andrew Scott of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Andrew Scott : Thank you. Michael, just a question for you, $40-odd million of below the line items there, I see the restructuring charges up relative to last quarter. Can you talk to us just two things, cash versus non-cash there? And when do we get line of sight to maybe seeing an end of these below the line items? Michael Casamento : Look, Andrew, the main items in the quarter are really around the restructuring program, which we have had in there for the last 12 months or so. That program is pretty much two-thirds of the way through. We have now started to see the benefits come through from that program. You might remember, we committed to invest around $170 million in cash. We have spent on that program to-date about $110 million. So, we have still got $50 million to $60 million to go. But we are starting to see the benefits come through from that, so we are pretty pleased about the progress. And really by the end of the calendar year, we would expect to be most of the way through that program. So, that\u2019s the way we see it from there. And as I said, we are pleased that we are now getting the benefits of $15 million in the quarter came through and we will expect to build on that in quarter four and then into \u201825. So, pretty pleased with where the program is at and it\u2019s on track. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to management for closing remarks. Peter Konieczny : Yes. Thank you, operator. Look, thank you everybody for the interest in the company. The only thing that I want to say here before we close the call is we are pretty pleased with the way how the Q3 turned out for us. I hope we were able to demonstrate that we \u2013 this was based on a broad-based volume improvement that we have seen in the business, combined with really some good cost performance in the third quarter. That also has impacted our margin performance. And more importantly, we believe that we have some underlying momentum here in order to \u2013 that will carry into Q4. So, we are very pleased with the situation we are in. We are going to take advantage of the momentum. And with that, we are going to close the call, and we are going to talk to each other again at the end of the fiscal year. Thank you very much. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Tracey Whitehead, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Tracey Whitehead : Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining Amcor's fiscal 2024 fourth quarter and full year earnings call. Joining today is Peter Konieczny, Interim Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Casamento, Chief Financial Officer. Before I hand over, let me note a few items. On our website, amcor.com, under the Investors section, you'll find today's press release and presentation, which we'll discuss on this call. Please be aware that we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and related reconciliations can be found in that press release and the presentation. Remarks will also include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions. The second slide in today's presentation lists several factors that could cause future results to differ than current estimates. Reference can be made to Amcor's SEC filings including our statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q for further details. Please note that during the question-and-answer session, we request that you limit yourself to a single question and then rejoin the queue if you have any additional follow-ups. With that, over to you, PK. Peter Konieczny : Thank you, Tracey, and thank you to all who have joined us for today's call. I want to open the call with a big thank you to our Amcor colleagues around the world, all of whom demonstrated tremendous focus in fiscal '24. Their hard work and dedication enabled us to improve our financial performance through the year and to finish the year strong. And I want to publicly recognize their efforts. In terms of Q4, we start as always with safety on slide three. Safety is our number one priority and our efforts to provide a safe and healthy work environment for our teams resulted in another year of improved performance, which reinforces our industry leadership when it comes to safety. 73% of our sites have remained injury-free for 12 months or longer and overall, Amcor experienced a 12% reduction in injuries, compared to fiscal '23. Our commitment to our people and to their safety remains our most important value, and we continue to aspire to achieve our ultimate goal of zero injuries. Turning to slide four. Amcor's near-term priorities remain consistent with those I shared on our Q3 earnings call, and I'm happy to report we are successfully delivering against these, and -- against these priorities. As I just mentioned, providing a safe and healthy work environment for our global workforce will always be number one. Second, is to stay close to our key stakeholders, including employees and customers, which helped us finish the fiscal '24 year strongly. Our teams continued to execute well in the fourth quarter, maintaining cost discipline as volume trends continued to improve sequentially with a return to volume growth in Q4. As a result, we delivered another quarter of solid margin expansion and earnings per share growth above the expectations we set out in April. Third, is to build on the progress we have worked hard to deliver across the business and ensure we maintain momentum in fiscal '25. We expect our earnings and volume performance to continue to improve, and this is reflected in our fiscal '25 guidance. And fourth, I and our senior leaders continue to focus on providing stability for the business and helping our teams deliver for all our stakeholders. We're executing well and winning with our customers as we continue to reinforce the Amcor strategy, agenda, and priorities have not changed. Moving to our key messages for today on slide five. First, Amcor reported strong financial results for the fourth quarter, driven by solid performance in the underlying business and a return to volume growth, resulting in both segments delivering adjusted EBIT growth on a comparable basis. Second, volumes, EPS growth, and free cash flow were ahead of expectations we set out in April. Overall volumes increased 1% in the quarter compared to last year, which exceeded the low single-digit decline we were anticipating. Earnings per share also outperformed expectations, up 9%, which was above our guidance for mid-single-digit growth. Third, we expect to build further momentum and deliver annual EPS growth through continued strong performance from the underlying business. At the midpoint of our fiscal '25 EPS guidance range of growth of 3% to 8%, we expect total annual value generated to once again be consistent with the 10% to 15% outlined on our shareholder value-creation model, assuming a dividend yield aligned with historical average. It is important to point out that we expect the underlying business to continue to deliver strong growth in line with the high-single-digit earnings growth experienced in Q4, considering our guidance includes an EPS headwind of approximately 4 percentage points related to normalization of incentives. Michael will step through the components embedded in our guidance range in more detail broadly. Our final key message is that our capital allocation priorities and strategies for long-term growth have not changed. We continue to invest in organic growth across the business, including in higher-value priority categories in emerging markets. Strategic M&A also remains an important source of incremental growth and value creation. We believe, the strength of our market positions, our opportunities to invest for growth, our execution capabilities, and our commitment to a compelling and growing dividend, and to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating sums up to a convincing investment case for Amcor. Moving to Slide 6, for a summary of our financial results. We finished fiscal '24 on a strong note. As customer demand continued to improve off second quarter lows, and our teams did an excellent job leveraging our differentiated value proposition to support our customers and drive volumes higher. At the same time, our unwavering focus on proactive cost management through the year resulted in a -- in four consecutive quarters of strong margin expansion. Overall volumes returned to growth earlier than we anticipated and were up 1% in Q4, our second consecutive quarter of strong sequential volume improvement. As expected, volumes across healthcare categories and in the North America beverage business remained soft through the fourth quarter. Combined, these two businesses, which represent approximately 25% of sales in Q4, unfavorably impacted overall volumes by approximately 2%. Across the balance of the business, overall volumes were approximately 3% higher than the June quarter last year. This reflects broad-based improvements in customer demand across many end markets and what we believe is the end of destocking in all categories other than healthcare. Price mix had an unfavorable impact on sales of approximately 3%, primarily driven by continued destocking in high-margin healthcare categories. Cost reduction and productivity initiatives remained a focus and we delivered another quarter of significant cost savings totaling more than $110 million, including an additional $20 million of benefits from structural cost initiatives in Q4. This builds on the outstanding efforts by all our teams across the businesses through the first three quarters, bringing the total cost savings for the year to more than $40 million, including structural savings of $35 million. The result of improving volume trends and our focus on cost and productivity actions was another quarter of strong earnings leverage as momentum in Amcor's underlying business continued. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.211 grew by 9% on a comparable constant currency basis, above our April guidance for mid-single-digit growth and adjusted EBIT was up 4% compared with last year. Overall, for fiscal '24, we delivered adjusted EPS toward the top-end of our guidance range we provided last August and our ongoing focus on cash conversion was rewarded with adjusted free cash flow of $952 million, up more than $100 million of last year and just above the top-end of our guidance range. We also continued to return significant cash to shareholders through a compelling and growing dividend in addition to share repurchase, which combined totaled approximately $750 million for fiscal '24. I'll turn it over to Michael now to provide some further color on the financials and our outlook. Michael? Michael Casamento : Thanks, PK, and hello, everyone. Beginning with the Flexibles segment on slide seven, and focusing on our fiscal Q4 performance. Q4 volumes increased by 3%, which represented a significant sequential improvement of 5 percentage points compared with the March quarter. Net sales, however, were down 1% on a comparable constant currency basis, whilst volume growth was offset by unfavorable price mix of approximately 4%, primarily related to lower healthcare sales, which we anticipated. Destocking in healthcare categories continued in North America and Europe and this resulted in a headwind of approximately 2% on overall segment volumes. Across the balance of our Flexibles portfolio, Amcor experienced very solid growth with volumes increasing by approximately 5% in the quarter. The improved customer demand we saw in the third quarter continued as customers increased their focus on growing volumes and returned to more normalized order patterns now that destocking has ended. This led to broad-based growth across most geographies with volumes increasing in several categories, including meat, cheese, home and personal care, and unconverted film and foil. Across North America and Europe, fourth quarter demand improved across many end markets, resulting in a return to overall volume growth in the low-to mid-single-digit range in both regions despite continued softness in healthcare. In North America, volumes were higher in meat, cheese, and snacks categories. And in Europe, the business delivered particularly strong volume growth in meat, home and personal care, and unconverted film and foil. Emerging market volumes were up mid-single digits in Q4. Most countries experienced solid growth with volumes in China increasing for the fourth consecutive quarter and strength continuing in India, Thailand, Brazil, and Mexico, to name a few. Adjusted EBIT for the quarter of $403 million was 5% higher than last year on a comparable constant currency basis. Higher volumes combined with strong cost performance through the quarter, including from restructuring initiatives, led to another quarter of margin expansion with EBIT margins up 110 basis points to 15%. Turning to Rigid Packaging on Slide 8. Volumes and earnings trajectory for Rigid continued to improve in the fourth quarter with the business delivering consecutive quarters of earnings growth in the second half. As anticipated, overall volume performance for the business improved sequentially as the 5% volume decline in Q4 was 3 percentage points better than the March quarter. As expected, the Q4 decline was driven by lower volumes in the North America beverage business. Across the balance of the Rigid packaging portfolio, volumes were in line with the fourth quarter last year and favorable price mix benefits of approximately 3% resulted in a 2% decline in net sales on a comparable constant currency basis. In North America, beverage volumes were down 8%, reflecting lower consumer demand in Amcor's key end markets and unfavorable customer mix. Volumes improved by 3 percentage points on a sequential basis as destocking ended and warmer weather resulted in modest improvement in consumer consumption versus the March quarter. In Latin America, volumes increased in the low single-digit range compared with last year, driven by continued growth in Brazil and in Colombia. And from an earnings perspective, the business delivered another quarter of earnings growth and margin expansion through an ongoing focus on cost reduction and productivity measures and the realization of benefits from restructuring initiatives. Adjusted EBIT increased by 2% in Q4 with EBIT margin increasing by 70 basis points to 8.8%. Moving to cash and the balance sheet on Slide 9. Adjusted free cash flow for fiscal '24 was just above the top end of our guidance range at $952 million, up more than $100 million or 12% compared with last year. Cash generation was strong through the fourth quarter and we delivered good cash conversion by remaining laser-focused on improving working capital performance with inventories reducing for the sixth consecutive quarter. The timing of spend on CapEx projects was also a modest tailwind in the year, which we expect to unwind in fiscal '25. Leverage of 3.1 times was down 0.3 of a turn from the March quarter and was in line with our expectations for year-end. This brings me to the outlook on Slide 10. For fiscal '25, we expect to continue building on the volume and earnings momentum we achieved through the second half of fiscal '24. Adjusted earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.72 to $0.76 per share on a reported basis, representing comparable constant currency growth of 3% to 8%. As PK noted earlier, we expect the growth in the underlying business will remain strong in fiscal '25. However, it's important to note that our guidance includes an EPS headwind of approximately 4% related to more normalized levels of incentive compensation based on our expectations for improved annual financial results. Excluding this incentive normalization, our guidance range implies expected growth from the underlying business in the high-single to low-double-digit range. Our guidance range assumes an expected volume increase in the low-to-mid single-digit range for the year with trading performance in July aligned with this expectation. Interest expense is expected to be between $290 million and $305 million and the effective tax rate is estimated to be in the range of 19% to 20%. When combining interest and tax in absolute terms, the expectation is for a modest headwind to earnings when compared with fiscal '24. In terms of phasing, we anticipate this will be broadly aligned with historical average of approximately 45% of earnings being delivered in the first half of the year and 55% in the second half, with the fourth quarter typically the strongest of the year. And finally, we expect to continue to generate strong adjusted free cash flow in the range of $900 million to $1 billion, even as we fund an increase in capital expenditure of approximately $40 million to $60 million from a lower base in '24, which I mentioned earlier. And we expect to exit the year with leverage back within our 2.5 times to 3 times management range. We are pleased with the finish to fiscal '24 and look forward to delivering strong financial results in '25 and beyond. So, with that, I'll hand it back to you, PK. Peter Konieczny : Thank you, Michael. In closing, on Slide 11, we finished '24 on a strong note and we are encouraged by the broad-based improvement in volumes we're seeing across most geographies and end markets. Earnings both -- earnings growth in both segments in the second half of fiscal '24, combined with a return to volume growth in the fourth quarter and the trends experienced in the first several weeks of fiscal '25, give us confidence that momentum will continue to build in the underlying business. We expect overall volumes to continue to grow in fiscal '25 and we will maintain a sharp focus on cost control and productivity initiatives to drive solid earnings growth. And importantly, assuming a dividend yield aligned with historical average, at the midpoint of our EPS guidance range, we are well positioned to deliver annualized value generated in fiscal '25 to be in line with the 10% to 15% outlined in our shareholder value-creation model. We will continue to capitalize on opportunities to grow the business by staying close to our customers, providing the support and the differentiated more sustainable packaging solutions they need, to protect, preserve, and promote their products as they drive their own volume growth. We continue to invest in organic growth, including in higher-value priority categories and emerging markets. Strategic M&A is an important source for incremental growth and value-creation and we are committed to a compelling dividend which grows annually. We're confident in our execution capabilities and in the opportunities we have, to continue delivering profitable growth from the underlying business and to create strong free cash flow in fiscal '25 and beyond. Operator, we are now ready to turn the line over to questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Your line is open. Ghansham Panjabi : Thank you. Hello, everybody. Look, can you just give us a sense as to what you're seeing as it relates to true market conditions? I mean, obviously, you're cycling over easier comparisons from a year ago, just given inventory destocking, etc., but what is your characterization of the actual end-market in context of what we read about with consumer affordability issues and so on? And I guess I'm asking because last year, your volumes were down 5% in fiscal year '24 and your guidance is, I think it was low-to mid-single-digit volumes. So, just trying to get a sense as to what you're actually seeing in the market. Peter Konieczny : Yes. Thanks, Ghansham. Let me take that question here and then see if Michael wants to build if needed or required. Look, first of all, we've been very pleased with the performance of the volumes with a sequential improvement from Q3 to Q4, which was even better than what we expected. And we went back to volume growth, which was again better than the low-single-digit decline that we had indicated after Q3. And we've been pleased with that being pretty much broad-based across the different regions and categories. So, it was a broad momentum that was building here and we're very pleased to see that too. Then, if I double-click on where the 1% comes from, and I try to depict that into the different drivers. The first thing that I would say is, it's not necessarily consumer demand. Consumer demand continues to be muted. We would consider that to be low-single-digit down still. And also when we go into '25 with our expectations, we wouldn't assume that that necessarily improves. And what we're seeing is that our customers are starting to do better, our customers. When we talked about this also in the last earnings call, and where we pointed out that our customers are looking for a better balance between volumes and price. And you also see that when you go through some of the announcements that have come out lately. So, that's better and we are demonstrating an ability to win with those customers. And that is through what we have to offer. And I would just call that on a headline, the value proposition that we can bring to the customer. So, that's encouraging. And that's really the driver of the improvement to a large extent. Of course, we are seeing some benefits from cycling out of the destocking that we had last year. In the fourth quarter, to give you a feel, that would have been not really much, maybe a couple of percentage points. But also remember that we're still seeing destocking in the healthcare business that pretty much goes against us. And those would be the major drivers. And they are very consistent with sort of what we're seeing when we look to '25. I hope that sort of answers the question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Chau of MST Financial Services. Your line is open. Keith Chau : Hi there, Peter and Michael. I just want to maybe actually reflect back on that question. So, what you're saying is that the consumer is still weak at the moment. So, the growth is not consumer demand, still low-single-digit down. Your volumes in FY \u201825, it feels like part of that is the unwinded destocking, which is a couple of percent that you're expecting kind of low-to mid-single-digit. So, there is maybe some slight improvement in your underlying volume. So, I'm just trying to work out what the difference is between those two factors. Like who do you think is losing and taking share? I'm just trying to square up the numbers from the first question. Thank you. Peter Konieczny : Yes, Keith. So, first of all, I would say it's not really a share story here. It comes down to, again, the things that I've mentioned before, the consumer demand we would hope to improve going forward, but we're careful in terms of our expectations for the next year. We're not banking much on that to happen. If it comes, that would be great and that would be providing further tailwinds for us. And again, what you're seeing is, on a comparative basis to prior periods, you would see the stocking sort of cycling off. That gets us a better volume performance in terms of what we report. And a little more color on that, in the first half of '25, we would be comping a pretty broad range destocking versus prior period. However, we said that pretty much came to an end after the first half last year. So, that won't be there in the second-half anymore. And in the first-half, we will still continue to see destocking in the healthcare category, which is pretty much a quarter longer than what we guided towards in Q3 -- in the earnings call after Q3. But that will abate in the back half of the year. And then we continue to believe that our customers, and to a large extent we have good exposure to big global customers, that they will continue to drive their volume performance, which is very consistent with what you're hearing. And we have -- we're partnering up with them. Like we have built a good relationship with them over the past. We always have been very close to the big customers. And as their volumes are coming back, we take advantage of that. So, you pull all that together, that sort of results to -- into the volume guidance of low-single-digit to mid-single-digit next year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Adam Samuelson : Yes. Thank you. Good evening, everyone. I guess maybe continuing along that line of discussion, maybe I'd like to dig in a little more on the healthcare end market, which is still your most challenged. And if I was doing the algebra right, it seems like you're implying that was down near high-single-digit volumes in the fiscal fourth quarter. Sounds like destocking continuing for at least one more quarter. You talked about the confidence that you have of that ending by the end of this calendar year, and maybe a little bit more clarity on what the assumptions are for the healthcare business for volumes in fiscal '25, has obviously had important implications on mix as we move through the year. Thank you. Peter Konieczny : Yes, good question, Adam. I mean, first of all, I'd say that healthcare is as far as I'm concerned, a real gem in our portfolio. Let's start right there. And if we're challenged with the healthcare category, it would really just be on the back of the normalization that the category is seeing after a major dislocation that the category has gone through in the more recent past. And that dislocation is now coming to an end with the category essentially rightsizing their inventories. That's what we're seeing. So, we don't have any concerns overall in the stability and the attractiveness of this category to start right there. But what we're going through until the end of the calendar on the back of what we know right now is really just continued destocking. I can confirm that the high-level estimates that you're doing on volumes is correct in terms of high-single-digits being down in the more recent past. I think that the destocking that we've seen in Q4 is probably slightly better than what we've seen in Q3. And again, on the back of everything that we know, the destocking will come to an end by the end of the calendar. And that would be based on various conversations that we have with our customers and what they're confirming currently is happening in their business. Now, in the back half then when the destocking has come to an end, we're expecting a better volume performance with the business as you would imagine. And we would definitely have no concerns to believe that healthcare can return to growth rates that are in line with the historical averages of sort of mid-single-digits growth. The final point that I'd like to make maybe on healthcare is as I'm thinking through it, how to best answer your question. The destocking that we're seeing in healthcare is actually, when you look at the numbers, quite similar to some other categories that we've seen beforehand. It's just that healthcare started later, pretty much in Q2 last year, and has started mostly with medical on the medical side, which we've cycled through right now. And then with the phase delay, we've seen some impacts on the pharma side, which we're now crunching through. And that will come to an end by the end of the calendar, as I said before. Michael Casamento : And maybe Adam, just to pick up on the mix point. Yes, you're quite right. Obviously, the mix is unfavorable in Q4. And with the destocking continuing, if we think about our guidance assumptions for the FY \u201825, we would expect that negative mix to continue in the first half. But then as we head into the second half, it will obviously improve as we're through the destocking. So, on a full year basis, we probably expect the mix to be more neutral. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Kang with CLSA. Your line is open. Daniel Kang : Good morning, everyone. Just a quick question on capital management. I noticed that the Board has chosen to refrain from share buyback at this point. Can you talk us through the decision there? Is it a reflection of wanting to see leverage ratios lower or is it a reflection of more confidence in the M&A pipeline? Michael Casamento : Yes. Thanks, Dan. It's Michael here. I can take that one for you. Look, we've still got a little bit more to go of a buyback that was approved earlier on. So, we didn't do that in Q4. And that's really a function of, we have a good M&A pipeline and there's opportunities there as always. So, we elected to not do the buyback. From a capital allocation standpoint, I mean, the buyback is just one element of that. Clearly the strong cash flow, we direct the CapEx first to grow the business organically. We continue to pay a dividend and you saw us increase the dividend again and then with the free cash flow left over, clearly we'd like to invest that first and foremost in M&A because that's where we get the greatest return. And if that's not available, then the buyback is really the next alternative. So, the buyback is -- and obviously, it's a function of the cash flow performance as well. So, for now, we haven't called out a buyback for '25. We've still got to finish a little bit left over there to do. But we've got a good pipeline of M&A activity. We're expecting the cash flow in the business to be solid through the year as we've guided to $900 million to $1 billion. So, we'll see how things play out as we work our way through the year and if there's capacity to do the buyback, we'll do it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Your line is open. Anthony Pettinari : Good evening. We've come off two, three years of pretty sharp cost inflation that you had to absorb and pass on to your customers. Just wondering, as you look at the '25 guidance, what kind of cost inflation, raw material inflation, resin assumptions are baked in to the full year guidance? And how might it be different or not different than what you've kind of experienced over the last couple of years? Michael Casamento : Yes, you're quite right. I mean, we've been in a highly inflationary environment. Clearly, inflation is abating, though it's still at a later level, but clearly abating. I think from where we sit today, the main area of inflation now is really in the labor of things. And that's probably in that kind of mid-single-digit range, and we'd expect that again in FY \u201825. But our cost inflation in the quarter-four was about $35 million or $190 million for this year versus $340 million in the prior year. So, you can see that it is abating. And I think the main area really now is just on the labor side as we look forward. From a raw material standpoint, look, it's a pretty benign environment at the moment. I think in Q4, probably overall, and we buy a broad basket of raw materials and across multiple geographies across the globe. If I think about Q4, probably in general it was up kind of low-single-digit, I would say, and -- but it was a bit mixed by raw material types, so resin is up a little, aluminum up probably more mid-to-high, but then films and liquids were down. So, on balance, not a material impact to the business, and from an EBIT standpoint, we really, for the year, were pretty neutral on the raw material side. As we look into '25, really, as we look into the first quarter, again, we're seeing a pretty benign environment. If I think about North America and Europe, raw materials typically look pretty flat in the first quarter. Perhaps Asia is the one area where we might see some slight increases in raw materials, but, again, generally, I'd say the basket of goods is pretty benign across the globe. So, that's what we've factored into our guidance assumptions, and, of course, we've given you a range of growth in the guidance assumptions, kind of 3% to 8%. Obviously, raw materials is a factor within that. I mean, we pass through raw materials contractually, but there can be a lag. So, that's just one element that could get us to the bottom or upper end of that range. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Your line is open. George Staphos : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Hope you can hear me. Can you comment on the outlook for beverage in North America and when you expect the volumes to turn more positive? Thank you so much. Peter Konieczny : Yes, George, it's PK here. I'll take that question. Look, beverage in North America is a little more discretionary than many of the other categories that we serve. Think about the acetonics categories as such. We're seeing in the current environment, if you just look at scanner data, sort of low-single-digit to mid-single-digit decline in that category. And that's what we're facing in the market right now. On top of that, I would say that our performance is also somewhat impacted by our exposure to customers that are in their totality underperforming the market. Sort of some low-single-digit, if you want, and that sort of rolls up to our own volume performance. On your question, how do we expect that to continue? I think as we're looking at '25, it will to a large extent come down to the question of how consumer demand is developing in that category going forward. I think we've got to be realistic here. We've got to say that we're not overly ambitious in terms of expecting the volumes to turn around in the near future. We would hope that that's the case. But as we're looking into the next year, I think we're being realistic about that. And it has mostly to do with the discretionary sort of nature of the category that we're exposed to. So, that's how I would answer the question. I hope that helps. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Wilson with Jarden Australia. Your line is open. James Wilson : Morning, guys. Just heading into FY \u201825, can you give us a bit of a sense of the quantum of the $400 million of cost-out that you've managed to do over FY \u201824 that will have to come back into the business as volumes pick up? Michael Casamento : Yes, sure, James. It's Michael here. I can take that one. As you said, we've been pretty focused on cost in' 24 and I'm pleased with where we ended up. We've generated savings in excess of $440 million, which includes $35 million of benefits from the structural program that we've put in place as well. And if you think about where that's coming from, there's two elements to it, obviously. The operating performance of the business, we've been laser-focused on managing our shift patterns, taking whole shifts out where we can, and flexing the operational costs of the business to the lower volumes. Procurement has been a big driver in this environment, obviously. We've been working hard through our global reach and scale on that front. And discretionary spend has been managed quite tightly. Obviously, we've had a strong year in '24 and we'll be lapping some of that. But as we look into '25, the structural benefits of $35 million, there'll be a further $15 million in '25. So, that completes that program where we were going to invest $170 million in cash and get the $50 million out. So, we're well down the path of that and confident in that space. And then on the balance, I mean, we continue to get procurement benefits. We'll continue to manage the operations. But clearly, as the volumes increase, which is what we saw in Q4, we'll have to flex the labor back up to manage those higher volumes that we're anticipating. That said, it won't be linear. So, we'll be able -- we're more efficient today. We'll continue to see benefits from the cost takeout that we've had just in the efficiency as we deal with those increasing volumes working through the next year. So, hopefully, that helps. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brook Campbell-Crawford with Barrenjoey. Your line is open. Brook Campbell-Crawford: Yes. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one for you, Michael, please. Just around the D&A charge in the fourth quarter was quite a bit lower than we were thinking. It was down about 8% year-over-year or 6% quarter-on-quarter. Do you mind just commenting on what sort of drove that reduction in D&A in the quarter? And should we really just be analyzing that fourth quarter D&A charge when thinking about FY \u201825? Or is there other adjustments we need to think about? Thanks. Michael Casamento : Yes. Thanks, Brook. I can help you there. Look, in the quarter -- well, for the year, as I said, D&A was down kind of $7 million or thereabouts, not material. I mean, it's really a factor of a couple of things. Obviously, we reduced cap expense. So, you've got a little less there. And also, with the restructuring we've been doing, we've closed seven plants, four restructures as well. So, clearly, some assets have come out of the business from that front. And there's been some other minor adjustments here and there. So, as I look forward, I'd still expect depreciation to be in that kind of $400 million to $420 million range on an annual basis, which is, again, as we build cap expense in '25, as I mentioned in my speaking notes, we are expecting to increase CapEx again in '25 as we work our way through high volume. So, that will normalize some of that depreciation. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Richard Johnson with Jefferies. Your line is open. Richard Johnson : Thanks very much. PK, I've been thinking a little bit about the business kind of beyond the volume normalization process and in the nearer term, the benefits, your profitability is getting from the structural -- the restructuring program that you've put in place. Is it possible to get a sense from you when you look across your portfolio, which of course is very broad from both a category but a geographic perspective, are there areas that you think that could do with a bit of refreshing on the one hand or on the other hand, maybe structurally challenged in long term might actually be a drag on the growth that you think the business could ultimately produce? Thanks. Peter Konieczny : Yes. Hi, Richard. I wonder how I can best sort of answer that question you're asking about refreshing certain areas of the portfolio and seeing potential drags on the performance of the business going forward. I got to -- first of all, I got to remind everyone here, the position that I'm in and it's hard for me right now as an interim to sort of formulate the views on the long-term strategy of the Company, which that sort of touches on when you go to the portfolio. But in essence, having said that, I believe that the business should continue to focus on categories that are more attractive than others. And that would be a starting point, that we feel strongly about focusing the business on certain areas that are potentially value-driven, therefore higher margins and offering better growth than others. In Flexibles, the problem is always -- or the challenge is, you can be everything to everybody and that has never really played out. I'm a big fan of focusing the business on those areas that are more attractive to us. Now, the ones that I would call out here as just as examples is the protein category that we've talked about in the past, which breaks out into meat and into dairy, cheese to be a little more specific. We do like coffee or particularly premium coffee. We do like healthcare. While I did say that we're going through the short-term normalization of the business, we like pet food and so on and so forth. So, that's a good starting point. When you sort of go through the portfolio, you may find other categories that are less attractive and that is something that we sort of need to strategically think through. In terms of geographies, I like the exposure of the business between developed and emerging markets. And there, we would want to continue the journey that we've been on. You've seen us make acquisitions also in the past. If I just look at the healthcare business that we acquired in China, the Flexibles business in India, we made an acquisition in Eastern Europe, which is positive, just to mention a few examples. So, I think that's what we're doing. This is the way how we're thinking about it and we need to continue to think about it. And I hope that provides a bit of color to the question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Purtell with Macquarie. Your line is open. John Purtell : Good day, Peter and Michael. I hope you're both well. Look, just a question regarding the flow of volumes through the quarter. Where did the exit rate end at? And if you're able to make any comment on developed markets and emerging markets within that? Peter Konieczny : Yes, I'm happy to take that question. Look, I'll start out by saying I'm not a big believer in commenting on monthly volume performances because you have big swings in there and you can't really read too much into it. And I think that a quarter is better of an indicator for actual performance. And I would like to stay on that level. So, 1% overall growth in the fourth quarter is a good indication for the momentum that we carry forward into fiscal '25. Now, to the second part of the question, developed markets versus emerging markets, we have in the past quarter seen growth in the emerging markets like you would expect. The developed markets were a little more muted. And what's been encouraging in the fourth quarter is that the developed markets also returned back to growth. And I say that, particularly encouraged by the fact that they also have the large exposure to healthcare, where we have seen continued destocking. So, that's quite encouraging for us. So, again, developed markets performing better. Despite the healthcare destocking, emerging markets continue to grow. And that's the momentum that we carry forward. Hope that helps. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Cameron McDonald with E&P. Your line is open. Cameron McDonald : Good morning, guys. Just going back to sort of the structural questions that were asked before, we're seeing some changes in preference shift around substrate towards aluminum cans particularly. Is that providing any sort of headwind to the beverages segment that you've got and then -- and/or any of the regulatory changes in the European market that could also be providing a bit of a challenge going forward? If you can comment on those, please. Peter Konieczny : Yes, happy to do that. I mean, these are two big questions or one big question, maybe another one that I can take first. That's a little easier to answer. Let me go to the beverage question first. Substrates in the beverage side of the business, they do coexist, particularly between aluminum and PET and they both have their place. PET typically is, you see that on the go consumption resealable. And that's where PET sort of finds its home. So, in the different categories on beverage, you find PET or cans coexist or aluminum coexist. There is one category where they both sort of compete with each other. And that would be in the subsegment of CSD on the beverage side. Now, over long periods of time, we have seen pretty much constant share between the two substrates in that category. In the more recent past, given the more discretionary environment that we're looking at, consumers are shifting to the better value option. And those tend to be aluminum cans, which are sold in multi-packs through the big box stores and the channel. And because when you take a look at the price points, they seem to be more attractive. So, in the more recent times, we've seen a bit of a share shift to cans on that end. And then we'll have to see how that plays out as the environment normalizes. But it's not been a big trend for us that significantly impacts the volumes because it's really just this one subcategory. So, that said, to the second part of the question, regulatory developments, which is a different animal, but likewise really important for our business. What we've seen in Europe, particularly the packaging and packaging waste regulations come through, and we are obviously taking a close look at that. This is a regulatory development that we, to be honest with you, welcome, because at the end of the day, all these initiatives try to do one thing and try to accomplish one thing, which is, trying to keep plastic waste out of the environment. And that's much aligned with our targets here as a Company and comes back to our efforts in terms of the sustainability -- or on the sustainability side. The developments there, they help us essentially move the industry faster to an end-point that we're more than happy to support and that we feel we're very well-placed to support. We have made great progress on developing more sustainable products, which are designed to be recyclable. And the regulation that we've seen essentially moves the whole industry to the concept of circularity that we want to support and that we want to get in place. So, we're supportive of the regulatory developments there in Europe, but also elsewhere, and we welcome it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Chau with MST Financial Services. Your line is open. Keith Chau : Hi there. Thanks for taking my follow-up. One for Michael, just the restructuring costs seem to have subsided a touch in the fourth quarter. I think there are some restructuring costs to go in FY \u201825, below the line. Just wondering if you can give us a sense, Michael, on what the drag on that will be on cash flow? Thank you. Michael Casamento : That's okay. Look, we're -- the program was going to be around $170 million in cash-out. We've spent net today around $110 million. So, we've got FY \u201825, we'll pretty much finish the program. So, it's another $60 million-odd to go, which you'd expect to see in the adjusted cash flow. Keith Chau : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Reilly with UBS. Your line is open. Nathan Reilly : Pete, I'm just curious, how much spare capacity do you have in the existing manufacturing footprint to respond to demand growth, really just in terms of managing your shift flexibility? Peter Konieczny : That's a great question, Nathan. You've got to -- you got to distinguish between sort of manned capacity and sort of machine capacity that we have in place. That's the way how sort of we think about it. And on the manned capacity side, we're challenging ourselves in the business really hard to sort of balance that with the actual demand profile as you would expect, right? So, from a manned capacity side, that we were pretty much balanced and that's what we flex, right? When we say we flex, that's what we're flexing. Now if you -- and when you look at the volume development over the more recent past and you know that we've gone through a pretty tough patch here. Obviously, volumes overall have come down and therefore, the machine capacity offers up some headroom for additional volumes, which is encouraging for the future when the volumes come back. But where we do have a challenge as a business then is to flex up again and operationalize essentially the additional machine capacity that we require. Now, there is always -- and that's going to be my last comment on that question, there is always a challenge because the reality is you never have the capacity where you need it. And so, that's -- that never plays out in a perfect world and particularly where we're well-positioned with a compelling value proposition, we are full in terms of our capacity, very oftentimes also from a machine capacity standpoint, but that's something that we need to manage on a tactical day-to-day business. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that's all-the-time we have for the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to management for closing remarks. Peter Konieczny : Well, look, thanks everybody for the interest in the Company and for joining the call. I think the most important thing for me is to really just go back and to -- go back to the key messages for the call. We really had a strong quarter and we've had good questions, but overall, the Company is I think in a good spot with the momentum that we have developed in the fourth quarter to go into '25. We are pretty good about where we stand and where we sit and pretty good about the guidance that we have out there and we're looking at a good year to come. So, thanks very much for the interest in the call and talk to you soon. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Tracey Whitehead, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. Tracey Whitehead : Thanks, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining Amcor's fiscal 2025 first quarter earnings call. Joining today is Peter Konieczny, Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Casamento, Chief Financial Officer. Let me note a few items before I hand over. On our website, amcor.com, under the Investors section, you'll find today's press release and presentation, which will be discussed on this call. Please be aware that we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and related reconciliations can be found in that press release and presentation. Remarks will also include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions. The second slide in today's presentation lists several factors that could cause future results to be different than current estimates. Reference can be made to Amcor's SEC filings including our statements on Form 10-K and 10-Q for further details. Please note that during the question-and-answer session, we request that you limit yourself to a single question and then rejoin the queue if you have any additional questions or follow-ups. Over to you, PK. Peter Konieczny : Thank you, Tracey, and thank you to all who have joined us for today's call. I'm pleased to report that our business continues to build on the momentum we've delivered since the beginning of the calendar year with another quarter of solid financial performance to kick off fiscal 2025. Our results are aligned with the expectations we set out in August and give us the confidence to reaffirm our guidance today. We start, as always, with safety on Slide 3. The safety and well-being of our people is a value deeply embedded in Amcor's culture, and I'm incredibly proud of our collective commitment to safety. We continue to achieve industry-leading performance with another 13% reduction in injuries compared to the same quarter last year and 73% of our sites remaining injury-free for more than a year. Before we turn to the first quarter, I'd like to take a few minutes to talk about the strategic actions we are taking to evolve into an even stronger company. Amcor is an outstanding company with a strong values-based culture, highly talented people and significant growth potential. We have a strategy that remains relevant to our business and does not require a revolutionary change. I begin my tenure as CEO with a good understanding of where Amcor is today and with a strong and clear vision of where Amcor will be in the future. I just covered what will always be our number one priority, safety. Our commitment here will never change and the health and safety of our team members comes before anything else. The unrelenting focus we have to safety has been rewarded with industry-leading metrics and performance, as I just shared, which is an excellent example of what Amcor can achieve when we are focused and aligned on our priorities. Second only to safety is the customer, as seen on Slide 4. I believe we have an excellent opportunity to become an even stronger company by accelerating our volume-driven organic growth through an unwavering focus on our customers on sustainability and on our portfolio. With our customers, we have two clear immediate opportunities. The first touches on our culture, talent and organization. We will instill a stronger growth-oriented and customer-first mindset across Amcor. One of the first changes I made as CEO was appointing Fred Stephan, previously President, Flexibles North America to the newly created Chief Operating Officer role. One of Fred's most important responsibilities is to ensure we fully leverage our scale and capabilities across the global flexible packaging businesses. Setting the org up in this way means we removed regional silos, we ensure best practices shared and deployed across the organization. We facilitate access to our entire product catalog anywhere in the world, and we drive efficiency across our manufacturing operations and equipment network. By redirecting operational responsibilities and reporting lines, this new structure also serves to elevate and enhance the role of our global management team to focus on strategic, bigger picture choices including those designed to further accelerate organic growth and shareholder returns. The second opportunity we have to win with our customers and accelerate our growth lies in ensuring all our teams have the growth capabilities, tools and processes to operationalize growth and accelerate volumes while we maintain margin quality. I believe we can be better when it comes to service quality, speed to market as well as building comprehensive pipelines of growth opportunities, which are managed rigorously to drive topline growth. For the last several months, we have allocated additional time and resources to expand on our commercial excellence framework and to make sure we get the basics right 100% of the time. In addition, we are leveraging our global network of innovation centers to get even closer to our customers and develop the next generation of packaging solutions that meet their needs to preserve, protect and promote their products in a way that supports circularity for the industry, which brings me to sustainability. We have the opportunity to raise our sustainability profile and be an even stronger advocate in support of the best packaging solutions for consumers and customers to eliminate waste, lower carbon footprint and increase recycling rates while preserving functionality. Selling sustainable packaging solution benefits the planet while driving value for shareholders, and I'm confident we can increase the pace of our efforts to support packaging portfolio transition for our customers with good economic stewardship. In order to demonstrate our commitment to sustainability leadership, I elevated our own focus, appointing David Clark to the newly created role of Chief Sustainability Officer. Many of you will know Dave has been instrumental in advancing our sustainability agenda for many years, and we continue to make excellent progress, which is detailed in our 2024 sustainability report launched earlier this month. I've also tasked our teams to leverage the early wins we are having with AmFiber to drive more growth from our innovative fiber-based offerings. And finally, portfolio. We will drive accelerated growth by capitalizing on the opportunity to further orient our mix towards faster-growing higher-margin categories. We have been focusing on the priority categories of healthcare, meat, pet care and premium coffee, which we have also supplemented with value-accretive acquisitions. I believe we can further accelerate organic growth by adding two additional areas, dairy and liquid applications. Both have significant global growth opportunities. My confidence in the ability to generate higher levels of organic volume growth consistently and stronger returns for our shareholders is underpinned by Amcor's proven ability to focus, execute and deliver as we have demonstrated with safety. Turning to Slide 5. This focus will move us towards becoming the company Amcor will be known as in the future and my vision for Amcor. First, Amcor will be known as a sustainability champion. Amcor's purpose is grounded in safely and efficiently bringing essential food and medicine to people around the world through our innovative packaging solutions. We do this with a commitment to the planet, contributing to significantly limiting food waste, decarbonizing our products and developing packaging solutions that ultimately eliminate packaging waste in the environment. This is what inspires and motivates us, to continue driving differentiation and value for our customers, employees and shareholders. And it is this combination of unique capabilities and a clear purpose that sets Amcor up to be the sustainability partner of choice for our customers and drive the next generation of growth through circularity and decarbonization in a way no other company can. Second is market leadership. Our unmatched scale, global reach and the breadth of our sustainable packaging solutions and service offerings positions Amcor to win as a critical supply partner to global, regional, national and local customers. We will continue to build and expand on these strengths to help ensure Amcor becomes the go-to packaging solutions provider in our categories of choice for customers across the globe. Third, my vision is that Amcor will be well known for delivering consistent organic growth. As I've just covered, I see a clear opportunity to deliver higher levels of profitable volume-driven organic growth creating an even stronger company and unlocking value for our stakeholders. And fourth, as an investment, Amcor will be known globally towards highly compelling financial profile with consistent performance against our model of delivering 10% to 15% of annual value creation for shareholders. We expect to continue to generate significant free cash flow, maintain our investment-grade balance sheet and execute against our capital allocation strategy, which does not change. I'm excited with my vision for Amcor's future and with the priorities we have set geared toward accelerating growth. As reflected in our Q1 volume performance, we are already starting to see some initial green shoots as a result of our efforts to date. There are many more opportunities ahead, and we will continue to be agile and evolve into an even stronger company. Now turning to the quarter on Slide 6. I'm pleased we delivered another quarter of volume growth with a trajectory improving for the third consecutive quarter. This also contributed to earnings growth in line with our expectations. And as mentioned, the solid start to the year has given us confidence to reaffirm our full-year guidance to date. We are very optimistic on the demand trends we are seeing in the market, and we expect our volumes will continue to grow through the year. I'll now turn the call over to Michael to cover the results and outlook in more detail. Michael? Michael Casamento : Thank you, PK, and thanks to everyone joining us today. Starting with Slide 7 and a summary of our Q1 financial results. Our fiscal 2025 year is off to a very good start with broad-based improving customer demand across many end markets. Our teams continue to position Amcor to win with our customers, which resulted in our third consecutive quarter of sequential improvement in volumes. Overall volumes for the fiscal first quarter were up approximately 2% compared with 1% in Q4. As expected and called out in August, volumes remained weak in healthcare in North American beverage, which unfavorably impacted overall company volumes by approximately 2%. So across the balance of the business, overall volumes increased by 4% over the September quarter last year. Price/mix had an unfavorable impact on sales of approximately 3% primarily driven by continued destocking in higher-margin healthcare categories as expected and as noted on our August earnings call. First quarter adjusted earnings per share was in line with our expectations, coming in at $0.162 per share, which represents growth of 5% on a comparable constant currency basis. Adjusted EBIT grew by 3% compared with last year, and our teams continue to proactively manage costs well, helping drive operating leverage across the business. This resulted in another quarter of margin improvement with adjusted EBIT margin increasing by 50 basis points to 10.9%. Moving to our Flexible segment on Slide 8. Q1 volumes were up 3% compared with last year and improved modestly on a sequential basis, reflecting broad-based growth across most geographies and end markets. Net sales decreased by 1% on a comparable constant currency basis as widespread volume growth across the Flexibles business was offset by unfavorable price/mix of approximately 4%, again, primarily related to lower healthcare sales. As anticipated and discussed on last quarter's call, destocking in healthcare continued in North America and Europe in pharmaceuticals, and this resulted in a headwind of approximately 2% to overall segment volumes. We expect this destocking to abate by the end of calendar 2024. Across the balance of our Flexibles portfolio, volumes were up approximately 5%, reflecting solid customer demand across all regions and in many product categories. In North America and Europe, first quarter demand continued to improve for the second consecutive quarter. Volumes were up low to mid-single digits in both regions despite the negative impact of healthcare destocking. In emerging markets, our Asia Pacific and Latin American businesses also continued to deliver good volume growth at low to mid single-digit rates, supported by solid demand in China, India, Brazil and Peru. From a product category standpoint, meat, dairy, liquids and ready meals all delivered mid single-digit growth and single-serve coffee was up. In healthcare, medical return to modest growth. However, pharma volumes were down low-double digits compared with last year. Adjusted EBIT for the quarter of $329 million grew by 3% over last year on a comparable constant currency basis. Higher volumes, combined with strong cost performance led to another quarter of margin expansion, with adjusted EBIT margins up 40 basis points to 12.9%. Turning to Rigid Packaging on Slide 9. The Rigid business continues to advance its performance and the trajectory of overall segment volumes improved for the third consecutive quarter. The business delivered another quarter of earnings growth despite a 4% decline in overall volumes compared with last year. As expected, this was primarily driven by continued soft consumer and customer demand in the North American beverage business. Net sales were down 4% on a comparable constant currency basis, with price/mix relatively flat. In North America, beverage volumes were down high-single digits, consistent with our volume performance in the previous quarter despite a modest negative impact from the temporary closure of a couple of plants in the Southern Eastern United States toward the end of the quarter to help ensure our people remain safe from the impacts of Hurricane Helene. As anticipated entering the quarter, consumer demand remained muted in Amcor's key end markets and customer mix remained unfavorable. Latin American volumes were lower than last year, reflecting weaker customer demand in Argentina and Colombia, which was partly offset by growth in Mexico and the Caribbean. The Specialty Containers business delivered good growth in the dairy and nutrition categories with volumes down in healthcare due to destocking. From an earnings perspective, the business delivered another quarter of growth and margin expansion through an ongoing focus on cost reduction and productivity measures. Adjusted EBIT of $62 million in Q1 was up 2% on a comparable constant currency basis, with EBIT margin increasing by 60 basis points to 7.7%. And as announced earlier today, we reached an agreement to sell our 50% interest in the Bericap North America closures business to our joint venture partner for $122 million, which we will use to reduce debt. Although we've had a long and respectful relationship with Bericap over the past 27 years, at this juncture, we have chosen to unwind the joint venture due to differing views on near-term capital requirements and resulting returns. While Amcor continues to operate in the closure space, and it remains a category of interest, we are committed to maintaining our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Moving to cash on the balance sheet on Slide 10. Consistent with historical quarterly phasing, Q1 was a quarter of cash usage. Compared with last year, CapEx increased to support a number of important projects that will continue to drive our sustainability, innovation and growth agendas. Additionally, we increased raw material inventories to ensure we are ready to service improving volume trends. Leverage was a little higher than we were anticipating, given the impact of higher inventories and secondly, due to stronger euro spot rates toward the end of the quarter, which negatively impacted debt and subsequent leverage by 0.1x, which has since unwound. We expect leverage to reduce through the fiscal year and anticipate an improvement in the second quarter with an end point below prior year December, and we remain confident in meeting our expectation to exit fiscal 2025 with leverage at 3x or lower. During the quarter, we returned approximately $180 million in cash to shareholders through our quarterly dividend, and our Board has also increased the quarterly dividend per share by 2% to $0.1275. That brings me to the outlook on Slide 11. As PK mentioned, based on our good start to fiscal 2025, we are reaffirming our guidance for the fiscal year. For fiscal 2025, we continue to expect adjusted earnings to be in the range of $0.72 to $0.76 per share on a reported basis, representing comparable constant currency growth of 3% to 8%. Our performance through the first quarter further supports our expectations for strong growth in the underlying business for the year as we continue to build on our volume and earnings momentum. As we pointed out on our August call, it's important to remember that this guidance includes an EPS headwind of approximately 4% related to more normalized levels of incentive compensation based on our expectations for improved annual financial results. Excluding this incentive normalization, we expect growth from the underlying business in the high single to low double-digit range. We continue to assume overall volumes will increase in the low to mid single-digit range for the year with trading performance through October aligned with these expectations. Interest expense guidance remains between $290 million and $305 million, with an effective tax rate in the range of 19% to 20%. Looking at our fiscal second quarter, we expect adjusted EPS to be relatively in line with our first quarter performance. This means fiscal 2025 earnings phasing as outlined on our August earnings call, will be broadly aligned with the historical average of approximately 45% of earnings being delivered in the first half of the year and 55% in the second half, with the fourth quarter typically the strongest of the year. And finally, we are affirming our expectations to generate strong adjusted free cash flow in the range of $900 million to $1 billion for the year, supporting our confidence in exiting the year with the leverage back at 3x or lower, as I noted earlier. We are happy with our start to fiscal 2025 and look forward to the opportunities we have to accelerate our future growth. And with that, I'll hand back to PK. Peter Konieczny : Thank you, Michael. Turning to Slide 12 for a few closing remarks prior to opening the call to questions. I'm pleased with the overall performance trajectory of the business, and I'm excited about the significant opportunities we have ahead of us to enhance our profitable growth profile. As I noted earlier, we have already taken a number of concrete actions designed to accelerate volume growth, each of which further strengthens our ability to generate attractive, sustainable shareholder returns. Customer demand is improving broadly, and Q1 was another quarter of volume growth with earnings in line with our expectations. We continue to build financial momentum and evolve our strategic focus to unlock value, supporting the reaffirmation of our financial guidance for fiscal 2025. Operator, we are ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Your line is open. Ghansham Panjabi : Thank you, operator. PK, first off, congrats on your new role, best wishes in the future. Peter Konieczny : Thank you. Ghansham Panjabi : Yes. So I guess in your vision slide specific to the organic growth component. I know it's early in your tenure, you've been in the company for a while, though. Can you share specifics on how exactly you intend to do that in the low growth end markets that both your segments sort of exposed towards? And do you anticipate any portfolio repositioning that's needed to accomplish that, including any divestitures? Thanks. Peter Konieczny : That's a great question, Ghansham. And you're right, I believe that driving a better organic volume growth profile is probably the biggest opportunity the company has. And I'll give you a couple of soundbites where I think we need to work to facilitate that. The first one is really basic, if you want because you want to get the basics right, service quality, you want to be easy to do business with for the customers, which is one thing that we just need to continue to have an eye on. And I said in my prepared remarks, we can probably do better on that side or do even better. The second one is related to capabilities where \u2013 remember, we are essentially looking at Amcor at a commercial excellence program, which we brand value plus, which however, given our past has really been focused on driving mix and margins. And that was an excellent tool for a challenge that we had many years ago, and you know that, that was highly successful in delivering returns for us. I think we have an opportunity to expand, but not reinvent the program to expand the program to also include elements of organic volume growth and initiatives that go in that direction. And we have already started doing that. The other capability side that I would see is just leveraging better and more our incredible innovation capabilities. And very simply said, to a certain extent that comes down to just leveraging our product portfolio across the global markets, particularly in Flexibles. We have incredible success with certain products that we bring to certain categories in the marketplace. And we see opportunities to use those products also in other regions, other markets across the world. And that leverage opportunity, I think we want to go after more consistently in the organization that we've set that really helps us. And then you know that we have an innovation center network that we leverage more going forward because we've invested in it, and we have excellent customer contact already in those innovation centers. Then very quickly to just round it off, we have focus categories, our segment, our focus on those categories in terms of need going forward, probably we'll talk more about protein because we had dairy, healthcare, well, that's a bit of a holdback at this point in time, but we're seeing through that. This is a great category that will get back to growth and a couple of others that I can speak more to, if you want to know more and then we have the opportunity on the fiber side. So as I'm going through those points, you can see that we're pretty bolted around the initiatives. At the same time, they're broad, and we're setting them up to facilitate the organic growth side of things. So that was a long-winded answer to your first question. The second one was, do we see any opportunities to prune the portfolio, whatever. Look, I think that's always going to be on the agenda, but I'll tell you right now, I feel pretty good about the portfolio that we're working with across Flexibles and Rigid Packaging. So I don't see any immediate need to make any changes there. Operator : The next question comes from the line of John Purtell with Macquarie. Your line is open. John Purtell : Good day, PK and Michael. Hope you are well and congrats, PK on the role. Just on Q1 volume growth, just confirming that sort of broadly where you thought it would be. So obviously, your Flexibles volumes are up 3%, which is the same as what we saw in Q4, but not an acceleration. Peter Konieczny : Yes, John. Look, first off, we're pretty encouraged about the volume performance in the first quarter. And if I just take you through that, overall company volume performance, plus 2%, which is 100 basis points up versus the quarter before. I'd say that, that is broadly in line with what we were expecting. If we put healthcare in North American beverage to the side, which is about 25% of our sales in the first quarter, the balance of the portfolio is up 4%. And you specifically referenced Flexibles. Flexibles is up, yes, 3%. That includes healthcare, which is still a bit of a holdback, but the rest of the portfolio is up 5%. So we feel pretty good about that. We feel pretty good because we also understand the healthcare dynamics. And healthcare, as you know, breaks out in two subcategories, one is medical. The other one is pharma. On medical, as we have said in prior calls, we are no longer seeing destocking. As a matter of fact, medical is back in growth territory in the first quarter, 2025, pretty much as expected in the destocking, you can say has come to an end. What's holding us back now is really \"just pharma\". We have a pretty strong pharma exposure, but pharma has started its destocking a little later than medical about a quarter. So we're still seeing destocking from pharma. And we believe that, that will sort of roll also partly into the second quarter. But as we leave the second quarter, I think we're going to see that destocking is abating and setting us up for a much better back half of the year. So with that said, I'd say we're feeling pretty good about the volume story in the first quarter. And if I look forward into the second quarter, we're definitely expecting another sequential volume improvement in Q2, too. So I'm in a spot where I say I'm very happy with how the volumes are currently coming back. Operator : The next question is George Staphos with Bank of America. Your line is open. George Staphos : Hey, thanks for taking my question. PK, good morning and congratulations. A lot of content here. I'll try to keep it at one question. Can you update us on some of how some of your newer products in the last few years, AmLite, AmPrima, AmFiber are doing? You had \u2013 you called that AmFiber, in particular. I believe there was a comment in the slide deck on AmPrima as well. If you index those or somehow quantify it, what's been the growth in those products? How important are they broadly to the portfolio overall. And relatedly, as you look out at the packaging waste reduction, [indiscernible] that they're off a few years, but nonetheless your customers are going to deal with them and you will as well. Are there any things that are looking a little bit more challenging for Amcor's portfolio to manage against maybe the recycled scale requirements? How would you have us think about that? Thank you. Peter Konieczny : Yes. Thanks, George. Great question again. I'll try to keep it short, too because there's a lot of content here. Let me go backwards. First of all, we're acutely aware, obviously, of regulatory trends, and that would include the packaging waste regulation in Europe. And the general headline around that from our side is we're supportive. We're supportive of such regulation to the extent that it drives the circularity that we need in order to keep plastic waste out of the environment. So the regulation is good, and we are supportive of that. It is exactly in that context that we're developing product platforms like AmFiber, like AmPrima, and others that are essentially developed in order to comply with such regulation. And what they all have in common is that these products are more sustainable and they're recyclable. And you asked me to talk a little bit more about fiber also. Look, fiber in the context of what I just said, fits perfectly in because it is another sustainable packaging substrate which has one advantage at this point in time, it is recyclable at scale today. And whereas for plastic, we're building within the concept of circularity that recyclability, but it requires more investment into infrastructure and so on and so forth. And fiber that is already there. And therefore, the substrate fiber appeals to customers and consumers at this point in time. Now I will tell you that we need to keep in mind that fiber is a natural substrate and it's porous, it's full of holes, which is against the requirements that we have when we think about primary packaging, which is, to a large extent, about creating barrier properties in order to protect the food stuff that's inside. And therefore, fiber will always have a very limited range of applications across the board of what we're serving today. But where it fits it is a responsible packaging substrate. And as a company that is a responsible packaging company, we proactively explore the opportunities on that end. And therefore, we have developed the platform of AmFiber, a product that we have is the performance paper product, which actually differentiates us really well because we've been able to introduce barrier properties which makes that solution really attractive to certain applications. And the same essentially is true for AmPrima. It's a plastic-based product, but it's a recyclable plastic-based product, which therefore, is finding good pickup into the marketplace. But I will tell you, and that's my last comment in terms of dimensionalizing and it would have to probably come back to you. But I'd say we're working \u2013 we're pretty \u2013 AmPrima is a pretty sizable base at this point in time, and it continues to grow. The fiber substrate is growing, but off a smaller base. And we see more growth opportunities going forward in line with, first of all, our growth aspirations, but secondly, also with the responsibility that we feel for more sustainable structures. Operator : Next is James Wilson with Jarden Australia. Your line is open. James Wilson : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the Bericap unwind of the joint venture, are you able to talk us through : a, what the strategic rationale behind unwinding that joint venture was and also the implications that, that will then have for Rigid\u2019s earnings going forward as well, please? Peter Konieczny : Yes, James, happy to do so, and I'll take the first part of your question, and then I hand it off to M.C. here, to Michael to talk about the earnings implications. Look, the first thing that I will say is we continue to be attracted to the closure space and we actually continue to operate in closures. We have a metal-based closures range that is very much focused on wine and spirits. We also have closures in the specialty containers business on the Rigid side. If you add all that business together, you will end up with a topline between 200 million, 300 million. And I think that's a pretty sizable exposure still. So strategically, no change in positioning to the closure space. Now why then sell off topline in a period where you want to grow and with the business you're strategically interested in. When something like this happens in a joint venture environment, it's typically because you have differences with your joint venture partner about the development of the business going forward. And that's exactly what happened here. We weren't comfortable with the views of our partner to \u2013 with regards to the amount of capital that the partner perceived to be necessary to develop the business going forward and the time it took to get to returns that were attractive to us. We sat together with the partner and then internally, and we thought about what to do. The fact is that our businesses are competing for capital. And we have a capital allocation model in the company where we felt we have other opportunities across the business where we can put the capital to work at better returns in a shorter period of time. And that was essentially the reason and the strategic background to the divestment and it really just demonstrates that we're very disciplined around our capital allocation model. Michael Casamento : Yes. Thanks, PK. And James, just to dimensionalize it for you. I mean, on an annual basis, we consolidate the revenue and earnings of the joint venture sales-wise, about $190 million on an annual basis. So remembering this \u2013 this divestment will close at the end of December. So it's really a half year impact for FY2025. And from an EBIT standpoint, about $19 million, which both sit in the Rigid Packaging segment. From a net income perspective at an Amcor level, the group level, after taking out the minority interest, it's about an $8 million net income on an annualized basis. So again, you've got to take half of that for FY2025 and obviously, with the proceeds going to reduce net debt, we are going to see some interest benefit from that. So when you put the two of those together actually for 2025 and ongoing the impact of the net income line is very minor. Peter Konieczny : I just want to round off that comment because I don't know who's dialed in here, maybe even our joint venture partners, dialed in. And I just want to say a very, very respectful relationship over many years and very amicable sort of wind up of the joint venture. And I know that the business will do well going forward, and it's good that the business again has clear direction. Operator : Next is Mike Roxland with Truist Securities. Your line is open. Michael Roxland : Thank you, PK. and Michael and Tracey for taking my questions. And I'll just echo what everybody say PK, congrats on the role. Peter Konieczny : Thanks, Mike. Michael Roxland : My question is regarding your algorithm in terms of annual margin improvement. Historically, Amcor targeted 20 to 30 basis points of this improvement, but over the last few years, and I think even destocking, you developed a leaner cost structure. So given this cost structure is leaner, and even some of those costs such as labor slowly come back, would it be fair to say that the algorithm at least in the near term has shifted higher. So maybe the 20 to 30 basis points of margin improvement could be 30 to 40 for the next year or two as you solely add back cost to the business? Michael Casamento : I'll start on that one, Mike. I think your observations are correct in the near term. I mean, obviously, the last couple of years, there's been a bit of a disconnect, particularly when you think about raw materials going through the topline, inflation going through the topline, then the impact of lower volumes, the cost-out agenda. So if you go back over time for Amcor over a long period of time, that 20 to 30 basis point algorithm works for us. It's been pretty consistent, but it can vary and fluctuate over the cycle. As we look forward, we still feel pretty confident around that algorithm. We\u2019re consistently driving efficiency through the business, managing our cost base really tightly, and we can flex the cost base on volume demand. And it's not linear necessarily. So if cost comes down, volumes come off, we can pull the cost down. It doesn't necessarily go back up at the same rate. I think as we look over a long period of time, the mix management, the portfolio really drive that consistency through. And PK touched on some of the new product innovation, the sustainable structures, they all have different margin profiles as we look forward. So from where I sit, I think it's still a good algorithm from where we are. And we kind of stand by that as we look forward. But it will vary from time to time depending on the cycle we're in. Operator : Next is Daniel Kang with CLSA. Your line is open. Daniel Kang : Good morning, everyone and congrats again to PK. Just a question on the addition of dairy and liquids into the focus categories. Can you just talk us through the opportunity here where you see Amcor currently sits in these categories and your realistic sort of medium-term targets? Peter Konieczny : Yes, Daniel. Happy to do that. Look, the most important thing is that in dairy and also in liquids, we have a very strong position in North America. And that's on the back of differentiated product solutions that go into these two segments. Now dairy is what dairy says, right? It's hard cheese, it\u2019s soft cheese, could go up to yogurt. So it's a whole dairy space. Liquids is one that may be a little less obvious, and we always struggle internally how to define that best. It's essentially packaging solutions for what we call pumpable food. So you would have sauces in there, like ketchup, mayo, all kinds of different other sauces, you would have pureed food like apple sauce and you would also have some beverage applications in their in pouches, for example. Now that just explains the category in both of these categories, we have a very strong position in North America. And we have just come out the quarter where we have seen solid mid-single-digit growth in those categories. And we believe that one of the big opportunities that we have before we get like super complex and sophisticated around developing new products and so on and so forth, it's just simply leveraging the products that we bring to market successfully in North America across the global reach that we have in Flexibles. And that's, first and foremost, what we want to do. So it's a product leverage challenge. Of course, there's also going to be additional innovation that we bring to these categories. But in the short-term, I think it's product leverage. And that's something that we can do better going forward. We have \u2013 just in order to calibrate also, we have annual revenues in those categories somewhere between $800 million and $1 billion in each one. So it's big. We have \u2013 we are well positioned. We have good products. And we have markets that will have an opportunity to adopt those products, and we have an opportunity to create some revenues on that basis. We're excited about that, and this is where we're coming from. Operator : Next is Sam Seow with Citi. Your line is open. Samuel Seow : Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one on net debt. You're obviously growing volumes and earnings, but when I look at your net debt, 3.5x, it's actually higher than 3.3x last year at this time. So just wondering, at a high level, if you can unpack that cash drag in particularly the working capital and how we should think about that cash conversion as volumes and inventories kind of may reverse? Thanks. Michael Casamento : Yes. Thanks, Sam. It's a good question. Look, I agree. Firstly, with leverage at 3x, we would say that's the peak. And it's a little higher than we were expecting in Q1 \u2013 what we would expect to see. And truly, it's for a couple of reasons. Firstly, as I mentioned in my remarks, we saw some spike in spot FX rates for euro that were higher than we were expecting at the end of the September quarter, which have since come back. And that had an impact of just the calculation 0.1 on leverage for the quarter. And as I said, that's unwound since then. Secondly, we did build additional inventory, particularly of raw materials in the quarter. And this was really on the back of a couple of things. Firstly, we are seeing strong demand signals, and PK touched on a little particularly in Q2. We've seen, over the last three quarters, sequential improvement in volume. And that demand signal continues into Q2. And we really don't want to miss any opportunity to service our customers on that basis. So the teams have been out there and increasing inventory, probably a little more conservative. But also the other thing that we have seen is a little bit of supply chain disruption and some tremors in the market, particularly around port strikes, a little bit of impact coming out of the Middle East as well. So it was pretty reasonable for the teams to take a little bit of a conservative view on there, just to make sure we've got the right inventory in place, the raw materials there to be able to convert as we work our way through the stronger demand. So if you put those two things aside, leverage would have been at 3.3x, pretty well aligned with prior year, and about right where we would have expected it to be for this time of year. But that said, it's higher than we like. And as we look forward, we've got a clear plan to work it down. We reaffirmed the full-year cash flow guidance today, that $900 million to $1 billion. And we have confidence in that, particularly as we work our way through the inventories and we see the higher volumes come through. Obviously, we're also paying down debt with the Bericap proceeds. So the disposal proceeds, which come in, in December. So we are going to see leverage come down through the year, and it's actually going to start in Q2. And we expect leverage will be lower than it was prior year in Q2. We'll see the improvement there. And then as we have really strong confidence in the balance of the year to come back to 3x or below as we exit the year in June 2025. Operator : Next is Brook Campbell-Crawford with Barrenjoey. Your line is open. Brook Campbell-Crawford: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just with respect to this focus on stronger organic growth. Previously, the business has always talked about low single-digit topline growth organically. What's the new target for this, if you can provide a bit of a range of what you're thinking about? And I guess, I'm more focused beyond the near term, given, I guess, volumes in Flexibles are still 6% below pre-COVID levels. So once you kind of catch up on that period of underperformance, what do you think the steady-state sort of medium-term topline should be? Thanks. Peter Konieczny : Yes. Thanks, Brook. There's a lot of questions there. I got to be a little conservative here, and I'm going to shy away from giving you a number and a target going forward. What I will tell you is that I think we can do definitely better than the expectations that we spelled out before COVID. As we walked into COVID, everything else that we've seen since then, I think, has been pretty volatile. And you could call out market dislocation for many different reasons. But we're working ourselves out of it as we have seen with the volume performance over the last three quarters and also \u2013 and as Michael just confirmed again, the demand signal into Q2 of this fiscal year. So I would probably leave that there and just simply say we can do better. We can do better consistently as we go forward, and that's the target. So stay close, and we'll demonstrate to you what we can do with the business. On your second part, when you compare our current volume levels to what it was pre-COVID, you're right that we haven't fully caught up in terms of volumes today versus what it was pre-COVID. On the other hand, I'll tell you, it's not so simple to just better spread that across the different categories that we serve. It's much more of a complex picture. In some cases, we're actually full and sold out. In some cases, we do have some capacity for \u2013 to absorb additional growth, and we're acutely aware of that. We are obviously more interested in selling open capacity now than selling capacity that requires more investment. But where it does and where we have good opportunities, we're also not held back or constrained in any way to make investments into the business. So that's the way how we're looking at it. But altogether, we're feeling good about the initiatives that we started to drive growth to higher levels going forward. And that is consistently \u2013 that would really be the target that I set out for the organization. Operator : Next is Cameron McDonald with E&P. Your line is open. Cameron McDonald : Good morning. Just some questions on the financials, if I can, please. So the \u2013 if I look at the adjusted EBITDA number in the back of the slides, can you just \u2013 Michael, can you just explain what the $13 million impact is across the restructuring and in other? The note sort of refers to Russia, but I'd be surprised if Russia was impacting the first quarter of this year from a restructuring cost perspective? Michael Casamento : Yes. So Cameron, look, that's just the program that we put in place to take some cost out of the business and restructure in certain parts as a result of disposing the Russian business to try and offset part of the disposed earnings. So we announced the program 18 months ago or so, and we've been working our way through that. We've announced seven plant closures, four plant restructures. In total, we were looking to spend, cash-wise, about $170 million. We're most of the way through that program now, and we're still seeing just a little bit of cost come through. But that's \u2013 you're also seeing the benefits of that program come through. We said that we would deliver about a $50 million annualized benefit in FY2024. We got $35 million of that. We've got a further $5 million or so in Q1 2025. So we're well on track to deliver those benefits for that program, and it's pretty much done by the end of calendar 2024. Operator : Your next question is from Nathan Reilly of UBS. Your line is open. Nathan Reilly : Thanks for taking my call or question I should say. Just in relation to the underlying group volume growth of 4%, excluding health care and beverage, relative to some of the European and U.S., Canada and some of the key end markets which have been quite patchy, that volume growth looks quite solid. So I'm just wondering if you can give us a little bit of an update just in terms of how you're seeing the state of the consumer across your key end markets in both the U.S. and Europe, please? Peter Konieczny : Yes, Nathan. First of all, I agree. I also believe that the number is actually pretty solid. And here's how we're thinking about this. If you sort of pull it apart into the different components, if you look at the consumer, I think the consumer is at best flat, if not a little down. And that's very consistent with what we've said in prior calls. And we're not expecting a lot of help from the consumer going forward either. So we're not going to bank on the consumer spending behavior sort of becoming more positive going forward. The thing that we're seeing is that the customers are performing better. We talked about that in the prior calls also in the context of two things really. One is the customers \u2013 many customers are trying to find a better balance between price and volumes. That also translates into promotional activities, and we're benefiting from that. What we also sort of group in the customer performance piece is just simply the fact that destocking is over. And that's \u2013 I can say that now, a little \u2013 with a little more conviction, destocking is over, except for the one category that we have decided to break out for this conversation because you introduced it like that. Let's put health care and North American beverage aside for a moment. And then the final point that we look at is how are we faring in the market that we're seeing? And that comes down to our ability to gain share. Now after the fourth quarter, I would have said something along the lines of it's not material, but we see some green shoots. Now as I'm sitting here after the first quarter, I would say, it's a little bit. So the momentum is increasing, and I'm still trying to be very bolted around all that and not to get ahead of myself. Let's get another quarter under our belt and see if and how the volumes develop and what the drivers are once we're getting out of Q2, but we feel pretty good about it. And if I \u2013 your question also was break it out between North America and Europe. I'd say, it's pretty much the same between the two and the way how we look at that. So that's pretty much the best answer that I can give you. Operator : Our last question comes from George at Bank of America. Your line is open. George Staphos : Thanks so much. PK, thanks for taking my follow-on. It's a two-part, where the first has nothing to do with the second part. So the first question is your volume growth actually has been relatively in line or actually a bit better than what we've seen out of other consumer packaging markets the last few quarters, and yet you are working on your innovation and really trying to drive greater speed to market. All companies try to improve, we get that. Was there a trigger for you in terms of what sort of drove that? We need to do an even better job of getting innovation to the goal line. Were there some lost sales? Or were there some opportunities? What drove that realization? And then the second question I had for you really is when \u2013 can you remind us when do you expect Rigid to inflect higher from a profit standpoint and when from a volume standpoint? Thank you. Peter Konieczny : Yes, George, that's really two questions. And as you said, they're not related. Yes, exactly. So \u2013 but, okay, let go backwards. So first of all, on the ARP, so Rigid Packaging. Look, we've been speaking a lot about the volumes. But what I haven't said yet is \u2013 and what you will see when you go through the numbers, is that the business has returned to earnings growth over the last couple of quarters. Actually, since the beginning of this calendar year, they've come back with earnings growth, which means that, despite the environment that they're operating in, they are being able to adjust their cost structures and their capacities to a level where they are turning out better profitability, which is something that we appreciate. The team is doing a great job. At the same time, we're all sitting here and waiting for the market to give us a bit more tailwind. And when that comes on the back of the efficiency that we've now created in the business, we'll see better improvement and better numbers, definitely better numbers, and we're looking for those. So we can't wait for that to happen on the profit side and also on the topline side. Now you're asking me, when is that going to happen? That really depends on the consumer. The consumer is still sort of held back on the categories that we serve. It is a very discretionary category mix that we're serving with the isotonics, with the ready-to-drink teas, or the juices. There's different ways of hydration. And while inflation may have come down, the consumer is just shocked by the prices on the shelf. And that's sort of the way how we explain currently the consumer behavior. So that needs to turn around. That will get us better volumes. And then we'll see definitely better topline and bottom line on the Rigid side. So that sort of is my answer to that part of the question. The other \u2013 the first part was, I think, geared towards innovation. And you're asking how to understand the questions. We need to gear up on innovation. Let me just, first of all, maybe correct the perception. I never wanted to say that we are behind in our capabilities on innovation. We're not. I think we are one of the leading companies in our space with our innovation capabilities. And I'm not just saying that because I feel that, I'm saying that on the back of the feedback that we get from our customers. And they're very impressed with what we can do. And I'd take the opportunity on this call for those of my team that are actually listening in, in the innovation space. You guys are doing a great job. Congratulations. But of course, we want more. And we have made investments in the innovation centers across the world. And we have invested in one in China. The latest one has just opened the doors a couple of months ago in Ghent in Belgium, in Europe, and we have a couple of satellites. And we just want to see the returns. I want to see the returns on that investment, and we're seeing that. Customers are coming in. We have a great process that we call Catalyst, where we sit down with the customers and we do innovation. And we shocked and amazed them with the things that we can do. So that's one. And the other one is really just around the leverage piece. It is part of the innovation. I'm not asking to do some rocket science here, which I think our people can do. What I'm saying right now is take the products that are successful to one market, and help introduce them in other markets where we have demand for the same products. It's as simple as that. And that's product leverage, and we have great opportunities to do that. So those were the two comments that I was trying to make on the innovation side, and I hope that's a little more clear. Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will turn the call back to PK for closing remarks. Peter Konieczny : Yes. Look, thanks for the interest in the company and for dialing in. Great questions. I mean, you're essentially asking the questions that we're asking ourselves here. I just want to say one more time, we feel pretty good about where we're at, particularly with the volumes coming back. That's really important for us. And as we see that trickle through, we'll definitely see that also translate to the bottom line. And we're looking at a solid year. So at this point in time, we are fully reaffirming our guidance for the full-year, and we feel we're in a good spot. Thank you very much. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",
