Welcome to the Molina Healthcare First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, Thursday, May 1, 2014. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Juan Jos\u00e9 Orellana, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Juan Jose Orellana : Thank you, George. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The purpose of this call is to discuss Molina Healthcare's financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2014. The company's earnings release reporting its results was issued today after the market closed and is now posted for viewing on our company website. On the call with me today are Dr. Mario Molina, our CEO; John Molina, our CFO; Terry Bayer, our COO; and Joseph White, our Chief Accounting Officer. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will call open the call to your questions. [Operator Instructions] Our comments today will contain forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. All of our forward-looking statements are based on current our expectations and assumptions, which are subject to numerous risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. A description of such risk factors can be found in our earnings release and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-K annual report, our Form 10-Q quarterly reports and our Form 8-K current reports. These reports can be accessed under the Investor Relations tab of our company website or on the SEC's website. All forward-looking statements made during today's call represent our judgment as of May 1, 2014, and we disclaim any obligation to update such statements except as required by securities laws. This call is being recorded, and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available at our company's website, molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Mario Molina. Joseph Mario Molina : Thank you, Juan Jos\u00e9. Hello, everyone. And as always, thank you for your interest in Molina Healthcare. As you review our financial results for the quarter, you'll see that our performance reflects actions that we talked about at our Investor Day in February. We are experiencing considerable revenue and enrollment growth. We are transforming from an acute care company to a chronic care company. We are diversifying by winning new contracts and entering new states. We are aligning our resources and skills to gain greater administrative leverage, and we continue to build on our framework for dramatic expansion in 2014 and beyond. For the quarter, we delivered adjusted net income per diluted share from continuing operations of $0.64. Our operating results were strong, despite the headwinds we communicated at our Investor Day. Of considerable interest in the investors during the first quarter was the timing difference between expense and revenue recognition associated with the reimbursement of the health insurance fees. As expected, the company had not secured agreements with all of our states prior to the quarter end. And as a result, only recognized reimbursement and tax effect in Florida, Illinois, Ohio, Washington and Wisconsin. Nevertheless, we remain optimistic that agreements with our remaining states will be resolved prior to the close of 2014. While much has happened during the first quarter in both our industry and our business, not much has actually changed from what we reported at the Investor Day. So let me focus on some of the things that have changed. Earlier this month, CMS reported that between October and February, nearly 12 million people have been determined eligible for Medicaid and CHIP, but that only 3 million people have actually enrolled in these programs during the same period. The increase in Medicaid enrollment across the country is encouraging, but the gap between those deemed eligible and those that are enrolled continues to point to the systemwide hurdles and resource constraints related to processing applications for millions of individuals. However, it's important to note that although the March 31 deadline for marketplace has passed, under the Medicaid program, people can apply for coverage at any time. This will enable us to continue to grow as the year goes by and as enrollment barriers are overcome. The surge in Medicaid applications during the open-enrollment period still contributed to a considerable enrollment gain to Molina during the first quarter. Specifically, our health plans and states participating in Medicaid Expansion added 133,000 new Medicaid expansion lives, accounting for 60% of our sequential enrollment growth. As a reminder, Medicaid expansion lives are reimbursed at higher per-member per-month premiums. To put these premiums in perspective, our new expansion lives are expected to generate approximately $1 billion in annualized revenue. This is almost the same amount of premium generated by our Ohio health plan in 2013. Enrollment due to the so-called woodwork effect at our health plans has not yet had a material impact on our results, but we anticipate that we could see higher enrollment related to it in the upcoming months. Also contributing to enrollment growth during the quarter was our expansion and diversification efforts in South Carolina. Effective January 1, 2014, we began serving members in all 46 counties under the state's new full risk Medicaid managed care program. At the end of the first quarter, we had membership of approximately 126,000 members, distinguishing Molina as the second-largest Medicaid health plan in South Carolina. Our expansion into South Carolina demonstrates that there are still start up and acquisition opportunities in states where we do not currently operate. For many years, we've been building for the opportunities associated with the dual eligibles that are now within sight. While, technically, a second quarter event, we are pleased to report that we've already enrolled nearly 9,000 fully integrated dual eligible members across California, Illinois and Ohio. Fully integrated duals are individuals for whom we receive premiums from both Medicaid and Medicare. California has generated nearly 60% of our initial dual eligibles enrollment. Voluntary enrollment for the demonstration program in California called CAL-Medi-Connect, started April 1 in 3 out of the 4 counties, where we were selected to participate : Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego. Voluntary enrollment in Los Angeles County is slated to begin in June 1. Our corporate and field teams are working diligently to complete health risk assessment calls, and call volumes are being handled, and we are meeting all compliant standards. The passive enrollment process for Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego begins today, May 1, and on July 1 for Riverside -- I'm sorry, for Los Angeles County. Dual eligibles are elderly or disabled and have chronic illness, or even multiple chronic illnesses, including mental illness and are, more likely, because of their low income, to remain continuously eligible for government programs. The demographic and health care characteristics of the dual eligible members requires additional outreach and individual care plans, making Molina exceptionally well suited to address the needs of this population. Our focus has always been to take care of those most in need of health care and least able to afford it. We're excited that California remains on track in terms of the implementation of its duals demonstration program. However, a delay has emerged in Michigan, where you may recall, we were chosen to participate in the dual eligible demonstration in 2 counties, Wayne and Macomb, which have a combined dual eligible population of approximately 75,000 individuals. Last month, Michigan finalized its memorandum of understanding with CMS, which included a delay in implementation timeline. The demonstration will now begin no earlier than January 1, 2015, and will continue through December 31, 2017. In the 2 counties in which we operate, Wayne and Macomb, the opt-in enrollment period will begin no earlier than March 1, 2015, with enrollments effective May 1, 2015. In Texas, we received notice from the Texas Health and Human Services Commission that the duals implementation has been delayed to March 1, 2015. In South Carolina, the duals eligible demonstration was originally slated for implementation in July 2014 and has now been delayed by the state to January 1, 2015. Finally, there have been various headlines in the news regarding the new Hepatitis C treatment drug, Sovaldi, and how states will pay for this extremely expensive therapy. For Molina, coverage of the cost of this new hepatitis treatment is included in our first quarter results. However, we anticipate an increase of cases, where the new Hepatitis C treatments are requested, as new all-oral therapies, in addition to Sovaldi are being approved by the FDA later this year, so we're keeping a close eye on this situation. We're still awaiting guidance for many of our states on how Sovaldi is going to be handled and how they are going to pay for it. We continue to believe that the cost of Sovaldi are not included in the rates we received and remain in discussion with states on how we will be reimbursed for these costs. In the meantime, in the relevant states, we are rigorously applying our clinical guidelines to request for treatment and, so far, the number of applicable cases has been low. However, we remain extremely concerned about the high cost of Sovaldi and other new Hepatitis C treatments and how they will affect state Medicaid budgets. Now I'd like to turn the call over to John. John C. Molina: Thank you, Mario, and hello, everyone. As Mario highlighted earlier, we reported adjusted earnings of $0.64 per diluted share; and on a GAAP basis, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $0.10. As a reminder, we introduced our methodology for the adjusted net income per diluted share calculation at our Investor Day last February. These adjustments add back non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and noncash interest expense. We believe that these adjustments best reflect our financial performance. We're pleased with our first quarter results which have developed as much as we anticipated they would when we spoke to you last in New York in February. We have been speaking for some time about the dramatic changes that would come our way in 2014. These changes make meaningful comparisons difficult to our results of a year ago or even to the previous quarter. We outlined many of the items affecting year-over-year comparability in today's press release for your reference, so rather than revisiting the differences, let me highlight some of the accomplishments achieved this quarter. Premium revenue grew by 21%, almost $350 million from what we reported for the fourth quarter of 2013, only 12 weeks ago. At 88.7% of premium revenue, Medical care costs were flat compared to last quarter, generating over $37 million more in medical margin than we reported a year -- a quarter ago. General and administrative expense fell from 11% of revenue in the fourth quarter to only 9.1% of revenue 90 days later. So with that as background, let me dive into the details. First, let's take the revenue for this quarter. The major drivers of the $350 million increase over the fourth quarter of last year were : Medicaid Expansion in California, New Mexico and Washington, which added $200 million in revenue in the first quarter; the start up of our South Carolina health plan, which added another $96 million to revenue; increased long-term care membership in Florida, which added $28 million to revenue over the fourth quarter; and the rollout of Centennial Care in New Mexico, which increased our revenue for the quarter by $27 million. This is separate from the increased revenue related to Medicaid expansion. Now moving onto medical costs. We are pleased that the medical care ratio at 88.7% was unchanged from the fourth quarter of last year. MCR was flat even though we added new products and services, which tend to exhibit higher initial medical costs due to factors such as pent-up demand. The medical care ratio for our Medicaid expansion members was about 88% on a consolidated basis. We did record a high MCR, or 94%, for our South Carolina health plan. High medical care ratios are typical for start-up health plans, when members are transitioning from fee-for-service to managed care. For both Medicaid expansion and South Carolina, it's still too early to assess what the steady-state medical care ratio will be. Again, we are happy to see a consolidated MCR unchanged from the fourth quarter. We often see higher medical costs in the first quarter of the year compared to other quarters. We are also pleased to note that we have started to experience the administrative cost leverage we have talked about at our last Investor Days. This was a big story for us this quarter. General and administrative expenses were 9.1% of revenue for the first quarter of 2014, a decrease from 11% in the fourth quarter of 2013. The administrative ratio improved, even though approximately $20 million, or $0.19 per diluted share in G&A costs were spent during the first quarter, with no related revenue. As the new programs are implemented, and their associated revenue finally starts hitting our books, we expect to gain greater administrative leverage, resulting in an even lower administrative expense ratio. Our full year guidance for 2014 anticipates that our administrative expense ratio will continue to decline to 7.5% for the fourth quarter of 2014. There are 3 other items that require special mention this quarter : First, the ACA health insurer fee. As of today, we have signed contracts calling for the reimbursement of the fee and its related tax effects with Florida, Ohio, Illinois, Washington and Wisconsin. This means that we have reached agreement for full reimbursement of the fee for approximately 50% of our Medicaid revenue. We remain optimistic that we will reach agreements for reimbursement with all of our states before the end of 2014. But for right now, for the first quarter of 2014, we have recognized the impact of the entire fee and its related tax effects as an expense, but we have recognized only half of the related Medicaid revenue that we expect to receive. This means that the first quarter revenue and pretax income is about $16 million, or $0.15 per diluted share less than it would have been had we recognized full state reimbursement of the health insurer fee. Bear in mind that the fee in any related revenue we recognize is prorated evenly across the year. Next, we were unable to recognize about $6 million, or about $0.06 per diluted share of quality-related revenue at our Texas health plan this quarter. We spoke about this in February. The state of Texas has changed some of its measurements used for the quality-related revenue. Since we don't have prior history for these new measurements, it is difficult to estimate current year progress towards these goals, this early in the year. Thus, we have not recognized quality revenue for these new metrics as of yet. We believe that we should be able to recognize most of this revenue later in the year. Lastly, our effective tax rate. As you no doubt can see from our financial results, the nondeductibility of the ACA health insurer fee results in a much higher tax rate this year. We have recorded an effective tax rate of about 54% for this quarter. As hard as it is to compare the first quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of last year, it is even more difficult to compare our results this quarter with the first quarter of 2013, given the significant changes to our business. All of the caveats I mentioned regarding the absence of reimbursement, a part of the health insurer fee, the revenue gross up required due to the nondeductibility of that fee and the unrecognized Texas quality revenue still apply to the first quarter of this year. Lastly, we have a very different effective tax rate between the first quarter of 2014 and 2013 due to the nondeductibility of the health insurer fee. Again, you will need to interpret our comparative financial performances yourselves, should you want to take -- undertake such an analysis. But I encourage you to consider all the points that I have made as you do so. We feel that year-over-year comparisons are not the most valuable way to measure our progress towards our defined goals. Operating cash flow was strong at $210 million for the quarter. We added a significant amount of premium and correspondingly, we've strengthened our reserves as evidenced by an increase in days in claims payable. Days in claims payable increased to 46 from 43 at the end of the 2013. As of March 31, 2014, the company had cash and investments of around $1.9 billion, including approximately $340 million at the parent company. We are reaffirming guidance for 2014 of adjusted net income per diluted share in the range of $4.00 to $4.50 and net income per diluted share on a GAAP basis in the range of $1.65 to $2.15. We had a strong quarter. But as you know from following us over the years, it is not our practice to fine tune guidance on a quarterly basis, particularly when we provided guidance just 12 weeks ago. Mario talked about delays and the implementation of the duals programs in Michigan, South Carolina and Texas. It is important to note that these delays have a minimal effect on 2014 guidance and no material effect to our long-term revenue growth target of $12.5 billion. While we are keeping our guidance range unchanged, because of our positive Q1 results, we now have a corresponding bias towards the higher end of fiscal year 2014 EPS guidance range. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sarah James from Wedbush. Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division : As some of your dual contracts have started to come online, has there been any updates or developments, any understanding of opt-out likelihood? Your assumptions seem to be a little bit more conservative than some of your peers? Joseph Mario Molina : This is Mario. We think it's a little too early to start commenting on the opt-out rates. Remember, that these patients have the ability to opt out any time throughout the course of the program. And for our guidance, we assumed a 50% opt-out rate. Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division : Okay. You mentioned benefiting some -- Sovaldi not being on the preferred drug list in some markets in first quarter, which is similar to comments that your peers have made, but some states have moved it onto the PDL for April while others, like Texas, may not do so until the third quarter. So I was wondering if you could help us understand how much of your book was exposed to that drug cost in the first quarter versus how you think about it being exposed in the second quarter, given the recent PDL update? Joseph Mario Molina : Well, this is Mario again. I think that we will see more exposure going forward. I think Gilead reported that only 7% of the sales in the first quarter were from Medicaid, although they didn't break out how much of the sales on the HMO side were to Medicaid patients covered by health plans. But I do think we will see this grow as the year unfolds. At the same token, when we first started talking about this at the beginning of the year, most states didn't recognize the problem. I think now it's widely recognized by state Medicaid directors that this is an issue, and I think there's growing acknowledgment by state Medicaid programs that the rates that we initially received did not include the cost of this new drug. So the story is evolving, and I think that perhaps next quarter, we'll be able to tell you a little bit more about utilization, but also a little bit more about what the state Medicaid programs are doing to appropriately reimburse us for costs. Operator : Our next question comes from Joshua Raskin with Barclays. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division : My question is on the Medicaid expansion population. I know it's early in terms of trends, and it sounds like you guys were accruing, I guess, you said at 88% MLRs. When do you think you'll have a better handle as to what the claims looks like? I'm assuming you've got some of the January claims processed and maybe a lot of the pharmacy claims, et cetera? And then the second part to the question is where are these members getting enrolled? Are the states aware of who these individuals are and they're auto assigning them? Or a lot of these people are getting signed up through utilization of the health care system i.e. hospital providers signing them up when they have some sort of acute episodes. John C. Molina: Josh, this is John. With respect to your -- the first part of your question. I think we'll have a much better handle by the end of the second quarter in terms of what the true utilization patterns are going to be. And as far as how folks are singing up, we don't have a lot of visibility into that. If they do identify a provider and they communicate that to the state and we get that information, then we can match them up. But I don't know at this point how many do and how many of them are just being auto assigned. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division : I guess, if you look at your January enrollment, for example, in some of the states where you've seen some robust growth there, are you able to see some sort of episode or some sort of cost usage early in their assignment of health plans? Or was there a January 1 sort of bucket that came through, so it looks like these are more evenly distributed across the population? John C. Molina: We didn't notice any particular pattern of how people were enrolled, Josh, sorry. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. All right, no problem. Just one second question, just on the exchange, I know it's only 8,000 lives for you. Is that majority in California? And then, any thoughts on where those individuals are coming on versus where you guys priced for them? Joseph Mario Molina : Well, the state that has the largest enrollment right now is California, so it is the -- where the majority of -- probably, half the 2/3 are coming out of California. What was the second part of your question, Josh? Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division : In terms of cost trends or any early signs of the age or demographics, how they're lining up relative to what your expectations were? Joseph Mario Molina : Yes. Actually, the demographics are very similar to what we expected when we made our projections, so we're pleased about that. A little over half of them are coming on in the Silver plan. 91% of them are receiving some sort of government subsidy, so it's all very consistent with what we expected. In terms of the medical costs, I think it's probably still too early to say, but the pharmacy costs seem to be tracking within expectations. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Lake with JPMorgan. Michael A. Newshel - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : It's actually Mike Newshel in for Justin. So I kind of like to go back to Hep C cost. If you can, is it possible to -- can you give us a number of patients or the dollar spending for the quarter? And sort of embedded within -- embedded in guidance, do you have -- there's something embedded in there for the full year? Or you're just assuming that if it does accelerate that the states are going to come back and cover for you? Joseph Mario Molina : Well, we're not going to break out the number of prescriptions or utilizing patients. We typically don't get into that kind of granular detail on our medical costs, so we're not going to do it here either. I don't believe that it was built into our guidance, because, we, frankly, did not anticipate this based on the rates that we were given from the state. So we see this as something outside of guidance. We are negotiating probably, right now, with about half the states over adjustments to payments whether it be through carve outs or a pass through or some of the mechanism or revisiting this in the rates. Michael A. Newshel - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. One more question on the ramp up of -- or, actually, the ramp down of the administrative expense ratio over the course of the year. You updated the fourth quarter. Any update you can give for the second and third quarter in terms of the ramp down given the delays in duals launches? John C. Molina: Sure. This is John. If you go back to our Investor Day slide presentation, there was a slide that had quarterly estimate for what we thought the MN expense ratio would be. I don't, off the top of my head, know what it is for Q2 and Q3. But if you want to go back to the slide, you should be able to find it. Michael A. Newshel - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : I know, and it's still valid? Joseph W. White: Yes, that's correct. It's Joe speaking. We don't think the sliding of those duals program is going to affect guidance one way or the other. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Rigg with the Susquehanna International Group. Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Just to come back to the exchange population again. I know you get paid slightly different rates, because there's, obviously, some acuity differences, but more generally, and we've heard some of the hospital guys talk about substantial declines in their uninsured visits, primarily, in the expansion states. And, I guess, can you give us a sense for whether you've seen a materially higher level of inpatient or hospital outpatient utilization among the newly enrolled by the expansion versus traditional populations? Joseph Mario Molina : Well, we -- are you talking about the expansion population or the exchange population? Because it sounds like you're mixing the 2. Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Yes, I meant to say the Medicaid expansion population, so the 133,000 that you guys highlighted. Joseph W. White: Yes. It's Joe's speaking. Frankly, those claims have been slow to come in. And we really don't -- we just don't have a read on their -- the medical claims development there, how it breaks down between inpatient and outpatient. Again, we're confident it's in that high 80s MCR, but we just haven't had a huge amount of claims development. Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Okay. And then, just on the build and the claims inventory in the balance sheet. Is that just due to your expected ramp in growth? Or is there something else going on there? Joseph W. White: It's Joe speaking again, that's tied to our growth, nothing unusual in claims process or anything. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Just going back to the exchange this year, obviously, about 8,000 lives in the first quarter. May I ask what are you guys expecting now for the year? Is it still around the 15,000 point, or after April, this is going to vary a little bit from that? John C. Molina: This is John. We did see a pick up in enrollment towards the end of March, early April, so that's going to grow. I don't know, it's going to get much beyond the 15,000 that we're talking about. Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : So switching, specifically to Washington there, I saw a little bit of an increase in the MCR, obviously, an expansion state there, was that part of the driver of the increase? Or share anything else was highlighting in Washington, specifically? Joseph W. White: It's Joe speaking yes, it's expansion, which is running [indiscernible] again of what we expect is running a little bit about what we traditionally run for the other populations in Washington. And I think we talked to the end of last year about a little bit of rate pressure in Washington, which is carried over into this year. Operator : Our next question comes from Ana Gupte with Leerink. Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : So just following up on the Medicaid Expansion and the claims experience that you saw this quarter. You talked about the 1Q being -- coming in favorable relative to expectations. How much of that is due to any kind of weather and/or the flu impact? And on the Medicaid Expansion, you said you haven't seen a lot of claims, but are you trying to steer the patients more to your point about being a chronic care company to the primary care physician when they come on board? Or will they just stand up in the ER? And how long does the claim cycle take for you to start seeing something? Might we see something that may have already happened in 1Q? Joseph Mario Molina : There's a bunch of questions in there. Let me see if I can hit them all. In terms of our expectations in whether a favorable pickup in Q1 because of -- I think what we said was we're coming at our expectation, which was the high 80s, like 88%. So I'm not sure if there was any favorability there. In terms of where are we expecting them to get care, all of the patients that we get, we do try to steer towards the primary care doctor as opposed to the ER. These folks may traditionally have used the ER as their primary care site, but that's really not much different than any time we switch from a fee-for-service in the managed-care environment. So we do try to connect them with their PCP. We do welcome calls, make sure they know who their primary care doctor is and encourage them to go in for that visit. And last, again, it's just really too early to tell, since we don't have a lot of claims experience yet to know what the utilization pattern is, but I don't think we're seeing anything unusual. Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : Okay, yes, got it. It's very early in the day. And I just wanted to follow-up, understanding, again, it's very early on the duals side. You've enrolled some members, and you're doing the health risk assessments, I'm just trying to triangulate to your point around, we should be looking at adjusted income. And as you're seeing some of its early experiences and risk profiles with duals and Medicaid expansion and after you get your revenue, that you're expecting on board, what might we see as normalized MLRs and your administrative cost ratio and margin? What would be your best guess going forward compared to where you are today? Joseph Mario Molina : Sure, I think that for the year, we're estimating medical care ratio of somewhere between 88% and 90% off the top of my head. I'm going back to guidance. And the admin cost, we're expecting will continue to decline throughout the year. We should have, as we said, fourth quarter about 7.5%. And I think on average, about 8% for the year. 89%... Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : I was thinking more about your $12.5 billion kind of long-term targets, and so it shouldn't go beyond your one-time story in '14. We all understand it's a transition here? Joseph Mario Molina : True. And what we've said consistently is we should exit 2015. We're on a $12.5 billion run rate, and our net income goal is 2%, and that's on a GAAP basis, so we'll be revisiting that in the next Investor Day to translate that into an adjusted earnings margin. But our story is fairly consistent in terms of what we expect, in terms of the margin and the revenue goals. Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : So still 2%, okay. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Carter with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Chris Carter : I guess, just first question. Can you just talk about if you experienced any benefit in the quarter from weather or more benign flu season? John C. Molina: This is John. I think the flu season was about the same as it was last year. So I don't know -- certainly better than when we had H1N1 in 2009, but I don't know if I would say it's a benefit. Joseph Mario Molina : In terms of the weather, this is Mario, a lot of that weather affected more the eastern part of the country. If you look, a large part of our membership is in places like California and Washington. I don't think the weather had any impact on us. Chris Carter : Okay. And then just curious, I know that the California MLR looked pretty good. I'm curious how that compared to the 3.25% target margin in the settlement agreement? And maybe if you had a swing positive or negative into that settlement account? John C. Molina: This is John. I think if you look in our Q, which is also filed today, we realized about a $5 million pickup from the settlement agreement. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank. Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : First question, just looks like the cost of services ratio improved by around 250 bps sequentially. were there any factors that drove the improvement in particular? And is this a good run rate for the rest of the year? That would seem to be trending a bit better than I was expecting there. Joseph W. White: This is Joe speaking. We've seen a pretty good quarter with MMS in first quarter of this year. It's a couple of things. There has been some lift, which we expect to continue from more claimed volume tied to Medicaid expansion. There were also some revenue recognition related to projects being completed and onetime payments from the state. I say if you can look at that, the improvement is 50-50 split between those two. So some of that improvement will carry forward. Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. Then just on the Texas MLR, was up around 300 bps sequentially. Was that all just not being able to recognize the quality revenues yet? Or were there any other factors that drove the MLR up a bit sequentially? Joseph W. White: It's Joe speaking again. The big issue there in terms of that, sequentially, from fourth quarter is the at-risk quality revenue not recognized. Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. Then just last question, I guess, just swinging back to Sovaldi here. Interested just how much does the determinations differ in the States, where the drug is on the PDL as compared to those that aren't. It was just interesting looking at the Florida Medicaid drug utilization report for the first quarter. It showed that Sovaldi for Florida Medicaid was the most costly drug in the program, even though they didn't even put it to the PDL till the end of the quarter. So just thought it was interesting that we're already seeing that type of spend, even in a state where it wasn't in the PDL. So just interested in how -- the variability that occurs between states with it on the PDL as compared to those that are not. Joseph Mario Molina : Well, we know that the state of Florida that they expect that -- Sovaldi to double their cost this year for the treatment of Hepatitis C, so I think, at least, in that status, it's going to be significant. I can't give you data on a state-by-state basis. And, of course, we only have limited exposure, because we're only looking at what our patients are experiencing, not what the entire state is doing. Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Mario, just on Florida, is there any update you know of as to where the discussion stand? Because I think the budget was basically getting wrapped up, right? So just wondering whether -- how the discussion on getting a rate adjustment filtered into that sort of last-minute discussions going on? Joseph Mario Molina : I think there's a lot of activity even yesterday and today on that. And I would say that it's a positive sign that the states are recognizing that this is an incremental cost. And I think most states are now recognizing that it was not built into the rates. Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : So you feel positive they're going to make an adjustment then, for the rates there? Joseph Mario Molina : I think we're going to see some adjustments. Like everything else though, is it appropriate, is it enough? Those are the kinds of things we always discuss with the states when they makes changes in the rates? Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Stephen Baxter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : This is Steve Baxter on for Kevin. I wanted to come back to the balance sheet. It looks like the claims in the inventory and the claims in inventory per member roughly doubled year-over-year. I was wondering if you could provide some color on what's driving the increase? And whether you expect that to clear out, or whether that might be a more stable kind of inventory level to think about going forward? Joseph W. White: It's Joe speaking. The increase in inventory, I think, a better metric to look at would be to compare it to fourth quarter of last year, but it's certainly and predominantly enrollment-driven. Stephen Baxter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay, well, I see that the claims per member were about 0.08 last year in the fourth quarter and now it looks like they're 0.013 -- or 0.13, so it seems like a pretty dramatic increase. Joseph W. White: Well, you're always going to have with -- as good a job, frankly, as we think we do in terms of claims payment, when new populations come on, you always tend to have a buildup, with peak, third, fourth month, fifth month of enrollment. And it just speaks to the time it takes for that. There's claims that show up in inventory and then to work through the backlog. It takes a while maneuvering people on for doctors to get the claims and -- based on where the member belongs. Joseph Mario Molina : And this also underscores why the days in claims payable was up. Stephen Baxter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. No, that makes sense. I appreciate the color. And then just one follow up on the $5 million you recognized from the risk share restaurant agreement. Was that on the duals site of enrollment or in the Medicaid side? Joseph W. White: It was on the Medicaid side. Joseph Mario Molina : No duals at first quarter in California. Stephen Baxter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay then. So you're not really booking the duals at very high MLR then? Somewhere in the low 90s, like you had kind of given a guidance? John C. Molina: We haven't got any duals in the revenue side for the first quarter, so we will book those, as they start to come in Q2. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Can you tell us a little bit more about the woodwork effect? I know you haven't seen much of it yet, but you talked about potentially seeing it going forward? Do you think that it's just held up sort of in process as we're moving through some of these people who've been identified as perhaps eligible for Medicaid that just haven't signed up yet? Is it a matter of going out and targeting these people from you guys? Or exactly, what do you think is going on there? And when do you think that will start to show up in your numbers? Terry P. Bayer: This is Terry. It varies by state, but you've seen in the press that the high number of folks who've been found eligible but still had not really made it into the roles. Remember, there's a process, by which people get on Medicaid, and it can take months. It varies sometimes [indiscernible] at the county level. There have been issues with some of the state processing systems. So in most cases, we had seen delays in that. And we expect it to be coming in, as people work their way through that process. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : And is that factored into your guidance as you sort of -- that enrollment process, and you see them for those people coming in? Do you have sort of factored in, in the last couple of quarters here showing up? Joseph Mario Molina : Yes, we do. I think we went over that -- quantified that at the Investor Day. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then just on the Texas incentive fee is that in guidance at this point, the $0.06? Joseph W. White: It's Joe speaking, yes. We expect to realize most of that. I mean, recognize most of that by the end of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from David Windley from Jefferies. David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Quick question on your MLR accrual on expansion lives. I want to make sure I understand. So I've heard you say 88% to 90%, or that range a couple of times. I've also heard you say that you haven't seen a lot of claims for them. So can you help me again to understand your comfort level with that high 80s level, if I have that right? And what allowances you're making for the low visibility relative to claims volume? Joseph W. White: This is Joe speaking. Obviously, when we have situations with light claims receipts, we tend to err a little bit to the side of being cautious. What we do, clearly, have though with expansion lives at this stage is we have very good pharmacy data, of course. And that is suggesting that we're tracking to where the lives are priced at by the state, or perhaps a little better than that. So I think it's fair to say we feel pretty good about that number. Pharmacy date is a pretty good indication of where it's going to come in, in time. David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : And taking that down to operating and pretax. What are your -- what are the company's expectations for contribution margin on these lives? What's in guidance, I guess, what I mean by that? John C. Molina: This is John. In guidance, we've got -- it varies a little bit by state, but 88% is about the average. If you go back to our Investor Day slide, we sort of broke it down, what we thought Medicaid Expansion will be on a state-by-state basis. I don't know that the admin costs vary much, so I'd use an average admin cost. And that's how you can get to a margin. Joseph Mario Molina : And if you look towards the MD&A discussion in our 10-Q, you see where we talked a little bit about the blended premium rates for the different population routes. So you can build it from that, I think. Operator : Our last question comes from Tom Carroll with Stifel. Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Question for you on kind of the variation in the headwinds that you told us about -- at your Investor Day a couple of months ago versus the actual results. And if I'm adding it up correctly, it looks like you highlighted kind of $0.92 a share in headwinds, and it looks like those are only turning out to be about $0.40 a share. So big favorable swing. Any 1 or 2 items you could highlight for us that would reconcile that sizable difference from 2 months ago? Joseph W. White: Sure, it's Joe speaking. When we called those out in New York, the intent was to present in each of those areas, the most extreme negative circumstances that could arise from those areas. So, obviously, had all of those played out, I think Slide 57 on our investor deck, had all those played out as negative, we would have had a disastrous quarter. So I think the way to look at it is those were each worse case and what could develop. That's not -- we don't set guidance, so assuming every worse case is going to develop. So that's the best I could express that. Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Okay, okay, very good. It sounds like a lot of conservatism built into those numbers, which were worst-case scenarios. Joseph W. White: And if you had anybody worked those into their numbers, they would've had a much lower number than how consensus work out for this quarter. Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : And then I missed it. Did you mention the Sovaldi spend in first quarter? I'd love to know that number if you could provide it to us. Joseph Mario Molina : No, Tom. We didn't, and we're not disclosing it. We typically don't break out medical cost to that granular degree, so we're not going to do that now. Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : It's just kind of an unusual characteristic this quarter, so just sticking to your guns on that? Joseph Mario Molina : That's right. Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. And then one last question. I'm pretty sure you guys bid down in Puerto Rico. I wondered if you could give us an update on kind of where that stands? It seems like sources and information's kind of gone radio silent. Is there an update you can give us? John C. Molina: No, this is John, no. Until something definitive happens, we're not going to comment. Joseph Mario Molina : All right, well, thank you, everyone. We appreciate you listening in on this quarter's call, and we'll be back with you in a few months to go over the second quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

Welcome to the Molina Healthcare Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, July 30, 2014. I would now like to turn the conference over to Juan Jos\u00e9 Orellana, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Juan Jos\u00e9 Orellana :  Thank you, Melody. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The purpose of this call is to discuss Molina Healthcare\u2019s financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2014. The company\u2019s earnings release reporting its results was issued today after the market close, and is now posted for viewing on our company website. On the call with me today are Dr. Mario Molina, our CEO; John Molina, our CFO; Terry Bayer, our COO; and Joseph White, our Chief Accounting Officer. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. If you have multiple questions, we ask that you get back in the queue so that others can have an opportunity to ask their questions. Our comments today will contain forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, including but not limited to forward-looking statements about the reimbursement of the ACA Insurer Fee, and the recognition of quality-based revenue by our Texas Health plan. All of our forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to numerous risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. A description of such risk factors can be found in our earnings release, and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-K Annual Report, our Form 10-Q Quarterly Reports and our Form 8-K current reports. These reports can be accessed under the Investor Relations tab of our company website or on the SEC\u2019s website. All forward-looking statements made during today\u2019s call represent our judgment as of July 30, 2014, and we disclaim any obligation to update such statements except as required by securities laws. This call is being recorded and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available at our company\u2019s website, molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Mario Molina. Joseph Mario Molina :  Thank you, Juan Jos\u00e9. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we report our second quarter results. We are pleased that the results for 2014 are unfolding as we anticipated when we provided guidance in February. The three key elements that we shared with you in February remain critical for our success in 2014, and they have not changed. These elements are the growth of membership and revenue, the provision of high quality cost effective care to our members and improving administrative efficiency. The membership continues to increase and we finished the second quarter with approximately 2.3 million members up from 1.85 million members at the end of the second quarter of 2013, an increase of 22%. In fact, we added over 100,000 members since last quarter alone. Much of this growth is due to the expansion of Medicaid that is added over 230,000 members since last year, and has exceeded the 160,000 new expansion members that we had projected in guidance at our February Investor Day. Several sates including California, Michigan and Illinois where we have health plan operations have reported backlogs affecting the processing of applications for Medicaid. For example, California reported a backlog of 600,000 applications, but they expect to cut the backlog to 350,000 by September. In Illinois, the backlog has decreased from 500,000 in April to 150,000 in June. As the states processed the backlog of applications, we expect to see our Medicaid enrollment continue to grow. The new members that are enrolling as a result of the Medicaid expansion tend to be slightly older compared to our channel members. The Urban Institute estimated that nearly 50% of the uninsured are over 35 years of age, consistent with this estimate, about 60% of our Medicaid expansion members are over 35 years old. It is too soon for us to know exactly what the final cost and characteristics of these members will ultimately be. Total revenue is tracking in line with our expectations, and is up 44% as compared to the second quarter of 2013, this is consistent with the growth in membership, and the shift to members that are older and have more complex medical needs. These members come with higher premiums. At 89.3% of premium, medical costs are higher than the same quarter a year ago when they were 86.2%. However, it is difficult to make meaningful comparisons to last year, because of the change in our member demographics. What is more important is that, Medical costs are in line with the 89% that we projected in guidance for 2014. Let me speak for a moment on Florida. First, it\u2019s important to note that we have limited exposure in Florida due to our relatively small enrollment in that state, and that our participation in the Managed Medical Assistance or MMA program did not begin until July 1. Once the program is fully implemented, Molina Healthcare will be operating in only three regions 7, 9 and 11, which geographically speaking represents Central Florida, the Florida Treasure Coast and South Florida. As part of the implementation of the new Medicaid contract awards in that state, we\u2019ve had to exit some markets and start operations in others. This has resulted in temporary declines in enrollment in June and July as we exited Tampa and Boulevard Counties. However, the membership decline will be offset with new membership in Miami-Dade, which started on July 1, as well as Orlando and Palm Beach Starting August 1. We will closely monitor the implementation to determine how it is tracking with our expectations. The life and pharmacy costs reflects the higher cost of drugs in general. The increased prescription drug needs of some of our new members, and the cost of new drug such as Sovaldi. While the utilization of Sovaldi appears to have plateaued in the second quarter, we remain concerned about the high cost of Gilead Sovaldi and the impact it could have on state Medicaid budgets. We are even more concerned about the future impact of specialty drugs, of which Sovaldi is just a single example. Competition generally brings with it lower costs. However, the specialty drug market may be an exception. Senator Wyden from Oregon and Senator Grassley from Iowa recently wrote and \u201cIn order for a marketplace to function properly, it must be competitive, fair and transparent, it is unclear how Gilead set the price for Sovaldi that price appears to be higher than expected given the cost of development and production and the steep discounts offered in other countries, an efficient market needs to inform consumers to keep costs down\u201d. We at Molina hope that in the future the pricing of specialty drugs by pharmaceutical companies will be competitive, fair and transparent. Another important strategic objective for this year and next year is the implementation of six demonstration contracts for the coordination of care for patients eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. These so called duals represent much higher medical costs than typical for Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries. They tend to have multiple chronic medical conditions and they face obstacles associated with poverty that further complicate their care. We are very proud to have been selected to participate in the Medicare/Medicaid plans demonstration programs. In addition to the 44,000 duals, we currently serve through our dual-eligible special needs plans, we began enrolling members in the MMP demonstration contracts in Illinois, California, and Ohio. Recall, that these dual eligible beneficiaries are first given the opportunity to enroll with a health plan that will coordinate both their Medicaid and Medicare benefits. Those that fail to do so will be assigned to a health plan through the process of passive enrollment. However, the beneficiaries have the right to elect, to continue to receive their Medicare benefits on a fee-for-service basis by opting out of the demonstration plan. We projected that 50% of the duals would opt out. Our experience so far leads us to believe that this is still a realistic estimate. There has been no change to the timeline for the implementation of our duals contracts for other states. We expect that these contracts will be implemented in Michigan, South Carolina and Texas in 2015. In keeping with our commitment to have all of our health plans accredited by NCQA for Medicaid, we are proud to announce that our health plan in Wisconsin received accreditation from NCQA in April of this year. Finally, we continue to see progress in administrative efficiency. Our general and administrative expense ratio declined sequentially to 8.4% in the second quarter of 2014. We expect this trend to continue as we guided to approximately 8% for the whole year. The quarter was negatively affected by three issues. The first is reimbursement of the health insurance fee or excise tax that is part of the Affordable Care Act. The second is the non-deductibility of this fee that increases our effective tax rate. And the third is the decision by the company to delay the recognition of some of the quality incentive revenue under our contract with the state of Texas. These are the same issues that affected our earnings last quarter as well. John will discuss these three issues in greater detail in a moment. The second quarter of 2014 much like the first quarter was consistent with our expectations and the guidance that we provided in February. We continue to make progress towards our goals for the year. Now, I will turn the call over to John. John C. Molina:  Thank you, Mario, and hello everyone. As we previously discussed, we are focusing on adjusted net income as our reporting metric, as we feel it better reflects how we manage our business. For the second quarter, adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.71 per diluted share. Overall, membership grew by 22% compared with the second quarter of 2013 and sequentially by 5%. Premium revenue has grown again this quarter to $2.2 billion, up 12% compared with the first quarter 2014. General and administrative expense ratio declined sequentially by 70 basis points to 8.4% in the second quarter of 2014 from 9.1% in the first quarter of 2014. The positive development I just outlined occurred despite some adverse factors which carried over from the first quarter of 2014. These include the delays in some of our states and securing agreements for the reimbursement of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Health Insurer Fee, as well as a gross up to cover the non-deductibility of that fee, and delays in the recognition of quality-related revenue at our Texas Health plan. These delays reduced earnings by a combined total of approximately $23 million or $0.20 per diluted share for the second quarter and $45 million or $0.41 per diluted share for the six months ended June 30, 2014. In other words, have we caught up in the second quarter with all of these timing differences, our year-to-date results would have been higher by $0.41. Total revenue this quarter increased by about $240 million, a 12% increase over the first quarter of 2014. The increase was due mainly by higher Medicaid expansion enrollment. Since the first quarter of 2014, our Medicaid expansion membership experienced a significant jump of almost 100,000 members, a 75% increase. As Martha mentioned, our current Medicaid expansion enrollment now exceeds the guidance of 160,000 that we laid out in February. As we previously discussed, we decided to delay recognition of a portion of the Texas Quality Revenue. To refresh your memory, the state implemented several new quality measures in 2014. Health plans earned this revenue by demonstrating improved performance for certain metrics in 2014 over 2013. The calculation of these new measures is extraordinarily complex and is performed on the state\u2019s behalf by a third party using proprietary software. It is the state\u2019s intent to distribute 2013 base line data to health plans some time in the second half of this year. We are calculating our performance against the measures today using our best estimates. But without seeing the state\u2019s methodology, we believe it is prudent to see that our performance in 2014 is better than what the state has measured for 2013 performance, before we recognize any revenue for these measures. In the first half of the year, we had about $13 million in quality revenue in Texas that we decided not to recognize. Medical costs this quarter experienced a modest increase partially offsetting the benefit from the increased revenue. We don\u2019t consider the change in medical care ratio between the first quarter and the second quarter to be significant. We believe that the rapid growth in our membership in the first half of the year coupled with the introduction of new benefits like long-term care services and new programs like Medicaid expansion make the fluctuations in medical care ratio between the first and second quarter less meaningful. Our anticipation is that our medical care ratios will remain influx during 2014 driven by factors such as pent-up demand, retroactive eligibility changes, member confusion regarding when and how to access care, and delays in our receded claims for services provided. However, we expect that the overall trend will remain in line with our guidance for the year. We are pleased to improve our administrative cost leverage this quarter. General and administrative expenses were 8.4% for the second quarter 2014, a decrease from 9.1% in the first quarter of 2014. Our expectation remains that as new programs are implemented, and their associated revenues finally start hitting our books. We will gain further administrative leverage resulting in a lower administrative expense ratio. So far, the decline in G&A ratio is trekking closely to the quarterly estimates we provided at Investor Day, positioning us well towards achieving our 7.5% target for the fourth quarter of 2014, and an overall 8% for the entire year. Finally, an update on our effective tax rate. The non-deductibility of the ACI Health Insurer Fee continues to affect our financial results through higher effective tax rates. We have recorded an effective tax rate of around 58% this quarter. Days and claims payable was flat at 46. And as of June 30, 2014 the company had cash and investments of around $1.9 billion including approximately $300 million at our parent company. The company\u2019s guidance for fiscal year 2014 remains unchanged, and is as follows. Adjusted net income per diluted share in the range of $4 to $4.50; and net income per diluted share in the range of $1.65 to $2.15. Our operations are tracking as anticipated as Mario suggested, but the timing of the ACA Health Insurer Fee in the Texas Quality Revenue may not be resolved until the fourth quarter. We believe these are timing differences not operating issues. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we\u2019ll now take questions. Operator :  Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Justin Lake with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Michael A. Newshel \u2013 JPMorgan:  Hi, this is Mike Newshel in for Justin actually. So with the variation of guidance, last quarter you said your bias was towards the upper end of the range, is there any change there in terms of how the quarter came in? Joseph Mario Molina :  I think that we\u2019re tracking just as we\u2019ve said in the script, and in the press release. Michael A. Newshel \u2013 JPMorgan:  So you won\u2019t \u2013 you\u2019re not earning the upper end of the guidance range, just sort of the whole \u2013 just laying out, it\u2019s going to fall within the whole range? John C. Molina:  That\u2019s right. And specifically on the MLR, I mean it sounded like, you go with an up tick that was \u2013 that may have fluctuated above what you\u2019re expecting for the quarter, but still was in line for the full year. I mean is it in line with what you\u2019re expecting for the quarter or just if not so high, that it\u2019s still within the same guidance range? Joseph Mario Molina :  This is Mario, if you look at our Medical Care ratio for the first six months of the year, it comes in right at 89%, and that\u2019s right in line with guidance. Michael A. Newshel \u2013 JPMorgan:  Got you. And specifically, on the Medicaid expansion, are they still tracking around 88%? That you mentioned. Joseph Mario Molina :  Again no, everything right now is tracking in line with guidance. Michael A. Newshel \u2013 JPMorgan:  Okay, great. Thank you. Operator :  Our next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush. Please proceed. Sarah James \u2013 Wedbush Securities Inc.:  Thank you. It looks like California MLR just keeps improving. Things are going very well there. Are you guys paying back under the EBIT agreement by now, and what should we think about as a run rate MLR under that agreement? John C. Molina:  Sarah, this is John. No we have not started paying back we still have a reserve or receivable from the stake. I think the run rate for California again there is a lot of changes in California especially now with the doors coming on, but as Mario said I think overall the picture is we are right tracking with guidance. Sarah James \u2013 Wedbush Securities Inc.:  Got it. And I hit a several back on this, but when I think about specific to this quarter, and the expansion number should if I am kind of doing the math on where run rate have been for a couple of markets and where MLR ended up it's just looked like a little bit higher than the number and some of the expansion in states like Illinois, Michigan, Utah, Washington. So I got the rest on tracks for the year, but just specific to this quarter are they at 88% or maybe that was never meant to be a quarterly specific number maybe that was the year end. Could you just talk about that a little bit. John C. Molina: Sarah, here is the challenge while Illinois, Ohio and Michigan are expansion, they didn\u2019t have much expansion enrollment in the quarter. It\u2019s really hard to get that granular and give you folks a picture of the overall half of the company. So, rather than try to figure out what the MLR is for the expansion population in X-state or Y state. The message is everything combined is tracking per guidance just like we have been talking about. John C. Molina:  Sarah, this is Mario. Let me just add if you look at the six biggest states that we have California, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio, Texas and Washington, four of those states are tracking with MLR\u2019s below 89%, and two of them are above. So again I think overall it\u2019s tracking within expectation and I don\u2019t place a lot of emphasis on a small state like Illinois, it doesn\u2019t really impact the numbers that much. So, we tend to focus more on the bigger states. Sarah James \u2013 Wedbush Securities Inc.:  Okay. Thank you. Operator :  Our next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed. Peter Heinz Costa \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities :  If you look at most of your states that they grew in membership a little bit sequentially and yet the loss ratios mostly relative as well. So, just the new membership is coming on at higher loss ratios. But I guess it wouldn\u2019t be a typical, but if that continues and you\u2019re talking about the members coming on from the back of the state. Do you think that your loss ratio should actually raise generally speaking through the rest of the year? And how confident are you that they\u2019re not going to raise it at a more accelerated rate than you\u2019re already looking at right now. John C. Molina:  So Peter we always have higher cost from the new programs come on as Mario said, for the first half of the year the MLR, we haven\u2019t see or rather is about 89% we\u2019re expecting to end the year by 89%, so I think that sort of addresses your question. Peter Heinz Costa \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities :  Yes, but if you look at the trend that you\u2019ve seen, it seems like it would be driving it slightly different direction, so what gives you the confidence that it\u2019s not going to continue to go with higher loss ratio as we go forward. John C. Molina:  Take California as an example. California is the state that\u2019s had the most growth, and their medical loss ratio is actually coming down. So I don\u2019t think you can just make a blanket statement that the medical loss ratio is trending up and they were not going to hit that 89%. We still believe that the guidance number 89% is the right number. Peter Heinz Costa \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities :  I am just looking at generally your state, the state patterns other than California. California is a little bit of an exception with an improving loss ratio sequentially. Most dealers once, it didn\u2019t improve particularly where you had membership growth. John C. Molina:  Well. We still maintained at 89% that we\u2019ve put in guidance is the correct number for the year. And Peter remember we will always discussed that has the population sort of ages in as we have more time to get people under care management et cetera, we can bring them the medical care ratio down. So while may gone up sequentially, it will start to track down. Peter Heinz Costa \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities :  Okay. Joseph W. White:  Peter, its Joe White speaking. Hi, as you can imagine, I\u2019m speaking because we\u2019re going to get into a technical discussion right now which we try to avoid. You also though have to look at when you measure the quarter-over-quarter developments, you have to look at the way our estimate of our 12/31/13 claims liability played out. If you recall back to the first quarter, we anticipated picking up about $51 million of favorable prior period development from 12/31/13 that dropped to $37 million in the second quarter, about a $14 million swing. And within individual states, I don\u2019t want to go into that much detail state-by-state, but prior period development of that size can move individual states pretty significantly. Peter Heinz Costa \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities :  That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much. Joseph W. White:  Sure. Operator :  Our next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please proceed. Joshua Raskin \u2013 Barclays:  Thanks. I just want to follow-up on Joe\u2019s response here real quick, so relative to historical norms or normal course of business prior period reserved development was there any abnormal or was there any negative development in the second quarter. Joseph Mario Molina :  Certainly we did again Josh, I'm talking about the development to be clear of the reserve we established the 12/31/13. It didn\u2019t come in as robustly, as we using anticipates. I think a couple of states may have actually met them below the margin, but the many states were essentially beneath the target margins I think we can\u2019t attribute that any specific thing other than I just sink with the new membership we got sharing in January 1. I think our claims payment was delayed a little bit which extended our lag factors a bit. Joshua Raskin \u2013 Barclays:  Okay. And then massive pick on Illinois, but Illinois was like it\u2019s mostly new membership right it\u2019s tools and expansion. And the MLR is 106%, so is that \u2013 in my understand I would be surprised if you had enough claims data to make a call one way the other. So I would assume that sort of an underwritten margin. So is that what you\u2019re expecting, we are expecting based on the rates that you were seeing that you be in the 106% range. Or do you actually have some claims data already that putting you towards a level that is higher than expected. Joseph W. White:  Again it\u2019s Joe speaking, and we\u2019re venturing into a accounting technicalities here, but one of the real challenge is with according to the MCR in Illinois is that with anticipation the expanded enrollment and with anticipation of the dual eligibles coming on, we had a front load a lot of our medical management staff. So, if you think a typical health plan, if you think consolidated basis, normally what we called quality assurance costs, medical management runs about 2.5% of revenue. And Illinois it\u2019s running about 10% of revenue. So, certainly it\u2019s one of our higher costs medical markets, but if you normalized for the administrative costs burden, the medical management burden, you knock about 10% off for that MLR for Illinois. Joshua Raskin \u2013 Barclays:  Got it. And you put all of those quality expenses in the medical cost line? Joseph W. White:  Correct. Joshua Raskin \u2013 Barclays:  Okay consistent with any IT guidelines et cetera. So and then, one more question for you the opt-out rates, I\u2019m just looking at the second quarter, it looks like you're about 62%. I think you guys have been talking about 50% opt-out rate. Can you sort of maybe just walk us through the timings of the dual roll out? So this is an issue where you\u2019ve got a timing issue and that \u2013 this will migrate more towards 50% or is that 62% in line with your expectation? Joseph W. White:  Josh, it\u2019s Joe and Terry is going to get into the more substantive business explanation of this in a minute. But as far as how we\u2019ve reported this not the numbers, that the major factor here is Ohio. Unlike our other MMP states, in Ohio the state is enrolling in every one for their Medicaid benefits and the individual until January 1 to receive the Medicare piece of the MMP has to opt in. So the result of that is, we are getting a lot of \u2013 we are starting to get members in Ohio who are default to just in the Medicaid piece of the MMP benefit, and have chosen not to opt into the Medicare piece. So the result of that is what you see right there on the \u2013 in terms of the way we disclose enrollment in the earnings release. Joshua Raskin \u2013 Barclays:  And so\u2026 Joseph W. White:  Terry is\u2026 Terry P. Bayer:  Josh I will just add two more factors and at this point we are telling you that we are tracking toward that 50% opt-out number which is one we put in guidance we don\u2019t have any indication will not be there. Some people opt-out before they ever come into the program some opt-out in the first month there are in the program, but what Joe just explained Ohio was a different situation where the path of enrollment will not begin until next January. So you got Medicaid coming in and then a voluntary opt-in on the others. So there are so many factors I think we\u2019ve discussed it late and look at Illinois, California and Ohio from our different points in the voluntary and passed that process and our conclusion is that we are not seeing that we will exceed that 50% of opt-in. The bottom line is too early to tell we are waiting for that information to finally come in. Joshua Raskin \u2013 Barclays:  So just to clarify in Ohio then, all of these individuals have been assigned Medicaid. Terry P. Bayer:  Yeah. Joshua Raskin \u2013 Barclays:  Possibly. And then they will get their Medicare assignment on January 1 possibly as well. And then there is probably an opt-out period after that as well. Terry P. Bayer:  Correct. They can opt out of Medicare at any time, I just want to also clarify for you the entire Ohio enrollment has not been assigned yet will that\u2019s coming in segments and you are seeing in the June 30 numbers, only the first half in selected regions that will continue to occur over the next month or two. Joshua Raskin \u2013 Barclays:  Right. You will get a big bump in the auto assignment for Jan I and then it will sort of come down a little bit as people opt-out after that. Terry P. Bayer:  Yes. But even the Medicaid is coming in over the course of couple of months not all at once. Joshua Raskin \u2013 Barclays:  Got it. Okay. Thanks. Operator :  Our next question comes from a line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed. Kevin Fischbeck \u2013 Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch :  Okay. Great, thanks. I am struggling to fully understand some of the commentary that you guys made so far. And I will get the 10-Q it looks like in the quarter California got a bunch of payments that were out of period revenue payments related to Q1 of 2013 which I believe may be MLR look lower by back that was not coming up with MLR up 150 basis points sequentially, is that the right way to think about it? And if so want to go back to the question earlier about revenue growth and rising trend in MLR? Joseph Mario Molina :  Sure. It\u2019s Joe speaking yes. I think the way you laid it out is a way I would lay it out on, the California benefited from other period revenue adjustment in the quarter that more or less offset consolidated prior period development. So we didn\u2019t see I need to call that one on a consolidated basis, Kevin. But when everyone started to talk about individual health plan performance, I was just making the point that unfavorable prior period development on a comparative basis from the previous quarter easily squeeze other health plan MLRS. So I think the way to look at it is without going into too much detail, California\u2019s MCR helped by the $15 million of out of period revenue, the other health plans hurt by prior period development. Kevin Fischbeck \u2013 Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch :  Yeah. I think the number was 2015 the sideline Q1 that\u2019s obviously a 2014 numbers, do you include in the 2014 to offset 2015, 2013 that you would back out? Joseph Mario Molina :  Exactly, 2015 versus 2015 for last year. Kevin Fischbeck \u2013 Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch :  Okay. So I mean it does seem then like on a normalized basis that generally speaking I understand the concept of relating that\u2019s hard to get a clean numbers if you don\u2019t have prior, but it\u2019s still directionally feel that the comment before that new enrollment coming and higher costs. Generally speaking is the right way to think about it and I think you guys have also talked about that historically that when you don\u2019t have visibility on claims you take a little bit more conservative thoughts on MLR, So it is interesting that we have that enrollment coming on normally we would think it should be a higher MLR, the bridge in the ramping guidance is pretty dramatic obviously you are expecting to get the healthcare insurance fee in terms of payments. So, I just trying to think about the bridge there is it all about the G&A reduction and exceeding that is that kind of other big reason for the dramatic increase in earnings when MLR might not be the answer. Joseph Mario Molina :  That\u2019s a big. It\u2019s Joe speaking again. That\u2019s a big chunk of it. I don\u2019t want to model for everybody, but if you look at if you do the, if you look at where guidance is at on the revenue side versus where we\u2019re today for the first half and then take the impact of the admin ratio, we talked about for the year which we still believe we\u2019re going to get, it\u2019s a pretty substantial number drop into the bottom line. Kevin Fischbeck \u2013 Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch :  Okay. And then just last question on the Texas incentive payments, just want to get an update, any color you can provide about your conversation you had with the state about where you\u2019re versus those numbers and obviously that\u2019s maybe restriction way it actually book at the just any color you have about the confidence of actually hitting those numbers. John C. Molina:  This is John. We\u2019ve got our own internal calculations that we feel pretty comfortable with our performance is improving, but until we see what the base line is and we have to get that from the state and they have to get that from the third party vendor it\u2019s impossible for us to know. Kevin Fischbeck \u2013 Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch :  Is that timing on the Q3 event or is that Q4? John C. Molina:  They have told us Q3, but space it we recognized that often times when states are rolling out new data that there are delays. Kevin Fischbeck \u2013 Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch :  Okay. All right. Thanks. Operator :  Our next question comes from the line of Chris Carter with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Chris Carter \u2013 Credit Suisse :  Thanks, good afternoon. Just quick when I go back to your Investor Day book, I think I come up with a target of around 60,000 duals I think you\u2019re targeting for the year. I mean you guys on pace for that, given where you are today? John C. Molina:  That\u2019s a good question. Joseph Mario Molina :  I think it\u2019s Joe speaking again, I mean, I think that point since and we\u2019ve talked about the delays is the rollouts in\u2026 John C. Molina:  South Carolina. Joseph Mario Molina :  Michigan and South Carolina. So, we don\u2019t want to go in that level of detail, but I think it\u2019s fair to say we\u2019ll come up a little bit less than that. Chris Carter \u2013 Credit Suisse :  Got it. Okay. And then just on the Texas MLR, I mean that looked elevated in the quarter. Is that just simply related to the revenue recognition or anything else going on there? Joseph W. White:  It's Joe speaking. Again, yes, it\u2019s the revenue recognition it\u2019s also if you look at it compared to last year it\u2019s also add to do with some timing of recognition of profit sharing to back of the stay. Chris Carter \u2013 Credit Suisse :  Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator :  Our next question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please proceed. David H. Windley \u2013 Jefferies:  Hi, thanks for taking the question. So a follow-up on the dual Medicare opt-out, I\u2019m wondering beyond the obvious that you don\u2019t get the medicare premium portion, are there other implications to that opt-out in terms of your ability to manage the members care and perhaps the saving assumptions that are baked into the premium that you are getting. John C. Molina:  I think that we are still going to be responsible for managing the long term care benefits. The savings that are baked in are baked in only for the MMP program. So if they are not fully enrolled there is no savings expectation. They are essentially like our Texas STAR PLUS members, where we are responsible for the long term care benefits, but there is no associated savings, the savings idea was that if you could co-ordinate the care for both Medicare and Medicaid there would be some synergy and some cost savings, to the extent that the members don\u2019t participate in both programs that are outside of that contract. Joseph W. White:  And that how we have modeled it in our guidance. David H. Windley \u2013 Jefferies:  Okay and so you feel like the premium that you will get in opt-out situation is appropriate for the benefits and the savings that you\u2019re responsible for? Joseph W. White:  That\u2019s right. David H. Windley \u2013 Jefferies:  Okay. Joseph W. White:  Yeah. And I also think that there is an opportunity later on for those patients to voluntarily enroll, if they choose to. And I think that if we do a good job of managing their other Medicaid benefits, they may gain confidence in health plan and decided that they want to fully participate. So it\u2019s not as if these members are permanently gone on the Medicare side, they could come back to us later. David H. Windley \u2013 Jefferies:  Sure. Are there \u2013 on that point, are there other steps that you can take that would change the proportion of opt-outs, change the network and things like that? Joseph Mario Molina :  Well certainly one of the reasons that people opt-out in the Medicare side is if we don\u2019t have their provider in the network. And it becomes more difficult on the Medicare side because these beneficiaries have multiple positions, whereas typically on the Medicaid side, the real contact with healthcare is through their primary care doctor. On the Medicare side, it\u2019s often the specialist. And if you\u2019ve got four or five specialists and one of them is not in our network, you may opt-out. So as time goes on, I think we will shore up the network. We do get information about who the providers are. David H. Windley \u2013 Jefferies:  Gotcha. So last question, coming back to the MLR, there is lot of focus on the new members that are coming in or will come in over the balance of the year and impact on MLR. What about your expectations for MLR underwriting margin for the members that we\u2019re looking at today. The decline as they mature into your plants and the medical management resources that you have in place, maybe you could talk us through proactive steps that you are taking to make sure these folks get into plans and their cost experience declines as they seize them. Terry P. Bayer:  This is Terry. We\u2019re executing on our model of care that we have been working on and focused on the last few years. We use a model of care whether each trying to stable patients in our Medicare D snip and we\u2019ve extended it now to the new enrollment. The patients are all risk assessment is completed upon their entry to the program and they are dependent upon that are modeling tools and our tearing of the severity and the need for immediate intervention. Folks are getting assigned to case managers. I think we have shared with you in the past we\u2019re focused on community connectors and care transition workers, so that we\u2019re working with members in their homes and when they leave the hospital just as much as we\u2019re managing them during their in-patient stage. So our full care management model which is very focused on coordinating medical, behavioral and social needs is in play on these members, not 100% on day one and that\u2019s where our triage mechanism come in place, so that we can focused on those of most greatest need in the beginning. There is also medication therapy management programs that come, so all of the members who have a high number of medical diagnosis and prescription drugs are each in dialogue with the registered pharmacist to coordinate their drug program and that\u2019s another way that we focused on those most greatest need in the beginning. David H. Windley \u2013 Jefferies:  All right. Thank you. Operator :  Our next question comes from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel. Please proceed. Thomas A. Carroll \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Company:  Yes, good afternoon. I wonder if you could talk about the process that you are taking with your states to get the ACA fee totally covered and wrapped up above. I thought by this time of the year, you might have a bit more visibility on it. So is there, are you more conservative in your process make? Additional color will be helpful there? John C. Molina:  Sure, Tom. This is John. I think one of the important things is, we\u2019re waiting for a contract language. So while there are a couple of states Utah and Michigan, where the legislature has passed budget appropriations to cover the fee and the gross app, we\u2019re not going to recognize that revenue until they get a contract amendment. Thomas A. Carroll \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Company:  Okay. And then just to clarify one other thing, did your prior guidance also excludes of all these spending? John C. Molina:  Yes. Thomas A. Carroll \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Company:  So it did, your prior. I guess one when was that I\u2019m just trying to figure out when that \u2013 when you excluded that was in your Investor Day? John C. Molina:  That wasn\u2019t Investor Day. Thomas A. Carroll \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Company:  Okay very good. And then is there any comment you could \u2013 you were hesitant to comment on first quarter bouts of all the spending, but may be and I appreciate the comments about telling, is there any kind of order of magnitude description you could give to us kind of first quarter into second quarter? Joseph Mario Molina :  Yeah, this is Mario. I don\u2019t want to quantify that. Certainly the spending in the second quarter was greater than the first quarter. We request for the drugs seem to plateus, so we think that that\u2019s going to flat now. And, I think that part of that is an expectation if there are new drugs in the pipeline and so some positions maybe waiting for those new treatments. Thomas A. Carroll \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Company:  Okay, thanks for that. Operator :  Our next question comes from the line of Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Andy Schenker \u2013 Morgan Stanley :  Hi, it\u2019s Andy Schenker, thanks for the question. I\u2019m just following up on the some falsy comments there. I mean you previously highlighted obviously we got the team in Florida. You guys had acknowledged it and these Texas acknowledged that the drug wasn\u2019t in rates. I mean how are those conversations going with Texas that reimbursement as they are specifically going forward and how your conversation and the other states potentially is going to pay retro actively and then as your expectation, it will be in rates when they renew? Joseph Mario Molina :  As a whole lot of questions here, Andy. John C. Molina:  Yeah, I\u2019m not aware that any worth playing pays retro actively I think that states are talking about what they can do on a prospective basis and I think that what I would say is it\u2019s all over the math, every state is taking a slightly different approach to this and I think they are building that into the rates for next year. As I stated in my remarks earlier a big part of our concern is not just above all of, but all the other specialty drugs and I think that the governments needs to step in here and make sure that the market is rationale. If we as a health plan with rate increase, we have to go to our regulators and get it approved. There is no such thing going on in the pharmaceutical market. Right now, pharmaceutical companies can charge whatever they want and I think there need to be rational basis for all this. If we\u2019re going to cover all of these people, all these uninsured people, the only way to do that is by bringing down healthcare costs and we can\u2019t do that if we see a large number of specialty drugs that sell at the medical trend. So it\u2019s a problem not only for Medicaid companies, but it\u2019s going to be a problem for Medicare, for the VA and for commercial plans. This is truly a national problem that\u2019s going to affect everyone. Andy Schenker \u2013 Morgan Stanley :  And just following-up, on your states that are off talented to fiscal year rate increases, any updates on how those rate discussions are progressing? John C. Molina:  We generally don\u2019t talk about how rates are progressing until we actually get rate manuals, rate sheets et cetera. But as Mario said, it does run the (indiscernible) from folks like Florida doing payment to others are going to increase the rates as certain percentage specifically for Sovaldi or our specialty drugs like Sovaldi. Andy Schenker \u2013 Morgan Stanley :  I think and also just beyond on Sovaldi just in general how discussions are trending? John C. Molina:  I think that with the discussions on the ACA fee and Sovaldi, those have sort of taken the forefront. So there hasn\u2019t been a lot of discussion yet about base volume trends other than for Sovaldi et cetera. I think that now that we\u2019re getting that populations in the MMPs getting in the Medicaid expansion, getting some data, will some of those discussions and trends to the forefront. Andy Schenker \u2013 Morgan Stanley :  Okay, thanks. Operator :  (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please proceed. Ana Gupte \u2013 Leerink Partners :  Thanks, good evening. Appreciate for taking my question. I wanted to do get some qualitative color if you can offer it at this point on the Medicaid expansion lives as far as the venue or the site that they are presenting themselves. What types of services are they seeking? And you think about the premiums of about 50% to 200% higher depending upon with state you are in. And do you think there is adequate rates in there to cover maybe the upfront our patient pharmacy emerging you know those types of costs for potentially untreated, unmanaged patients. Joseph Mario Molina :  Ana, this is Mario. As I said before, the patients are older than our typical tenant members, but I still think it\u2019s early for us to be making statements about the rates or the place of service or the kinds of services that they are getting. I mean for example we picked up a 100,000 members from the first quarter to the second quarter, and so I don\u2019t feel that we have enough claims data yet to be making those kinds of statements beginning into lot of the member characteristics or healthcare patents yet, I think its developing and, we\u2019re just going to have to watch it and maybe we can update you on that in future quarters, but right now it\u2019s probably to assume. Ana Gupte \u2013 Leerink Partners :  And then the hospitals I think some of them are talking about, expecting the outpatient care might trend down and it eventually transition to the inpatient setting or you has a health plan taking any step to get primary care interventions or anything of that nature, is this just going to kind of happen relatively unmanaged and they end up in the ER and so the plans don\u2019t really have that much control over what happen? John C. Molina:  Well, we certainly hope that this is not going to be on Managed Care, that\u2019s sort of what we\u2019re here for. And we are trying to manage the patients as best we can. As Terry mentioned for a lot of the patients we\u2019re doing initial health assessments, we\u2019ve got all kinds of care managers, John talked about the investments we made in Illinois. Across the board and this is reflected in our admin costs, we staffed up and you saw a lot of that infrastructure growth last year. So I wouldn\u2019t say that this is just going to develop in an unmanaged fashion. We\u2019re learning as we go. We will try to continue to improve on the method of care for these numbers, but I\u2019m hoping that the tools we have will help us to manage them. Ana Gupte \u2013 Leerink Partners :  And then with the States, at the point when you and the states together can make decision as to whether the rates were adequate or in excess or too little. Let\u2019s assume they were excessive. Do you think the states will manage the margins to where they think they should be through a risk corridor, MLR floor type mechanism or on top of that there may be some rate adjustments? And if there were rate adjustments, do you think the states will use the expansion population in the federal subsidies to manage against their budgetary constraints in other areas that (indiscernible) that type of thing? John C. Molina:  Ana, this is John. I am not sure how a state could do what you\u2019re discussing in terms of the last point. These are federal dollars, so I don\u2019t know how the state could use it for their budget issues. There are number of states that have caps and floors with respect to the expansion populations, but the rates for the expansion populations have to actuarially sound. And so as we get data in on demographics and utilization, we\u2019ll have discussions with the states on what the appropriate rates are. Joseph Mario Molina :  Yes, Ana, I think that\u2019s an important point that John just made. In addition because of these sort of rate quarters that we have in lot of the contracts, there is some additional mitigation that you don\u2019t see. We set aside money for claims that have been incurred but not received yet but there is also risk quarter or mitigation factors that will help us as well. Ana Gupte \u2013 Leerink Partners :  And then we last talked I think there was something about a rate change in July, did that actually materialize and then California I might have just missed that all together but. Joseph Mario Molina :  California is looking at rates per certain counties in July but I don\u2019t know haven\u2019t seen them all yet and don\u2019t know what the impact on the expansion if any is. Ana Gupte \u2013 Leerink Partners :  And then finally just on duals with the opt-outs that you\u2019re seeing any sort of selection in that opt-out equation where the more acute care utilizes for the Medicare portion of this some more likely to opt-out because they get more unmanaged usage of that sort of (indiscernible). Joseph Mario Molina :  Well, we really don\u2019t know. What I\u2019d say as this. The members opt-out is a voluntary choice on their part. And we don\u2019t have a lot of insight into things like what their prior care or what your health status today at a time they are opting out. We really don\u2019t any get an information as to why they opt-out. It\u2019s really anecdotal information that we get. We suspect based on our experience with the dual eligible special needs plans, that a big driver of this are the providers and the provider network that we have. But I can't give you that kind of detail as to who\u2019s opting out and why and what their patterns of utilizations are, that\u2019s just something we don\u2019t have any insight into. Ana Gupte \u2013 Leerink Partners :  And if I could seek on last follow-up on that point you made, do you do any outreach to these other same people so that you know who you\u2019re reaching out to and trying to keep and retain within the system either through the provider base or any other channel. Joseph Mario Molina :  The moment that we are allowed to reach out to these members, we do so. Ana Gupte \u2013 Leerink Partners :  Okay, all right. I appreciate the color. Operator :  Our next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna International Group. Please proceed. Christian Rigg \u2013 Susquehanna International :  Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I just want to sort of kind of dumb down the guidance for the year and make sure I understand what exactly the message is. The year-to-date EPS is $0.26, the normalized for the health annualized was about $0.60 and then the taxes issue annualized about $0.24, but it gives you to roughly a $1.20 which leaves you $0.45 to $0.95 from your guidance. I guess is the message on the low end, do you think you can get there just on G&A improvement and then to get to the upper end we need to see the MLRs come down a bit? Joseph Mario Molina :  This is John. I hate to make it that (indiscernible). As we\u2019ve discussed, there is a lot of moving parts. But I think if you want to characterize it that way, I would think that just bringing the G&A down, that would get us beyond the low end. Christian Rigg \u2013 Susquehanna International :  Okay. And then, the DCP remained at an elevated level here from the first quarter and I guess I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for what\u2019s the right level to think about as we move into the back half of the year or maybe just a little bit longer term. Joseph W. White:  Joe speaking. Are you asking about what\u2019s the right level for DCP is? Christian Rigg \u2013 Susquehanna International :  Yes, I mean it looks like there is some conservatism baked into that and you\u2019re not alone in the industry at this point, but I\u2019m just trying to figure out where you think that shakes out overtime. Joseph Mario Molina :  We don\u2019t put a lot of stock in DCP, but I think you can expect it come down a day or two as the population mature, we work through our client backlogs and we get more confidentially where we are in terms about cost estimation. Christian Rigg \u2013 Susquehanna International :  Okay. And then my last question or questions, I guess the health insurance fee and the remuneration for that, is that still a split like an (indiscernible) split between the states and the fed\u2019s picking up most of that on behalf of the states? Joseph Mario Molina :  It is a split. Part of it is contributed by the state, part of it is contributed by the feds. Christian Rigg \u2013 Susquehanna International :  Right and then I mean this is kind of crazy, but then when you think about Texas and sort of where they are cortically, big rate of governor who seems to low everything about the ACA, is there any political element in your mind with regard to them not agreeing, you have to remunerate that because they may just say, hey we don\u2019t care, it\u2019s a federal tax and we don\u2019t want any part of it. Joseph Mario Molina :  Well, what I would say about that is, that we have a very good relationship with the Health and Human Services Commission. And we have dialogue with them as do the other health plans. I would not describe a lot of political mode of do anything at this point. Christian Rigg \u2013 Susquehanna International :  Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator :  And our final question comes from the line of Brian Wright with Sterne Agee. Please proceed. Brian Wright \u2013 Sterne Agee :  Thanks, and I apologize I may have missed this. But could you talk a little bit about the sequential move in Michigan on the MLR to just give us some understanding to what happen there? Joseph W. White:  Hey, Brian, it\u2019s Joe speaking. That\u2019s one of those mechanical developments in terms of how 12/31 changed, if that combined and again the numbers are small and consolidated but they are relative to some revenue adjustments on Medicare there. Brian Wright \u2013 Sterne Agee :  Okay. Joseph W. White:  Not significant enough to move the needle consolidated but they can impact on the health plan. Brian Wright \u2013 Sterne Agee :  Okay, thank you. Operator :  Dr. Molina, there are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you. J. Mario Molina :  Well, thank you all for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you with our next quarter results. Operator :  Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s conference call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Thank you and have a great day.",

Joseph Mario Molina : Thank you, Juan Jos\u00e9, and hello, everyone. Our performance this quarter is consistent with what we discussed at our Investor Day in September. We continue to operate in a very dynamic environment, one that has brought us a tremendous amount of growth in a short period of time. Our premium revenue, which has been fueled by unprecedented enrollment gains, now stands at $6.4 billion on a year-to-date basis and $200 million more than we booked in all of 2013. To put our growth in perspective, it took our company approximately 23 years to grow to 500,000 members. This year, we added nearly 500,000 members in the first 3 quarters alone. But that's not all, we now expect to add an additional 500,000 members in the next 9 months. This makes for an exciting time for our company. A time filled with exceptional growth opportunities that are already contributing to a dramatic expansion. 2/3 of our new enrollment this year has come from Medicaid expansion lives led by California, Ohio and Washington. The remaining 1/3 has come from initiatives that are even more significant to our long-term growth. The expansion of our geographic footprint and the addition of new programs for the chronically ill. We expanded our footprint, adding South Carolina and Illinois. Our Florida health plan began rolling out the new Managed Medicaid Assistance or MMA program in August. The Florida health plan was involved in 2 acquisitions : one in Palm Beach; and one in the Jacksonville service area. The Jacksonville transition is now approved for transition of members starting on December 1, 2014, and we anticipate that approximately 65,000 members will be transitioned to become Molina members. In terms of programs for the elderly and disabled, many of whom are chronically ill, we have also implemented dual eligible contracts in California, Illinois and Ohio, as well as new long-term care contracts in Florida and New Mexico. Last, we began selling marketplace products in 9 of our states, and we've learned a great deal from this experience over the past year. Collectively, the coordination of all these new programs combined with Medicaid expansion represents the largest and fastest integration in the history of our company. With this growth environment as a backdrop, it is not surprising that our top line revenue growth has been excellent. Administrative costs are also tracking just as we expected. We continue to reap the benefit of the investments in infrastructure that we made last year. As a matter of fact, our year-to-date admin ratio of 8.2% is 160 basis points lower than last year, and our third quarter admin rate of 7.2% is the lowest in 5 years. This has contributed to the doubling of pretax income when you compare the third quarter of 2014 to the third quarter of 2013. We are positioned to continue capitalizing on this growth, and we are fully aware that short-term issues are the price we pay for long-term success. So let's talk about some of the factors that are having a greater impact on our short-term profitability. They include the delays in revenue recognition, the programmatic challenges of integrating a new managed care business and a difficult rate environment across many of our states. I will now expand on each of these factors. First, the delay in revenue recognition has affected our financial results throughout the year. Specifically, the delay in recognition of the health insurer fee and the quality incentive revenue under our contract with the State of Texas have yet to be fully resolved. With respect to the health insurer fee, as of today, the company has a formal commitment for the reimbursement of about 60% of the 2014 fee, including tax effects. Most of the shortfall relates to our California, New Mexico and Texas health plans. Unreimbursed health insurer fees from California, New Mexico and Texas plus unreimbursed tax effects of the fee from Michigan and Utah amounts to $50 million in total for all of 2014. To date, we have paid $89 million related to the health insurer fee to the Internal Revenue Service, with $81 million related to Medicaid and $8 million related to Medicare. Even though we received informal acknowledgments from California, New Mexico and Texas, that they are responsible for reimbursing the fee. So far, they have not made formal commitments. We continue to believe that this represents a timing issue and that all of our states will ultimately fund the fee. However, we are less certain that they will formally commit to doing so before the year-end. Finally, to secure formal commitments to reimburse the fee -- I'm sorry, failure to secure formal commitments to reimburse the fee will delay revenue recognition, and we can expect that some states will not provide such formal commitments until next year. Let me remind you, as we talked about at our Investor Day, our 2014 guidance assumed that we would be able to book 100% of the fee during the current year. So the inability to recognize any portion of the $50 million in reimbursement, not yet secured, will represent a shortfall from our guidance. Our other major barrier to revenue recognition is related to quality incentives in Texas. You will recall that we have about $35 million of potential quality revenue in Texas for the full year and that our 2014 guidance includes full recognition of this amount. We have yet to receive clear direction from the state as to how some of these quality measures will be calculated. So far this year, we have recorded only $8 million of that revenue. To the extent that we do not receive clear guidance by year-end, we will not record the full amount of Texas quality revenue. As with the health insurer fee, the outcome of this matter will have a direct effect on our performance versus guidance in 2014. The second factor impeding profitability in 2014 has to do with implementing new managed care programs and the challenges involved in caring for those with chronic health conditions that result in higher medical costs. Currently, our medical costs are trending slightly higher than we anticipated, and we expect this trend to continue as we bring on additional enrollment in the near future. You may recall the large-scale migrations from fee-for-service to managed care that we implemented for the TANF and ABD populations in Ohio, for ABD in California or in managed care expansion for STAR+ programs in Texas in 2012. These implementations resulted in short-term margin compression due to medical cost volatility. Over time, and with the help of medical management initiatives, these programs stabilized and began contributing to earnings as the medical care ratio declined. The implementation of a new managed care program is further complicated by the complex needs of our new members. The care model for chronically ill requires skill, patience and persistence. Frequently, it requires educating both members and physicians about the most appropriate ways to access healthcare services. It requires hard work in assessing the health condition of new members, developing care plans for patients with complex conditions, ensuring that their home environments are supportive of good health and constant follow-up to coordinate care among medical, behavioral health and personal care; providers. In many cases, it is difficult to even locate and establish contact with our new members. Many of you will recall that Terry spoke at length to these issues when we were in New York City last month. Among her lessons learned was that the chronically ill require more intensive management than even we anticipated. We have spoken many times over the past year about the growth in the number of members receiving long-term services and supports or LTSS. We have also discussed how on a percentage basis profit margins on LTSS are generally lower than those on the acute medical benefits, providing us with very little wiggle room. Despite these challenges, we remain confident in our ability to improve medical margins over time. First, as members become acclimated to managed care and enrollment decelerates, we would expect medical cost come down. Second, we have proven in the past that our medical management and care coordination efforts are successful in reducing medical cost over time. A third factor is per-member per-month premium revenue. Premium rate increases have not kept up with medical inflation. We have had success in addressing inadequate premium rates before. One need only look to the experience of our California health plan to see the dramatic effect that even modest rate increases can have on our financial performance. We remain optimistic that the revenue recognition issues associated with the health insurer fee and the spike in medical cost will improve over time. The adequacy of premium rates is an ongoing challenge in our industry. We will continue to support actuarial soundness, but we need more transparency into the states' rate setting process. We continue to seek new market opportunities that are consistent with our mission and strategy. This month, Molina was selected by the Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration to operate the Commonwealth's Medicaid-funded government health program in the East and Southwest regions. We are pleased to have been selected, and we look forward to working closely with local providers in order to satisfy readiness requirements. Under the government health program, the new model of care in Puerto Rico will integrate medical and behavioral healthcare services under a single managed care organization in each region. Molina Healthcare's total expected enrollment opportunity in the 2 regions is about 350,000 members, with expected annualized revenues of approximately $750 million. The program currently covers 1.4 million beneficiaries across Puerto Rico and is expected to begin in April 2015. Along with continuing to pursue opportunities for the future, we continue to focus on providing high-quality, cost-effective care for our members. For our company, quality is a strategic priority. We therefore consider it a great achievement that, for 10 consecutive years, our health plans have been nationally ranked by NCQA for providing quality care. This year, 9 of our health plans were ranked by NCQA among the best Medicaid health plans in the United States. Our Medicaid plans in New Mexico, Utah and Washington are the highest-ranked plans in their respective states. Providing our members with access to quality care, continues to be our top priority today, just as it has been for the last 34 years. The third quarter 2014, much like the first and second quarters, faced many of the headwinds we have been talking about all year. Nevertheless, we have more than doubled our pretax income when compared to the third quarter of last year. We have not reached all of our goals and we will not reach them over night, but we are certainly making progress. Now I'd like to turn the call over to John. John C. Molina: Thank you, Mario, and hello, everyone. Diluted net income per share doubled to $0.33 during the third quarter of 2014 compared to $0.16 per diluted share during the third quarter of 2013. Adjusted net income and adjusted EPS from continuing operations increased to $0.83 per diluted share this quarter compared to $0.71 during the same quarter a year ago. During the third quarter, we maintained the strong enrollment and revenue growth we saw in the first half of the year and improved our administrative cost performance markedly. In summary, premiums and administrative costs are tracking consistently with our expectations. Our medical care ratio is tracking slightly above our expectations, which is creating some pressure on our bottom line. First, I'll talk about revenue. Total revenue this quarter reached $2.5 billion, fueled by increases in both membership and per-member per-month premium. During the third quarter, enrollment grew across all of our products. Let me provide you with some enrollment highlights. Medicaid expansion enrollment was strong and grew over 80,000 members this quarter to 315,000, a 35% increase. Not only does our current Medicaid expansion enrollment significantly exceed the enrollment guidance we provided, but the number of expansion members we have added so for this year exceeds the total membership we added in 2012 and 2013 combined. And we are encouraged by recent studies published by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Modern Healthcare, that suggests we may continue to see more Medicaid expansion enrollment growth in 2015. In addition, other states continue to review expanding their Medicaid programs. For example, last week, the State of Utah announced that it has come to terms with CMS on a Medicaid Expansion program. Enrollment also grew dramatically in Florida and Illinois. The Florida health plan added 40,000 members during their third quarter. In addition, once the Jacksonville transaction closes in December, we anticipate that approximately 65,000 members will transfer to Molina. In Illinois, we began participating in the managed care program for TANF and expression patients in August, and our enrollment in that state grew by 15,000 members in the third quarter. Illinois TANF and expansion enrollment is still growing, and we anticipate our membership will increase by 60,000 members in the fourth quarter. I want to take a moment to highlight that combined 125,000 members, that we are expecting from Florida and Illinois during the fourth quarter, is the equivalent of adding another entire state. As a point of comparison, our health plan in South Carolina currently has 118,000 members. We launched Medicare Medicaid Plans or MMPs in California, Illinois and Ohio. At September 30, we served over 14,000 MMP members. These are members for whom we provide both Medicare and Medicaid benefits. At September 30, we also served over 20,000 MMP-eligible members in California and Ohio for whom we provide only Medicaid benefits. Over 80% of MMP-eligible members, for whom we provide only Medicaid benefits, are in Ohio. MMP-eligible members in Ohio are not yet assigned by default to a managed care provider for Medicare coverage. Only those who actively choose or opt-in to receive an integrated offering are enrolled as fully integrated MMP members. Passive enrollment of members into an integrated program is not slated to begin in Ohio until 2015. Setting aside the technicalities of enrollment, fully integrated MMP members have contributed almost $95 million to premium revenue in the 9 months ended September 30, 2014, while MMP-eligible members receiving only Medicaid benefits from Molina contributed another $95 million. Despite the rapid ramp-up in revenue, we have had some revenue-related issues this year. The most significant, of course, has been our inability to recognize as revenue the full reimbursement we believe we are owed from state Medicaid agencies for the ACA health insurer fee. To reiterate what Mario said, we have about $50 million of health insurer fee revenue for the full year of 2014 that we have not been able to recognize, even though all of the state Medicaid agencies have informally committed to full reimbursement, including tax effects. Without a formal commitment from those states, principally California, New Mexico and Texas, we will not be able to book any of the remaining $50 million this year. There is still the uncertainty surrounding the Texas quality revenue. We have about $35 million in potential quality revenue in Texas for all of 2014. Through September 30, we recognized only $8 million of that revenue. Unfortunately, we continue to await further clarification from the state. And given this late date, we are doubtful that we'll be able to recognize the full amount of our Texas quality revenue during 2014. Now let's move on to medical costs. I want to emphasize 3 points. First, the company's transition to a chronic care focus makes meaningful comparisons to last year's results difficult. As we've said before, premiums for long-term services and supports, or LTSS, are much greater than those for acute medical benefits. But the percentage margins for administrative costs and profit built into those rates is much lower than that for traditional medical benefits. Through September 30, 2014, we have recorded premium revenue of about $1.1 billion tied to members who are eligible for LTSS compared to only $700 million for the first 9 months of 2013. This 57% growth in LTSS revenue resulted in an increase to our medical expense ratio of 1.2% in the third quarter of 2014. To further demonstrate how our financial measurements are changing, despite the fact that our medical care ratio increased by 3% during 2014, our medical margin, as measured in dollars, increased by 8%. Again, as our business continues to grow and become more complex, we will be exploring new methods of presentation that better capture these characteristics. We find geographic descriptions are less informative than product descriptions. Second, as Mario pointed out, flat to very low rate increases across the company's traditional Medicaid business have resulted in higher medical ratio. Third, lack of coordination in the design of profit caps and medical cost floors in some of our contracts is resulting in counterproductive outcomes. In some instances, givebacks due to profitable performance in one product cannot be offset against losses in other products. We believe the resulting asymmetric assignment of risk is unfair to health plans and counterproductive to the goal of Medicaid programs to ensure access to care for all beneficiaries. For example, at our Washington health plan, adjustments to premium revenue as a result of minimum medical loss ratio requirements for the Medicaid expansion population, reduced income before taxes by approximately $17 million for the third quarter of 2014 and $23 million for the 9 months ended September 30, 2014. Simultaneously, the Washington health plan incurred a medical care ratio in excess of 100% for its aged, blind and disabled members. However, we are unable to offset profits from our Medicaid expansion contract against our ABD contracts. The Washington health plan is therefore left in a position where it must return profits under its Medicaid expansion contract, while it receives no relief from losses incurred under its ABD contract despite very little differences between the 2 programs. In a similar manner, our New Mexico health plan received a new contract provision, limiting profits on retroactively added members, which reduced income before taxes by approximately $6 million for the 9 months ended September 30, 2014. At the same time, the New Mexico health plan's LTSS program operated at a medical care ratio in excess of 100%. In reviewing our overall medical cost performance, I'll remind you of what we have said in the past. 2014 and 2015 will be years of rapid growth, while 2016 will be a year of stabilization. Stabilization and margin expansion will come as we integrate new member into our care models. Our past experiences in Ohio and California, where we have thrived in difficult situations by both managing care and getting appropriate premiums, gives us confidence as we look to the future. We continue to achieve greater administrative cost leverage. At our Investor Day event in 2013, we communicated how we were investing in infrastructure to support our growth, driving administrative costs as a percentage of revenue up to over 10% last year. Earlier this year, we discussed our expectations related to administrative costs for 2014. As expected, our administrative costs as a percentage of revenue have declined significantly during 2014 as our revenue has surged. General and administrative expenses were 7.2% for the third quarter of 2014, a decrease from 8.4% in the second quarter of 2014. We remain confident in the target of about 8% for the whole year of 2014. During the third quarter of 2014, the Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations related to compensation deduction limitations applicable to certain health insurance insurers. Pursuant to these final regulations, the company recorded a tax benefit during the third quarter of 2014 of approximately $7 million for periods prior to the third quarter of 2014. Days in claims payable this quarter increased by 4 to 50 days. As of September 30, 2014, the company had cash and investments of around $2.4 billion, including approximately $347 million at the parent. And cash flow from operating activities was very strong through September 30 at $841 million. We now believe that our earnings per diluted share and our adjusted earnings per diluted share may fall below the low end of the ranges included in our previously issued 2014 guidance. This is because, as we have disclosed in the past, our inability to fully recognize the ACA insurer -- health insurer fee revenue and the Texas quality revenue in 2014, along with medical care costs that are trending higher than we anticipated, as compared with our most recent full year 2014 estimates and the impact of certain contractual provisions that limit our ability to retain profits. At our Investor Day in 2012, we embarked on an ambitious plan to double our revenue, decrease our administrative ratio and increase our margin. We are well underway to accomplishing the first 2 of these goals. We have consistently stated that we're focused on this long-term plan and that investors should not be distracted by quarterly fluctuations that are inevitable. We remain just as excited about our prospects today, as we were when we announced that plan. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sarah James with Wedbush. Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division : I just wanted to get a little bit more color on what changed in your expectations. It sounds like the majority of it was just the 2 timing issues. I wanted to understand if it wasn't for the health insurance fee in Texas now looking more like the '15 than '14 event. Could you have maintained guidance? Or was there really something that changed inter-quarter on your understanding of the ability to net contracts and the state against each other when looking at profit caps? John C. Molina: Look, Sarah, I think that there's a couple of things there. First of all, as you said, the majority of the disconnect is the timing on both Texas quality revenue and health insurer fee. Those combined are close to $70 million, almost $80 million. Then we had the Washington settlement in the third quarter, which was a drag of $11 million. And I think that the impact of the inability to net the profits is an issue. Did we know about it early on? I think we did, theoretically. We just didn't understand the impact and we certainly did not know about the take back in New Mexico, where the retroactive membership was capped at basically a 95% MCR, leaving very little room for profit there. Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division : Got it. If I kind of just look at the -- what the clean numbers or run rate if I'm taking out those timing issues with the ACA fee, Texas, Washington payment that doesn't repeat. And you've mentioned before an SG&A number that wasn't matched timing-wise. I'm kind of getting close to $1.36 or so of nonrepeating headwinds. So when I think about go forward, the outlook, it looks a lot brighter going forward. John C. Molina: Well, I think, as I said, we are excited by our prospects. We've got some very good revenue growth momentum. We've got Puerto Rico coming on next year, admin costs are coming down, just like we expected. So now it's a matter of us trying to work with the states on correcting some of these contract issues, getting some premium rate increases. As Mario said, for the base businesses, it's been a struggle in most of the states to get what we think are adequate rates. But yes, we think that we're in good position right now. Operator : Our next question comes from Christian Rigg with Susquehanna International Group. Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : I just want to make sure I understand sort of the EPS in the quarter. So GAAP was $0.33, you've got $0.07 from the HIF, $0.05 from Texas quality, $0.14 from Washington penalty payment and then another sort of $0.15 benefit from the retroactive adjustment on the nondeductible comp tax issue. That gets me to about $0.44. Is that kind of the right way to think about it, maybe $0.01 or $0.02 lower for the in-quarter contribution from the nondeductibility of the comp? John C. Molina: Joe is adding up the numbers right now as we speak. You're a little bit faster on your arithmetic than he is. Joseph W. White: Yes, Chris, I think that's definitely a good way to look at it. Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Okay. And then on the G&A absolute costs, my model I expected a similar amount of leverage. But obviously, I was a little higher than top line. But on an actual dollar amount, the G&A expenses declined fairly meaningfully quarter-to-quarter. Can you give us a sense for what drove that? Joseph W. White: It's Joe speaking again, Chris. It's a variety of things. I wouldn't expect that decline. I would just -- I wouldn't expect that decline to repeat in the fourth quarter as we gear up for Puerto Rico, and we consider what advertising investments we want to make, leading into 2015 enrollment for marketplace. It's -- I guess I would just say that the spending has its own cycles. And this quarter, we were just down a little bit. We're still -- I think John mentioned in his remarks, we're still -- we're not changing the overall guidance to 8% for the year. So I would just stick with what we talked about since February in terms of admin spend. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Barclays. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division : So I just want to dig into the medical cost issue, because that seems to be the one that is not timing-related, so -- and I feel like I've asked this in the past on certain situations like this. But I guess, which medical costs specifically are coming in higher? And maybe you can help us with your diligence process on when you're taking on some of these new contracts, especially some with high acuity. Do you use consultant actuaries? I'm just curious how you guys come up with sort of expectations, especially for these new populations. And again, maybe help us with which buckets have been the most surprising. John C. Molina: Sure, Josh. This is John. I think the 2 or 3 areas that have the most meaningful, in terms of the MCR, would be the LTSS in New Mexico. Now we were given data from the state from New Mexico. That was a rate bid within a band. We were either the highest or the second highest in terms of what we bid. So given everything that we saw from the state, our actuaries and outside actuaries, we felt pretty good about that and it's still running in excess of 100%. We think the state just made some errors in some of their assumptions when they gave us the rate; most notably, the challenges of getting out and reaching all these members. I think secondarily, you've got the HOBD, or the blind and disabled, up in Washington. And what happened there was, again, we bid right in line with all the other managed care players using our actuaries, and I believe some consulting actuaries, and we were fine on the -- on that program in 2013. But again, the state then cut the rates because they assumed greater managed care savings than we told them we could get, and I think that all health plans expected to get. And it was a bit similar to the situation in Texas, where the actuaries in the state put it assumptions that are too aggressive. The state also included psychotropic and other high-cost drugs, but didn't give us the tools to manage that. And I think that cost us somewhere in the neighborhood of $1 million through 9 months. So like I say, some of these are programmatic things. I know that Florida looks a little bit out of the line. The MMA, new MMA members are coming in, I think, for the most part, in line. But you've got a pretty significant amount of the real high-cost nursing home patients there. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. So I mean, I guess my real question is you've got 5 states running MLRs over 90% at this point. So what's the response? I mean, growth is obviously important and helpful long term, and we're certainly willing to see growing pains, et cetera. But just when do you make a decision? I don't remember the last time Molina exited a program. So I mean, is there a point you're talking about chronic multiyear underpayment? Do you have to sort of put your foot down on any of these states and just say, enough is enough? John C. Molina: Well, I think that the ones that had the most impact are Washington, certainly because of how large it is. And I think we've talked a little bit about the issues in Washington and some potential remedies. There's really not much different in terms of looking at the membership profiles of the ABD population in Washington and the expansion population. They're very close in age, they're very close in utilization, et cetera. Why not offset one line of business with the other? In Texas, that's over 90%. But a good chunk of that, of course, is the unrecognized revenue. Utah has traditionally grown very well. I think that's more of a Medicare issue, so that's why we're looking more at programs than geographies in the future. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. Can I just ask one quick on the tax rate? What's your expected tax rate going forward, now that you're no longer subject to that compensation deduction limitation? Joseph W. White: It's Joe speaking. I don't want to speak to 2015 yet, because this rate is very -- our effective tax rate is very much a product of what our pretax income is. So you, speaking just to the fourth quarter, Josh, a lot just goes to play out, it's just going to determine on whether we can pick up any of this ACA insurer fee revenue, if we can pick up any of this Texas quality revenue. If we don't pick that up, we're going to be left with a quarterly effective rate of probably between 60% and 65%. We have the issue of nondeductible expenses, which drive the effective rate up as pretax goes down. So worst case, it's somewhere north of 60%. If some of that insurer fee revenue comes in with the Texas quality revenue, it will be a little bit below that. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I guess I think I agree with the concept that the MLR is high, it's new business, and you guys just had a track record of bringing down MLR over time. I guess, a lot of times when we see companies view that there is investments in G&A to get there, how comfortable are you that the G&A run rate is what you need? That you don't have to rollout new medical management programs in certain states to really get the MLR where it needs to be. Joseph W. White: It's Joe speaking. I think we're pretty comfortable that there's not going to be a huge amount of spend on additional management. Bear in mind that we capture a lot of the med management cost in our MLR, that you'd see on the books right now. And that's part of what's driving the higher MLRs. We've talked before about how we've had to staff up in terms of med management care coordination staff. And that's still the case as we roll out the MMP plans and dive into things like Centennial Care in New Mexico and MMA in Florida. So I think, if anything we're going to see from a percentage basis, a little bit of moderation on the admin portion that's built into our MLR. Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Actually, if I can just ask one more. I guess I understand the comment about the rebate and the expansion states not being able to offset the other business, but I do believe that was kind of the point from the beginning. And it seems like the other companies that are -- reported Medicaid results, so far, really had pretty strong results broadly speaking. So I don't see that as a good explanation for why it was up. Because basically less new business is maximizing its earnings, which implies that the core business is the business that is not doing well. And to therefore break the core business, maybe into 2 buckets, I know one of your competitors does it this way what they think is interesting of kind of existing business versus new business. How much of the higher MLR would you say is really new business coming in higher versus existing business and having issues in any of the existing book of business? Joseph Mario Molina : Well, this is Mario. We are looking at changing the way we report. I think you sort of hit the nail on the head. You mentioned earlier that we don't think that a geographic approach, which is what we use when we are primarily a TANF is the best way to do this going forward. We talked about the areas where we really think we have medical cost issues. John mentioned those just a few minutes ago. So I don't think it's -- the other thing is, on the expansion side, the expansion membership has a much bigger impact with us than I think it does with most of the other companies, because we have had such a large expansion enrollment. So this is a bigger issue for us than it may be for some of them. Joseph W. White: Okay. And Kevin, if I could just add one technical -- this is Joe speaking, one technical point to that, I think John spoke to the fact that, for the quarter, the MLR is probably about 1.2% higher based on the new LTSS business we've added for the MMPs Florida -- sorry, Centennial Care and Florida. Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : So I guess, 1.2%, that could just be a mix shift issue rather than are you saying 1.2% higher just because it is high MLR business? Are you saying it's 1.2% higher, because that business is coming in higher than you thought? That's what I'm trying to get to, was it coming in higher than you thought? Joseph W. White: No doubt it's a -- no doubt there's a mix shift there. On the other hand, I think if you look historically, we do tend to run higher MCRs when we first enter programs. Just a result of margin build and conservatism and everything. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Carter with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Chris Carter : Could you just give us an update on how the opt-out rate for the duals is running versus the kind of 50% you previously talked about? Terry P. Bayer: Yes, this is Terry. We updated you in September at Investor Day that the opt-out rate is coming in where we expected. And we were conservative and estimated would be about 50% in that is what we're seeing thus far. Chris Carter : Got it. So no change. And then just on the California settlement agreement, can you just give us an update there in terms of where you stand in terms of that balance? Joseph W. White: Sure. It's Joe speaking. Just to put the numbers in sequence : quarter 1, we had $5 million recorded for that as receivable; quarter 2, that went to $9.5 million; third quarter, it's down to $3.5 million, which reflects, obviously, better performance in California. So at 9/30, $3.5 million is booked as a receivable of the $40 million available. Chris Carter : Okay. And then just maybe one more. I think you said over the next 9 months, you're going to add 500,000 members. I think, 350,000 is Puerto Rico. Can you maybe just break out for us the delta there? Joseph Mario Molina : Well, the rest is Illinois and Florida. We're picking up 65,000 members in Florida in December as a result of that acquisition, and then the continued growth in Illinois. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I was wondering if you could maybe characterize what your performance is like now with 9 months of visibility of expansion members. And how much specifically for that block it's varying state-by-state in where you have trouble or pressures in particular regions? John C. Molina: Well, it's interesting Matt, this is John. When you compare the populations across states, they're very similar in terms of the demographics. The folks are -- we're seeing a lot of chronic conditions for this population. But we're not seeing -- we didn't see the initial utilization pick up in places like California and Washington that we saw in Michigan and Ohio. We think a lot of this is just an educational and a timing issue that folks haven't used services early on here because they didn't know they were available to them, they didn't understand the program. If you look at a study that was just put out by The New England Journal of Medicine... Joseph Mario Molina : Yes, there was a paper. This is Mario. In The New England Journal of Medicine on October 23, a nice little 3-page article about the way that Michigan rolled out their new program for expansion. And some of the things they did, they put a lot of money up front into education, they were able to rapidly process and enroll people. And 36% of the patients that have enrolled have so far scheduled a primary care visit. So I think if you look at a state that's done it right, it was Michigan. I think states like California, where there have been problems with backlogs, have contributed to the lower utilization. But we think it's going to catch-up as people figure out that they've got insurance and they learn how to use it. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. And what about with respect to the adequacy of rates? I realized it's relative to the underlying costs that you're talking about. But now that you have the visibility that you do, do you feel significantly better about the expansion funding than you do? I mean, maybe it's just -- sorry, if you could just talk on that? Joseph Mario Molina : Yes. We believe that the rates are adequate. What we have a problem with is this asymmetric risk that we have in some of our contracts, where we have to return money where we're making profit and absorb losses in other contract areas when we're not. And that's part of the problem. We believe that these things should offset that the various product lines should all be evaluated together. But in terms of expansion, for the most part, we feel that the rates are adequate. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : And is there an element of which these, the asymmetrical nature of the contracts, caught you by surprise? Or has it just been something that you struggled with on an ongoing basis and now it's hurting enough that you're bringing it more to our attention in terms of its prominence? And maybe related to that, if you could just touch on the New Mexico situation. Because that one, in particular, sounded like it was a surprise to you. John C. Molina: Well, with respect to -- this is John. With respect to New Mexico, the surprise was the state implemented at on a retroactive basis, it wasn't part of the contract at the beginning of the year. So that was a surprise to us. I think that we did realize that there were profit caps and MCR floors, and Joe talked about that in the last Investor Day, is just typical of a much bigger bite in the third quarter than it had in the first 2. Joseph W. White: It's is Joe speaking. I'd like just to add, too. I think we're seeing more stark disparities for different populations than we have in the past. It's just been a bit -- it's been surprising how the rates had been off so much between different programs. I don't think we've seen that before. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Right. Over in some cases and under in others, yes. Joseph W. White: Yes. John C. Molina: And Matt, that suggests that, over time, each side will correct itself. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Drilling down a little bit more in Florida. Can you maybe talk about the pressures you saw? I guess you highlighted nursing home services. Is that in MMA or is that related to in long-term care services you've already been offering there and one of your competitors talked about potential rate relief for a long-term care going back to September 1. Maybe update us on your thoughts around that as well. Joseph W. White: Sure. It's Joe speaking, Andy. I'll start off with that question, or at least to get you started. A couple of observations. First, you remember, from an MMA perspective, we've only had these rates since July 1 and we have a very small population in Florida, which is something John alluded to in his remarks about how swings in some of these smaller states could be misleading. With that said, what we think we know now based on, again, all 3 months of data, our feeling is that while the MCR is high, it's not inconsistent with what we were expecting. We feel like pharmacy is pretty much within the tracks, within the range we expected it to be. We generally feel like both the Nursing Home and the Home and Community-Based Services are coming in as we've expected. We're seeing higher inpatient utilization, curiously enough, than we thought on the TANF side. So I wouldn't -- I don't think there's a whole lot to read into our Florida performance. We also, this quarter, have picked up about $2 million or $2.5 million of unfavorable prior period development from pretty far back in the calendar. And on a $100 million revenue base, that can be pretty distortive. So when Terry and I both spoke to Florida back at Investor Day in September, we talked about an MCR somewhere in the low 90s overall for that business, and I don't think we're seeing anything that would suggest it will be different. Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And on the long-term care side around potential updates on rates for September, anything? Joseph W. White: No, I don't think we have anything on it. I don't have anything on that, sorry. Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : And then clarifying on the tax update, the $7 million, is that for all of '13 and the first half of '14 there? Joseph W. White: Yes, that's correct. Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : And was it -- is it roughly even every quarter? Or is there lumpiness within those numbers? Joseph W. White: It's a little bit lumpy. It's -- about $6 million applies to last year. It has to do with the size of the executive comp we're expensing, which was higher last year. But essentially, it's about $6 million in '13 and then $1 million in the first half of this year. Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay, great. And then just a last one to squeeze in here. Any thoughts as we're heading into open enrollment here for the exchanges, obviously, not a major driver this year. But any thoughts about how that's going to change, maybe, heading into next year, you think? Joseph Mario Molina : Well, we were pretty conservative last year with our rates. And in a number of states, we've brought rates down to be more competitive. And I think that we are more competitive. Having things like the second lowest Silver or the cheapest Bronze plan in a number of markets. But remember that this is not going to be a big driver for our business. We've got 2.4 million Medicaid beneficiaries. We're going to add another 500,000 over the next 9 months. So while we think it's important from a strategic standpoint to put a toe in the water on the exchanges, the real drivers of our business are going to be Medicaid, Medicare duals, and that's not going to -- the exchanges are not going to make a huge contribution. Operator : Our next question comes from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : On -- the first question is on the DCP. You've raised it quite considerably. What are your plans to -- I mean, is that going to stay where it is? And how are you thinking about this? This is somewhat unusual... Joseph W. White: Ana, it's Joe speaking. We get a lot of questions about this over time. The best I can say on that is the DCP is a product of our -- of the reserve we set with our actuaries. We have a full process with an FSA employed by the company with a full team of actuaries who sets reserves every quarter. Those reserves are vetted by Ernst & Young. The way those shake out is the DCP shakes out from those reserve estimates. So I think it's fair to say we've got more liabilities. It's factual, we have more liabilities on the balance sheet than we have in the past, but we don't target the DCP specifically. My expectation is once these populations get established and we've addressed any kind of claims payment issues, which show up sometimes in the beginning of programs. We're going to drop back down into the mid-40s. I don't know when that will be though. Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : Okay. So for the purposes of 2014, you're staying at the 50. As I go back to what we were told at your Investor Day in September and look at the swing factors for what might be bringing your guidance down. It sounds like the biggest one is the MLR, obviously, stating such an obviously thing. And then the offset would be the tax rate. Everything else seems kind of within the noise, if you will. Would you say, I guess, and I'm listening to all of -- or looking at your news release and listening to your commentary, it feels like you're saying, structurally, your loss ratio is now trending upward. And it's not just about kind of one initial spike or anything, it's just that you're getting lower rates and you have pressures on your -- whatever profitability caps and so on. And so is that fair? I somehow kind of come out thinking, the Medicaid Expansion and potentially even duals, the rate setting was a little more fair, and so you might at least be neutral if not better. Joseph Mario Molina : Well, Ana, I think I would say that a little differently. I think what we tried to emphasize is that the -- we assumed that we would get 100% of the Texas pay-for-performance quality revenue and the health insurer fee. And those are things that are largely beyond our control, and we really thought this would be resolved by this time of the year. Now that we are nearly in November and they're still not resolved, we don't have as much confidence, and we tried to convey that to everyone. There is a slight upward trend in the MCR, and we tried to explain that. A lot of it has to do with certain contracts in certain states. I don't think that it's necessarily a overall widespread trend. I mean, you can really talk about this as 3 -- I think 3 major states that are a problem : Washington, Texas and New Mexico. And it has to do with issues around the expansion and the contracts, it has to do with the inability to offset givebacks and losses, and it has to do with the inability to recognize the insurer fee and the quality revenue. I think that a component of it is the medical care ratio. But medical care ratio is a ratio, it's not the medical cost per se, and that can be affected by a lot of things. And so when we're giving revenue back to states, it affects the MCR, but not because medical costs are rising or because we're having medical management difficulties. Certainly, over time, I think we can whittle these things down. You also have to remember, and I -- we haven't talked about this. But when you bring in a lot of these new populations like the duals and like Centennial Care, there are requirements to do initial health assessments, and often to make home visits. And a lot of this is an up front cost that we're bearing because of the large influx of new members. So that's been a strain. We've had lots of problems with eligibility in New Mexico. We are getting members retroactively back to January, they're coming on in October, and it's because the enrollment system that ACS built has been problematic. So anytime you have enrollment issues, and we've seen this in other states in the past, when they implemented new systems, it makes things very difficult for us. We need to know who's on the plan, when they're on the plan and where they live and how to reach them. And in some cases, we only know that for 1/3 of the members. Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : Okay. I don't want to belabor too much. One -- just one final point though. Should we -- as we think about past '14, which is, as you've said, a transition year, as we model '15, is it an okay thing? Or am I just being too optimistic to model like an 89%-ish ratio? Or should we kind of be thinking about 90.5%, 91% blended? John C. Molina: Come in February, Ana, and we'll clarify it for you. Operator : Our next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : I want to reframe it a slightly different way. What I hear you saying to, in several questions, is that there are a lot of fairly discrete large-dollar amount items that are subject to a signature, a negotiation, an agreement with the state, things that Dr. Molina, you just mentioned are kind of out of your control -- I guess, there, at least in your control, to put shoulder against the yield and continue to push. If you don't get them this year, I mean, what is a reasonable time frame for us to think about you're ultimately getting some of these things? And then secondly, when you do get them, do you expect that they will be retroactive back to the beginning of the period we've been measuring? Joseph Mario Molina : So yes, let me respond to that. I do think these things will be retroactive. We have had discussions with the state of Texas. They recognize that the health insurer fee is a legitimate cost and they believe there's an obligation to pay it. We know that the state of California is planning to submit a rate amendment for approval by CMS in November that will cover this period. The problem is, even if CMS were to do that, it often takes 60 to 90 days to get that amendment processed at the state, get the contracts signed and the check cut. So I think we will get paid. I'm just not sure that we're going to get paid in this year. The other problem we have is that while we have had communications with them, they haven't put it in writing sufficient that we can accrue the revenue. So it's not that we believe the revenue's not coming, and there's some big chunks of it out there, but this is mostly going to be a timing issue. Nevertheless, it will affect, from an accounting standpoint, the results for 2014 if we don't secure those written agreements before the end of the year. John C. Molina: And, Dave, this is John. Let me just follow up one thing. We have every confidence that on the HIF stuff, we're going to collect it, we don't want people to run wild if we collect $50 million in the first quarter of next year, for example, and think that's a run rate. So that's why we are downplaying a lot of these quarter-to-quarter fluctuations and looking out for the long term. David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Understood. Just a quick follow-up on that. The -- in your press release, your HIF fee collection or expectation for the fourth quarter actually drops from what you collected in the third quarter. Could you explain that for me? Joseph W. White: Sure. It's Joe speaking, Dave. I think we noted that in this quarter, Utah and Michigan caught up and, in effect, paid 75% or 9 months worth of that base fee. Not the tax effect, but the base fee. So there's a catch up in the quarter. David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then my final question kind of come. Sorry, go ahead. I was just saying my final... Joseph W. White: The one we're going to focus on is that $50 million still out there. David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay. Final question, coming back to kind of confidence of negotiations. Dr. Molina, what would -- how would you describe your confidence on negotiating with the states around these potential offsets relative to the confidence on collecting the HIF fee? Joseph Mario Molina : Well, I think that we enjoy good relationships with our state partners. And I think that they are unattended consequences of their actions, so I think that if there's strong policy arguments as to why these things should be changed. Any time you come in with new contracts and new programs or you expand populations, there are always unforeseen results. So I think there's a good chance that we can get some relief on these things. It just makes sense. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : I think we understand the HIF and the Texas quality payments and the Washington settlements going on. But I'd like to get what's causing the loss ratio to be higher? And how much higher is it? If I adjust for those 3 things in this quarter, I still come up with a loss ratio that's over 90%. So can you tell us what you were expecting in this quarter relative to sort of that 90%, 90.1% or so? John C. Molina: All right. So yes, Pete, I think that the -- one of the big drivers is the double whammy in the state Washington with the ABD population having a higher MCR. Now remember, while it was a net $11 million drag, it was really a $19 million unfavorable hit. And most of that, if not all of that, hit the ABD line. And so you have this ABD problem, and then we had the revenue reduction due to the giveback of $17 million? Joseph W. White: Correct. It's the adjustment for the MLR floor and Washington, Pete. That's $23 million year-to-date, but $17 million of that was in the third quarter. So if I were modeling, I might take that $23 million and spread it over 3 quarters rather than cram it all into the third quarter. John C. Molina: I think the other thing to note is that Washington does their calculations slightly differently for the expansion than the rest of the states in which we have contracts, and that does have some impact. We haven't quantified it yet, but we just know that the arithmetic is different. And then you've got New Mexico with both a higher LTSS. We thought that, that was going to come in a high 90s, not over 100%. And that is then exacerbated by the retroactive issues related to, as Mario said, the retroactive membership. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. I'll try that a little -- slightly different way. The stuff that can be resolved from a rate change that's not 1 of those, the 3 things that we've already talked about a lot, when do you expect those rate actions to potentially happen for you next year as opposed to just your normal regular way, improving the cost trend of the business and getting the new members to have lower loss ratios over time? What do you expect from rate actions to help you out, and when? Joseph W. White: Okay. We're having more rates come up Jan 1 than we did before. A lot of states have shifted it. So I think New Mexico has shifted. Washington, we're having those discussions right now. And whether or not we get rate increases or policy changes that have a similar effect, it's a little too early to tell right now. Joseph Mario Molina : Yes, this is Mario. I think if you look at what happened with California when they brought the ABDs in, for a long time, 1 year, 1.5 years, there was a lot of turmoil. But California eventually got it right. And if you look at the performance of the California health plan, there's been a dramatic change. And so you see what getting the rates right can do. But we need to work with the states' actuaries and some of their policy people to make them understand this. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then for Puerto Rico, what are you expecting for a loss ratio on that business when it first starts up with you? John C. Molina: We're not talking about Puerto Rico other than just the membership and the revenue, because that was put out by the Medicaid agency. We'll talk about other expectations probably in February. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And what were your Hep C costs in the quarter? Joseph Mario Molina : Yes, the Hep C costs are built into the pharmacy numbers that we reported. It hasn't been extraordinary. However, having said that, with this new drug being approved, I think a lot of doctors have been warehousing their patients waiting for an all-oral option, and I expect Hep C costs to rise. There was a letter that came from the financial association of Medicaid directors that went to the Senate Finance Committee asking for some sort of action to be taken. There's also a lot of concern being raised by people in corrections where the states are completely on the hook for the care of the patients there. And we're seeing a lot of people who are voicing a lot of concerns about how these drugs have been priced. So I think in the next year, you're going to see some action there. We also have some carve out arrangements in Florida and Washington which, I think, will be helpful. So all the states are looking at this. Everybody's scratching their head trying to figure out what to do, but I don't think it's going to go along status quo in 2015. Operator : Our next question comes from Carl McDonald with Citigroup. Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : So one follow-up on the Puerto Rico contract. You had some prior experience there where you were awarded the contract, didn't like the rates and ended up not participating. Is this contract finalized and you are comfortable with the planned reimbursement? Joseph Mario Molina : Well, first of all, I don't think the contract is finalized yet. And secondly, the previous procurement was withdrawn. So it wasn't a matter of we didn't like the rates, we didn't sign. We never got that far because the whole procurement was withdrawn. Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Got it. I actually -- as you responded, I realized I think I'm confusing you with -- Centene may have won a couple of RFPs ago and pulled out. So I'll just withdraw that question. The other question I had was on the compensation deduction, since there's no explicit piece of that, that excludes Medicaid plans or government plans generally, I'd just be interested in why you think the Medicaid business would be exempt from that and whether there's been any conversation with either Treasury or IRS or if it's just the opinion of the tax and legal advisers. Joseph W. White: It's Joe speaking. To your last question, no, there hasn't been any specific discussion with the IRS about this. The -- we feel like, no, the preamble to the final regs is pretty clear about how the de minimis test is going to be calculated. And what that de minimis test really comes down to, obviously, is a numerator and the denominator. And we are very confident the way we read the final regs that, that numerator would exclude Medicaid premiums. Now let me just say though that test for recognition of income tax expense is more likely than not. So Carl, this is not like a revenue recognition issue where the standard of recognition is near certainty. This is the more likely than not test. But we've spoken to our tax advisers. We've read the preamble of the final regs. We've read the final regs. We've been through the de minimis test, and we're confident we pass it. Joseph Mario Molina : And Carl, the auditors have bought off on this. And I think just our tradition of pretty conservative accounting should give you some comfort. Operator : That was our last question. I'll turn the call back to you, Mr. Orellana. Juan Jos\u00e9 Orellana : Well, thank you very much for listening to our quarterly call. We look forward to talking to you next time. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

As a reminder, given that our Investor Day presentation will take place this coming Thursday, where we will discuss the company\u2019s outlook for 2015. Today we will only be taking questions related to our earnings release. Our comments today will contain forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. All of our forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to numerous risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. A description of such risk factors can be found in our earnings release and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-K annual report, our Form 10-Q quarterly reports and our Form 8-K current reports. These reports can be accessed under the Investor Relations tab of our company website or on the SEC's website. All forward-looking statements made during today's call represent our judgment as of February 9, 2015, and we disclaim any obligation to update such statements except as required by securities laws. This call is being recorded, and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available at our company's website, molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Mario Molina. Mario Molina : Thank you, Juan Jos\u00e9. Hello, everyone and thanks for joining our discussion. I have just a few comments today, but I\u2019ll turn the call over to John who will delve into our financials in greater detail. I\u2019m pleased to report that 2014 was a year of continued success in delivering on our strategic objectives. When compared with 2013, our revenue grew by almost 50%, our enrollment increased 36%. We expanded our geographic footprint to new markets in South Carolina and Florida. And we achieved greater economies of scale as evidenced by the consistent decline in our administrative cost ratio throughout the year. Two years ago, at our Winner Investor Day, we shared with investors our plan to nearly double the size of the company by the end of 2015. Our milestones, for the quarter and the year confirmed that we have made considerable progress towards that end but more importantly that our goal is now clearly within our reach. Last month I had the opportunity to meet with many of our investors at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, to talk about the company and our strategy. As I shared in my presentation, the revenue and enrollment momentum that we generated throughout 2014 has carried forward into the first quarter of 2015. In January alone, our enrollment grew by nearly 200,000 members led by new marketplace and Medicaid expansion lives. While the actual enrollment gains in our dual-eligible plans have been overshadowed by the gains in our marketplace and Medicaid expansion plans. Let me remind everyone that the revenue impact of one dual-eligible member is comparable to adding almost five Medicaid expansion members or 10 traditional TANF members. The continued addition of members with dual and long-term services and supports benefits shifts our focus towards more chronic, home-health and long-term care services for these members, and away from nor episodic and acute medical conditions we have seen in our TANF members. Several years ago, I introduced a chart that nicely illustrated the market segmentation of our business in the form of a pyramid. Today I want to remind all of you that this chart is still applicable as much today as when it was first presented. While our mothers and children continue to form the foundation of our membership base, we have continued to move towards a more complex care by adding more elderly and disabled members that now include the duals and long-term care beneficiaries. The implementation of our duals and standalone long-term care contracts will allow us to continue to evolve our model of care for members with chronic medical conditions. While at the same time, refining our operational processes for the duals contracts in Michigan and Texas. As in aside, our duals contract in South Carolina became operational this month with voluntary enrollment. As I discussed last month during the conference, we continue to expect 2015 to look a lot like 2014. In 2014, we experienced rapid membership and revenue growth requiring the assimilation of new members across all lines of business. And we expect much or the same this year. While this growth may come with the usual set of growing pains, as we have seen in 2014, it adds tremendous opportunity for us to greatly expand our business. Harnessing this unprecedented growth is a key area of focus for us in the near future. We\u2019re very excited about the growth that we have seen this past year and with our successes in lowering the percentage of revenue spent on administrative cost. Staying true to the mission of our company and their values has allowed us to navigate through this exciting time. And we are looking forward to 2015 and to what the future holds for the company. I would now like to turn the call over to John. John Molina : Thank you, Mario and hello everyone. Although we did not meet our earnings expectations in 2014, we, did good on many of our commitments to revenue growth and a greater administrative efficiency. When we see you in New York on Thursday, we will talk more about how our work in 2014 has set the stage for continued growth and improved profitability in the future. Right now though, I want to focus on 2014. Today we reported full year earnings at $1.30 per diluted share on a GAAP basis, or $3.43 per diluted share on an adjusted basis. This represents an improvement of more than 35% on a GAAP basis from our earnings of $0.96 per diluted share reported for 2013. We reported $3.13 per diluted share on an adjusted basis for the full year of 2013. Total revenues for the year grew by almost 50% compared with 2013, reaching a record of almost $10 billion. Putting this in perspective, we had more revenue in the first three quarters of 2014 than we had during all of 2013. Five of our health plans now generate over $1 billion in premiums. And two health plans California and New Mexico doubled their revenue in 2014 alone. This revenue growth was driven primarily by two key factors, significant increases in enrollment and higher premium revenue for many of our members. The higher premiums per member resulted from our continued transition from a company operating an acute care business to un-serving members with complex care needs that include behavioral healthcare and long-term services and supports. Members with more complex-needs bring with them a higher per-member per-month premium. 2014 enrollment grew to 2.6 million members, an increase of almost 700,000 members over year-end 2013. Membership growth was strong across all lines of business but was driven by Medicaid expansion and the membership added in South Carolina, Illinois and our Acquisition of First Coast Advantage in Florida. Per-member per-month premium grew by nearly 20% over the prior year, and was primarily a result of new Long-Term Services and Supports or LTSS benefits, now included in our managed care programs in California, Florida, Illinois, New Mexico and Ohio. As we promised back in February of 2014, we were able to deliver significant improvements in administrative efficiency throughout the year. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue declined to 7.3% for the fourth quarter of 2014, from 11% for the same period in 2013. For the full year ending December 31, 2014, we experienced an administrative expense ratio was 7.9% versus 10.1% in the same period for 2013. To remind you, the 10-basis point drop in our administrative expense ratio equates to an expense reduction of approximately $10 million or about $0.12 per diluted share directly to the bottom line. As we discussed last year, we devoted significant resources to infrastructure and human capital investments that were necessary to fuel our anticipated growth. As our new growth business came online during the year, we were able to finally realize the benefits of those investments. Our greatest financial challenge in 2014 was reflected in the increase in our medical care ratio over 2013. While we were pleased that our medical care ratio actually dropped slightly in the fourth quarter of 2014 when compared to the third quarter of 2014, our medical care ratio for the full year of 2014 was, 240 basis points higher than in 2013. We attribute the year-over-year increase in MCR to four factors. First, a significant amount of our revenue is now coming in from programs that cover long-term services and supports. As we\u2019ve discussed in the past, the percentage profit margins for members receiving LTSS benefits are generally lower than those associated with our traditional membership, but the dollar margins are significantly higher. Second, increases to our base premiums in recent years have not kept pace with medical cost trends, as states it had to balance the need for rate increases with an increasing number of individuals who are eligible for government programs. Third, a lack of coordination in the design of profit caps and medical cost floors and some of our contracts have resulted in counter-productive outcomes. And the fourth factor is the inevitable time-lag between the initiation of care coordination and the care management efforts for our members with complex-needs and the realization of financial benefits from those efforts to reduce margins in 2014. In San Francisco last month, we talked about how we continue to be affected by delays and reimbursement for the health insurer fee in a few remaining states. We\u2019ve also previously discussed that during the fourth quarter, the New Mexico and Texas Medicaid agencies agree to full reimbursement resulting in the recognition of $30 million in the fourth quarter. We have summarized the still unrecognized health insurer fee revenue for 2014 in the earnings release. The net amount outstanding from the California, Michigan and Utah Medicaid agencies is approximately $20 million. In other words, had we been able to recognize this revenue in 2014, our EPS would have been higher by $0.26. Finally, I want to highlight our cash position as of December 31, 2014. The company had cash in investments of around $2.6 billion including approximately $200 million at the parent level. Most importantly cash flow from operations increased significantly to over $1 billion for the year ending December 31, 2014. We will be hosting our Investor Day Conference in New York City this Thursday, February 12 at 12 :30 p.m. Eastern Time. At that presentation we will be discussing the company\u2019s outlook and strategy for 2015. We look forward to seeing you there or encourage that you listen the other webcast. Since we will be discussing 2015 outlook in New York on Thursday, as Juan Jos\u00e9 said, we will not be taking calls or questions on this subject matter today. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush Securities. You may proceed with your question. Sarah James : Thank you. I was hoping that you could break out some of the out-of-period items in the quarter. It looked like there was about $0.21 of health insurer fee that was the out-of-period benefit and the $0.10 Texas bonus headwind. But I wasn\u2019t sure if there was unusual flu activity. SG&A came in about 20 basis points better than guidance. I wasn\u2019t sure if that\u2019s just out-of-period revenue or if there is some sustainable improvement there? And then, last, if there was anything going on in Florida related FCA Acquisition like a reserve belt? Thank you. Joe White : Hi Sarah, it\u2019s Joe speaking. As with any quarter we have and I could discuss with you four hours, a whole pile of one-time out-of-period adjustments favorable and unfavorable. I think really other than the pick-up from the ACA health insurer fee in Texas and New Mexico, I would say that the pluses and minuses kind of evened out this quarter. Texas quality revenue continues to remain a headwind. And I think we spoke about that. There is about $19 million or $20 million of that potentially still left on the table that we might be able to realize in 2015, if we get information from the state. And that information indicates we\u2019ve earned the quality revenue. Again, there is a lot of step back and forth, New Mexico for example is a state. It\u2019s a state with considerable activity this quarter and this year in terms of retroactive enrollment, adjustments to reserves. I\u2019d say the same thing about Florida in the second half of the year as a result of revenue increases that are going to come in retro to September 1, 2014 that we were able to recognize. So, you\u2019ve seen some out-of-period stuff reflected in those states. And I think it\u2019s meaningful. But in general, I think you can just look at it in terms of the health insurer fees being the one item. John Molina : Yes, Sarah, this is John. This is why we always caution everyone against trying to take a quarter and extrapolate future run rates. That\u2019s why we rather look at a longer period of time, one or two years as opposed to one or two quarters. Sarah James : Got it. Thank you guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Carter with Credit Suisse. You may proceed with your question. Chris Carter : Thanks, good afternoon. Just wondering if you could give us an update on New Mexico, I know the LTSS members are running access of 100% MLR there last quarter, just curious how that book is tracking this quarter. Joe White : It\u2019s Joe speaking again, Chris. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen anything drastically changed about New Mexico. Obviously we\u2019ll talk about that more on Thursday at Investor Day. I would say though that despite what the recorded numbers are showing you, I don\u2019t think there has been deterioration in New Mexico or Florida this quarter. And there is like just a huge amount of retroactivity with membership and other issues in New Mexico. So, I think what we said last quarter it pretty much stands. Chris Carter : Got it. And then, just maybe some more commentary on Washington, did you guys get a rate increase there or anything on the ABD book? Mario Molina : Chris, we\u2019re going to be talking about all the 2015 rates on Thursday. Chris Carter : Okay, all right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays. You may proceed with your question. Josh Raskin : Hi, thanks. First question, just on Texas, I think in the press release you talked about the $25.5 million that wasn\u2019t recorded and you said $20 million was lack of information I guess to substantiate the payment. So, what\u2019s the other $5.5 million? Joe White : Josh, its Joe again. The other $5.5 million is essentially revenue we don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be able to recognize related to 2014. Josh Raskin : Okay. So you have visibility on that but you just don\u2019t think you hit the matrix or whatever they changed often, and that\u2019s sort of, so that\u2019s normally there? Joe White : Correct. Josh Raskin : And then, what about timing for the ACA reimbursement from California, have they given you a timeline as to when they will reviewing this and do they have any rationale for why they are one of the only states that doesn\u2019t believe that this should part of rates? John Molina : Josh, we\u2019re going to talk more about that on Thursday. But California is making progress albeit slow. So there is a light at the end of the tunnel and there is another train coming our way. Josh Raskin : Okay. It\u2019s not something where you feel like you need to start taking legal action or anything like that? Mario Molina : No. This is Mario. My understanding is that they have submitted something to CMS and they\u2019re waiting approval. Josh Raskin : Okay, got you. And then, just last question, I know we don\u2019t want to talk about a specific quarter and extrapolating and I know you\u2019re not going to give guidance for \u201915, but that\u2019s our job. So, I have to ask. The 2014 number, as you guys think about it, how would you break-out the one-time items? Obviously we know the ACAP and we know the tax performance fees. And I guess we can determine whether or not we think taxes, is run rate or not. But I know Joe just mentioned some retroactivity in the quarter. So, I\u2019m just trying to figure about if you think about what is like the run rate, so getting about 2015 but where do we start in 2014 as sort of a baseline of what you think you\u2019ve earned on a run rate basis? Joe White : It\u2019s Joe speaking. I think it\u2019s, I mean, all-in Josh, I would kind of look to, I would kind of look to what we reported for the full year. That\u2019s all-in, that I think says what our year is pretty well once you smooth everything out I wouldn\u2019t look to a quarter. But I think the full year rate of 89.5% is, that\u2019s our run rate for 2014. Mario Molina : So, this is Mario, I just want to kind of reemphasize what Joe said. This has been a lumpy year because of a lot of timing issues, things like the ACAPs and so forth. New programs coming in, some rate adjustments here and there, retroactive membership, it\u2019s been added to the plan. So, it\u2019s very difficult to do much with the quarter but I think that to Joe\u2019s point, look at the year-end results. And that gives you a pretty fair picture, smooth out of what the year look like. Josh Raskin : Yes, and I was looking more at the EPS number. So, I was thinking about like $1.30 and then Texas, is $0.33 and the un-reimbursed health insurance fee is $0.26. So, after adjusting for those, do you think that that\u2019s relatively reflective of what you think Molina\u2019s underlying earnings are? Joe White : I would say Josh that\u2019s reflective of what 2014 underlying earnings are. We\u2019re going to speak more to 2015 on Thursday. Mario Molina : Yes, I mean, clearly there are some things like the ACAP reimbursement that hurt us this year that was really outside of our control. If you look at the medical care ratio, it\u2019s about what we thought I was going to come in at when we gave guidance last year. Josh Raskin : Okay, all right. Perfect, thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with JPMorgan. You may proceed with your question. Mike Meesha : Good evening, this is Mike Meesha in for Justin. Did the fourth quarter include any one-time transaction costs from the First Coast Advantage Acquisition? And also can you break down sharing the transaction details or expected accretion from the deal? Joe White : It\u2019s Joe speaking. As far as transaction cost, they were pretty minimal. Mike Meesha : And how about any transaction details or accretion? Mario Molina : We brought over 63,000 members in the Jacksonville area, it was an asset purchase in terms of the revenue accretion and it\u2019s probably it\u2019s not material at this point. Mike Meesha : Okay. And does the deal have any sort of skewing effect on the elevated MLR in for the quarter or was that really not much of the factor? Joe White : It\u2019s Joe speaking. If you look at the Florida standalone results for the quarter, yes. Because when we do, when acquisition of that especially in December, the way we book reserves it\u2019s going to be a factor and pushing up the fourth quarter Florida MLR but not consolidated. Mike Meesha : And do you have a sense of where the Florida MLR would have been current x the transaction? Joe White : I can\u2019t speak to that but I would just say that given everything that\u2019s happened in Florida this quarter back in New York in September, I said Florida was probably going to run in the low 90s, and I\u2019m standing by that prediction. Mike Meesha : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, great. Thanks. I guess, just going back to the Texas if for a second, I guess you didn\u2019t book $5.5 million. How do we think about that number, is that a number where you say well, the number was $32 million annually. Then you always only collect 90% of it or 80% of it or is that a number that you think you should be consistently getting 100% over what that has been historically? John Molina : This is John. It changes every year because the State of Texas changes, the T for P metrics. So, this year, on the metrics that we got visibility on, we think that we\u2019re not going to achieve 100% compliance. So we think that\u2019s going to result in $5 million get-back. In 2015 it may be different depending on what the measures are on our performance. Kevin Fischbeck : But I guess, do you have like a 2013 number? John Molina : Yes, actually there was, I want to say in 2013, there was $4 million or $5 million we were unable to recognize too. So in that regard, it\u2019s been consistent. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And I guess, I appreciate the fact that from quarter-to-quarter a lot of moving pieces and you\u2019ve grown so much that it\u2019s difficult to kind of look at things on a quarterly basis. But I guess, just qualitatively as we think about the quarter, there are some books of business that you just brought online this quarter, some books of business that you had for a couple of quarters now. As you guys think about that normal progression of a company bringing out a lot of revenue, is there any book whether it\u2019s duals or long-term care or whatever is performing not the way you would have thought in a good or bad, is there any clarity you can give around how you feel like qualitatively the progression is coming in? And then if you can kind of break it out between your Medicaid expansion versus core TANF versus duals versus long-term care, that would be helpful? Mario Molina : Kevin that is a great question and we actually have a slide on that. We\u2019ll be talking about that on Thursday. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, all right. I guess so I look for that. Perfect. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Wright with Sterne Agee. You may proceed with your question. Brian Wright : Thanks. It seems like since there were some retro membership assigned in both Florida and New Mexico, did I hear that correctly? Joe White : Brian much more in New Mexico, New Mexico has been having retro revenue - I\u2019m sorry retro enrollment additions all year. Brian Wright : And that\u2019s completely separate from your negotiations with regard to the separate minimum MLR by products in New Mexico? Joe White : As far as I know yes, I think it\u2019s just a matter of the state. And everybody in New Mexico has been working hard to get members on so they can get care. And that rolled out during the year and some people were enrolled retro. Brian Wright : I apologize, but did you give us the dollar amount of the negative impact for the byproduct MLRs in certain states like New Mexico? Mario Molina : Say that again Brian. Brian Wright : Wanted to just know, kind of how much the results were hurt in \u201914 by kind of byproduct MLRs in states like New Mexico and sort of like a consolidated minimum MLR? Mario Molina : Okay. Well, Brian let me speak to, yes, we have a line on our balance sheet for the amount payable back to the states about $527,000 is payable back to the states for various issues. About $390,000 or $400,000 of that relates to Washington, California and New Mexico combined. John Molina : Let me clarify Brian, that was $570 million not $570,000. Brian Wright : Okay, thank you. And then if I can just sneak one last one in here. Way back in \u201905 you guys took a run at Georgia, just any updated thoughts? Joe White : So, our understanding that the RFP was released today. And so anytime an RFP is released we evaluate whether we want to proceed. Brian Wright : You have people in the state currently? Mario Molina : What do you mean by people Brian? You mean, do we have staff there? No. Brian Wright : Okay, all right. Thank you. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got. Thanks. Mario Molina : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group. You may proceed with your question. Chris Rigg : Okay. Well, thanks. I just wanted to come back to Florida quickly here on the MLR. I heard a comment about the acquisition but I guess, I believe you got a rate increase on the long-term care side. I could be wrong. But assuming you did, did things Joe still shape up as you, when you talked about the MLR last fall, did you assume the rate increase in the context of your comments? Joe White : Yes, that\u2019s correct Chris. And there was a rate increase in Florida, back in September \u201901 just as a result of timing of communication of that and signing of the paperwork and everything. We weren\u2019t able to recognize any of that increase in 2014. So that\u2019s one reason of why the fourth quarter had such a high MLR. So, there is a definitive delay and revenue recognition in Florida that\u2019s hurting the quarter. Chris Rigg : Okay, all right. So then I guess, how much would, can you give us a sense for how much the rate increase would have impacted results? Joe White : I don\u2019t have that specifically Chris but I think if we have APU combine that with the impact of the way we book the acquisition, you definitely push down below 95%. Chris Rigg : Okay. And then I guess\u2026 John Molina : I think we\u2019re going nothing below 90s there with all the said and done. Chris Rigg : Okay. And then I guess, just on the flip side, California continues to track pretty well here. Any sense for how we should think about sort of, I know this is kind of a 2015 question but just sense about trends going forward, how the state is looking at the rates there? How you feel about rates in California generally? Thanks. John Molina : I think California is a real good illustration that we can carry on to places like Florida and New Mexico and Washington. California recognized that it has under-priced specifically the ABD population. And over a period of about two to three years they raised that rate. And as we grew the business, grew profitably. So, again I think that over the next several years when we\u2019re working with other states on the base rates because the lack of rate increases over a period of time can squeeze margins. Mario Molina : This is Mario. I just want to put in the plug for medical management as well. I mean it\u2019s not simply a passive issue about getting your rate increase. The management team in California did a good job as well of trying to improve the performance of the plan they deserve credit too. John Molina : That\u2019s the difference between the doctor and the lawyer in the line of business. Chris Rigg : There you go. Thanks a lot. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. You may proceed with your question. Ana Gupte : Yes, thanks. Good evening. The first question I had was on G&A outlook as you point out. It\u2019s extremely sensitive and much of the bottom line. In terms of the fourth quarter and in business expansion costs and other things for \u201915, was that in any way more front-loaded? So as you\u2019re thinking about 2015, is there likely to be more improvement going forward? Joe White : Ana, you said the word outlook. So, we\u2019re going to get into all of the admin. Remember, we\u2019re going to be bringing on in Puerto Rico and some other of the duals contracts in 2015. So, we\u2019ll go through the whole admin discussion on Thursday. Ana Gupte : Okay. Anything at all on whether or not you had \u201915 cost, what was the magnitude of the \u201915 cost in the fourth quarter? Joe White : I\u2019m sorry Ana, we didn\u2019t hear that, any magnitude of what? Ana Gupte : Anything you can comment on as far as just how much of the business expansion cost might have been booked upfront? Joe White : I mean, I would say in general they weren\u2019t substantial. When we were in New York, we expected G&A back in January, we said G&A would run about 7.5% on the fourth quarter it\u2019s a hair below that. But year-to-date we\u2019re right basically where we said we\u2019d be. I wouldn\u2019t, we continue to make good progress on the G&A front but I don\u2019t think there is something, there is huge upside out there beyond what we\u2019ve already talked to you about. Ana Gupte : Okay, thanks. Thanks Joe. On flu and Hep-C, did you say anything about that if you did in your prepared remarks, I\u2019m sorry, but what was the experience in the fourth quarter and as the flu season peaking? Mario Molina : Sure. So, on the flu season, I think it\u2019s been a moderate increase from last year so 2014 a little bit higher than 2013 but not a lot. And on Hepatitis C, as you know we have been able to reach accommodation with many of our states on some sort of reimbursement mechanism, so that\u2019s mitigated a lot of the risk that we face on the Hepatitis C front. And the current Hepatitis C utilizations included in our numbers for the quarter. Ana Gupte : Okay, thanks. One last one on, based on claims payables, is where you are right now something that you see as your normalized levels of where you need to be? Joe White : It\u2019s Joe speaking. I would think that over time that DCP number is going to come down. Right now obviously we still have a lot of business, it\u2019s starting. Any claims that we\u2019re associated with the Florida acquisition, very few of those were paid in December because we just started. So I think, I think over time you\u2019ll see us work our inventories down which will in-turn reduce the days and claims payable as a byproduct of that. I don\u2019t know when that\u2019s going to happen because we got some growth in front of us next year. But I think in general, as we look out over a couple of years that number will come down. Ana Gupte : Thanks so much, I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel. You may proceed with your question. Tom Carroll : Hi guys, good evening. So I want to come back a couple of things, I want to come back to Josh\u2019s question on run rate and put a final point on it. Joe, you mentioned $1.30 was a good number, but if we add back the $0.26 for the ACA impact, $0.33 for the Texas quality impact, we get to $1.89. Is that a reasonable number to think about in terms of us now thinking about next year? Mario Molina : Yes. My thoughts were more on the MCR level. I think we\u2019ve laid it out Tom. I think if you add back in the health insurer fee and a good chunk of the Texas quality revenue that\u2019s where you get. I would just caution everybody that we\u2019re going to be talking again about 2015 on Thursday. So things can change in the course of the year. Tom Carroll : So, that considering the $1.89 just for conversation purposes now, and looking out at the consensus numbers that are out there of around $2.51, it implies like 33% growth. And I would think a company like yours seeing all kinds of growth would be fairly comfortable with that number. Would you feel uncomfortable putting percentage? Joe White : Tom, Tom, Tom, nice try. But that\u2019s you\u2019re asking us to confirm something that we\u2019re going to talk about on Thursday. Tom Carroll : All right. What are the things? So let\u2019s go to the Texas quality payment again. There has been some dialogue around this now for a while so I apologize. But relative to the $20 million that you highlight that lacks information. Is that run-out data that you need from the state in order to evaluate the framework? And I guess what, is your gut feeling in terms of that coming into the company either in first quarter or second quarter of this year? Mario Molina : So, Tom, this is Mario. This is a very complex calculation. And it depends not only on our performance but our performance relative to our peers. So even if we know how we\u2019re doing on some of these measures, it\u2019s very difficult for us to be able to recognize the revenue because we don\u2019t know where we stand in relation to everyone else. That\u2019s one of the problems with these new measures that Texas has come up with. If you look at some of the measures we had from 2013, we did not settle that until December of 2014. So, it could take a while before we get clarity on the Texas performance measure that\u2019s still outstanding. Tom Carroll : Right, I appreciate that. But you must have, you have some comfort around the $5 million right, in not being able to capture that? Mario Molina : The $5 million is really more related to HETA [ph] scores which are pretty easy to calculate. Tom Carroll : Okay. So, I guess what\u2019s your comfort level around the $20 million is that, it sounds like there is some risk there still to it. Is it do you feel like you\u2019re going to get 80% of it? Mario Molina : I think it\u2019s difficult for us to say at this point. Tom Carroll : Okay. Mario Molina : I think potentially we\u2019re going to pick up some of it, but I can\u2019t tell you how much. Joe White : If we had insight into that we\u2019d record the revenue or tell you can, we would have recorded the revenue. So right now, we just know enough. Tom Carroll : And then, one last one, the tax rate in the quarter seemed a little lower than was implied through the guidance discussions we had all through 2014. Is that the case you think and if it was why do you have a lower number? Mario Molina : We\u2019re just going to be talking about tax rates in New York on Thursday but not to steal this thunder. But in general, remember with a large non-deductible, expenses we have, to the extent pre-tax income increases, you\u2019re going to have a decrease in your effective tax rate which is what happened this quarter. Tom Carroll : Okay, all right, thank you. Mario Molina : So, you are correct. It would be a little lower than some, it would be lower than some people might have expected. Tom Carroll : All right, good deal. Thanks. Thursday. Mario Molina : Thursday. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed with your question. Peter Costa : Thanks. And looking at your Texas quality payments for the quarter, they actually went down from the third quarter. You\u2019re expecting to see more coming in from next year. Can you explain to us why they went down from one quarter to the next? Joe White : It\u2019s Joe speaking. First of all we\u2019re not saying anything about what we expect to receive or not receive what we expect to earn next quarter. All we\u2019re saying is that of the $25 million of Texas quality revenue related to 2014, $20 million of that was not recognized because we do not yet have the appropriate metrics from the state to assess our compliance. As far as the actual number, the amount recognized in fourth quarter dropping, that\u2019s because we realized that $5 million was not going to be recognized as a result of some hiatus measures we didn\u2019t hit. So, again I just want to emphasize, we don\u2019t have visibility right now right now into how that $20 million is going to play out in terms of whether we\u2019d be able to recognize it or not. Right now it\u2019s unrecognized. And we\u2019ll recognize it if we indeed earn the revenue. Peter Costa : So the revenues would have been higher if you hadn\u2019t made the decision that $5.5 million wouldn\u2019t be recognized, is that a fair statement? Joe White : That\u2019s correct, that\u2019s correct. Peter Costa : Okay. And then, can you talk about Hep-C a little bit more in detail. How many states have carved out specifically vacillating you from utilization of Hepatitis C drugs, so not necessarily included into your rates but created some kind of a car value, there are kick payment or something like that? Joe White : Off the top of my head, I can\u2019t tell you that. But I know that most of our States\u2019 grafts almost all of them have done something to mitigate the Hepatitis C and starting a variety of different mechanisms. So it\u2019s kind of, it\u2019s very complicated. But we do have a fair amount of protection on mitigation, not entirely. And clearly we don\u2019t have that for the Medicare business on the Part B side. But there are other issues with Medicare Part B. So, I\u2019m feeling pretty good about it now, much better than I did this time last year when we thought this was potentially a budget buster for us, having said that, it\u2019s still a big issue for the states. And whether they are reimbursing us or paying for fee-for-service, this is something that\u2019s going to put a drag on state Medicaid budgets in the future. Peter Costa : Okay. And then, in your prepared comments, you said 2015 would be a lot like 2014 but then you said it was a year where they\u2019re setting you up for growth and improve profitability in the future. Did you imply improved profitability in 2015? And if you did, off of what level, off the run-rate you guys were talking about or off of the reported numbers? Joe White : So again, when we get into guidance on Thursday, what you\u2019re going to see is that 2014 and 2015 are going to be very similar. And this is another year of growth for us, picked up a lot of members in January and February through the marketplace. And we continue to see growth in Medicaid. We have the Puerto Rico contract coming in. And we have some duals contracts that are rolling in so, again, another year of a lot of growth in revenue and membership. Peter Costa : All right, I understand that. But just regarding the improved profitability in the future, what future are we referring to, after 2015 or 2015? Mario Molina : That\u2019s 2015, right. Peter Costa : Okay, got it. Thanks much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Windley with Jefferies. You may proceed with your question. David Windley : Hi, good evening, thank you. You\u2019ve addressed for several of the other higher MLR states in your report tonight, overlapped with the state that you mentioned about LTSS and then in case of Washington ABD, do you feel like you have the appropriate programs and resources deployed in states to be able to continue to attack and work down medical cost and MLR? Or are there still investments that need to be made in those states to get there? I suppose the flip side of that question would be, how much of it is rate and how much of it is your execution? Terry Bayer : This is Terry Bayer, I\u2019ll respond to that. First keep in mind that this is the first time that the full long-term services and supports benefit both from a community base and long-term care facility is coming into managed care. And like any new program, it takes time to really develop and execute on the program. No different, there is a unit cost element but more importantly we\u2019re focused on the coordination programs. One of the benefits of the duals and the Medicaid and Medicare dollars coming together is that by managing the long-term services and supports, we expect to see benefit back on the Medicare side. Remember that the LTSS is a Medicaid benefit. So, this will not be in place on day one, it takes time to build relationships with the facilities, to get everybody assessed, to get the care plans in place and get it executed before [ph]. But we are really looking at the whole set of services, both the Medicaid and Medicare side. Mario Molina : So, let me just also add to what Terry said, this is Mario. We have been doing Medicare D-SNPs now for nine years. We have experienced with many of these benefits in places like California, Texas and Florida. So, I think we\u2019re very well positioned to deal with these issues going forward. And I think that we do have the appropriate staff and experience. I think our experience with the D-SNPs has been invaluable and will really help us as we try to combine the Medicaid long-term services with the Medicare program of these combined contracts. So I think I\u2019m pretty confident that we can do this and I think that we\u2019re really well positioned for it. David Windley : Thank you. So, follow-on question there, what are you seeing in terms of Medicare opt-out in the duals, is that leveled off, I mean what messaging actions are you taking around that? Mario Molina : Well, we told everyone at the beginning of the year that we thought it was going to run about 50%. And it\u2019s been doing that, of course it varies a little bit from one geographic region to another. It depends on things like networks. Remember if you\u2019ve got a dual eligible beneficiary who is seeing five or six specialists, all you need is the one specialist to say I\u2019m not in the network, don\u2019t stay in that health plan. So, that\u2019s I think part of what contributes to this, part of its network. The other thing is frankly, the way these things are rolled out, there is a lot of confusion for the beneficiaries. And some of these people dis-enroll before they even find out what the program is all about. I think that to the extent that we have a longer voluntary enrollment period and more of an ability to explain to the members the benefits of the program, as we\u2019ve done with the D-SNPs in the past, people will sign-up, I think they will see it\u2019s beneficial to them. But it\u2019s going to take a while and I think some of the people that are opting out now may come around and rejoin us in the future because we will still be responsible for their long-term care services. David Windley : Thank you for the answers. Operator : The final question is a follow-up question from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please proceed with your question. Chris Rigg : Great, thanks for letting me hop back on here. I just wanted to come back Mario, I could have misheard you. But did you say that you just recognized some quality moneys in Texas from 2013 in the fourth quarter of \u201914? Joe White : It\u2019s Joe speaking that\u2019s correct. The amounts were fairly small. But I think there was $300,000 or $400,000 it just got cleaned up in late 2014 related to 2013. I think Mario\u2019s point was there is an extraordinary. There can be an extraordinary tail on the determination of these metrics. They\u2019re extraordinarily complex in their calculation and require time for them to develop. So while it\u2019s not, that specific item wasn\u2019t financially significant. It does indicate again the tail we have on some of this revenue which really far sees what we even have on claims liability. Chris Rigg : All right, great. I just wanted to make sure that it wasn\u2019t something material in the quarter. Joe White : Yes. Chris Rigg : Thanks a lot. Joe White : Yes. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference back to you. Mario Molina : So, it probably doesn\u2019t need to be said but we\u2019re looking forward to seeing you all on Thursday where we\u2019re going to provide guidance and talk about our strategy and outlook for 2015. See you then.",

Welcome to the Molina Healthcare First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, May 7, 2015. I would now like to turn the conference over to Juan Jose Orellana, SVP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Juan Jos\u00e9 Orellana - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations & Marketing: Thank you, Scott. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The purpose of this call is to discuss Molina Healthcare's financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2015. The company issued its release reporting the results today after the market closed, and the release is now posted for viewing on our company website. On the call with me today are Dr. Mario Molina, our CEO; John Molina, our CFO; Terry Bayer, our COO; and Joseph White, our Chief Accounting Officer. After the completion of our prepared remarks we will open the call to take your questions. If you have multiple questions we ask that you get back it the queue so that others can have an opportunity to ask their questions. Our comments today will contain forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. All of our forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to numerous risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. A description of such risk factors can be found in our earnings release and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-K annual report, our Form 10-Q quarterly reports, and our Form 8-K current reports. These reports can be accessed under the Investor Relations tab of our company website or on the SEC's website. All forward-looking statements made during today's call represent our judgment as of May 7, 2015, and we disclaim any obligation to update such statements, except as required by securities laws. This call is being recorded and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available at our company's website, molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Mario Molina. J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Juan Jose. Hello, everyone and thank you for joining our call today. I will speak for a few minutes on our start for the year and then hand the call over to John who will provide a financial summary of the quarter. Molina is off to an excellent start in 2015, and I am very pleased with our current trajectory and progress. We delivered 38% enrollment growth and 53% revenue growth, which together resulted in net income that was about six times higher than the first quarter of 2014. This success underscores the current growth opportunities of our business, and validates our strategic push to diversify into new markets and new programs to manage the healthcare of complex patients, and to leverage our administrative infrastructure. All of this without ever losing sight of quality. Today's results establish a solid foundation for us to build upon as we set our sights on our targets for the year, and to achieve our long-term goals and objectives. During the first quarter, strong membership growth continued as we increased enrollment by 342,000 members sequentially, growing to nearly three million members across all of our markets. Arranging healthcare services for three million members is no simple task. So I want to take this opportunity to congratulate all of our employees on this milestone achievement. But more importantly, I want to thank them for their hard work, and for remaining grounded by always keeping in mind our humble beginnings in a single clinic. Thank you. We are currently operating in one of the most exciting periods in the history of Medicaid managed care, two of the fastest growing programs in the managed care industry. The dual eligible demonstration and the expansion of Medicaid are core areas of focus at Molina. As individuals in these programs transition into managed care, the demands for our services will continue to increase. Our dual eligible membership increased by nearly 90% sequentially, fueled by the three health plans that began operations under this program last year, California, Illinois and Ohio. Many of you listening to this call have been keenly interested in the opt-out rates for our duals programs. We continue to experience a consolidated opt-out rate of about 50%, consistent with the number we have shared in the past. Medicaid expansion membership grew by 50,000 new members during the first quarter and by 300,000 when compared to the same period one year-ago. This product has been and continues to be an area of significant growth for the company. The health plans that we operate in states that chose to expand their Medicaid programs experienced significant growth. For example our health plans in California and Washington have each added more than 100,000 new expansion members since the beginning of 2014. And Michigan, New Mexico and Ohio have each added more than 50,000 expansion members as well. However, Texas and Florida, two states with large numbers of people without health insurance continue to refrain from expanding their Medicaid program. While lawmakers continue their debate over Medicaid expansion, managed care remains an important value and cost savings proposition. In terms of new markets, our health plan in Puerto Rico went live on April 1, as we welcomed 350,000 new members in the East and Southwest regions of the Commonwealth. I had a chance to visit with our employees at our offices in San Juan right before the launch and I was very impressed with their efforts to bring up the business under a very compressed timeframe. From our recent experience in large managed care implementations in Florida, Illinois, South Carolina and Texas we have learned that anytime large numbers of beneficiaries are transitioned into a new program, lack of awareness and confusion are always present among members and providers in the near-term. Therefore in keeping with past practice we expect to record higher medical costs in Puerto Rico during the onset of the implementation until we have our own claims data. Now let's talk a little bit about premium rates. As we think about some of our concerns from last year the rate environment immediately comes to mind. We continue to view rates in general as an ongoing headwind, especially for members in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families category or TANF. The good news is that the rate relief in the Aged, Blind and Disabled category or ABD, as demonstrated in our New Mexico and Washington health plans provides us with some comfort that these issues will be mitigated and resolved over time. Another issue of concern last year was the reimbursement of the Affordable Care Act health insurer fee by our state partners. While not all states have formally committed to reimbursement of the health insurer fee for 2015 we remain confident of full reimbursement. As I mentioned previously, I am very pleased with our results for the quarter as our revenue and membership growth have maintained the momentum that we developed in 2014. I remain excited about the continued opportunities we are seeing and the progress we are making as we continue positioning the company for success. I would now like to turn the call over to John. John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Mario, and hello, everyone. Today we reported net income per diluted share from continuing operations of $0.56. Additionally, we're reporting adjusted net income per diluted share from continuing operations of $0.71. Both numbers represent significant improvements over our results for the first quarter of 2014 and we are all very pleased with our performance. The first quarter was notable for several key reasons. First we continue to see robust top line growth. We added more than 340,000 new members over the course of the quarter with almost three-quarters of those new members coming through the Marketplace. As we have said previously, we took a deliberate and measured approach toward the Marketplace in 2014 given the many uncertainties. For 2015 we refined our pricing based on 2014 experience and concentrated our network development. These efforts resulted in significant membership growth during the first quarter. Florida is our largest Marketplace health plan with 185,000 members while our Wisconsin health plan has about 25,000 Marketplace members and California has nearly 20,000. While we are still early in the year our cost and utilization experience so far suggests that our Marketplace business for 2015 is priced appropriately. Second, top line growth reflects our growing diversity both geographically and across different programs. In order to help you better understand that diversity we are for the first time disclosing in today's earnings release, our revenue and medical care ratios by product line. I caution everyone that financial information presented with this degree of granularity is subject to quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. This is the same situation as with the health plan specific information that we've always provided. I urge you to use the detailed geographical and product line data to better understand our business tactics, our market opportunities and challenges and the complexities of our business. But use our consolidated results to understand our strategic goals and opportunities, to weigh our performance over time and to form your own assessment of the long-term potential of our company. Third, we've gained traction, for the time being, at least, in our efforts to control medical care costs. Our medical care ratio for the first quarter was the same as it was a year ago, and down 70 basis points sequentially. Fourth, administrative cost leverage is improving our profitability. Finally, we achieved strong first quarter results, despite the continued drag on earnings from the ACA health insurer fee and Texas quality revenue. Of course there are always challenges. As we've said before, increases to our base premiums in recent years have not kept pace with medical cost trends. And we continue to give back revenue due to limitations on medical margins for some programs, even as we suffer unacceptably low medical margins in other programs. Now for some additional details : Premium revenue grew 53% from a year ago and 14% from the fourth quarter of 2014. While additional memberships certainly contributes to revenue growth, membership is only one component of the overall revenue growth story. Per member per month premium revenue has increased by 15% over the last year as a result of additional membership in higher premium groups such as Medicaid expansion, the dual eligibles, Aged, Blind and Disabled populations and Marketplace. Turning to medical costs, our consolidated medical care ratio remained flat year-over-year at 88.7%, and declined by 70 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2014. As always, our health plan financial data disclosure, and now our product line financial data disclosure present a complex picture. To reiterate what I said a minute ago, it is our consolidated financial performance that tells you where we're headed. With that said, here are some general observations on our medical cost performance. First, premium rates for our MMP plans in California, Illinois and Ohio appear for now to be adequate to support the costs associated with those programs. Let me remind you that the MMP are the fully integrated duals programs. Of course we are unable to comment at the moment on our MMP programs in Michigan, South Carolina or Texas, which have just been launched. Second, we have seen some margin relief for the Aged, Blind and Disabled line of business in Washington and New Mexico, although not for the long-term care benefit attached to the ABD population in New Mexico. We are experiencing margin compression in the TANF line of business, as Mario said, particularly in the states of New Mexico, Washington, Florida and Utah. This is consistent with what we've said previously about base premium rates not keeping pace with increases in medical costs. Third the Medicaid expansion and Marketplace lines of business are for now experiencing lower medical care ratios than our other lines of business. Fourth on a consolidated basis prior period development did not have a significant impact on our results. Although we reported a benefit from prior period development in the quarter of $136 million approximately $25 million of that favorable development was offset by reductions to revenue as the result of medical cost floors and corridors. Once you strip out the PPD that resulted in offsetting adjustments to revenue our metrics look very similar to the first quarters of 2013 and 2012 because we strive to maintain consistent reserving methodologies and do not believe that prior period development had a material impact on our consolidated results. Days in Claims Payable increased sequentially from December by 2 days to 51 days and by 5 days from the first quarter 2014. As we've said before diversification across geographers and product lines allows us to mitigate the variations in contribution by market and product. This is particularly important as we continue to grow and expand our business. Not only have we been able to diversify on a geographic basis but product line diversification has also provided us with additional stability and opportunity. First quarter results continue to show the benefits of the administrative cost leverage that we have discussed in the past. As noted in our earnings release and our 10-Q, administrative costs associated with the startup of our Puerto Rico health plan, Marketplace broker commissions and Marketplace exchange fees resulted in a general and administrative expense ratio that was higher than in the fourth quarter of 2014. Absent these costs associated with Puerto Rico and our Marketplace build out our administrative cost ratio would have been approximately 7.4% for the quarter, this is consistent with our expectations. We believe a key comparison to make is with our general and administrative expense ratio for the first quarter of 2014 which was a full percentage point higher than our G&A ratio for the first quarter this year. I am pleased that we achieved good results this quarter despite headwinds from the lack of full Affordable Care Act health insurer fee reimbursement and our decision to defer recognition of quality revenue related to Texas. In the first quarter of 2014 we did not record reimbursement for the 2015 health insurer fee in California, Michigan and Utah reducing our first quarter income by approximately $16 million or $0.20 per diluted share. Nor do we recognize any of the outstanding health insurer fee reimbursement related to 2014 which stood at approximately $20 million as of March 31, 2015. We remain confident that all states will eventually reimburse us for the health insurer fee, but the timing of our revenue recognition remains uncertain. To that point, the state of California has just reimbursed us for our 2014 health insurer fee. So we will be recognizing that revenue in the second quarter. We still do not have formal documentation of California's intent to reimburse us for the 2015 health insurance fee. So we don't know when we'll be able to recognize 2015 health insurer fee reimbursement from California. We're only recognizing a portion of the Texas Health Plan's quality revenue for the first quarter of 2015 due to the lack of clarity around the methodology of the calculations. We have discussed this previously. As a result, about $7 million of the approximately $9 million of quality revenue available in Texas for the first quarter of 2015, which is equivalent to about $0.09 per diluted share, was not recognized this quarter. Nor do we recognize any quality related revenue from 2014 during the first quarter of this year. The balance from 2014 is $20 million. The import of this discussion is that our first quarter results for 2015 would have been $0.29 better had we been in a position to recognize these last two items. You will notice that our convertible debt, due February of 2020, has been reclassified as a short-term liability effective March 31, 2015, and that the related derivative asset and liability have also been reclassified as current. Because of the sharp increase in our share price, the stock price trigger allowing conversion of the notes into cash has occurred. No notes have been presented to us for conversion. And the notes continue to trade at a price in excess of the value that could be realized by a note holder upon conversion. The excess in value of the notes over the conversion value reflects the value of the coupon rate attached to the notes, and the optionality value of the conversion feature over the remaining life of the notes. As of March 31, 2015, the company had cash and investments in excess of $3 billion, including in excess of $200 million at the parent. We've also made some changes to the methodology by which we calculate adjusted net income and related per share amounts. Specifically, we're no longer subtracting depreciation and amortization of capitalized software and share based compensation from net income to arrive at adjusted net income and the related per share amount. We made this change to better reflect the way in which we evaluate our financial performance, making financing and business decisions, and forecasts and plan for the future periods. In addition, we believe this calculation makes our adjusted net income more comparable to our peers. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP calculation has been included in today's release and is available there for your review. Finally and as a reminder from our Investor Day presentation, we only provide guidance annually and we don't intend to change guidance unless there's an event that has a material impact on our business. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question is from Sarah James with Wedbush. Please proceed. Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Thank you. And congratulations on the strong quarter. It looks like without a few of the delays it would have been even further above consensus. So I just appreciate the new detail on the product MLR and it's a new metric so I was hoping we could get a little bit more context. I was looking at the TANF, CHIP, MLR compared to kind of the range that you guys gave at Investor Day of high 80s for 2014 and 2015 and there's a little bit of gap there between where first quarter is and where the years' were. And I was hoping you could talk about maybe how non-recognition of the ACA fee or rate updates expected later in the year may be kind of skewing this quarter off of what you had previously talked about annually? John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : So, Sarah, this is John. I think while we still continue to grow and get very big we can't forget about seasonality and I think you're looking at one quarter and comparing it to our entire year so that's going to be the big difference. I don't think that the recognition of the ACA fee is going to have anything to do with \u2013 or much to do with that and the Texas quality revenue is primarily in the ABD population so if anything, would benefit the ABD population some. But again short answer is seasonality. Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Got it. And then could you remind us how you guys are thinking about share count with respect to your existing guidance? What's in there as far as share count or treatment of the convert? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : Sure, Sarah. It's Joe speaking. I think for guidance we were at around 50 million \u2013 I think we were around 50 million which is where we ended up for this quarter, I think we were like at 51 million this quarter. The way I would look at it is once you cross $53 in share price, increment about 250,000 shares on a full year basis. Obviously you've got to weight it for the weighted average over the days. But about 225,000 shares to 250,000 shares per $1 over $53. So you can take what we gave you and then peg your estimate of where our share price is going to be for the year and adjust it accordingly. Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. Appreciate that, Joe. Thanks. Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : Sure. Operator : And our next question is from Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please proceed. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. I know you don't update guidance, but I'm just curious, did 1Q come in better than your estimates? I mean obviously above the Street. But how did that compare to your previous expectations? J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hello, Josh. This is Mario. As we said at the outset, we're going to provide annual guidance. So for us to comment on the quarter-to-quarter development would in effect be giving quarterly guidance. So we're not going to comment on that aspect. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. I'll skip that one. Second question... J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : On the other hand... Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yep? J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : On the other hand, as I said in my remarks, I'm very pleased with the company's performance so far. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. I will add very pleased to the rest of the year I guess. Texas performance payments, so for the 2014 year, what are you still \u2013 the $20 million that you're waiting on, what metrics or what information are you waiting on to see if you can actually record those? And have you been able to rule? I know you're not \u2013 you haven't been able to recognize any of that. But have you been able to rule out any of it? Were there any metrics that you don't think you hit? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : It's Joe speaking. We know we definitely missed $4 million in Texas last year. So there's another $20 million out there. And it's the \u2013 you know it's the same story, Josh. We're just waiting to hear how the state has calculated through its third party, how it has calculated the metrics versus how we've calculated. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And you don't \u2013 so you can't just rely on your own calculations. You've got to wait until...? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : No. No, because it's a very complex calculation subject to a lot of interpretation. And it's also dependent on other health plan performance. John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : Josh, this is John. This is the biggest thing is, it's rank ordered against other health plans. So until we know how they did, our internal data is only half the picture. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got you. So you may know how you did, right, but that doesn't help you in the calculations. And then just the last one on the health insurer's exchange, you know the MLR in the quarter under 81% seems relatively low for a new entrant and big growth, et cetera. Can you talk a little bit about how you're accruing the claims? And then if there's any three Rs assumption? I don't want to preempt Joe's September presentation, I'm sure that's coming but curious what the accruals are. Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : What we're finding so far, Josh, and this is the beginning of the year \u2013 what we're finding though is that utilization is less than we anticipated. Pretty much substantially less which would suggest that there could conceivably be a \u2013 there could conceivable be a risk adjustment downward \u2013 adjustment to revenue but we think we've captured that in the calculations of the risk adjustment in the MLR floor and all of that. So I think in general it's fair to say we don't have any big receivables booked back on anything like risk adjustment. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Do you have any payables then, Joe? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : No. We haven't \u2013 I think it's fair to say that we anticipate that and we've worked that into our calculation of the anticipated MLR. I don't want go into details about whether we've got that booked as a higher medical claims liability or a risk adjustment liability but the exercise gets you to the same point. In a nutshell experience is coming in much less, so far much lower than we anticipated. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. I mean but just so I understand it's coming in much lower but you don't have a payable? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : We've adjusted \u2013 the best way to express this is between the claims reserved we recorded and the risk adjustment liability we've recorded, we think we're very nicely positioned. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Got you. It accrued over... Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : Yeah. I guess what I'm trying to say, Josh, is we don't anything substantial in the way of receivables and we anticipate, yes, there will payables to put back on risk adjustment. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : And our next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please proceed. Kevin M. Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Great. Thanks. I guess maybe just following up on that one, so I think you said that you think you've priced appropriately so I guess based on that last comment we should be thinking that the exchanges are tracking to profit this year so far? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : In our case, yes. Kevin M. Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then just on the Medicaid expansion MLR, can you talk a little bit about the MLR in the quarter? I know some states or many states have these rebate floors, wasn't sure if there was anything seasonality where you book the rebate floors more in the back half and so we should expect MLR to rise as the year goes on? Or whether this captures that number and this number might be in some ways sustainable? John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : This is John, Kevin. I think on the expansion the things you have to consider are the rates changed. And in many cases, we discussed this at the Investor Day, the rates \u2013 the premium rates dropped quite a bit. So if the MLR goes up, it largely is a function of the revenue per member going down. And then the methodology that different states use to calculate, either the floors or the give-backs are different. So that's going to have a little bit of an impact. And lastly, the time horizon, especially for a state like California, the measurement period's over 18 months as opposed to 12 months. So I think what we see in Q1 it's good. It might rise a little bit. I don't expect it to go shooting through the roof, but I don't expect it to drop much more. Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : Yeah. I would just add to that we've had 15 months of experience now with this population. So I think we've got a pretty good handle on the MLR corridors and floors. I don't think there's any snapback in that we would anticipate. Kevin M. Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And the number \u2013 because I mean we normally think about floors being in that kind of mid-80 or low-80 range if you're at 77.5. So can you just remind us maybe how much of your states have floors, versus don't have floors there? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : It's Joe speaking. They all have some sort of what the states call risk mitigation, strategies, some kind of risk corridor. Remember, though, that the definitions of revenue and expense in those calculations don't match what we show on a GAAP income statement. So oftentimes our revenue is reduced by certain items, and expense can be adjusted too so that the net effect of that is often an MLR floor that is slightly different than that which you would calculate from GAAP. Kevin M. Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Because I guess the reason that I ask is that obviously you've got a state in Kentucky who's looking to kind of rebid that contract pretty quickly because people were doing well there. And I know you're not there, but just trying to make sure. So you think that kind of where you are, or even in California this past year where there was a big rate cut, you kind of think where you are is more in line with directionally where the MLR floors \u2013 or do you think that there's rate risk to that over time? John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : I didn't hear the last part of your question. There's what over time? Kevin M. Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I was just saying there's rate and risk to that number over time and that states may additionally look to bring that MLR up. Or whether this MLR is generally in line with kind of where the corridors would put you on a GAAP adjusted basis? John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. I think that the states are taking the same approach. Their actuaries are looking at the data, utilization, expected trends, et cetera, and they're pricing it accordingly. They weren't as much in the dark as we were in the first year. And as Joe says, as we get more data, we would expect that the rates will be adjusted to be more in line with what the actual experience is. Kevin M. Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks very much... Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : Which is what we saw starting January 1, of this year. John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : Right. Kevin M. Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : And our next question is from Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Cornelia Miller - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. This Cornelia in for Andy. I guess just first it looks like your commercial revenues related to the exchanges were 7% of total premiums in the quarter. Do you think you'll still qualify for the de minimis rule? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : It's Joe speaking. We'll have to see how that plays out over the year. I would just \u2013 the only commentary I would make on this is we run this business on an operating basis not a tax basis. And we're not going to adjust our business strategy directly for a tax strategy but we'll have to see how the year plays out. But agree we're above the de minimis threshold first quarter. Cornelia Miller - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just to come back to the Texas quality payments. So I just want to make sure the 2015 outlook only assumed you received 80% of the 2015 payments, is that correct? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : Mechanically that's correct. The guidance we gave assumed 80% recovery of the 2015 amount and nothing for 2014. Cornelia Miller - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And it now looks like you're sort of tracking similarly to 2014 at this point in the year. Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : It's difficult to say after one quarter. We're certainly bluntly still in the dark on the metrics that we haven't heard about from 2014 as we go into 2015. But also the portion of the revenue that's tied to HEDIS scores, we've found it very difficult to recognize that in the first quarter until our data develops further. So I guess I would just say I don't see anything happening in the first quarter that's going to take us off of what we said in guidance. Cornelia Miller - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you. John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : Sure. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Wright with Sterne, Agee, CRT. Please proceed. Brian M. Wright - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning \u2013 good morning, geez. Good evening. So one real quick question, if one has a view that the stock price goes to $90 what's the cap on the conversion? The incremental kind of share count? John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : I mean the total \u2013 I want to say the total shares underlying the 2020 convert, Brian, are about 13.5 million and then I want to say \u2013 I want to say it's something like five million shares underlying the 2014 convert. I mean I haven't done the math to know what happens at a given share price. And I think it's unrealistic we'd ever reach those numbers. But I think it's $13.5 million on the 2020 and $5.5 million on the 2044. Brian M. Wright - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.: Okay. I'll follow up with you after on some of the details on how to calculate it. Thanks. John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : Okay. Looking forward to it. Thanks. Operator : And a question from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please proceed. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Yes. Thanks. Good evening. I wanted to follow up on I think some of the questions around MLR particularly. So as I look at your \u2013 now you have all the membership disclosed by product. A lot of the new growth is Medicaid expansion and the Marketplaces. So it seems like a lot of the new business, they're probably running at a higher MLR than kind of the existing ABDs and duals where there's not much growth, and after 2016 levels sort of anniversary. So how do you think about what the normalized loss ratio should be across your book of business? And this year you're getting a nice lift, I would imagine, from some of these higher margin businesses, lower MLR. How does that look as you go forward? And what type of improvement are you seeing in your existing ABD and duals populations as far as normalizing the MLR? John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : Ana, give us a minute. We're going back to take a look at what we said at the Investor Day. I think the important thing is rather than look at each individual product line, as we said in our prepared remarks, to look at where the company's going to end up overall, we look at the consolidated. And what we've consistently said is that we want to reach a 1.5% to 2% margin by 2017. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. So I think you had guided to 90 at the Investor Day for this year, which you haven't updated, a 7.5% on the G&A ratio. So it's not a very high bar I guess with 1.5% to 2%. That's net right? I imagine (37:00), I think that's what it was... John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : That's right. The bar I think is \u2013 from the outside it may look easy. From the inside, with all the moving parts, it's a challenge. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : No, I didn't mean it that way (37:12)... John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : And our goal by 2017 is to lower that by 0.5% to 1.5%. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. So right now I just I think what \u2013 all I'm trying to say is that it doesn't look like you would miss that, your normalized parts (37:27). If anything it feels like there might be some upside given that at least for the first quarter you've come in a little bit better, right. So hopefully that's... John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : Well, I think that as Mario and Terry talked about at the last Investor Day, we have a new Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Keith Wilson, who is re-energizing the medical management. And they've taken a very member-centric approach to things. And it seems that as we said, for the first quarter we can say it seems that some of the efforts are taking hold. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. And then you had mentioned also at the I-Day that there's a federal regulation which will help you cross-subsidize. And some of my channel checks are saying that that's due any day. Any more color on that? And will that help you out? J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : No? J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We are \u2013 we're still waiting for those regulations. We thought they would be out. We have no further information. We're just going to have to wait. They'll come out when they come out. John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : And, Ana, to clarify, I don't think we said that the regulations would allow us to cross-subsidize. What we said was it was our opinion, our profession that these are all Medicaid patients. So it makes sense to include the Medicaid expansion lives and the TANF and the ABD in one set of risk mitigation calculations as opposed to three separate ones. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. So, blended with Medicaid. Got it. All right. Thank you. Operator : And we have a question from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please proceed. Unknown Speaker : Sure. Thanks. This is Ace Fablo (39:12) in for Windley. I wanted to circle back to the G&A and just get a sense of that 8.1% starting point. Sure sounds like Puerto Rico once that comes on, that will help out with the leverage. But wanted to get a view of whether or not that was consistent with what you guys were thinking for the first quarter? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : It's Joe speaking. Yeah, when we line up everything on the G&A side it's first quarter, it was very consistent with what we expected for our guidance. Unknown Speaker : Okay. And then besides Puerto Rico, are there other actions that are going to continue to help drive it lower? Or is it more of a function of business mix and scalability? J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : It's scalability really. You know we've got a fair amount of revenue. And you can see by looking at our full-year guidance, we got a fair amount of revenue in addition to Puerto Rico still to come on this year. We've got the three MMP dual programs coming on in Michigan, Texas and South Carolina. If you look back to Investor Day, we also talked about some new programs in Texas that are going to add a lot to the top line. So I would say it's more scalability than anything, plus Puerto Rico. Unknown Speaker : Okay. And then circling back to the HIF, I know you mentioned California. Can you \u2013 I think Michigan and Utah were the other hanging chads. What are the updates there with those states? And what's preventing them from locking up 2015 for you guys? J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think it's just an issue of getting the appropriate documentation. We know that both Utah and Michigan have passed in their most recent budgets dollars to fund the payments but our policy is either we get a check or we get a contract amendment. And we haven't got the contract amendments in Utah or Michigan as of yet. Unknown Speaker : Okay. And then just lastly on Florida, can you just give us an updated view on how things are trending there and what you're expecting in the full negotiation coming up here? J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : On the MMA product I think that Molina like a lot of the other health plans are seeing higher medical care costs than we anticipated when the program was first bid and we are active discussions with ACA and legislature to increase the rates so that things turn out for the, as we expected. Unknown Speaker : Okay. Thanks. Operator : And our next question is from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Christopher J. Benassi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, there. This is Christopher Benassi on behalf of Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Congrats on the quarter. I was wondering if you wouldn't mind walking us back through the HIF reimbursement timeline, I believe you mentioned it would have a $0.29 improvement to EPS. And then following up on that do you see any potential for this HIF timeline to be reduced going forward? John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : Sure. So, on the HIF we did not recognize any HIF revenue associated with the first quarter of 2015 for California, Michigan or Utah. That amount was $16 million or $0.20. The balance, the other $0.09, had to do with the non-recognition of the quality revenue in Texas. Getting back to the HIF we also have $20 million still hanging from 2014 which we did not recognize in the first quarter. We did get a check from the state of California after the quarter was over so we'll recognize that amount in the second quarter and that relates to 2014 unless we get a contract amendment or something from the state of California we will not recognize any of the HIF for 2015. Christopher J. Benassi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you. And just following up on that quickly; MCR looked strong in the quarter. However, with all the market commentary regarding utilization I was just curious if you've seen any upticks geographically or within certain subpopulations? Thank you. John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : We didn't see anything unusual in the first quarter. Christopher J. Benassi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you very much. John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks. Operator : And we have a question from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed. Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Sure. A question around the costs, in particular hep C costs for the quarter. How much of that have you gotten arranged to be passed through to your states at this point versus how much you don't have pass through or don't have agreements on? And then looking at your cost breakdown I can see that pharmacy and capitation costs as a percent of your overall costs is declining. Is that mix related or is there anything in terms of pricing on the fee for service side that's causing that to go down? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : It's Joe speaking. I don't have anything specific on hep C, I will say though in most of our states that issue has either been addressed either through some kind of risk pool, some kind of specific state reimbursement or an attempt to reimburse it in our rates. So I don't think hep C had a \u2013 treatments had a material impact on the first quarter. I think it's a matter now of just refining how states reimburse that's rather than trying to get over the concept of reimbursement. The second point is why is pharmacy would be dropping as a percentage of total medical spend is really driven by just the long-term services and support spend that we incur. One of the things as we shift to \u2013 we talked about shifting to more chronically ill patients or members who need home health assistance. Obviously for someone in some sort of home and community based services setting or in nursing facilities the drug cost is going to be \u2013 while large in absolute terms is a smaller percentage of their total spend. Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And is that with... Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : That's the issue (45:23) in a nutshell. Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And is it true with the capitation component as well? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : Yeah. It's the same story. Nothing dramatically has changed our capitation structure again it's just a lot of the costs with the LTSS are direct rather than capitated. Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question is from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please proceed. Chris D. Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thanks. Hey, guys. I know this is a small number in the Texas quality revenue but the amount you didn't recognize increased by $1 million year-to-year, I just want to make sure there's nothing to read into that, i.e. you have even lower visibility now than you did last year or something is tracking for the worse on the quality side? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : Well that's a really \u2013 that's an astute question. The numbers are very small but curiously enough the percentage of quality revenue that's tied to those measures that we don't have visibility into went from about 50% last year to 60% this year. So I think that's what you're seeing. Chris D. Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. And then the cost of service ratio declined quite a bit year-to-year and came in below where we are. Can you give us some color on what happened there? And just any \u2013 I know you give annual guidance. But sort of quarterly this has been a tough one to predict. Sort of any way to help us think about that would be helpful. Thank you. John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : The cost of service revenue associated with MMS? You know, Chris, nothing leaps to mind. Maybe we can dig into those numbers a little bit more to see what gets ferreted out. Chris D. Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. And then I guess the cash flow too was pretty strong. Was there anything there notable? Thanks. And I'll leave it at that. John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : No. I mean we've been having very strong cash flow. DCP is up. We still \u2013 and a couple of the health plans are accruing money that we have to return to the states. So that is helping cash flow a bit. Chris D. Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. Thanks a lot. John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Chris. Operator : And that was our final question. And I'll now turn the call back to Dr. Molina. J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us. It was a very strong quarter. And we're looking forward to talking to you next quarter on our next earnings release. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Mario Molina. Dr. Mario Molina : Thank you, Juan Jos\u00e9. Good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining us today as we report our second quarter results for 2015. I am pleased to report that during the second quarter, we maintained momentum in our business and continue to deliver great financial results. We are growing, we are diversifying and we are driving strong operating results. Striking a balance between growth and profitability is an imperative for us. As a result, we were very pleased to deliver both revenue and enrollment growth that was nearly 50% greater than what we reported during the second quarter of 2015. After the first two quarters of the year, our net profit margin now stands at 1% and we saw a net profit expansion of 80 basis points sequentially. My father used to say shoemaker mind I last, and we have done so. While speculation and mega deals among the commercial players have been grabbing all the headlines, we have remained focused on growing our core business and we have been involved in several key acquisitions of our own. The transactions that we have announced demonstrate our continued focus on government programs and our ability to use our expertise in providing access to healthcare to those who needed most and who are least able to afford it. We remain focused on our mission to serve low income individuals that require government assistance. Let me provide you with some greater details on each of these transactions. Our transaction with Preferred Medical Plan in Florida will add about 25,000 Medicaid members to our Florida health plan, doubling our Medicaid enrollment in the Miami-Dade market. Many of our existing providers are also contracted this preferred medical plan. Therefore this acquisition will deepen our relationships with providers. We anticipate this transaction will add about $80 million in annual revenue. Medicaid health plans in Florida are currently engaged in discussions with the state regarding premium rates for the next fiscal year and some increases are expected. While premium rates in Florida have not kept pace with medical cost during the current rate year, we remain optimistic about our future in Florida. In fact, we believe that this is the right time to be acquiring other health plans in this market. After all, Florida is the fourth largest Medicaid market in the country. The acquisition of HealthPlus of Michigan is expected to add 90,000 Medicaid and 6000 CHIP members. This will increase our enrollment in Michigan by 40% and expand our geographic footprint by adding two additional counties in the central part of the state. We expect the transaction to add roughly $300 million in annual revenue. With the acquisition of MyCare Chicago, we are entering one of the largest Medicaid counties in the country. Cook county alone accounts for nearly half of the state\u2019s 3.2 million Medicaid eligibles and gives us an opportunity for future growth. In addition to the long-term opportunity, this acquisitions brings in 60,000 additional members, increasing our enrollment in Illinois by 60%. And we expect the incremental revenue from this transaction to be $190 million on an annual basis. Combined, these transactions are expected to add an additional 180,000 new members and approximately $570 million in annualized revenue. While the impact to 2015 maybe small, given the anticipated closing dates, all transactions are expected to be accretive. And when combined with our enrollment from our start up and Puerto Rico, Medicaid expansion in the marketplace, we will have added 900,000 members by the end of the year. In-market acquisitions are an important part of our growth strategy and highly accretive, helping us to expand margins in the future. This is because in-market acquisitions are generally asset purchases, provide us with additional scale and in some instances, a larger service footprint at a small marginal cost. We have considerable experience integrating these types of transactions as we have completed more than 10 asset purchases over the past decade. For the most part, speed to integration for these types of lower risk acquisitions coupled with our existing infrastructure, result in significant accretion value. The acquisition pipeline remains robust. Our recent equity offering and credit facility allow us to remain nimble and continue to take advantage of such opportunities as they arise. Changing gears, I want to briefly address the debt and budgetary challenges currently being faced by Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico pays our premiums weekly and is current with their payments. We will continue to monitor the situation there. We would like to welcome those of you that are new to Molina and to our story. We look forward to speaking with you about our business. We are committed to making a difference by providing compassionate care to those receiving government assistance and most in need of our help. We are pleased with our results so far and more broadly how they contribute to our longer term objectives. Now I will turn the call over to John. John Molina : Thank you, Mario. Good afternoon, everyone. Today we reported net income of $0.72 per diluted share and adjusted net income per diluted share of $0.86. We are particularly pleased that we achieved these results by growing, both our top-line and our profit margins. As Mario briefly touched upon, premium revenue grew in excess of 50% compared with the second quarter of 2014 and our medical care ratio dropped by 60 basis points. This improved medical margin performance coupled with greater administrative cost efficiency and more complete reimbursement of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Health Insurer Fee or HIF. Our second quarter after tax margin grew to 1.1%. This is the first time in our company\u2019s 35-year history that we have reported pretax income of $100 million for a quarter. Our second quarter results demonstrate the diversification of our business even as we remain focused on Medicaid related markets. Medical care ratios at nine of our health plans were lower this quarter than in the second quarter of 2014. Based on our results during the last two quarters, we expect that six of our health plans will each have revenues in excess of $2 billion by the end of the year. Pardon me, will have in excess of $1 billion by the end of the year. We also continued to make progress in securing reimbursement from the HIF. During the second quarter, we received a commitment to reimburse the fee from California, leaving only Michigan and Utah among our state plan partners that have not formally committed to reimbursement of the fee. During the second quarter, we recognized all of the 2014 HIF reimbursement due from California and half of the amount due for 2015. This amounted to $29 million, but because we are still not recognizing HIF reimbursement from Michigan and Utah, the net impact of the HIF reimbursement was only $12 million or $0.14 per diluted share favorable for the quarter. But I want to emphasize, the impact is actually $5 million or $0.06 per share unfavorable year-to-date. Since we are now largely caught up on the HIF corrections, we will cease reporting on this issue on a regular basis in future periods. Regarding Texas quality revenue, you will recall that since the beginning of 2014, about half of our total potential quality revenue is determined based upon performance measures for which we do not have historical information, clear definition or clarity around minimum standards. Through June of this year, this portion of our potential quality revenue amounted to about $32 million, $20 million for all of 2014 and $12 million for the first half of 2015. We will continue to defer recognition of this revenue until we get greater clarity from the state of Texas. I\u2019ve already mentioned that our medical care ratio decreased 60 basis points in the second quarter of this year compared to the second quarter of 2014. Our medical care ratio was unchanged from the first quarter of 2015 at 88.7%. But if we exclude our Puerto Rico operations which was new this quarter, our medical care ratio fell 40 basis points to 88.3% from the first quarter of 2015. Our health plans generally report high MCRs in initial years\u2019 operation and we attach no particular long term significance to Puerto Rico\u2019s high medical care ratio this quarter. This point of our Puerto Rico leads another matter which I want to touch upon, the high degree of variability that occurs in the granular data that we provide. We will always share details of our individual health plan performance. Starting last quarter, we disclosed our revenue and medical care ratios by product line in order to further increase transparency. I want to repeat some things that I said on last quarter\u2019s call. Financial information presented with this degree of granularity is inevitably subject to quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. Please use the detailed geographic and product line data to better understand our business tactics, our market opportunities and challenges and the complexities of our business. Use our consolidated results to understand our strategic goals and opportunities to weigh our performance over time and to form your own assessment of a long-term potential of our company. Getting back to the results, general and administrative expense ratio declined by 30 basis points when compared with the second quarter of 2014. Days in claims payable dropped slightly from the first quarter to second quarters from 50.52 days last quarter to 49.47 this quarter, a decrease of 1.05 days. However, we are up three days when compared to same period last year. As of June 30, 2015, the company had cash and investments of approximately $3.5 billion including in excess of $530 million at our parent company. During the second quarter, we issued 5.75 million shares of common stock, raising more than $370 million in net proceeds. As a result of the offering, our diluted weighted average shares outstanding have increased to just over 52 million shares for the six months ending June 2015. We expect diluted shares outstanding to be approximately 60 million for the third quarter and fourth quarters and approximately 56 million for the full year 2015. These estimates are consistent with the revised outlook we issued June 1st. During our road show for the secondary offering, we told investors that we were exploring a large number of potential acquisitions. As Mario discussed, we have been able to sign up three of those acquisitions. I want to remind everyone that these transactions are still going through the formal closing process and that we expect them to close during the third and fourth quarters of this year. As such these acquisitions will have limited impact on our 2015 results. Finally, I wanted to highlight that today marks a historic milestone in our industry. Medicaid turns 50 years old. On July 30, 1965, President, Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law the Medicaid and Medicare programs. Over the last five decades, these programs have transformed the nation\u2019s healthcare system, protecting the health and well being of millions of families. As pay tribute to this event, we feel privileged that Molina Healthcare has played an active role in the programs, since our inception 35 years ago and we\u2019re excited to continue shaping the future of the program by providing more people with access to quality healthcare. We look forward to talking to you again during our next Investor Day in New York on September 17th. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hello everybody. On the MLR for the first half, so you are at 88.7 and I think your full guidance is still 89.5, can you give us some of the factors that -- a sense on seasonality in the back half of the year, any other factors, does that MLR number now look increasingly conservative; any color? John Molina : A.J., this is John. What I would say is we do have some seasonality Q4, but really the medical costs are coming in line a little bit faster than we expected but I wouldn\u2019t draw any conclusions on what that first half of the year as to the second half of the year, because as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, we\u2019re not going to update guidance unless something material changes. A.J. Rice: Right. And then similarly, this is my follow-up on the SG&A line, if I look at that, you\u2019re 8.1 in the first half, your outlook for the year is 7.6, so in that one you need the back half to be quite bit strong or is that mainly just leverage or is there something else that would happen that would help you on that? John Molina : It\u2019d be continued leverage but I think the thing we have to look at with respect the admin ratio is, as we\u2019ve discussed before, we have profit the caps, medical cost floors and those are achieved largely by reductions in revenue, but in the case of a marketplace for example while we may reduce the revenue for things like risk adjustments, the marketing costs, the broker commissions et cetera are flat. So as a percentage of the revenue, we get from marketplace, it\u2019s higher. But I\u2019d say all in all, both admin and medical claims are -- medical costs are coming in, in a way as Mario said that makes us very pleased. Operator : The next question is from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Sarah James : I was wondering if you could walk us through some of the moving pieces in the quarter. So, as I think about MLR, were there any rate updates that came through and improved things sequentially; was there any benefit from a three-R true up? And then on that SG&A side, was there any impact all from either the financing transactions or due-diligence for M&A that impacted the quarter that wouldn\u2019t be an ongoing cost? John Molina : Okay. Sarah, this is John. Let me see if I can take those three questions now in order. On the MLR side, there were no rate increases. I think that the MLR is where it is because we\u2019re doing good medical management. On the three Rs, there was no true up. And in terms of the SG&A, there was no significant increase either from the offering or from M&A. Sarah James : Got it. And I guess just a follow-up excluding out the one-time items. On Texas, I think you guys had talked about in the past the state providing data finally last quarter to the plans and then there was a review or appeal process. So, where does that stand now as far as closing out\u2026 John Molina : It\u2019s like the John show; I\u2019m getting all the questions. We actually hedged; there are two systems state provides to us to use and unfortunately the last time order from the state the two systems were in bit of a conflict. So, we have no further information other than state is rerunning the data and will get back to us as soon as they have good confirmation. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel. Please go ahead. Tom Carroll : Hi guys. Good afternoon. Another follow-up on Texas while I\u2019m thinking about it. The 32 million that you highlight, remind us again are you cash flowed that money or is that just money you are owed at some point in time. And secondly, in terms of the process, I guess you have some peers in the state that have recognized the fair amount of their share. So, should we take that as being -- maybe the probability is a bit higher that you will eventually recognize those dollars in the near future? Joseph White : To your first question, that\u2019s not a cash flow issue for us. The state, if they were to take money back would have to take money back from us if we miss the measure. So, it\u2019s not a cash flow issue. To the second point, obviously we don\u2019t know what are peers are doing in the state but from our perspective, the quality measures break into two broad categories, about half of them we have which are HEDIS based measures, we have good insight to and we\u2019ve been recognizing revenue associated with those measures. It\u2019s just these other measures that we don\u2019t have insight to that we\u2019re not recognizing revenue. So for us, it splits out about 50-50 of the potential. I don\u2019t know what our peers are doing obviously. Tom Carroll : So on the 32 million, half of that you\u2019ve recognized or half you could, you have better visibility on? Joseph White : That 32 million is what is unrecognized. So, if you take the potential, it would have been around 64 million. We\u2019ve recognized 32 and there is another 32 out there. Tom Carroll : And then just for clarification, the health insurer fee items, those are all contemplated as part of your outlook this year. Correct? John Molina : That\u2019s correct. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Cornelia Miller : This is Cornelia in for Andy. I guess just focusing on Florida for a second, the MLR fell more than 600 basis points quarter-to-quarter. Was that all driven by your marketplace numbers, or did you see any improvement in MMA as well? John Molina : No, it\u2019s marketplace. This is John. Cornelia Miller : And then can you just remind us what you\u2019ve included in guidance for a rate increase in Florida? John Molina : In January we\u2019re expecting 3%. Cornelia Miller : Okay. And then just following up on the marketplace MLR, obviously down significantly to 55.4%. It sounds like that\u2019s not related to any three R true-ups; is there anything else going on in the quarter that we should be thinking about? I mean all these Florida members are super profitable, or\u2026 Joseph White : In general, we\u2019ve been seeing very good experience on the marketplace. As far as three R true-ups we\u2019re helped in a few of our states because of credibility of factors where we\u2019re not having to accrue MLR get backs. But we\u2019ve actually got a nice table on the three Rs at the very end of our 10Q where you can see how we\u2019re positioned for 2015. I think in general though it\u2019s fair to say that pretty much across the board, the marketplaces have come in very well for us this year. Operator : The next question is from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead. Mary Shang : This is Mary Shang in for Josh this afternoon. So, you clearly saw some significant initial enrollment in Puerto Rico. Was this enrollment that you saw in line with your expectations and could you may be provide some more color on the cost trends of these members so far? John Molina : The enrollment is right where we expected to be. Remember in Puerto Rico we are serving two regions and we are the only health plan in those two regions. So, if you are on Medicaid in either of those regions, you are a member of Molina. In terms of cost trends, just a little early to say anything; we\u2019ve got three months worth of experience. So, when we have more to report at the end of the third quarter and certainly going into the fourth quarter. Mary Shang : You\u2019ve been active with your recent acquisitions in Florida, Illinois, Michigan. Could you just provide some more color around what the future pipeline looks for you? I know you mentioned Florida health plans in your prepared remarks. John Molina : Sure. We are seeing smaller health plans just like the three that we talked about today, provider sponsored plans that realize they want to focus on being providers for us and not being in health plan business. And as we\u2019ve discussed in the past we\u2019re also looking at companies that can help broaden our service capabilities. Operator : The next question is from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Peter Costa : The marketplace MLR is so low, 70% or so for the first six months. Do you think that that is something that\u2019s going to trigger the medical loss ratio minimums in that category or is that being accounted for correctly already? John Molina : Peter, in some states it will, as Joe mentioned in some states there is credibility factors which have a different effect. But we\u2019re confident that we are accruing everything correctly for the marketplace. Peter Costa : So we shouldn\u2019t expect that to go higher going forward as you see the performance continue be good if you will. Joseph White : I think as we leave the protection, if you will, the credibility factors as the plans get bigger, we could obviously see higher MCRs. Peter Costa : And then sort of on the same MLR line but different business, the California MLR continues trend a little bit worse. I know you have a lot of improvement in almost every other state but just focusing on California where it did deteriorate again, do you expect that to continue to deteriorate or do you think that can start to improve from here? John Molina : This is John. I think it will start to improve. Peter Costa : And do you want to give any color on why? John Molina : I was waiting for you to ask me that question. We are seeing more of our members go into our own delivery system. We\u2019ve seen -- that has at least two effects. We do know that in our own clinics we tend to get patients with more chronic illnesses, so until we get the risk scores and everything turned around there, I think that we\u2019ll see a little bit higher MCR, we also have some hospital contracts that we\u2019re in the process of renegotiating which are a bit higher than we like them to be. Peter Costa : So, can you give us a timeframe on when some of that stuff will start to hit? John Molina : Probably early next year. Operator : The next question is from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please proceed. Dave Windley : If I take your year-to-date performance and then tack on the, say the net benefit from the HIF that you haven\u2019t collected in the first six months and from everything you\u2019ve said so far, it doesn\u2019t sound like there is significant negative seasonality in the back half. So, if I kind of annualize your number, you are running pretty significantly above your 235 guidance. I know to A.J.\u2019s question you kind of mentioned materiality. Is it still not material enough to make a change on guidance? Dr. Mario Molina : This is Mario. We said at the beginning of the year that we were going to provide annual guidance unless there was a material change. Earlier this year when we did the stock offering, we did update the guidance because of the change in the share count. But at this point we are going to stick by our policy of providing annual guidance. The number is what it is. The performance is running better than what we had forecast. Dave Windley : Alright, so moving on then, a couple of maybe organic opportunities in Iowa where I think you are bidding and then Michigan where you\u2019re going to close an acquisition and there is opportunity there or re-procurement there. I\u2019m wondering what your views are on opportunity to win and/or defend position as the case maybe? Dr. Mario Molina : This is Mario. We obviously feel pretty good about Michigan. As far as Iowa goes, I wouldn\u2019t care to speculate at this point. We submitted what we think was a good response and we will just have to see how the scoring and the awards come out. Operator : The next question is from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Steve Baxter : Hi. This is actually Steve Baxter on for Kevin. I just want to clarify the HIF commentary just to put a fine point on it. The $0.14 when you flagged that in the press release, that\u2019s the amount of revenue you recognized not related to the second quarter of 2015. So if we were trying to think of a run rate, $0.14 is the right number to adjust? John Molina : That\u2019s correct. Steve Baxter : And I guess I\u2019d love to get a little bit of an update on the duals population. I know you caution against too much quarter-to-quarter MLR comparisons but it looks like the MLR jumped up a little bit there. I guess any color on that would be great. And I guess just ongoing dialogue with the states to kind of improve the sustainability of that program would be of interest as well. Dr. Mario Molina : With regard to the MMP contracts, I think the results right now are lumpy and that\u2019s for a couple of reasons. First of all, we\u2019re getting a lot of new enrollment and the numbers are still small. So until things stabilize, I think you will see fluctuations. The other thing is that depending on the state, in some cases, our medical costs are higher than anticipated on the Medicare side whereas in other states the costs have come in a little higher than anticipated on the Medicaid or the LTSS services. And some of that is a function of our experience with those services. But I think that as John pointed out, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it at this point. The numbers are small, things are still in flux. And it\u2019s going to be a while before everything I think settles out. Generally speaking, it takes nine months to a year for things to kind of stabilize. So don\u2019t read too much into the quarter-to-quarter numbers. Steve Baxter : I guess just one question on the exchanges. It seems like you have a significant amount of room to re-price that business to kind of get to a margin that might be a little more sustainable and won\u2019t really put you up against all the three R corridors. Can you talk about what your expectations are for growth around that program over the next couple of years and how that might impact your government comp tax susceptibility? John Molina : We don\u2019t anticipate being able to adopt the executive comp starting next year because the marketplace has been successful for us. We like the product and are going to continue to try and grow it the way we did in 2015. Steve Baxter : I guess that just begs the question then on do you have a sense of what the adjustment would look like to your tax rate? Joseph White : I think it was around 40 bps but obviously our tax rate has been in such flux lately that I\u2019m not sure you can really adjust that very easily. But I believe it was around 40 bps when we talked about it last year. Operator : The next question is from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink. Please go ahead. Ana Gupte : Just following up again on the marketplace, why is it that you are doing so well? I\u2019m just curious why is it that your margins are so good? And it seems like for Medicaid players in general as compared to players like Humana which generally in the same states as well, not just in California, seem to be in trouble. Is it because you are contracting on Medicaid networks whereas they are not or I\u2019m just curious what\u2019s going on? Dr. Mario Molina : It\u2019s difficult question for us to answer. What I can say is that our strategy was to offer products that would be attractive to people who are at the lower end of the FPL, so maybe upto about 250% of poverty and that we wanted to build this as an extension of Medicaid. So that people who were coming off of Medicaid, the so called churn would be able to stay with their health plans, stay with their doctor. That\u2019s how we\u2019ve designed the products. I can\u2019t tell you why there is a difference between us and some of the other health plans. But we had a strategy. I also think that we were conservative going in and that\u2019s allowed us to lower our rats a little bit in the second year. So far our strategy is holding. We\u2019ll see what it does in the third year. Ana Gupte : So it\u2019s partly maybe not just the networks but you\u2019re targeting a certain segment of that subsidized population, it sounds like. And just following up on that, when I look at the 2016 proposed rates and I expect you all are still in the negotiating phase of the HIF marketplaces. You are filing for something on average that looks like a rate reduction probably and I may not have all the states and all but somewhere in the 8ish percent range. And is that to kind of get to the more normalized sustainable state or am I missing some data somewhere? John Molina : The ability to have affordable products for the population that Mario talked about is very important and core to the mission of the company. So, our ability to lower the price going into next year was very important and with the balance being able to lower our costs for our members and making sure that we have the right margin on the business. I don\u2019t know if it was 8% across the board or what but it was our goal to balance those two items. Operator : The next question is from the line of Brian Wright with Sterne, Agee CRT. Please go ahead. Brian Wright : Two real quick ones. On the California PMPM, I just would have thought that with the health insurance fee accrual this quarter, it would\u2019ve been a bit higher, because I mean even with that it\u2019s down year-over-year, so is there anything one-timeish in the revenue that\u2019s driving that? Joseph White : Brian, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s one-timeish but remember last year there was the PCP parity and then also we had some retroactive adjustments to our MMP rates in California sort of normal course reconciliation that hit this quarter. John Molina : Brian, also if you\u2019re looking at the revenue in the detail, we exclude the HIF from that. Brian Wright : And then lastly, it looks like CMS is allowing the states to have the option to extend the duals pilots another two years. I was just curious if you had spoken to California and kind of gotten their lenience on that option. John Molina : We haven\u2019t started to engage with the state obviously. We put a lot of effort into the MMP programs across all the states and so we like to see the programs continue. But we\u2019re not going to speak for the state Medicaid agencies. Dr. Mario Molina : And let me just add, this is Mario. I think that it\u2019s really appropriate to extend these pilots because the truth of the matter is some of them got started late and three years is a very short time to really analyze the effectiveness. By the time you get all the data and then try to analyze it, you\u2019re talking about probably two to three years anyway. So, I think the three year timeframe was pretty short to do a really good analysis of the value of these new MMP programs. It makes sense to extend them. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Christopher Benassi : Congrats on another great quarter. This is Christopher Benassi on for Matthew Borsch. With all the industry consolidation that has been occurring, could you touch on where Molina sits within the managed care ecosystem and how you are strategically positioned? And just following that up, do think the push for scale has been overemphasized? Dr. Mario Molina : This is Mario. Let me take a minute on that. I think that the way things are settling out, Molina is turning out to be the purest of the pure plays that we are really focused on our mission which is to serve low income patients who receive some form of government assistance with their healthcare premiums. As you can see from the acquisitions that we have done, we continue to grow; we\u2019re going to add 900,000 members this year. We have a lot of opportunity in front of us in Medicaid and especially when it comes to programs like the duals and the long-term care services. So there is plenty of room for us to grow, lots of accretive opportunities in front us and that\u2019s I think where we sit in the sort of managed care ecosystem. Christopher Benassi : And just to dovetail off that, would you maybe be willing to touch on any areas you\u2019d be interested in expanding into geographically and how do you think you\u2019ll be positioned for any divestitures in the upcoming consolidation -- in the upcoming wave of consolidation? Dr. Mario Molina : Clearly we\u2019re interested in Georgia and Iowa. We remain interested in states that have significant managed care opportunities in Medicaid. We are looking at companies for acquisitions that might give us capabilities that we don\u2019t currently have. And as far as divestures go, the fact that we have the equity offering behind us now and the line of credit, we\u2019re well poised to take advantage and move quickly in opportunities that they may arise. Christopher Benassi : And I guess one more quick follow-up as well. Where would you feel comfortable with your debt to cap? You screen towards the bottom end of our coverage and you have a great balance sheet, so just kind of curious around that. Dr. Mario Molina : I think that after the equity offering, we\u2019re pretty happy with where we are right now. Operator : The next question is from the line of Gary Taylor with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Gary Taylor : Most of my questions have been answered. I actually just have one small clarification from a question earlier. Did I hear correctly that you said the sequential year-over-year improvement in the Florida medical loss ratio was mostly due to the performance of marketplace plans, is that correct? John Molina : That\u2019s correct Gary. Operator : The next question is from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead. Chris Rigg : Mario, just a follow-up on what you said a few minutes ago about potentially buying capabilities that you don\u2019t have. Does that theoretically mean if some Medicare Advantage assets came up for sale, you guys would take a look? Dr. Mario Molina : I think that we would be willing to take a look at Medicare Advantage assets, sure. We\u2019d be looking at Medicare, Medicaid other companies that could fill in parts of our business portfolio in the area of long-term care services; there is a variety of things. We wouldn\u2019t necessarily shy away from Medicare Advantage. Chris Rigg : This is really just a follow-up on at least two questions that have been asked with regard to guidance. I guess when I look at the year-to-date MCR and the year-to-date G&A, then look back where you\u2019re at guidance wise, is it just conservatism in the outlook or are you actually indeed looking for a big step down on an absolute basis of G&A and the MCR to bump in a very meaningful way in the last half of the year? Dr. Mario Molina : I would say that we tend to be conservative, if you look at the way we\u2019ve handle things like the Texas pay for performance revenue and some of these other things, we tend to be on the conservative side and we would rather be that way; same thing with the health insurance fees. We think that health insurance tax will ultimately all be paid and we\u2019ve assumed that in our guidance but we haven\u2019t recognized all of it yet. So, we tend to be conservative. Chris Rigg : Got it. And I appreciate that but on the MCR in particular, is there anything that we should know about that actually is going to drive that meaningfully higher in the back half of the year or we should just take the conservative commentary on its face? Dr. Mario Molina : There are no events that we\u2019re aware of right now that I think will drive the MCR higher. John did mention there is some seasonality. We typically see higher medical costs in the fourth and first quarters of the year. But aside from that, no. We continue to work on the MMP and the Medicare costs but nothing out of the ordinary. Operator : The next question is follow up from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel. Please go ahead. Tom Carroll : Just a few others here just to think about. So, on Texas, the $32 million, how do you expect that to hit the bottom-line, should it come into play? Is this just a tax adjustment and the rest of it falls right to the bottom line and is it around $0.30 a share? Is that what you think about? Joseph White : Whatever comes in would be a direct increase to pretax income. So, there is no offset in terms of expenses or anything. Tom Carroll : And then secondly, somewhat conceptual; in Utah and Michigan, the Affordable Care Act rolled out 18 months ago, we\u2019ve had visibility on this thing now for what five years. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s been that long. What do you think the holdup is in these two markets; are these guys just stringing you along for another few months and then eventually it\u2019s going to hit or maybe give us some sense of what you think these markets are -- what are they thinking? John Molina : I don\u2019t think that either state is intentionally staying there so long. In both Michigan and Utah, the dollars have been passed through the budget by the legislatures. But in fairness, there is a lot of stuff going on in both of those states. Michigan is putting out a new RFP; Utah is taking about expansion of Medicaid. And what we\u2019re waiting for is the contractual language, the contracts amendment to solidify that. So, we are very comfortable that the both states intend to pay us in the future and we\u2019re being patient. And that\u2019s why again it\u2019s becoming a smaller and smaller issue. So we\u2019re happy not to talk about it anymore. Dr. Mario Molina : Tom, is the question about the health insurance fee or Medicaid expansion? Tom Carroll : The health insurance fee, the fee side of things. Dr. Mario Molina : Okay. I misunderstood. Thanks. Tom Carroll : John I won\u2019t ask you about it anymore. And then lastly on your acquisitions, I think you said they were going to be accretive but where do you expect these to operate in 2016? Are these operating in line with your broader organization in terms operating margin or is there going to be some further ramp in year one where you\u2019ve got to get in there with the Molina secret sauce and get it going? John Molina : Since these are in-market or \u201cbolt-on acquisitions\u201d, they tend to perform slightly better than company average but we\u2019ll get into the accretion numbers etcetera in 2016 at our normal Investor Day A. Tom Carroll : Great. Thank you very much. That\u2019s what I was looking for. Operator : Okay. Gentlemen, there are no other questions left in the queue. I\u2019ll turn it back to you. Please continue with your presentation or closing remarks. Dr. Mario Molina : Great. Thank you. Well everyone, we hope that you will have a good summer what\u2019s left of it and look forward to seeing you again at the Investor Day in New York in September. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

This call is being recorded and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available at our company's website, molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Mario Molina. J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Juan Jos\u00e9 and thanks everyone for joining us on the call today as we review our financial results and key accomplishments for the quarter. As outlined in today's earnings release, we continued to grow enrollment and revenue when compared to last year and last quarter. We're making progress on our long-term margin improvement efforts. In addition, we remain watchful of new business opportunities. For example, over the last three quarters we've announced six transactions. These acquisitions have afforded us new avenues to expand our current health plan business and add capabilities to our service offering. Since we covered a considerable amount of information at our last Investor Day in New York just last month today, I will primarily highlight a few recent developments and discuss some of the things that have changed since our presentation in September. John will address our quarterly financials in greater detail during his remarks. For now, all I have to say is that those results are very good indeed. As of this September nearly 18 million people have gained health insurance by signing up for Medicaid or the marketplace as a result of the Affordable Care Act. The uninsured rate has fallen from a high of 18% to nearly 11%, the lowest uninsured rate in 50 years. And we at Molina Healthcare are doing our part to ensure that everyone has access to care. Our enrollment has grown by approximately 1.5 million members to 3.5 million since January of 2014. Today, we serve more than 0.5 million Medicaid expansion members and over 200,000 low-income marketplace members. But our contribution to healthcare goes beyond the numbers of members we serve. Our most important contribution lies in our commitment to providing access to quality healthcare for our members. To that end, we have set about expanding and deepening the care capabilities that we bring to our members. We are focusing on quality outcomes, care integration, and measurable results. During our Investor Day, we talked at great length about our acquisition of Providence Human Services. You will recall that Providence is one of the nation's largest providers of behavioral and mental health services with 6,800 employees, more than 80% of which are client facing, and operations in 23 states and the District of Columbia. The company's broad national footprint is deployed by a local level enabling it to effectively target specific needs in diverse geographies. As states continue to look for cost effective strategies to manage the care of individuals with more complex healthcare and behavioral needs, we will continue to see more states move towards the integration of behavioral health and medical services. We're excited about the opportunity to pursue these initiatives with our new capability. And we look forward to bringing the skills, enthusiasm, commitment, and expertise of the Providence team to our members. In the meantime, we remain focused on closing this transaction in the near future. Given our recent acquisition activity, I wanted to remind everyone of our approach to M&A. In general, our acquisition strategy falls into three categories. New markets, existing markets, and new capabilities. When we target a new market, our goal is to continue to diversify our geographic footprint by increasing the number of state contracts that we hold. Over the long-term, this allows us to leverage our administrative infrastructure across a broader revenue base and drive down cost. In an existing market, our goal is to strengthen our competitive position and market share by pursuing bolt on acquisitions. These types of transitions typically see higher accretion levels and given our established infrastructure in these markets, enable us to drive short-term administrative leverage and create long-term value. When evaluating a new capability or the enhancement of an existing capability or provider arrangement, our strategy is to strengthen provider alignment to ensure our goals align with our providers goals, improving medical costs over time. Our pipeline remains robust and we have continued to execute on our acquisition strategy. Integral Health Plan in Florida is a 90,000 member Medicaid plan operating in the Pensacola, Tampa, Sarasota and Fort Myers regions. This acquisition further expands our Medicaid footprint to seven of the 11 Medicaid regions across the state. We expect the Integral acquisition to generate approximately $250 million in annualized revenue and that the transaction will close later this year. In Illinois, Loyola Physician Partners serves as a medical home for approximately 20,000 members in Cook County. This acquisition further expands our Chicago area footprint, complementing our recently announced acquisition of MyCare in July. Loyola is expected to generate approximately $50 million in revenue on an annualized basis and we anticipate that this transaction will close in the first quarter of 2016. As I mentioned before, the integration process for in market acquisitions benefits from our existing infrastructure and local presence. Because of this, the process requires minimal resources at the corporate level and allows for a significant portion to be completed locally. Our record number of acquisitions this year, while significant, has not diminished our focus on retaining existing business. In Michigan, for example, we currently provide services in 50 counties where approximately 1.3 million individuals eligible for Medicaid receive care. Our current enrollment, which includes members from the HealthPlus acquisition, is about 340,000 members across multiple lines of business. Earlier this month, the State of Michigan announced its health plan recommendations for their Medicaid program to begin January 2016. And we are pleased to announced that Molina Healthcare of Michigan was recommended for eight regions covering 65 counties. Our dual eligible programs continue to drive up membership and premium revenue quarter-over-quarter, with the majority of our states completing the passive enrollment process. Texas will complete passive enrollment this month, while South Carolina is still purely voluntary, with a passive enrollment date now set for April 1. As we near the end of the passive enrollment phase in these programs, it is important to understand that our focus shifts from enrolling new members to member retention. Last, I want to congratulate our New Mexico Plan President, Patty Kehoe, and the staff of our New Mexico Health Plan for being recognized at the Pinion Level by Quality New Mexico as part of its New Mexico Performance Excellence Awards. The award recognizes organizations that show evidence of using systemic processes as a foundation to attain improved overall outcomes. That concludes my commentary about the quarter. We continue to experience an exciting and extended period of growth. We continue to be well-positioned for the future and I look forward to what that will bring. With that, I will now turn the call over to John for a look at our financial performance in the quarter. John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : As Mario noted, from a financial perspective this was an excellent quarter for Molina Healthcare. Net income per diluted share more than doubled to $0.77 this quarter compared to $0.33 in the third quarter of 2014. For the year to date, net income per diluted share is $2.07 compared to approximately $0.60 for the same period last year. Adjusted EPS for the quarter increased to $0.89 per diluted share compared to just $0.48 during the same quarter a year ago. Before I get into the details of the quarter, I want to point out a couple of the most important takeaways from our progress for the first three quarters of 2015. First, top line revenue remains strong. Total revenue reached $10.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This is the second year in a row in which we have recorded more revenue year-to-date through September than during the entire previous year. Second, we continue to expand our margins. Our net profit margin for the last six months was 1.1%, a 70 basis point improvement over the last year. Our margin improvement over last year has been driven by three key factors, higher revenue, improved medical cost efficiencies and full reimbursement of the Affordable Care Act Health Insurance Fee. As is usually the case, there are some moving parts in the numbers when looked at on a quarterly basis, so let me tell you how those parts fit together. First, we have now recognized all revenue related to Medicaid Health Insurance Fee Reimbursement from January 2014 through September 2015. Our final HIF catch up this quarter added approximately $25 million to pre-tax income for the quarters, $8 million of which related to 2014. This amount was offset by $25 million in reduced revenue related to 2014 for medical cost corridors and profit limitations. The reduction in revenue related to 2014 is the result of the challenges posed by cost floors and profit limitations that are built around vague, ambiguous and poorly defined contract terms. We have several other costs floors and profit limitations to settle so I don't want to imply that this issue is behind us. But we have started the process, and with time will come more clarity. The important point to note is that these two items offset each other. Next, our medical care ratio continues to improve year-over-year, as we reported an 88.9% medical care ratio for the last nine months, compared to 89.6% in the same period last year. Absent the $25 million reduction related to the 2014 cost floor true-ups, which I just mentioned, our third quarter medical care ratio would have been consistent with the first two quarters of this year. Our MMP plans or Medicare Medicaid Plan, in particular on a quarter-over-quarter basis saw significant improvement. We continued to benefit from administrative cost leverage but you need to look a little bit deeper into the numbers to see it. If we ignore significant marketplace, broker and exchange fees, which weren't present last year our G&A ratio was 7.4% for the third quarter of 2015. It is 7.5% year-to-date. As a reminder, we do not provide quarterly guidance, and do not change guidance unless there is a material change in our business. Therefore, we're not going to adjust the year-to-date guidance that we've previously given and you should take nothing regarding our operations from that. Our results demonstrate that we continue to make progress towards achieving our 2017 margin goals that we have set for ourselves. I want to mention that while we're not providing specific guidance for 2016 on this call, I want to make a few general comments regarding the marketplace. First, open enrollment period for 2016 is slated to start this upcoming Sunday, November 1. Our premium levels are competitive headed into the enrollment window and we believe the marketplace will continue to be profitable in 2016. Second, I want to point out that the drop in marketplace enrollment that we saw between the second quarters and third quarters of this year is due to general attrition. Unlike enrollment in Medicaid, marketplace membership does not grow or replenish throughout the year. Mario touched on our acquisitions earlier, so let me just add that three health plan acquisitions remain open and are anticipated to close in the fourth quarter of 2015 or in early 2016. Combined, these account for roughly 180,000 new members or $300 million in new top-line revenue from health plan operations on an annual basis. Days in claims payable was flat sequentially and the company had cash and investments in excess of $3.7 billion, including approximately $470 million at the parent. As we discussed during Investor Day, we anticipate cash outflows will accelerate in the fourth quarter, as we begin to pay for acquisitions that have closed and disperse accrued dollars related to Medicaid expansion corridors. Finally, at our Investor Day in February 2013, we set our goal to double the size of the company from $6 billion in revenue to a run rate of $12 billion in revenue by the end of 2015. I'm pleased to report that as of the end of the third quarter, we remain forced to exceed that goal. We have achieved this by continuing to emphasize providing access to high-quality care, by operating in the right states, pursuing the right programs, building the right provider networks and hiring the best employees. This past year, we began shifting our focus towards expanding our margins. And as you can see from our results, we're getting some traction on that front for which we are pleased. This concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take questions. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please to ahead. Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes. Thank you. My first question is on the rate outlook, as you head into next year and I'm asking partly in the context of another large competitor or company in the industry that talked to seeing or potentially seeing some adverse impact going into next year. Can you just talk about where you stand relative to rate resets? John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : Sure, Matt. We did get a rate adjustment in Florida, that's effective September 1, that I believe is about a gross 7% increase, but there are some provider passes et cetera. So it'll end up being somewhere in the neighborhood of 5%, 5.5%. I believe that's the only one that we have now that's sort of lock downed. Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And what are you anticipating for some of your other geographies. I mean, I guess the question I'm asking is, is this an environment where Medicaid plans have generally been doing well and you find some of your states are in a mode where they're contemplating rate increases that might be tougher? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : Matt, if you look back over the last several years, the success of plans like Molina increasing our profitability, is due more to our own operations, than has been to increases in rates. We've been experiencing flat to low single-digit rates for the past several years. So, I don't know that we're going to be expecting decreases or anything of that nature. We will see some or likely to see some, with respect to the Medicaid expansion rates because we are accruing money to give back under those programs. Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Matt, this is Mario. If you go back to our Investor Day, I think there was a nice table where we went through our expectations around rate increases. And there's really not been much changed since that Investor Day presentation. Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Good fair enough. If I could just on the -- on the cost and rebate floors that you referred to, is the -- the $25 million there that was offset by recruitment of the Health Insurer Fee. Is that, that was something that you were not in a position to recognize last year because you just couldn't know or didn't have a good basis for knowing how it was going to come out? John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : That's correct. Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Got it. John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : We had money accrued but this was above and beyond that. Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And do you feel that you are closer to understanding what the methodology is at least that you'd be in a better position to predict it going forward? John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : As long as they don't change the methodology, I think we're in good shape. Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Fair enough. All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe just following up, make sure I understand the $25 million adjustment. Is -- when you guys laid out your guidance for this year, should we think that that was in there or it was just such an unknown that you did not have that in your guidance? John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : Now, A.J., a big portion of that came from New Mexico and Washington. Washington was a change in the risk adjustment methodology. So we had no visibility to it when we put in our guidance numbers. And in New Mexico it related to the retroactive adjustments that they made with respect to a certain population that came in, I guess retroactively. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And is it, I know you said you think you're getting your arms around all the 2014 exposure. Are there open ended issues with respect to what's happening in 2015 that might be like this either for the fourth quarter or next year? John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : There are potentially because some of the methodologies are not articulated very clearly in the state contract. So, there is some interpretation of medical costs and such. We believe that in the discussions we have with the states that are impacted, there was a good dialogue with the state regulators and we would hope that there wouldn't be much impact either way. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And just, I know you don't update full year outlook unless there is a material change, but I guess the $25 million, which wasn't contemplated, would seem to me to be meaningful. You're not updating guidance in any way for that. So, does that imply that the rest of the business is effectively \u2013 you're raising your outlook for the rest of the business to offset that, is that the way we should \u2013 because I think you did say you always had contemplated collecting the Health Insurance Fee, albeit, you didn't know what quarter it was going to come in. John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : Again, I hate to isolate one factor and say that is the only thing that's material. We have a number of acquisitions that are coming in in the fourth quarter that we didn't contemplate at the beginning of the year, that certainly will have an impact on earnings. And to try and pinpoint just for the sake of a single quarter doesn't make a lot of sense. I would say that from a revenue and profit margin perspective, we are at a place that is a little bit further than what we thought, but it doesn't make sense since what we're really driving to is a sustainable profit margin in 2017, to really monkey around with the numbers for one quarter. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And maybe just one last data point question there. I guess you picked up 65,000 in Medicaid expansion lives during the quarter. I guess it's \u2013 it seems to be late in the year to be seeing more Medicaid expansion unless you're in \u2013 there's somehow a new market or is this acquisitions that are doing that? How did you end up picking up 65,000 new Medicaid expansion lives? John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : It is for the most part the acquisitions. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. All right. Thanks a lot. John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. I hate to harp on this $25 million issue, but just want to make sure I understand. Obviously, they've changed the methodology with which they're looking back at 2014. Is that now contemplated in your thoughts for 2015 as well? Or have you sort of recalibrated based on what the states are telling you in terms of floor definitions, et cetera? John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : We think, Josh, that we've got it pretty well ironed out now. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. But did you have \u2013 I guess my question is, did you have any catch-up accruals in the third quarter to account for the fact that if they applied the same methodology, for argument's sake, that maybe you'd owe more money back to the states as well? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : Josh, it's Joe speaking. Very insignificant, because if you think of it, the bulk of this activity happened in 2014. So, there were some adjustments, but they were relatively insignificant relating to 2015, a few million dollars. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. But you know what I mean, Joe, where I say, if they are assuming, whatever they are defining these costs to be or the premium calculation, I would assume if you guys were owing money \u2013 if you guys owed money last year, maybe you'd owe it again this year. But it doesn't sound like you've made any extra accruals for this year, this all relates to the prior year? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : No, Josh, to be clear, we true up all accruals through the report date based on our knowledge as of that date. So we have adjusted those numbers. It's just that the impact on 2015 wasn't particularly severe. So, for example, if you think of New Mexico, most of the retroactivity happened in 2014. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. So that was a specific cohort. I got you. Got you. Okay. And then just on Puerto Rico, the MLR moved down from, say, 95%, I assume that was just sort of a target accrual number, to just below 90%. I guess I am curious how operations are going there and are you guys now accruing based on claims or just better estimates in terms of your targets? I'm just curious why the MLR came down there. Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : Josh, it's Joe speaking. We are moving towards reliance on claims, but oftentimes in the initial months of a startup, we generally tend to run higher MCRs, so what you're seeing now is we're moving closer to what we expect that to run. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. So, a 90%-ish number is what you would expect in the future or you think it comes down from there? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : I wouldn't think it would drop much more below 90%. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got you. So, clearly no claims trends or anything that are unusual or out of the ordinary that you didn't expect? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : That's correct. So far it appears to be what we expected it to be. If you look back to, Mario mentioned our guidance presentation at the beginning of the year, we thought it would come in around 91%. So, it's pretty much coming in where we thought it would. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Okay. Unknown Speaker : Anything else, Josh? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks for the question. Question sort of relates to the guidance and then sort of known items in the fourth quarter, I like to break it down by business instead of by state. If you look at your original guidance for the year on a GAAP basis it was $2.35. After nine months you're at $2.07, so that leaves sort of $0.28 for the fourth quarter. And I want to be clear that you're not actually reiterating the $2.35, you're just not updating that. So it's not necessarily $0.28 that you're telling us to get to for the fourth quarter. And then the remainder of the question is, are there known items to you now going into the fourth quarter that are going to go up either in the Medicaid expansion business, and you've been running at a very low MLR there. You said you've been accruing for the various updates, but is there something that's going to make that go up, that loss ratio go up in the fourth quarter? The same question regarding the medical \u2013 the marketplace business, where you're at sort of 70% loss ratio. Do you expect that to go higher in the fourth quarter? And then third, your acquisitions. Overall, do you expect them to be accretive or dilutive going into the fourth quarter? John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : So, Pete, that's a lot of great questions there, so let me see if I can parse it out. I'm going to start with the three business lines questions first and then get to guidance. With respect to the Medicaid expansion, you have to remember that the GAAP definition for Medical Care Ratio is different than what the states are using and the states frankly are using different requirements, or different components depending on the state. But we don't expect other than normal seasonality that that should increase materially. With the marketplace, I would say the same thing. We did see some deterioration in the enrollment. It may be that folks didn't pay their premium and some were dropped off and it's most likely that the folks who didn't pay their premiums were not using \u2013 utilizing a lot of services anyway. So, there may be a bit of a mix shift there. But again, I don't think it's going to mean anything material. The third question was acquisitions. We did close a couple of acquisitions in this quarter, the HealthPlus acquisition and the Integral acquisition. Pardon me, and the smaller one in Florida, Integral will close in the fourth quarter, Preferred was closed in the current quarter. We do tend to see pent-up demand early on with these types of acquisitions. I think we've talked about that ad nauseum before, so that you may see something. But then we'll also get some possibly towards of the end of the fourth quarter, some of the normalization from the acquisitions that closed in the third quarter. So again, I don't know that that's going to be a significant impact. With respect to guidance, I think the way you characterize it is correct. We're not updating guidance, on the other hand, we're not confirming that low number. It is -- the number is going to be what it is after we have the medical costs and the admin costs running through there. You will see an increase in the admin costs related to what we're doing in terms of the marketplace in Medicare enrollment. You may see a little bit higher medical cost because it is the fourth quarter, but nothing that I would is say is extraordinary. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. That was helpful. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Stephen Baxter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hello, this is Steve Baxter filling in for Kevin. Sorry to come back to the $25 million again, does that all relate to the TANF businesses in Washington and New Mexico or is there any of that spread out in ABD? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : It's Joe speaking. It's about $20 million or so related mainly to TANF in New Mexico and the rest to expansion in Washington. Stephen Baxter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, thanks. So I guess if I am looking at the sequential TANF, CHIP MLR it was up about 300 basis points in rough math, I guess we'd probably explain about half of that. I guess is there anything else you want to highlight there in terms of kind of pressure you saw in the quarter or is that just reading too much into it? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : I think we'd say that's reading too much into it, it's a single quarter. I wouldn't \u2013 I wouldn't read beyond John's remarks about rates at the beginning of the call. Stephen Baxter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then, I guess the sequential movement in the marketplace MLR. I think it was in the mid-50s in the second quarter, now moving into the mid-70s. Is that the progression that you would expect? I guess, it's hard for us to totally understand how that business is running, I think you guys are the only ones who disclose it, is that correct? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : Yeah, we don't have enough history with this large of a population to draw any conclusions definitively at this time. Stephen Baxter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : I think, with that said we can say that year-to-date number, it's pretty solid. Stephen Baxter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : Focus on the year-to-date not the quarter. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Cornelia Miller - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. This is Cornelia in for Andy. So some of your large cap peers have discussed competitive pricing on the exchanges and some potential for enrollment declines next year. Do you think you can grow your presence meaningfully on the exchanges and do you have any expectations to pick-up lives from some of the co-ops closing? John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : This is John. I don't know if we have too many of the co-ops closing in the states that we are doing the marketplace. We priced our products at a point we thought they would be competitive and yet remain profitable, and I would also want to make sure that people understand it's not just the premium, it's also things like co-pays, deductibles, et cetera that really roll into what a competitive financial package is. But we think, we're well positioned for the marketplace going into next year. Cornelia Miller - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, just in Florida, it looks like your MLR increased almost 600 basis points quarter-to-quarter. Is it possible to breakout what that was driven by (33:45) long-term care versus the exchanges or should we be thinking about the majority of that was the increase from the 55% to 73% in the exchange MLR? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : Yeah. It's Joe speaking, you have it at the end, it's a trend in marketplace. Cornelia Miller - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah. Thanks. Good evening. First question is about the RFPs. You obviously won in Michigan, Georgia and Iowa were not successful. So as you look at the wins and the criteria are there any learnings from what might have made things different? And what the criteria that are being used right by largely just incumbents versus new entrants? J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, this is Mario. I think, the clearly incumbents in a state like Georgia have an advantage. You're operating there, you've got your networks in place, you're well known both to the state and to the providers. So that clearly played into it. I don't want to comment on Iowa. We are happy with the results in Michigan. I wouldn't read a whole lot into it, they were three RFPs in three different states with a lot of different criteria. So it's hard to draw conclusions across them Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : And as you bought the behavioral piece in Providence and other capabilities you're building it seems to be the services. And you look at the upcoming pipeline of RFPs, can you comment on what those might look like, and I believe Virginia comes out maybe in the next year and Pennsylvania is out there, Nebraska and so on. J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we didn't do the acquisition because of the RFPs. We did it because we believe there is an overall trend in the Medicaid program to integrate and coordinate behavioral health with the medical benefits, and that's a long-term trend. At the same time, in many states where we're being asked to manage those benefits we felt that it was prudent for us to have a stronger presence in the behavioral health area, and also to have providers that we can draw on. So Providence is largely a provider organization, providing care to Medicaid beneficiaries. It matches very well with our business and our strategy. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Got it. Thanks. One more if I may on the G&A. Where do you think this will settle out here? You have some pressure here, with some drivers for that. What is just the target right now on the normalized G&A and then on the loss ratio as well with the 89.3%. So is it still at the 2% net margin that we should be kind of thinking about and what the timing of that margin might be? Can you give us some color? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : Ana, we haven't changed our thinking in terms of where we want to be in 2017. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Great. And then one final one, if I might. On exchanges you say you're positioned well, obviously we're hearing a lot of angst from others. You had 200,000 (37:03) losses this quarter but it's sort of 200,000 plus. Any thoughts on what you might expect to see in the open enrollment season that is starting a couple of days from now? J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, this is Mario, we have not provided any guidance on what we think our 2016 marketplace is going to look like. It's really hard to tell. We have put together what we think are competitive rates. We remain in operations in all the states where we had operations last year. We have slightly expanded our footprint by adding a few new counties. But remember too that the primary goal of our entering into the marketplace was to provide continuity of care for people that had been on Medicaid and may be no longer qualified and had become uninsured as a result. And that continues to be the strategy. If you look at our marketplace enrollment, it is largely people below 250% of poverty. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah. That makes a ton of sense. Yeah, thanks, Mario. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Wright with Sterne Agee CRT. Please go ahead. Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT : Thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions. Is there a way or do you have any guess or sense as to kind of what the buckets of attrition for the public marketplace is between tax documentation, immigration documentation and failure to pay premiums? And just kind of any insights into deadlines that may have occurred in the third quarter specifically for any of those issues? John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : Brian, this is John. You're working way too hard, if you start this by saying good morning. We don't have the granular detail in terms of why people rolled off the marketplace during the third quarter. Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT : Okay. And then... John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : It'd just be speculation on our part. Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT : Yeah. Do you have anything procedurally as far as any insights into some of the procedural documentation kind of deadlines for any of those issues or... John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : I don't believe that they give us reasons why people drop off, whether it's, whatever you had cited to. J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We're \u2013 Brian, this is Mario, the answer is no. Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT : Okay, then no worries. And then one that I know you can help me out with. Texas kind of picked up a bit sequentially, was there \u2013 on the MLR side. Was there anything kind of one time-ish or anything that you could point us to to what may be driving some of that? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : Go ahead Joe. Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : It's the launch of the MMP in Texas, Brian, that's picking up speed. Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT : Okay. John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : So, we'll run higher (40:00) MCR in the initial stages. Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT : So, that's just an initial \u2013 based on guests, but not based on claims? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : Correct. John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : Correct. Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT : Great. Okay, thank you. John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hey, guys. Not to beat this horse to death but on the $25 million, can you give us just a sense of sort of the gestation of how that occurred? I mean, is this something that just sort of came up during the quarter or has this been \u2013 particularly I think, you said New Mexico it's about $20 million. Sort of how long has this been ongoing and when you kind of came to a resolution on it? John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : I'll take the first part of that. If you flip back through our 10-Qs, particularly in the Washington situation, we've been talking about this for a number of quarters. The issue related to Washington is essentially our rates are tied to premium adjustment across \u2013 risk adjustment across the entire population and we don't have visibility into that. We've been talking about that for a long time in the 10-Qs and we just got clarity on it just this quarter. You can also go back to our Investor Day back in September where we talked a fair amount about this. But suffice to say, these are \u2013 until these amounts are at least settled for the first year, it's very uncertain as to the actual mechanics of the calculation and the definitions involved. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. And then just on the guidance, again I appreciate your comments. But is there any \u2013 you kind of gave some of the puts and takes for the fourth quarter, but is there anything large either on the plus side or the negative side that we should be thinking about or is it just sort of normal business trends with some impacts from maybe some of the recent acquisitions? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : I would say that, Chris. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks a lot, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. The first one on the Providence acquisition, you talked at the Investor Day about spending I think in the order of $160 million on behavioral-related care. How quickly in the overlap, perhaps how quickly can you begin to leverage Providence services into your health plan footprint? J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : This is Mario. It's hard to say at this point because we haven't closed the acquisition, the first thing we've got to do is close and then we can get in there and begin talking to them about how we can make better use of their services, but that is our goal. I just can't give you any idea on the timing. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : And did I understand correctly that it would also be maybe the second step in the goal would be to expand the Providence footprint into additional Molina states? J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Certainly. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Then on I guess Texas Quality where \u2013 sorry, if this question has been asked. Do you have any better visibility on the \u2013 what has been opaque calculation on that? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : Dave, I think, Juan Jos\u00e9 wins $25 because he bet at some point, someone would ask that even if we were silent. No, we've got no update. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And in Michigan with re-procurement there and the -- I think eight regions that you were awarded, is it your expectation that membership would be about stable or do you think you can pick up some incremental numbers based on your going forward footprint? John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : Usually, we would only expect to pick up membership if one or more plans in a region were dropped. I think in a couple of regions and we may have one plan that was dropped and so that membership would be distributed. But for the most part, we think it will largely be stable. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And the HealthPlus acquisition, is the only kind of cross benefit there, just leverage as an SG&A presence in the state. Is that what I remembered from the Investor Day conversation? John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : That's a big portion of it, yes. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Okay. All right. Thank you. John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : Great. Operator : Our final question is a follow up question from Brian Wright with Sterne Agee CRT. Please go ahead. Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT : I missed a bit of the answer on that last one, I apologize. Is there any set timeframe on getting greater clarity on the definitions in Texas? John C. Molina - Chief Financial Officer : Well we thought we would have it by the end of the third quarter, Brian we're hoping that we'll have it by the end of the year. I recall the last time we got it it was about 15 months before we got clarity. So, if they give it to us by the end of the year, it will be a step in the right direction. Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT : Right. So, there is a chance but we're not holding our breath. Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : I'm not. Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT : Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. J. Mario Molina, MD - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Well, thank you everyone. We appreciate you joining in the call. It was a good quarter and we look forward to talking to you at the next earnings release. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

After the completion of our prepared remarks we will open the call to take your questions. If you have multiple questions, we ask that you get back in the queue so that others can have an opportunity to ask their questions. As a reminder, on Thursday at our investor day presentation, we will discuss the company\u2019s outlook for 2016. Today, we will only be taking questions related to our earnings release. Additionally, our comments today will contain forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. All of our forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to numerous risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially.

These reports can be accessed under the Investor Relations tab of our company website or on the SEC's website. All forward-looking statements made during today's call represent our judgment as of February 8, 2016, and we disclaim any obligation to update such statements except as required by the securities laws. This call is being recorded and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available on our company's website, molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Mario Molina. Mario Molina : Thank you, Juan Jos\u00e9 and thank you for that nice introduction. Hello everyone and thank you for joining our call this afternoon.  The fourth quarter of 2015 capped off a very strong year for Molina Healthcare. Net income more than doubled when compared to 2014, and we are making progress towards our goal of a 1.5% to 2% net income margin by the end of 2017. However, today I want to talk about our results within the framework of our mission and strategy.  Our mission is to provide quality healthcare to people receiving government assistance. One of our first objectives of our strategy over the past 35 years has been to grow and diversify our revenue. We have done just that in 2015. Revenue grew by 46% from $9.7 billion in 2014 to just over $14 billion in 2015. Revenue growth was driven by an increase in membership of about 35% from 2.6 million members in 2014 to slightly more than 3.5 million members by the end of 2015.  Our growth strategy can be divided into four components : growth and retention in our existing markets, expansion into new geographies, transitioning members and benefits from fee for service to managed care, and finally, developing and acquiring new products and capabilities.  During 2015 we successfully executed on all four of these components through our growth strategy. We retained and grew exisitng business with our re-procurement wins in Michigan and Washington. Our new contract in Michigan expanded our service area across all of the lower peninsula spanning an additional 18 counties. The Washington win along with our acquisition of Columbia United Providers strengthens our presence in the Southwest region. It also serves as a solid foundation to build on the state as the state continues to consolidate medical and behavioral health benefits under a single contract through additional regional procurements over the next few years. We also grew our marketplace enrollment from 15,000 members in 2014 to over 200,000 members in December 2015.  Finally, in-market or tuck-in acquisitions made a major contribution to our growth in existing markets in 2015. 2015 was the most active year in M&A in our company\u2019s history. Of the nine acquisitions we announced in 2015, eight were in-market or tuck-in acquisitions in four of exisitng states. These acquisitions alone will add about $1.2 billion in premium revenue in 2016. Because these are asset purchases where we acquire the Medicaid contract from another health plan, these transactions have minimum retention [ph] risks and allow us to spread existing administrative overhead costs over a larger membership.  In keeping with the second component of our growth strategy, enter into new geographic markets, we launched our health plan in Puerto Rico in April of 2015. As I noted a minute ago, transitioning members and benefits from fee for service to managed care is the third component of our growth strategy. In 2015, we saw a strong growth in our Medicare Medicaid plan and aged, blind and disabled programs. While smaller in total numbers of members, these programs translate into strong revenue growth because these members come with much higher premiums when compared to the marketplace and Medicaid expansion programs or our tenant [ph] members.  The final component of our growth strategy is the development and acquisition of new products and capabilities. In addition to the in-market acquisitions that I have already discussed, we also acquired a behavioral health and mental health services provider, Providence Human Services in November. This transaction is now closed and has been rebranded under the name Pathways. Pathways brings in-house additional capabilities in behavioral health and some long term services and supports.  Altogether our growth strategy has allowed us to expand from less than 1 million members in 2005 to 3.9 million members today resulting in a compound annual growth rate of 16%. Our revenues on the other hand have grown 1.5 times faster than that of our membership during that same period. That is because we have a greater portion of our members with chronic health conditions that come with higher premiums, enabling us to achieve a compound annual growth of revenues of 24%. In 2015 we saw net income more than doubled from $62 million in 2014 to $143 million in 2015. On a relative basis, our net income margin increased from 0.6% in 2014 to 1% in 2015, a jump of 67% and an important milestone on our path towards achieving our long term net income margin goal of 1.5% to 2%.  How do we improve our financial performance? Our medical care ratio declined from 89.5% of revenue in 2014 to 89% of revenue in 2015, while administrative costs rose only slightly pressured by costs associated with the marketplace. Nevertheless we have made solid progress on improving our margins. At the same time we have worked to keep our administrative costs low at around 8%, down from a high of 10% in 2013. This is significant when you consider that we continued to expand our business considerably over the past two years while growing into infrastructure we had invested in prior to commencing new contracts involving long term care services, and serving the chronic care conditions of dual eligible members.  We did all of these without losing our focus on quality. Five of our health plans improved their CMS quality ratings for Medicare to 3.5 stars and all of our eligible health plans maintained accreditation by the National Committee for Quality Assurance.  But that\u2019s not all. We continue to invest in the company to better serve our members in the future. We installed electronic health records in all of our clinics earning meaningful use payments along the way. We also expanded the size of a number of our clinics and added behavioral health providers and social workers to help our members deal with mental health and social issues that were affecting and complicating their health care.  We built provider and member portals to allow physicians and members to interact with our health plans more easily. And we took steps to further bolster the privacy of protected health information. We implemented new Medicaid, Medicaid plan contracts in Michigan, South Carolina and Texas and brought up a new health plan in Puerto Rico. All of these things will drive shareholder value in the long term.  I am proud of the team that we have built and I am proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished over the past 35 years. This past year was an inflection point in our efforts to improve our margins. That being said, the opportunity before us with managed long term care services for Medicaid patients and the opportunities for care coordination, our opportunity lies with these patients in the future. And our future is bright indeed. And now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to John who will review in detail the financial results for the quarter and the year ending December 2015. John Molina : Thank you, Mario and hello everyone. As Mario said, the fourth quarter was a strong close to a strong year. Our financial performance in 2015 exceeded our expectations and bodes well for the future. In addition to our top line revenue and membership growth, we took substantial strides towards our margin targets for the end of 2017. We will be providing additional insight into what 2016 holds later this week during our investor day. But for now I want to focus on our performance throughout 2015.  Today we report full year earnings of $2.57, almost doubling the $1.29 we reported last year. Fourth quarter EPS of $0.51 and our full year earnings would have been $0.26 and $0.27 higher respectively but for the following items. First, we recorded a $15 million charge resulting from the early termination of a hospital management agreement. Let me be clear this expense has been included in our 2015 results and will not be a drag on earnings in 2016 [ph]. We [ph] incurred G&A expense relating to transaction costs during the quarter associated with our acquisitions. Finally, we also recognized $6 million in interest expense related to our recent senior note offerings that we issued in November, an expense that we will continue to recognize going forward.  Premium revenue was up almost 50% from 2014 and has more than doubled since 2013. That growth in itself is impressive but we should not forget the many paths we have traveled to get here. In two years we have established a start-up health plan in Puerto Rico, opened six Medicare Medicaid health plans, established a strong physician in the ACA marketplaces, won four key re-procurements, among our health plan and MMS states, closed on 10 acquisitions through January 2016, and provided over 0.5 million Medicaid expansion members the peace of mind that comes with access to affordable, quality healthcare. We did all of these while strengthening our capital position, improving profitability and staying true to our commitment to deliver quality healthcare to those most in need.  Words cannot express the pride that Mario, my sister Martha and I feel when we look at what Molina has accomplished. We offer our heartfelt thanks to each and every one of the 20,000 Molina team members who helped make this happen. We continue to transition from a company providing episodic medical care to also serving members with complex care needs that include healthcare and long term services and support. During 2015 enrollment [technical difficulty] 3.5 million members, an increase of more than 900,000 members when compared to December of 2014. Membership growth remained strong across all lines of business as a result of continued organic Medicaid expansion growth, the launch of our Puerto Rico health plan, enrollment growth in our Medicare Medicaid plans in Texas and Michigan as they completed passive enrollment, strong marketplace enrollment, and the completion and closing of four in-market acquisitions during 2015.  Our marketplace business continues to perform well. Our fourth quarter marketplace medical care ratio was higher than we\u2019ve seen earlier in the year. But this was the result of true-ups to our risk adjustment liability that relates to the entire year. Mario talked about the convergence of medical cost ratios between marketplace and the rest of our business last month in San Francisco. We will have more to say about this later in the week but for now it is enough to know that we are confident that marketplace enrollment will remain a valuable complement to our core business moving forward.  Medical margin improvement has largely driven our bottom line profitability improvement. In fact, all of our states saw improved medical margin compared to last year\u2019s performance and our nearly $1.5 billion medical margin this year represents a 53% improvement to 2014 results. We believe that our lower medical care ratio in 2015 is the first indication of success for our efforts focused on care management and care coordination for our members with the most complex medical and social needs. Our general and administrative ratio increased 8.2% in 2015 compared to 7.9% in 2014. If we remove the impact of marketplace broker commissions and exchange fees from the calculation, G&A ratio actually decreased from 7.8% in 2014 to 7.5% this year. Sequentially our G&A ratio in the fourth quarter of 2015 was higher than in the third quarter primarily because of higher costs incurred for the 2016 Medicare and marketplace open enrollments and various acquisition costs.  In general, we are very pleased with the year-over-year reduction in our consolidated medical care ratio. Improving administrative efficiency bolsters improving medical margins I spoke about a few minutes ago. As of December 31, 2015 the company had cash and investments of more than $4 billion, including in excess of $600 million at the parent company.  As our results include the reductions I first mentioned, I am pleased with our performance and our results for the year as we continue to grow while demonstrating progress towards our longer term goals. As a reminder, we will be hosting our investor day conference in New York city this Thursday, February 11 at 12 :30 PM Eastern Time. At that presentation we will be discussing the company\u2019s outlook and strategy for 2016. We look forward to seeing you there or encourage you to listen in via the webcast. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions but I will again remind everyone we will not be speaking to questions that address performance or expected performance for 2016. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays. Joshua Raskin : So first question, just on the hospital contract termination, I just wanted to better understand what exactly happened there. Was that some sort of contract dispute around rates, et cetera? And then were you in some sort of position where you owed the facility some sort of settlements, or how did that cost you guys money? John Molina : Josh, this is John. A little bit different kind of contract than we are used to. A couple of years ago, we actually went into a management of the acute care services of a hospital that we did not own but that a behavioral health company owned. Given their priorities and our priorities did not converge as we expected. We felt the best thing for us to do was to get out of that contract. In order to get out of that contract, we took a charge of $15 million. Joshua Raskin : So it was some sort of performance fee that you guys would have to -- it was just to break the contract, it sounds like. So it wasn't a medical expense or anything like that? John Molina : Correct. Josh, we did book it medical expense because it was part of our direct delivery network but not as an ongoing provider contract like we would have with an unaffiliated hospital. Joshua Raskin : And so now you'll just replace it with some sort of fee-for-service payment to other providers in the market, whatever market that is? John Molina : That\u2019s correct. Joshua Raskin : And then just second, on the Texas performance fees, it looks like you didn't book -- I don't want to say you didn't book anything, but it didn't look like you booked the full amount for sure in the fourth quarter. Did you book anything? And then if not, are we now less confident or is this just again a timing issue, where you can't prove it, so you're not booking it? John Molina : I think it\u2019s the latter, Josh. We didn\u2019t book anything in the fourth quarter. It\u2019s not that we are less confident, it\u2019s just that we have really no additional news that would give us any more confidence at this point to book anything. It\u2019s a very challenging environment to try in and keep the accounting in parallel with items that we can\u2019t assess. Joshua Raskin : And then as I remember, John, you had given guidance early in the year, when you guys were providing initial guidance, that had included that, right? So I just want to make sure that's right. That's typically the practice, but if you anticipate getting some sort of performance fees, that will be included; and then we should think about your earnings coming in a little bit better relative -- despite the fact you didn't get any of the Texas performance fees. Is that fair? John Molina : That\u2019s fair. Joshua Raskin : And I assume you would just continue that practice. You'll assume you're going to be able to book performance fees as you've always been able to in your contracts? John Molina : We do assume that we will book a portion of it and on Thursday we can provide some additional insight into that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush. Sarah James : Thank you. You guys have had a number of contracts that renewed their rates. Since we last spoke there's, I think, Texas in September, and Michigan in October, and then a number in January. So if can you kind of walk us through what you're seeing so far with the rate update? John Molina : Sarah, this is John. I don\u2019t have that numbers specifically for Texas and suffice it to say we are we\u2019re going to be detailing that out on Thursday but it still remains very low single digits if anything at all. And I think a couple of states actually had some drop in the rates effective Jan 1. So the rate environment is not where we would like it to be and our improvement is not going to be driven primarily by increased rates. Sarah James : And was there anything out-of-period in the quarter in relation to the New Mexico true-up? I think in the past you guys had talked about the liability being in excess of third-quarter accruals there. So was there anything out-of-period recognized in New Mexico? Joseph White : Sarah, it\u2019s Joe speaking. No, there wasn\u2019t. If I can just tag on to what John said about rates, we\u2019re not seeing anything different as he emphasized, now than we've been talking about for the last couple of years. Low single digits, at best. So I just wanted to make sure that that was familiar. But nothing picked up in New Mexico. Sarah James : And just to clarify, Joe, are liabilities still in excess of current accruals for New Mexico or are you guys kind of on par now? Joseph White : Going back to the third quarter disclosure, I wouldn\u2019t say liabilities are in excess of accruals because the two equal each other. If you took the department\u2019s most extreme position, I guess, that exceeds our liability but we do not believe that it\u2019s going to play out the department\u2019s most extreme position. So we think we are adequately reserved at December 31. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Steve Baxter : This is actually Steve Baxter on for Kevin. I wanted to come back to your comments on the exchange business. I guess can you quantify the impact, the dollar impact of the risk adjustment true-up in the quarter -- and I guess, what the entire net change to the Three Rs was? Just trying to get a sense for the run rate of the business headed into 2016. Joseph White : It\u2019s Joe. I will take that question. Outside of risk adjustment the impact of the 3Rs is very minimal. Obviously the corridors I think everybody is familiar with. There's not a lot of protection from those. Reinsurance is pretty much easily measured. So then we are left with the risk adjustment and I think it\u2019s fair to say that if you look at the year in total which we disclosed for marketplace [technical difficulty] the number for the full year. So I think broadly you can take the difference in MCR between the fourth quarter and the year to date and that would basically reflect the impact of risk adjustment for the quarter. Steve Baxter : And I guess nothing so significant that it kind of impacts how you feel like you are positioned for 2016? Mario Molina : Well, that\u2019s a 2016 question. But I think John, he made it clear that we still feel reasonably confident about marketplace from our perspective. Steve Baxter : And then I guess on the recent acquisitions you guys have done, can you give us an update on the performance of Providence or I guess now, Pathways's performance, since you closed the deal, and performance of the tuck-in deals? I think you guys have said that those typically come on a little bit above total company margins. Is that kind of playing out with your expectations? John Molina : Providence is a little bit of a different animal than our normal managed-care tuck-ins. We see some of those come in with margins that start out a little bit lower and then they go higher. They start out a little bit lower because you\u2019ve got some pent-up demand that occurs like usually in the first quarter after the acquisition, than of having higher margins overall because you don\u2019t have to add as much in terms of an admin expense. Incremental admin for a tuck-in is less than the average. On Providence, that\u2019s largely a fee for service business currently which Mario will discuss on Thursday how we want to use that in the future but we\u2019ve only had it now for November and December. So it is moving along as we expected for the first two months. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Ana Gupte : So I wanted to just follow up on the 1.5% to 2% you've expressed confidence in the net income margin. How are the marketplaces performing? It looks like you went from about 55% to 70% in the third quarter, and now it's 73% or 74% on the MLR. As you are seeing the open enrollment membership coming in, ex-the Three Rs, and you've seen quite a bit of attrition, it looks like, how is this going to bode for next year? And do you expect margins to remain constant or expand? John Molina : So Ana, you said the magic words, the next year. We\u2019ll talk about that on Thursday. Ana Gupte : But I guess from the experience in the fourth quarter, say, for going from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, you saw a little bit of deterioration. Are you seeing any issues with special enrollments? And when you look at the risk adjusters, are you thinking about a pooled risk adjuster across companies that are serving more than just the churn from the Medicaid population? And how have you booked it? Joseph White : It\u2019s Joe. I am not sure I understood the last question. But speaking in general, we feel that that for 2015 the full year financial performance we disclosed is indicative of where the margins ended up for this year. We don\u2019t think fourth quarter reflects anything unique or any kind of inflection point. And as John and Mario said, we will talk about the rest on Thursday. Ana Gupte : And just following up on your tax rate, how should I think about this, when I'm modeling it? It surprised me a little bit because it was positive. Joseph White : The tax rate for the full year came in at \u2013 came in pretty close to what we thought it would come in when we guided back \u2013 revised guidance back in September. The rate came in around 56 \u2013 I want to say 56.2% -- which is 55.5% -- I think back in June, we guided to 56%. So it\u2019s come in about what we expected it would come in at. Obviously it\u2019s high for all the reasons we\u2019ve talked about in the past, the non-deductibility of the health insurance provider fee in particular. Ana Gupte : But the fourth quarter came in lower than that, correct? Or am I reading that wrong? Joseph White : That\u2019s correct. In the fourth quarter added very typical, we took in some discrete items that were favorable, various credits and stuff that are available, swapping [ph] credits, R&D credits, normal course type of stuff. The ETR has also helped out a little bit by the fact that our pre-tax income came in higher than we were anticipating back in June when we revised guidance. So that gives you a \u2013 that improvement in the pretax number gives you \u2013 also gives you some lift in lowering your effective tax rate. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna. Chris Rigg : Just one quick follow-up on the tax rate. If I normalize it for the health insurer fee, it looks like it came in in the upper-20% range in the quarter. Is that the right way to think about it? John Molina : I think at a very technical level, that might be the right way to think about it, Chris but again if you think about what happened in the fourth quarter, we had the benefit of the three items which are obviously not repeated in the other quarters. So that\u2019s going to push down the rate. And again the fact that pretax income came in higher than we anticipated is also going to push down the ETR for the year and it\u2019s all going to be magnified in the quarter. So like much of this year\u2019s financial performance, I think the way to look at is to look at where we ended the full year on. And if you care to extrapolate, extrapolate from that, or wait until we talk about it on Thursday. Chris Rigg : And then on the $15 million charge in the quarter, I know you guys don't update guidance very frequently, but was that $15 million assumed in the guidance that you had left out there? John Molina : No, it isn\u2019t. Chris Rigg : And then the last question, which just may fall into the conversation later in the week, but you raised about $700 million a couple months ago. And it looks like a lot of that is still residual on the balance sheet. How should we think about the deployment of that money? John Molina : There really hasn\u2019t been change in the strategy of how we want to deploy the money in terms of statutory capital as we enter new markets and acquisitions both of health plans and new capabilities. Chris Rigg : But is the money earmarked specifically for something at this point, or right now just in the kitty for future uses? \u2013 John Molina : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from A.J. Rice from UBS. A.J. Rice : Just a couple of quick things. On the duals, give us just your latest thoughts as you ended the year on that program. And I noticed specifically California, I guess, has announced they're going to delay their decision on whether to continue. Are you in discussions with them? What's happening just generally in the dual program, and particularly California? Mario Molina : This is Mario. Yes, the duals continue to march forward. We are happy with the contracts. The issue in California is around the managed care tax. I do think that\u2019s going to get resolved. So we are not anticipating any changes in those programs right now. If there was one thing we would like to see the government do, it would be to allow us to market and enroll directly as we do for other Medicare beneficiaries. A.J. Rice : And I might just ask you quickly, for my follow-up, on the Puerto Rico. It looks like you had a very good medical care ratio in the quarter. Just wondering, it seems like that must be going well. Is there any update on Puerto Rico and how that's working? Mario Molina : There is not a lot to say about Puerto Rico at this point. We\u2019ve had that contract for less than a year. I would say that it\u2019s operating pretty much the way we anticipated. We had some initial startup problems that are typical for any kind of a new health plan but those have largely been ironed out and it seems to be doing well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse. Scott Fidel : Thanks. Just had a question on Florida, it looked like the MLR was up quite a bit sequentially. Was that where you guys were booking the hospital management charge, or was there something else going on there? Joseph White : Hi, it\u2019s Joe speaking. The main issue that you see pushing through the Florida MLR is just the adjustments that we talked about, the exchanges. Remember most of our exchange enrollment last year was in Florida. Scott Fidel : So that was mostly just the change in the risk adjuster accruals playing out in Florida? Joseph White : Exactly, exactly. So think of that as being spread over the entire year. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel. Tom Carroll : Just one quick one on service revenue. It doubled sequentially; is that related to the Providence acquisition? Joseph White : Tom, it\u2019s Joe. That\u2019s correct. We are recording a revenue associated with Pathways as service revenue and related expense as service expense, just to separate it from our health plan. Tom Carroll : And then just a quick follow-up on the tax issues. The favorable items that were recorded in the fourth quarter -- were you mostly expecting those? Because we had modeled a much higher tax rate. John Molina : I don\u2019t want to say our tax leadership may have forecasted it. I know that we typically do receive these kind of benefits, these kind of discrete benefits we generally record, that was in the fourth quarter. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s surprising in their size, I think what you might not have modeled, I don\u2019t know what Tom, what you modeled for pretax income number. But again if you modeled a pretax income number much as we expected in our guidance, when that number turned out higher, it\u2019s going to push down the effective tax rate. So that might be your issue there. Tom Carroll : So maybe these things just come in when they come in, and for the full year you were pretty much right on where you expected, that's probably how I should think about it? John Molina : Again with the exception that pre-tax income came in higher than we expected, so that was a little bit of a \u2013 depressing all the tax rate. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Gary Taylor : I was just slightly tuned out two questions ago. So I hope I'm not asking the same question, but if I am, just tell me to move on. But, Joe, you've done a good job all year describing to us that some of these very low MLRs in the marketplace business aren't completely obviously accruing to earnings because the minimum medical loss ratios. Given that you've got these additional risk adjustment accruals in the fourth quarter, were you able to reverse any of the rebate accruals for the year to date? Joseph White : Yes, they are small right now. The rebate accruals are within \u2013 well under $10 million. I don\u2019t have that handy but they\u2019ve pretty much dropped to nothing. Gary Taylor : And also I just wanted [technical difficulty] the loss ratio includes that $15 million. So really that's, maybe, recurring numbers, about 40 basis points lower -- $88.7 million maybe? Is that right? Joseph White : I haven\u2019t done the math on that but you are correct. It is in medical costs, so to get an MLR you\u2019d have to back that out. Gary Taylor : And then last question, I guess I have lost track of MyCare Chicago? Did that transaction close yet? We were looking for maybe $60,000 in Illinois enrollment, which obviously wasn't in the year-end number sequentially. John Molina : This is John. We are still waiting on one of the Chicago acquisitions to close in March, the rest closed in January. Joseph White : It\u2019s Joe again. So when they\u2019re closed in January obviously you don\u2019t see them on these numbers. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with Raymond James. Michael Baker : Just a follow-up on the earlier question in terms of Pathways, Providence. Sounds like that's running through service revenue. When you have a situation in which a state includes behavioral going forward, at some point are we going to see some of that revenue get allocated to that state as you do services internally or how should we think about that? Joseph White : Mike, it\u2019s Joe speaking. I think what you will see going forward is that the health plan will pick up a portion of that service expense \u2013 the bottom line impact should be improved, slightly improved margins. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Dave Windley : Part of my Florida question was asked a couple of minutes ago, but I did want to clarify, we were also expecting a rate update to impact your revenue and MLR in the fourth quarter, and I think recognizing maybe five or even six months' worth of rate updates in the fourth quarter. Did that happen and what impact on the MLR did that have, if you can tell me? John Molina : Dave, are you talking specifically about Florida? Dave Windley : Yes. John Molina : The Florida rate increase was \u2013 Joseph White : I think the Florida rate increase, we start about 5%, we started picking that up September \u2013 John Molina : So we talked about in the last call. Joseph White : So that\u2019s been there from September [ph]. Dave Windley : So you did accrue that in the last quarter pro rata? It wasn't a cash back in the fourth quarter? Joseph White : Correct, for two months. End of Q& A Operator : And we have no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back to you. Mario Molina : Well, thanks for joining us everyone. We look forward to seeing you on Thursday in New York for investor day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you once again for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

Welcome to the Molina Healthcare First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, April 28, 2016. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Juan Jos\u00e9 Orellana, Senior Vice President of Investors Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Juan Jos\u00e9 Orellana - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations & Marketing: Thank you, Pascal. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The purpose of this call is to discuss Molina Healthcare's financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2016. The company issued its earnings release reporting these results today after the market closed, and this release is now posted for viewing on our company website. On the call with me today are Dr. Mario Molina, our Chief Executive Officer; John Molina, our Chief Financial Officer; and Terry Bayer, our Chief Operating Officer; Joseph White, our Chief Accounting Officer. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. If you have multiple questions, we ask that you get back in the queue so that others can have an opportunity to ask their questions. Our comments today will contain forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. All of our forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions which are subject to numerous risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. A description of such risk factors can be found in our earnings release, and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-K annual report, our Form 10-Q quarterly reports, and our Form 8-K current reports. These reports can be accessed under the Investor Relations tab of our company's website or on the SEC's website. All forward-looking statements made during today's call represent our judgment as of April 28, 2016, and we disclaim any obligation to update such statements except as required by securities laws. This call is being recorded and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available at our company's website, molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Mario Molina. Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Juan Jos\u00e9, and thanks to everyone for joining us. As we announced today, Molina Healthcare reported adjusted net income of $29 million or $0.51 per diluted share. Coming off a very strong performance during 2015, we encountered a few challenges that contributed to a disappointing first quarter, and that have caused us to reassess our outlook for the year. We have identified those factors that affected our results. We are working diligently to address them, and we remain confident that we will reach our goal of 1.5% to 2% after-tax margin by the fourth quarter of 2017. John will be discussing our financials for the quarter in greater detail during his remarks. In the meantime, it is important to interpret these results within the context of our current business environment and not to lose sight of our long-term growth and margin goals. With that margin goal in mind, let's review the quarter. Enrollment and revenue growth continue to exceed expectations. Enrollment grew to 4.2 million members for this quarter. That is an increase of about 1.3 million members from the first quarter of last year. Over half of that increase, nearly 700,000 members, occurred in the first quarter of 2016 alone. This is the largest membership gain that we have experienced during sequential quarters in the 35 year history of our company. Our strong revenue growth is the result of a strategy that was well conceived and well executed. But I must acknowledge that two years of hyper growth across multiple geographies and multiple programs has created a bit of a strain this quarter. I'll speak more about that in a minute. Despite that strain due to growth, I am pleased to report that we were successful in decreasing our year-over-year medical costs on a per member per month basis by about 5%, from $306 per member per month to $291 per member per month. Lowering medical costs is what we're supposed to do. In fact, the only way to sustain the increases in health insurance coverage that we as a nation currently enjoy is to lower the cost of medical care. While we were pleased with these improvements, they simply did not offset reductions in per member per month revenue. During that same period, revenue per member per month actually decreased from $345 to $324 per member per month. Lower premium revenue per member per month resulted from much lower Medicaid expansion rates, updated risk adjustment estimates on marketplace and the general failure of Medicaid rates to keep pace with the growing medical care costs. Others in our space have also commented on these headwinds in recent reports. In the end, the decline in per member per month premium revenue outpaced the decline in per member per month medical costs, exerting pressure on our profit margins this quarter. So here is where we stand today. First, we believe that we've achieved the top line growth necessary to reach our 2017 net margin target. We've achieved this top line growth even more quickly than we anticipated. Second, the improvements in our care management systems and practices that are needed to support our future profitability, although not complete, are well underway. Next, we continue to develop new capabilities, while integrating acquired ones like Pathways into our organization. Nevertheless, we are experiencing some of the pains that often come with rapid growth and some symptoms that have to be addressed have emerged. For example, medical costs at our Ohio and Texas health plans were higher than we anticipated. And increased pharmacy costs across the business, but particularly in Puerto Rico, resulted in additional margin pressure. Let me take a minute to talk about each one of these issues. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we anticipated enrollment growth, but our results exceeded even our own projections. Assimilating this membership stretched our operational resources. Accordingly, we've redoubled our efforts around member and provider services, care and utilization management, provider payment and information technology \u2013 all areas that felt the strain of rapid growth. When we remember that quality of care and compliance can't be compromised, it becomes clear that some short-term profitability may have to suffer. At our Ohio and Texas health plans, higher than anticipated costs were largely the result of utilization issues that we expect to resolve through a number of ongoing care management initiatives. We've spoken about these initiatives before, but I think it's worth our time to review them again today. In broad terms, these care management initiatives are comprised of a number of areas : First, the application of updated authorization standards and criteria. Second, a greater focus on the management of transitions of care. Third, the use of hospitalists to achieve cost-effective outcomes. Fourth, the use of interdisciplinary care teams to help those with combined physical, behavioral, and social challenges. And fifth, the early identification and effective treatment of those who require or may require complex and expensive care over long periods of time. Our performance in the first quarter requires that we revisit the timing and pace of these initiatives and that we adjust the focus of our efforts towards Ohio and Texas. The other area of concern is pharmacy costs. So far this year, pharmacy costs are above our expectations and rate increases do not seem to be offsetting the full impact. The effect on our business of high-cost specialty drugs is something that we have been combating for the past two years and this cost is still not fully recognized by the government's actuaries. Having addressed the cost drivers in the first quarter results, let me now turn to the future. What do all of the headlines about other insurers exiting the marketplace mean to Molina Healthcare? What is our strategy for the marketplace? Our plan is to stay the course. That is because our strategy and our goals for this product are different from those of many other insurers. Our objective is to provide an accessible extension of our Medicaid product to individuals whose eligibility for Medicaid fluctuates, and we believe that we are successfully doing so. As a reminder, the segment most likely to purchase an exchange project from Molina healthcare are individuals under 250% of the federal poverty level who receive significant government subsidies. Approximately 90% of our marketplace members receive a government subsidy for co-pays and premiums. We have never expected our marketplace product to perform better than our Medicaid business, nor operate at significantly better margins over the long term. After a period extremely rapid growth over the past two years, we expect the remainder of 2016 to be more stable. It should give us a chance to catch our breath as an organization while we continue to build on our current infrastructure. You may recall that back in 2013, in preparation for the anticipated growth in Medicaid expansion, the dual demonstration programs and marketplace we invested in operations and systems. Well, the growth exceeded even our optimistic expectations and we need to once again think about administrative capacity. There are a number of things that we need to do this year in preparation for 2017 and to help us achieve our long-term profit targets. First, we need to continue to supplement our management bench strength with additional talent. Our business continues to evolve by growing larger in scale, introducing new demands and becoming more complex as we add new products and services. Second, we need to continue to refine our expertise in medical management. We must continue to make progress in our provider contracts so that both providers and payers are working together to provide the best possible care for each member. This includes working with hospitals to actively reduce readmissions, while promoting patient safety and quality of care. It will also require us to choose our partners carefully and redefined the traditional relationships between health plans and hospitals. Third, we continue to manage our growth and integrate our newly acquired businesses. We completed a number of in-state acquisitions in 2015 that are being integrated in 2016. While the integration of these new members is relatively simple from an operations standpoint, because we have existing health plans in those states, addressing the financial impacts may not be so simple. For example, many of our new members, including those in marketplace, are coming to us from a fee-for-service environment. Short-term pent-up demand, new care management models and different methods of accessing healthcare services can result in higher costs in the short run. With that said, we believe these integration characteristics are transitory, and as a result, we remain optimistic when it comes to growing our business. We were very pleased to announce last week's acquisition of Total Care, a Medicaid health plan in the Syracuse area. Once approved, this transaction will mark our initial entry into the State of New York. Total Care serves approximately 39,000 members. The acquisition provides us with an established platform for future growth similar to what we experienced in states like Florida, Illinois and Michigan. Now, in light of some of the growing pains we've experienced this quarter, it is important to note that we expect this transition to close in the latter half of this year. By that time, we should have worked through the assimilation of our new members from other acquisitions. We plan to continue to respond to RFPs, as we have previously discussed, primarily to enter new states, especially as they relate to Medicaid long-term services and supports, or MLTSS. Now, let me switch topics and talk about a new healthcare threat in the United States, Zika. I use the term \"new\" with a touch of irony. Zika was first identified 70 years ago in Africa, and initially it was thought that it did not cause illness in humans. We have certainly learned otherwise as it is spread from Africa to South America and the Caribbean. It definitely causes a rare birth defect, called microcephaly that is associated with small head and abnormal brain development. While very few of the expectant mothers among our membership have contracted the virus, the full financial effects of Zika will not likely be known for several months. We continue to monitor the situation closely. Striving to deliver quality care for our members is our company's DNA. So I want to congratulate our 11 health plans that were awarded the Multicultural Health Care Distinction from the National Committee for Quality Assurance for Medicaid. The Multicultural Health Care Program evaluates how well an organization complies with standards in the following areas \u2013 collection of race and ethnicity and language data, provision of language assistance, cultural responsiveness, provision of culturally and linguistically appropriate services and the reduction of healthcare disparities. In keeping with our commitment to quality, all nine of our health plans that offer marketplace products also received the award. I want to personally thank each employee who made this award possible. Finally, neither our first quarter results nor anything else that has happened since we issued our 2016 outlook in February constitute a fundamental change to our business or to our long-term outlook. Enrollment growth this year is trending toward the high end of expectations. The care management and quality of care initiatives we discussed in February continue as planned, and appear to be having an impact as evidenced by the decrease in per member per month medical costs. Our diversification efforts, think of our recent New York acquisition, remain on track. As a result, we remain confident that we will reach our stated goal of an after-tax margin of 1.5% to 2% by the fourth quarter of 2017. I would now like to turn the call over to John. John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Thank you, Mario. Today, we reported adjusted net income per diluted share of $0.51 for the first quarter of 2016 compared to $0.62 per diluted share on an adjusted basis for the same period last year. While we recognize that these results are disappointing, I want to reiterate what Mario just said, these results give us no reason to doubt our ability to reach our goal of a 1.5% to 2% after-tax margin by the end of 2017. We have executed very well on our initiatives to grow the business. Total revenue increased to $4.3 billion this quarter, an increase of more than $1 billion and more than 30% when compared to the first quarter of 2015. This increase was driven by the nearly 700,000 new members we added, a combination of closed transactions from 2015, and better-than-expected growth in our Marketplace product. Top line revenue growth has also had a positive impact on our administrative cost ratio. Our general and administrative ratio decreased by 30 basis points to 7.8% from both the first quarter of 2015 and the end of last year. We have now closed on all nine acquisitions that we announced during 2015. The last five transactions added more than 250,000 members, or more than $600 million in annualized revenues. That is all well and good, but we know that we need increased profits in addition to increased revenue. So, what made this quarter more challenging than expected? First, fee-for-service costs in Ohio and Texas were higher than we expected. For the most part, this is the result of higher-than-expected utilization. Mario has already outlined the care management initiatives that we expect will resolve this challenge. And second, we continued to see cost pressures relative to the level of our premium rates. Looking at the enterprise as a whole, these cost pressures are particularly acute for the pharmacy benefit. Margin pressure across our states as pharmacy costs have continued to increase this year. Despite high generic utilization, we are seeing pressure from new high cost specialty drugs. A good example of this is what we are experiencing at our Puerto Rico health plan. In Puerto Rico, we had a formulary change that added additional branded drugs to the Medicaid preferred drug list over the course of our contract, which resulted in increased costs and were not anticipated when we negotiated our rates back in the spring of 2015. To help mitigate these changes, we are actively engaged on this issue with the Medicaid agency as part of our annual rate discussions, and we continue to work with providers and make the case for actuarially sound rates to ensure the program remain sustainable. Looking at our operating results today when compared to the outlook we provided back in February, you can see that our consolidated medical care ratio of 89.8% was, for the most of our lines of business, in line and tracking along with that guidance. Our TANF and ABD lines of business are the exceptions. These two areas largely contributed to the sequential medical care ratio increase we saw between this quarter and the fourth quarter of 2015. We continue to believe that while our medical cost assumptions have changed, our revenue and administrative assumptions are in line with previous expectations. And as we look out over our mitigation efforts, we see short, medium, and long-term solutions. Weighing all of these factors, we think it is appropriate to reduce our 2016 earnings outlook. We now expect income before tax to be in the range of $350 million on the low-end to $400 million on the high end compared to our initial guidance of $460 million. Accordingly, we are reducing our 2016 outlook for adjusted earnings per share to $2.50 to $2.95 down from $3.86. Despite this revision to our 2016 outlook, I want to emphasize that we expect to exit 2016 with the trajectory that maintains the progress towards our stated goal of 1.5% to 2% after-tax margin by the fourth quarter of 2017. For the interim, so that you can better model and follow our progress, we anticipate slow progress through the second quarter, with increasing performance in the second half of the year, as the efforts we have outlined bear fruit. We estimate that approximately two-thirds of our earnings will be achieved during the second half of 2016. The key takeaways that despite the challenges we faced during the quarter, we have taken action to minimize the impact on our operations going forward, and we did not lose sight of our longer-term objectives, growth, and margin improvement. We have always maintained that one quarter does not define us. We are focused on the long-term. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for the question. I wanted to clarify on Texas and Ohio, was there an increase in utilization or is it just that utilization is not declining as fast as you had previously expected, given the new medical management programs that were put in place? And how much did the Jan 1 rate update play into this? Because I think Ohio was down 7% on expansion and Texas down 1% overall. Thanks. Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Sarah. This is Mario. Let me comment first on the utilization. I think it's both. I think that we did see increased utilization and we had also expected a greater decrease in utilization from some of our medical cost initiatives. Especially in Texas, I think they've been a little slower to materialize. But they're still in progress and we anticipate that they will continue and will bear fruit throughout the year. I'll let John take the rate issues. John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: So, Sarah, the rate issues certainly magnified the lack of a decline in inpatient utilization especially in Ohio. So, we had two things happening : utilization went up and rates went down. That combined made Ohio a much more challenging market than we anticipated. I would note two other things, the first is, our prior-period development did not indicate that the cost issues in Ohio stretched back into 2015. These were things that happened starting Jan 1 and the second thing is we believe that we have some fixes in that should allow us to start seeing the utilization decline starting in the second quarter. Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Were there program changes in Texas or Ohio that drove the utilization, or what was driving it if there was change to the contracts? Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think that part of it, we talked about the surge in enrollment that we experienced across the board in the company and I think it was a little bit overwhelming. In order to process all of the prior authorizations, we had relaxed our standards a little bit in the first quarter, but we've added additional bandwidth both in terms of the IT system and personnel. So, we think that, that has played out. Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Thanks. And last clarification is just on the Puerto Rico rates, I think at Investor Day you guys had in your slides that those were going to update in April. So, are you expecting an imminent update on that rate? John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Sarah, this is John. There is a rate meeting in the next couple of weeks and we expect that July 1, new rates to be implemented. Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead. A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Yes. So, just, maybe I'll ask about the public exchanges. Your membership there jumped by about 420,000 but your PMPM looks like it's down about 24%, when most people are talking about raising their PMPM \u2013 or trying to at least raise their rates 15%, 20%. I'm just trying to understand what's going on there and is that something that we just have to live with for this year or is there any way to correct that? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : Hi, A.J. It's Joe speaking. The bulk of the decrease you see in revenue PMPM from Marketplace year-over-year is just driven by the fact we're getting better factoring in risk adjustments. Obviously, we talked about the fact, we have a comparably healthy population, which means we're going to have relative lower risk scores, which means we're going to be giving money back on risk adjustment. If you look at the MLR for Marketplace, for the first quarter of 2016, you'll see it's consistent with what we've guided to and pretty consistent with last year actually. A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then just looking at the TANF and CHIP business, you highlighted that TANF business is an issue but it looks like the actual MCR was down year-to-year at least. Maybe just a little bit more clarification on that? Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You're correct \u2013 this is Mario, you're correct that the MCRs have come down year-over-year. The problem is that it didn't come down as much as we had anticipated for 2016. And so, in our guidance, we had anticipated further decreases in MCR and utilization. And because of Puerto Rico, Texas, and Ohio, that didn't materialize in the first quarter as we anticipated. A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : And how much \u2013 how big issue was flu for you? Have you been able to quantify that? Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I don't think that the flu has been extraordinary this quarter. A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. All right. Thanks a lot John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Yeah. A.J., this is John, the other thing to note about the TANF is that it's less of an impact this year than last. So, we had a greater percentage of TANF members last year, so the decrease in the MCR in 2016 was a bit muted. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the changes in the ABD MCR. Right at your Analyst Day, you were guiding us down 300 basis points. Obviously, it's up year-over-year at this point. Anything worth highlighting there that's particular to that segment? Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think that in both the TANF and the ABD lines of business, the increased utilization was primarily on the inpatient side. Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. So, was the higher MCR strictly or completely driven for the ABD just by the increased utilization or was there anything else in there? Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No, I think it's primarily increased inpatient utilization. Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then, going back to sort of pharmacy comments earlier. It sounds like \u2013 is it fair to characterize the pressures you saw really as changes driven by the formularies, or was there just a broader increase or anything HCV related or other changes that could have impacted or was it primarily related, as you highlighted, to the changes when drugs were put on your formulary outside your expectations? Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, this is Mario again. I think with regard to the pharmacy costs, it's a combination of two things : increased costs coming from specialty drugs other than those used to treat hepatitis C; and some formulary changes primarily in Florida and in Puerto Rico, where we don't really control the preferred drug list. And they have shifted to include more brand-name drugs. So, we're going to have to with our providers, since we don't really control the formulary, to work on controlling utilization and encouraging the use of generic drugs. That said, our use of generic drugs as an entity, as the whole corporation, remains quite high. Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good evening, guys. So, first question, just, Ohio is a strange one for me because it doesn't look like there's been much change in membership. So, I know you guys mentioned the rate, but what change in the environment, why all of a sudden is there this uptick in utilization? Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Josh, I think there were a number of things that affected Ohio. We've had some turnover in staff, we brought in a lot of new nurses that required a lot of training, and of course, when you're new on the job you're not as effective as you are when you've got more experience. There were some IT issues which we have corrected in terms of adding more bandwidth, so that we can process more authorizations. But as a result some of these things, the staff being less effective and some other issues, we did loosen our prior authorization requirements. And so, we probably authorized things that we might not have authorized in the past, but we felt that, that it was better to err on the side of the patient. And so, that accounts for some of the increased utilization you're seeing there. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: But, Mario, what changed? I mean, it wasn't like there was more membership or more revenues necessarily. So, did you just have a lot of employees leave and you just couldn't fill those roles? Was that what it was? Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we had some management changes. We have a new Chief Medical Officer, new Healthcare Services person, a lot of new nurses. I mentioned we had a tidal wave of membership that affected the systems, and so we had increased system downtime as a result. That's been corrected, but those things in combination created problems and it was especially a problem in Ohio. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then, I guess, a similar question just for TANF, this is a population that runs in PMPM around $180; they seem to be less chronic, not as acute. And I guess it's not often that we see these spikes in costs for TANFs. So, I'm curious again was this market related or was the TANF population the one that you relaxed the authorization standards, or why would you see \u2013 I get it on the duals and ABD, I just \u2013 I'm surprised on the TANF. Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think it's the same thing, Josh. I mean, we were really focused on the Medicare and I think we did a good job with that. I think we were a little overwhelmed with all the new membership and the growing pains strained our ability to manage a lot of our members and it affected the TANF and ABD members disproportionately. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then, I guess, next question, just on \u2013 did you catch it, right, so day's claims payable is down two days. I know the cash flow was relatively strong. But when you sort of looked at your reserves, are you erring \u2013 my understanding is the actuaries give you a range, and are you erring more on the side of caution within that range, or it's just \u2013 there's nothing that sort of points to that. So, I'm curious how you feel about the established reserves now? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : Hey, Josh, it's Joe speaking. I don't think we saw anything this quarter that led us to think that the reserves at March 31 needed to be particularly strengthened. If you look at the overall trend from 12-31 to 4-15, prior period development on a dollar is very consistent with where it was a year ago. Also, a lot of these issues with authorizations and everything we're talking about in various states that peaked in January and February. So, a lot of those claims have already made their way through the system; we pay very quickly. So, it's not as if there's some \u2013 in our opinion, it's not as if there are some issue out there with being aware of claims and their late development. This is almost like a real-time issue in terms of utilization. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then, just last question, more I guess for Mario. When you're doing some of this M&A diligence sort of RFP expansion opportunities, is there a component of your process that looks at management time and effort? Do you guys sort of think, okay, if we end up winning this contract or expanding in the marketplace, or bidding on this acquisition, it's going to take X man-hours of management time and do you sort of have a process for that in place? Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Josh, I'm going to let John handle that because John is the one that handles most of the M&A work. John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Josh, I don't think that we cut it as finely as what you have mentioned. We've done a lot of acquisitions in the past. I think that the first quarter, we got hit with two things : number one, we did have the integrations of a number of acquisitions, especially in Illinois, we brought on three plans in the first quarter in Illinois; but then on top of that, as someone else noted earlier, we increased our Marketplace membership by more than 200%, I believe. So if it had just been dealing with integrating the acquisitions, probably not an issue, but we had on top of that, a large increase in the marketplace that put an additional strain on the systems and on the people, because we had a lot of people who hadn't been covered before were calling in and looking for help. Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Josh, this is Mario I just want to reemphasize that point. The Marketplace enrollment really exceeded our expectations. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. All right will follow up with the rest. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. First question is just following up on the comments you made about needing to increase your, sort of, capacity and some of the constraints you've had. Have you already work through sort of budgeting how much additional administrative cost you may need to allocate to that in 2016 and 2017? And just wondering if \u2013 as you sort of recommit to that long-term net margin target, whether an increased sort of administrative cost profile is contemplated within that? Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. This is Mario. I think that a big part of the issue is training. We have brought on additional people. I think that the real answer is we need to be more effective. And so, when you bring in new people, especially in UM, they're not comfortable with the systems, they're not comfortable with the guidelines, they're not as effective as they otherwise would be. So, we think that over time, over the course of the year, the staff will become more effective, the systems will become more effective. We're in the process of implementing some additional UM guidelines which should also help, but that I think is a big part of the issue. John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Scott, this is John. We've also added to the IT infrastructure, so that now we've got the bandwidth or the pipes to allow us to maintain an increase in enrollment without having big glitches or stopgaps. Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. And let me just comment on that too as well. We tested the systems expecting a certain level of enrollment and we exceeded that, and I think that was part of the problem. The growth was just far more than we anticipated. Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Then I had a second question, and just as it relates to Zika and sort of how you're approaching that in your guidance. Obviously, it's still sort of early stage here, but have you built in an assumption that you'll have additional costs in Puerto Rico on that or reserved for that, or are you still sort of just waiting to see how this plays out and then will factor that in as you get more, I guess, some additional information? Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : This is Mario. We have not factored that in at this point. I think we have one patient that we know of who's been infected. Of course, there may be others, but right now we're just watching. John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: And as we mentioned before, we're expecting to get new rates in Puerto Rico effective July 1. And I'm sure that this will have to be addressed in those new rates. Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And then just one last question. Just on the five health plans that you now recently closed on, how much visibility do you have into sort of the utilization trends in those books? And sort of any updates you can give us on how cost trends have been performing in the acquired businesses. Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : It's Joe speaking. We don't have huge visibility into that. We don't see anything to suggest that they are fundamentally different from our members, but that doesn't \u2013 our existing members, that doesn't rule out pent-up demand as we implement our care protocols. So, right now, we don't have huge visibility. Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hey, guys. I just want to make sure I understand the comments in the press release about the Medicaid expansion premium rate headwind. That was just to illustrate the year-to-year decline that was not intended to be a surprise rate cut? Is that correct? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : It's Joe speaking. That's absolutely correct. We knew that, if you \u2013 we knew about expansion rates just as we knew about the Ohio premium rate decrease. And you can see that, based on our guidance, the expansion number, MCR is coming in pretty much to what we guided to. So, it's purely a year-over-year comparison. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. And then, just to flush out sort of what I would describe as infrastructure issues. It's not abundantly clear to me whether this was more like a human error problem, and they were just not \u2013 error may be the wrong word, but more of a people problem versus an actual systems problem in that where the systems adequate to handle the new members. Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. This is Mario. Let me say both. I think that additional personnel, new on the job, perhaps a little less effective than they'll be when they're a little bit more experienced, increased pressure on the system. The system was a little slower, again, slowing people's work down. So, I think it was a combination of both. The bandwidth in the IT system has been addressed. I think the experience will come with time for the personnel. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Brian Wright with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead. Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT : Thanks. Good evening. A couple of questions here. No mention of leap day impact, so was curious about that. Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : Hey, Brian. This is Joe. Obviously, in the first quarter of a leap year, you're going to have higher medical costs, probably by about 1% since you have an extra day which would go straight to your bottom line. However, we are subject to the same calendar as everybody else in the business. We knew about that calendar when we set guidance. So, I don't think it's a factor in how the quarter played out versus what we thought. Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT : Okay. And then do you have, like, on the exchange members, the \u2013 a lot of the new exchange members, do you have any sense of your exchange members how many were prior, kind of, Medicaid customers or anything like that for the new people that you're getting? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : I don't think we had that information. That information would be very hard to develop. I'm not aware of anything that would tell us that. Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. The Medicaid agency doesn't share their information with us. We, obviously, aren't getting any kind of claims or history from our new members, so \u2013 I mean, the only way you could find that out would be to do some sort of a survey. Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT : Okay. And then \u2013 sorry, I'm sorry I just have a longer list than usual today. Just wanted to be clear, the exchange MLR outlook for the year is still 85% or is that changed any at all? John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Brian, this is John. It hasn't changed and we're looking back at what we gave February. Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : I think you're confusing that with expansion, Brian. We guided Marketplace at 79% to 80%, and that's not changing. Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT : Oh, sorry, you are right. I looked at the wrong one. Sorry about that. So, you're assuming the same kind of \u2013 similar kind of seasonality where it goes down in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. Once you get some experience, you just kind of book it where you thought it would be and then kind of in the second quarter, you kind of really find out, is that a fair way to think about that? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : Well, I think I would express it this way as far as recording the expansion MCR, Brian. We're going to book to our pricing until we \u2013 unless we see evidence that pricing is not adequate. When you look at both 2014 and 2015 in terms of pure periods, full-year run-outs, those years actually in total played out very close to our pricing. So, we're going to book to pricing this year, until or unless we see evidence that it is not running \u2013 it is running above pricing. So, I think what that means is, you'll actually see a slight increase in the MLR as the year develops as we get the special enrollment members and as new members become more familiar with how to access the system. Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT : Okay. Okay. And then just lastly, on the \u2013 any of the \u2013 the PMPM issue on the exchange business, is any of that like retro risk adjustment, kind of, changes to 2015? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : Yes. Well, a couple of points, I think was A.J. who had that question. I think the appropriate answer to A.J.'s question was, if you look at where we ended up fourth quarter of 2015 on Marketplace PMPM revenue, we're very close, we're little above that, $20 above that for the first quarter of this year. So, I think the appropriate comparison would be where we ended up last year after we pushed through all of the risk adjustment and all of that. And to your other question, yes, we continue to refine our estimates on things like \u2013 on items like risk adjustment, reinsurance, CSR reconciliation on the marketplace. I think the best way to express all of that, though, is if you look at this quarter in total, you don't see a big impact from out of period development. Just like I said about on claims, not \u2013 in total, much of an impact. Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT : Okay. So, basically, it was at the levels that you thought it was going to be towards the end of last year, the PMPMs on the exchange business? There was no big \u2013 there was like no big risk adjustments getting that much lower relative to what you thought or anything of that nature? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : No. I mean, you saw that happen second \u2013 third and fourth quarters last year and I think we've kind of figured it out by now. Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT : Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah. Thanks. Good evening. So, just, again, to reiterate I think a question that came up earlier, the expansion rates were not the negative surprise, correct? You anticipated this and basically your negative surprise, as I'm understanding from the release, is the cost pressure in Ohio and Texas and then potentially on an increase basis in Puerto Rico? John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: That's right. The surprise was the increased cost in Ohio and Texas. We did note the higher MCR in the expansion as a way to explain the differences between Q1 of 2015 and Q1 of 2016, but we had anticipated that. And if you go back to the guidance, that we did talk about that and included that in the guidance deck from February. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : And then on a go-forward basis as far as expansion rates, do you feel comfortable that there will be no more negative surprises going forward and which states are you then \u2013 if you could just recap, what states are expecting pressure going forward, if any? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : So, let me try that one first. I think what we're seeing now with expansion, if you look at the MLR, it's starting to approach the TANF and ABD populations and we always said that would happen over time. So, I don't think the cost \u2013 the premium pressure I think ultimately \u2013 the big drops in premium I think are, for the most part, behind us looking at the MLRs. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay, so that's done. Then on a go-forward basis, to fix this and to get to this 1.5% or 2%, granted it's not happening until the end of next year, so what is the plan of action in Ohio and Texas there to get this... John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Let me underscore something before Mario speaks. We do talk about the 1.5% to 2% at the end of 2017 and I just want to clarify that what we mean is the end. So, it will be the fourth quarter. Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : All right. So, Ana, this is Mario. If you go back to our guidance slide from February, you'll see where we had projected the MLRs by product. And right now, where we're really off is on the Medicaid, TANF, and ADB. So, I mean, the first thing we need to do is, we need to address that issue. I think longer-term, we still think that there is room for improvement on things like LTSS and duals in Medicare, but that's more of a long-term thing. So we're going to continue to work to drive down medical costs. And as I mentioned in my remarks, the only way that this expansion of insurance to more people is going to work, is if health plans like ourselves can continue to drive down cost. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. And you don't anticipate this issue on our cost to go to some other states? Do feel pretty confident just in these two states or we will be seeing more issues? In other words... Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No, right now we think we've worked through the major issues. And we would anticipate the cost to come down over time. And as a result, the profitability should increase towards the back half of the year. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : And then, finally on the managed Medicaid regulation, is this anything at all to do, is it just a Molina-specific thing or would you be able to use the regulation to improve your rate outlook in any way? And then on Rico funding, the government is looking, I believe, the secretary of BOA just went to Puerto Rico and all that, are you in discussions on what the government might do to help the plans on future costs? Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, first of all, in terms of the regulations, you know they're extensive. They're almost 1,500 pages. So, we're still in the process of evaluating them. So, I don't really want to comment on what we think the regs mean until we've had a chance to really thoroughly review them. We did comment on the draft regulations and our comment letters are public, I believe. In terms of Puerto Rico, we are in discussions with them over the rates. So, again, there's really nothing that I can comment on there. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Hi, thanks for taking the questions. In thinking about the achievement of the 1.5% to 2% by the end of 2017, I guess, given the setback, your trajectory to that will obviously be steeper. I'm wondering if you have views about where you're now \u2013 are you now targeting, say, the low end of that range, where your aspirations might have been higher before. Or another way to come at that might be, at what point in 2016 do you need to see material progress in that direction to believe that those are still achievable? Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, I think that we will see material progress in the third and fourth quarters. And it's a little bit difficult at this point for us to comment on whether we think we're going to be at the high end or the low end of that range. We want to be somewhere between 1.5% and 2% for our profit margin for the fourth quarter of 2017. That's management's commitment. That's what we're driving toward and we still believe that that's an achievable target. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And, Mario, you've talked about the issues and alleviation of a lot of those issues, be it systems or hiring of staff. Have most of the actions or all of the actions been taken at this point and it's a matter of feeling the benefit of the actions or do you still have, for example, management bench to fortify or things like that, that are still needing to be completed? Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I would say both. I think that a lot of these initiatives are in-flight. They're in various stages of development in the different states. We will prioritize the rollout of these things in the future depending upon issues like the size of the state or certain medical cost issues. But those things are all launched. There's really nothing that's new that has to be done. It's just a matter of rolling them out across the enterprise and seeing the benefits. In terms of management, I do think we mentioned, we probably need to add some bench strength. I think there are certain key issues around claims and processing of enrollment and premiums, reconciliation, and so forth where we could probably strengthen things a little bit. I don't think it's a matter of hiring a lot of people, I think it's a matter of hiring a few key people. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Okay. My last question, you have, over the course of the call, talked about wanting to continue to respond to RFPs as it relates to, I believe, you were speaking to acquisitions in that context. You've also said that the acquisitions and the number of them put strain on management. I guess I'm curious about your rationale on continuing to kind of pursue acquisitions, given your need to kind of batten down the hatches here. Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, again, I'll refer you back to our guidance day. We were very clear about the RFPs that we intend to respond to, and I think that those are things that are really going to be 2017 events. As I mentioned in my remarks, we think that beyond the first quarter now, we're going to have a little time to digest and absorb all of this. We don't see a lot new coming on in 2016. In terms of acquisitions, again, the strategy hasn't changed. We're very disciplined about this. We're interested in acquisitions that are going to bring us into new states, and New York is a perfect example of that. That was a strategic acquisition. It gets us into the second largest Medicaid state in the country, and we've been trying to get into that state for many, many years. So, we're now all in five of the five largest Medicaid markets in the country. With regard to other acquisitions, I don't see anything that's going to come in, in 2016. But again, we've been pretty disciplined about our approach and we will continue to pursue the acquisitions as we outlined in February. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Inc.: Great. Just want to go back to the 2017 guidance and the confidence that you're going to get there. I mean, I'm still not 100% clear to me exactly what you mean by the investments in kind of the infrastructure, because I guess my initial thought would be you had that goal for 2017, you learned since then that there were investments that needed to be made with head count, with IT systems and that you're somehow still hitting that same margin target. It seems counterintuitive to me. So, how do you bridge that gap? Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, this is Mario. I think that the way we bridge that gap is through some system changes that we have made. And we are in the process of updating, for example, a lot of our UM guidelines, which we think will lead to lower utilization. But some of this is just allowing those things to mature. As I mentioned, we've hired new nurses. Some of them are inexperienced, and some of them are not very facile with the computer systems. So as those things mature, I think that they'll become more effective and we can do a better job. Part of this is just tincture of time. We do see the profit margins rising in the backend of the year, and our projection is that that will continue into 2017. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Inc.: And so I guess, how much of your view about the margin mean reversion over the next couple years is predicated on getting above average rate increases over the next year working with the state departments (56:02) to do that versus having your medical management deliver cost savings? Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we have never counted on above average rate increases to drive our progress. We've always felt that if we can do a more effective job of managing the members, there is opportunity. And as I mentioned at the outset, we have plenty of revenue and plenty of membership. We are at the high end of our enrollment projections. So I think we're well-positioned. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Inc.: And, I guess, I also have a question about the growth dynamic. I mean, it sounds like you had a range of membership, you're at the high end of the range and that was enough to strain your systems. So I guess how do you think about your ability to grow? In 2016, it sounded like a little bit about rebase year, but you mentioned a lot of RFPs in 2017, thinking about doing deals again in 2017. I mean, is there growth target that you don't really want to get above as you think about that? Is there a right way to manage that number? Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No, I don't think so. I mean, I think that part of our strategy is to continue to grow. It's really more a matter of timing. And we'll continue to grow in the future. John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Kevin, this is John. When we started this out, in I think it was 2012, with the idea that we were going to double the size of the company, we built our systems to double the size of the company and then a margin above that so that we wouldn't get caught too far ahead of ourselves. What we didn't realize is that we would then double the size of the company once again on top of that. So, I think that's where the constraint came in, in terms of some of the systems, which then flowed down into the people and processes. I think what we've done now is we have built a capacity that we need for the next several years, and we're confident that we're not going to have another strain like we just experienced in the first quarter of this year. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Inc.: All right, great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks for the question. There's a lot of things going on here, and sometimes when we see that, it ends up just being that the explanation for overall cost trend going higher. But yet you seem fairly confident that you can get resolved toward the end of this year or the back half of this year. So if we were to sort of classify some of these problems of the industry versus sort of management distraction issues versus cost trend not performing, how much of the different things do you think are those items like Puerto Rico seems fairly industry-wide, Ohio maybe the rate is industry but then there's a local management distraction issue. The TANF and ABD business not performing, it seems like it's a management distraction issue, so maybe those things are management. But how much of the rest of it is just overall cost trend being a little bit faster? Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think is two things. I think, first, we did trip. There's no question that fair amount of this was our own fault. And that's what's led to some of the problem. I think the sort of pricing issue really revolves more around pharmacy than anything else. So, some of these utilization issues we talked about in the first quarter are really growing pains on our part. But I think the more systematic problem is the long-term pharmacy cost trend and we've been talking about that for a couple of years. Pharmacy cost are going up. Insulin, for example, a very common drug that lot of our patients use, has gone up quite a bit in price. We're seeing a lot of new specialty pharmacy drugs and this is not a problem just for us. I think this is industry-wide. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So you would classify sort of the industry stuff is being pharmacy issues, but the other stuff being sort of more within your control to fix going forward, is that a fair way to classify it? Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then you threw out Zika there, but you really didn't sort of put the blame of any of the problems on Zika and it doesn't seem like a big deal yet. But is it driving more utilization in Puerto Rico? Are we seeing more doctor visits of pregnant moms or anything like that? Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, I think we are seeing people are scared and we're probably seeing people that have illnesses that are worried that they might have Zika. So it probably is driving a little bit of utilization. But I don't think we're having catastrophic costs related to Zika at this point. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Have you tried to quantify that yet? Is Puerto Rico could be a test market for what's going to happen in the rest of country as it moves up here? Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think you're right about the fact that this could migrate to the Continental United States. But no, I don't think we have an answer on that one. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, good afternoon. Couple questions. One, obviously, you're anticipating better performance in the back half, have you seen any actual improvement or inflection in utilization in Texas or Ohio yet, or simply anticipating that you'll be able to affect that going forward? Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, it's pretty early for us to comment on that, but I do think we are seeing improvement. But remember this is only the end of April so we haven't even completed the first month of the quarter. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. Secondly I just wanted to clarify I mean, you show us your premium costs and MLR performance by population and then you also show it by state, but we don't get it by population by state. So when we just look at Texas for example, TANF was not an issue for you broadly, ABD and Duals were, so in Texas we're using increased cost across all three of those populations? Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think the increase are across a number populations. But you know in reference to your first comment, we cut this data a lot of ways, and we report quite a bit of information. I think we are very transparent. I don't think it's practical for us to produce more. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : No, that was intended to be a criticism. You definitely give more. I guess what I was trying to parse out was TANF, overall TANF costs broadly across your book looked inline and MLR was down and the issues that really seem to have growth, disproportionate growth in cost and MLRs were ABD and duals. So when we think about Texas and Ohio both, I just wonder if some of the cost issues were isolated in ABD and duals or if you'd say broadly in those states impacted TANF as well, that's what I was trying to get at. Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No. It's more an issue of ABD and TANF and it's more an issue around Ohio and Texas than the other states. I also think if you look at the numbers you'll also see that year-over-year, I think the medical costs are up, the MLRs are up in Illinois and Michigan. Both of those are areas where we have significant new populations because of the acquisitions. And then Ohio and Texas again, it was just general increases in utilization. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then finally, just kind of going back to the Zika topic, a little bit. I think we have a slide from I think your last Investor Day that showed 3% of your fee-for-service costs were in maternity and neonatal, which just I guess struck me as a pretty small number particularly for Medicaid population. So I didn't know if that was TANF only or if this was across your entire book but obviously would have some populations that wouldn't have higher relative maternity costs? Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I'm not really sure what slide you're talking about. I don't have those in front of me. So I can't really address that. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. I'll follow up. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel. Please go ahead. Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, guys. Good afternoon. So two questions and first on the marketplace business and you've chatted a lot about being confident in the numbers and visible cap that you're seeing things visibly going forward, I mean, that's clear and the goal that you're setting out for yourselves. What is the chance that more near term, that on the strong marketplace enrollment growth that you guys are getting adversely selected and that experience catches up with you and we feel more pain on the second quarter? If you could talk a bit to that. You mentioned have an almost real-time data, maybe alleviate some of our fears versus with respect to adverse selection in the marketplace. Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : It's Joe speaking, Tom. What you're suggesting is always possible of course. What we see though generally is a low utilizing a population. Now, the trade-off of that again is we tend to give money back in risk adjustments for that. I guess, all that we can say is in the course of the two and a quarter years we've been doing it, we haven't seen that development. Yes, it could happen in the future, but based on the demographics of our members and what we're seeing, it doesn't look like that's happening. Now remember \u2013 and we talked about this in the script, we're not expecting this business to produce 5% or 10% margins. We're expecting it to produce margins consistent with Medicaid which are obviously much lower. So, our expectations are lower going into it which might be why we're less disappointed. But again, we don't see anything so far that indicates we are getting sicker numbers. Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And Tom, I'll also add that I think that our strategy has a lot to do with this. This is really an extension of our Medicaid product, using our Medicaid network. I think the patients that we're seeing are very similar to our Medicaid members generally, high degree of subsidy. And we never had a commercial product. So, there's no cannibalization of our commercial product into our exchange product. We really think that we're getting people who are low income and have either been on Medicaid in the past, or were uninsured in the past. Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I guess what spooks me a little bit is just the growth that you saw this quarter, right, and Joe, I get that you've been there for a couple of years now. You haven't seen this experience so far. But a pretty sizable jump in the quarter. I guess that's what... Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You're right, Tom, and I would again get back to the network issues. I mean, this is our Medicaid network. And I think we're attracting patients that are similar to the demographics of our Medicaid patients. Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We don't have any data. Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Secondly, is the M&A you've done showing any kind of accretion at all given that most of these are in-market deals and plans that you bought? In the past, when we seen you do tuck-in deals like this, they tend to be accretive or they tend to work right from the start or at least pretty quickly. So, it sounds like the deals that have closed at least so far from when you started about a year ago, offered really no support against the challenges that you're highlighting, for example, like in Ohio and Texas. Is that there or are we off-base? Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. So, Tom, there wasn't a lot of infrastructure buildout required in those states. But I think you can kind of break it into categories. So remember, that in Illinois and in Michigan, we are in new service areas. So, while the health plan staff for the most part are the same, we're dealing with new providers and we don't have a lot of claims experience in those areas. I mean clearly, you're right, we didn't get a big lift this quarter out of our acquisitions. That doesn't mean that we won't going forward. I think it's a little hard to sort out right now. John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Tom, this is John. You have remember, when we bring in new populations, we tend to set our claims reserves on an MCR method for the first few months in the first quarter, and then there is a provision for adverse deviation that we put on top of that. So that tends to the first quarter or two inflate the medical costs and then it comes down over time. So while you didn't see it happen in Q1, that's part of the improvement we'll see in the back half of the year. Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So does your guidance \u2013 it sounds like your guidance include some amount of accretion from the M&A that you've done? John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Yes. Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Is there any way to quantify that or give some of the magnitude or maybe I'll take it off-line. John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: That's probably best. Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : It's very difficult to do that under embark, (01:10:01) Tom, but we can talk. Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. And our last question is a follow-up from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Thanks for fitting me back in. It looks like the dollars spend on G&A came down $100 million from the February guidance and I know you guys had strong enrollment growth, so there's more members and you talked about investing in staff and systems, can you speak to what's the positive offset driving the lower G&A spend? John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Just give us a second. Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : Bear with me, Sarah. Sarah, I think to a degree there, we're victims of rounding, first of all, that's not $100 million. I'm sure that's probably closer to $50 million. It's just a matter of refining our estimates and looking at the degree to which we were are able to hire in the first quarter and fill positions and that kind of items. Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Got it. And as we think about the moving pieces into 2017, are you expecting any benefit from the new accounting guidance related to employee share-based payments can you speak to how much that would be once implemented? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : You put me on the spot there, Sarah. Honestly, I haven't researched that all lot. Our equity spend isn't particularly huge. We also lose the tax deductibility of that. I'll have to look into that and get back to you. Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: But it sounds like that's not part of getting to the 1.5% to 2% maybe that would just be upside. Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : No. But I'll take a look at it. Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, Sarah, once again, we have saved the best for last. Thank you for your questions. So I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. That concludes our call and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, July 27, 2016. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Juan Jos\u00e9 Orellana, Senior Vice President of Investors Relations. Please go ahead. Juan Jos\u00e9 Orellana - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations & Marketing: Thank you, Pascal. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The purpose of this call is to discuss Molina Healthcare's financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2016. The company issued its earnings release reporting these results today after the market closed, and this release is now posted for viewing on our company website. On the call with me today are Dr. Mario Molina, our CEO; John Molina, our CFO; Terry Bayer, our COO; Joseph White, our Chief Accounting Officer. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. If you have multiple questions, we ask that you get back in the queue so that others can have an opportunity to ask their questions. Our comments today will contain forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. All of our forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to numerous risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. A description of such risk factors can be found in our earnings release, and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-K annual report, our Form 10-Q quarterly reports, and our Form 8-K current reports. These reports can be accessed under the Investor Relations tab of our company's website or the SEC's website. All forward-looking statements made during today's call represent our judgment as of July 27, 2016, and we disclaim any obligation to update such statements, except as required by securities laws. This call is being recorded and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available at our company's website, molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Mario Molina. Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Juan Jos\u00e9. Thanks to everyone for joining us. I'm pleased to report that the results we published today represent a significant improvement over the first quarter. We earned $33 million in net income, or $0.58 per diluted share, and adjusted net income of $38 million, or $0.67 per diluted share. I call attention to our adjusted net income, because so many of you are now gauging our performance by that metric. We believe that adjusted net income per diluted share is very helpful in assessing our financial performance, because it removes the non-cash amortization of purchased intangibles. Last quarter, we shared with you some specific improvements that we needed to make to our operations. The results we have reported today speak to the progress we have made. We remain confident about Puerto Rico. We continue to improve our information technology and medical management infrastructure. We're making good progress in Texas, and the issues we identified in Ohio in the first quarter are substantially resolved. Now, let me take these in order. First, we told you that progress in Puerto Rico would take time, but we have reasons to be optimistic. While bad news in the Commonwealth continues to capture headlines, many of the underlying developments tell a more positive story. Governor Padilla has argued consistently that payments for essential public services are a priority. There are more than words behind the Governor's commitment. As of today, Puerto Rico is current on its premium payments, and we believe they will continue to make payments on a timely basis. I'm also happy to report that our rate discussions with the Commonwealth have gone well and that we received a rate increase of approximately 2.5% that was effective on July 1. Stepping away from the macroeconomic situation on the island, there remains much that is within our control. We have identified numerous utilization management and provider contracting opportunities in Puerto Rico that give us a great deal of confidence in the future. We also remain vigilant of Zika infection trends in Puerto Rico and are actively contributing to prevention and education efforts on the island. In addition, health officials in Florida are investigating two possible non-travel-related Zika cases. Again, this is not a Medicaid-specific risk, but a general public health threat, and the concern now is a lack of adequate funding to local government agencies to respond to Zika in a comprehensive manner. During the first quarter, we discussed the substantial growth in our enrollment and the stresses that this growth placed upon our information technology and medical management infrastructure. In order to avoid a repeat of what happened in the first quarter, we have re-prioritized and accelerated improvements that were already planned and budgeted for 2016. Costs associated with these enhancements have already been contemplated in our 2016 outlook. Two improvements are worth specific mention. In the area of information technology, we have supplemented our systems with a hyper-converged infrastructure. This software-centric architecture enables us to achieve a greater level of scalability, improved operational efficiency, shorter deployment times, and enhanced security by tightly integrating our computing, storage, and virtualization resources. On the medical management front, we have also selected a new software platform to manage pharmacy and medical care. This effort will further unify our medical and pharmacy clinical management within one platform rather than managing these two functions separately. We also spoke to the utilization management and provider contracting issues that contributed to our problems in Texas during the first quarter. Even without the benefit of the out-of-period quality revenue adjustments that John will talk about in a few minutes, the medical care ratio of the Texas health plan would have been approximately 85.3% in the second quarter. That is well under the 92.8% medical care ratio we reported in the first quarter. We continue to work with local providers in innovative ways to supplement our contracted provider network. We entered into an agreement with Memorial Hermann in Houston to add this prestigious hospital to our network in 2017. Finally, we shared with you our opinion that the problems experienced by our Ohio health plan in the first quarter were transitory in nature. Today's results support that opinion. The medical care ratio of the Ohio health plan decreased to 89.7% in the second quarter of 2016 from 92% in the first quarter. Health plan and corporate staff have worked together to address the root causes of the utilization management issues that contributed to our first-quarter results. We're pleased with our progress to date. This quarter has given us added confidence that we're making use of the right tools and getting the right results. I look forward to updating you again on our progress. I would now like to turn the call over to John. John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Thank you, Mario, and hello, everyone. Today, as Mario said, we reported adjusted net income per diluted share of $0.67 for the second quarter compared to $0.51 per diluted share on an adjusted basis for the first quarter. These results were driven by lower medical costs as reflected by a 60 basis point improvement in our medical care ratio compared to the first quarter. Comparing our year-over-year performance is no longer meaningful given our growth, changes in product mix and acquisition activity. So, I will focus most of this discussion on sequential comparisons. While changes in accounting estimates resulted in several significant out-of-period adjustments during the quarter and for the year-to-date, it is important to note that in total these items only added $0.04 of a benefit to our quarterly results. For the first half of the year, these adjustments were, in fact, a $0.19 drag on our performance. In other words, however important these items might be to a particular geography or program, they were not significant to our consolidated quarterly results. The important facts about the quarter are as follows. As Mario said, we have reasons to be optimistic in Puerto Rico. Effective July 1, we received a 2.5% increase in premiums on the island. We also have multiple medical management and provider contracting opportunities that we are pursuing while we speak. Operationally, we have addressed the infrastructure problems that contributed to our first quarter difficulties. Despite the noise around our 2015 estimate change, we are satisfied with our marketplace performance. Through June 30 of 2016, the medical care ratio of our marketplace business for 2016 dates of service alone is approximately 78%. This accounts for risk adjustment accruals that we're making for calendar year 2016. And we believe that our marketplace pricing for 2017 is adequate. Finally, the primary drivers of our margin improvement resulted from the work that has been accomplished in Ohio and Texas. The medical care ratio in our Ohio health plan decreased by 230 basis points over the first quarter of 2016. Improvement in Texas was even more pronounced. Even without the benefit of out-of-period quality revenue adjustments, the medical care ratio of our Texas health plan was approximately 85.3% in the second quarter, that is well under the 92.8% medical care ratio that we reported in the first quarter. Now, let's quickly review the significant out-of-period adjustments in the second quarter. All of these adjustments are the result of new information we received during the quarter that required us to make changes to our accounting estimates. First, we recorded increased pre-tax income of $51 million or $0.58 per share relating to the recognition of previously-deferred Texas quality revenue. The Texas Department of Health and Human Services notified us this quarter that it would allow health plans to retain all outstanding quality revenue for calendar years 2014 through 2016. Based on that notification, we recognized $51 million of revenue for 2014, 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 that had previously been deferred. Of the $51 million, $44 million related to 2015 and 2014 dates of service, and $7 million related to the first quarter of 2016. As you know, we have been very transparent about the measurement difficulties with this program and the related accounting treatments, which has affected our earnings. We're happy to be able to put this to rest for a while. Second, we recorded a $37 million or $0.42 per share decrease to pre-tax income related to marketplace 2015 dates of service. As a reminder, on June 30, 2016, CMS published its final update on risk transfer and reinsurance payments for the 2015 calendar year, and we adjusted our accruals accordingly. Based on information received in 2016, we now know that our 2015 accruals were light. We continue to refine our accrual methodology as we get more information and believe we are more accurately reserved for the 2016 benefit year. I want to emphasize that our marketplace strategy has been to provide an accessible extension of our Medicaid product to those individuals whose eligibility for Medicaid tends to fluctuate due to variability in their income. Remember, the segment most likely to purchase an exchange product from Molina includes those individuals under 250% of the federal poverty level. Approximately 90% of our marketplace members continue to receive a government subsidy for co-pays and premiums, and it's no coincidence that we have grown significantly in states that have not expanded their Medicaid programs. We continue to have a disciplined approach to our pricing strategy, and we believe that we have adequately priced our marketplace products for 2017. An important consideration as you analyze our marketplace pricing is to compare our pricing with that of other health plans that primarily serve Medicaid members, as opposed to those that primarily serve commercial members. Next, we recorded an $11 million or $0.12 per share decrease to pre-tax income for 2015 dates of service related to Puerto Rico. As disclosed in our 10-Q for the first quarter, this matter arose as a result of enrollment discrepancies between our health plan and the Commonwealth in the early stages of our contract. Let me be clear. We believe that we have a valid claim to all of the premiums withheld. Nevertheless, we reduced premium revenue by $11 million during the second quarter in connection with this matter. The company is affirming its previously-announced earnings outlook. That outlook anticipates earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.15 to $2.60, and adjusted earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.50 to $2.95. We believe that adjusted net income per diluted share is very helpful in assessing our financial performance, because it removes the non-cash amortization of purchased intangibles. Furthermore, we expect our 2016 marketplace margins, measured absent the impact of the 2015 true-ups, to decline significantly during the second half of the year, as a result of four factors. One, we will incur higher costs as members reach the limits of the cost-sharing provisions of their insurance coverage. Two, higher-cost members will be added through the special enrollment period. Three, there will be attrition among lower utilizing members. And four, utilization among new members will increase as they become more engaged with our networks. While we expect our Ohio and Texas health plans will continue to perform well, additional improvement over and above the performance this quarter will be difficult to achieve. In particular, the decline in marketplace margins that we expect in the second half will be especially notable in Texas. Puerto Rico will begin to improve, but slowly and towards the end of the year. Rate increases will provide a modest lift to the second half performance as follows. For Medicaid rates in 2016 and excluding Medicaid expansion, we receive increases of approximately 3% in California and 2.5% in Puerto Rico, both effective July 1, and approximately 3% in Texas effective September 1. For Medicaid expansion rates in 2016, we saw decreases of approximately 11% in California and approximately 2% in Ohio, both effective July 1. Finally, and somewhat related, we saw the implementation of a medical care ratio floor of 86% for the South Carolina Medicaid business effective July 1. At June 30, 2016, days and claims payable were up two days to 48 days from the previous quarter, and cash and investments were in excess of $4.3 billion. Cash flow from operations was $139 million, in line with the prior quarter, and we held more than $465 million in cash and investments at the parent. Finally, we wanted to provide you with ample notice that we are postponing our 2016 fall Investor Day in September in order to have a more meaningful discussion that includes our third quarter results. We've moved that to another date. We will communicate that new date once it has been selected. It was a very good quarter, and I want to thank all of those employees who worked very hard to make it such a success. This concludes our prepared remarks. We're ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Joshua Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good work this quarter, guys. I guess my question is just starting on the marketplace, and you know this sort of \u2013 I don't what you want to call it, sort of same-store 78% MLR, excluding all the out-of-period stuff. I guess, I know we've asked this before how is that sustainable, and I know you guys keep producing solid results and you're targeting low income, but we are seeing a lot more pressure sort of across the board. So I'm just curious, are you seeing any of these issues that have been reported by others in terms of chronic cost and dialysis or substance abuse, or any of these other issues? Are any of these factors that you guys are seeing? Is it just you guys were better prepared? I'm curious. Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Josh, this is Mario. Yes, we have seen that, all those things to some extent in our members, just like everyone else. I don't think they were any different in that respect. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. So, I guess I'm just curious, like is there \u2013 there has been no deterioration, though, in those trends, right? And it sounds like others have seen it. Are you \u2013 because you guys have taken on a ton of membership, and I'm just curious, were they previously insured with other carriers and just not new to it? I'm just curious how you guys are doing such a good job here. Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : Well, Josh, it's Joe. I would just point out that while we are seeing those conditions as any health plan would, we continue to have, on a risk score basis, comparatively healthier members. We've put aside for 2016 dates of service about $220 million so far this year for payables back to CMS for risk adjustment. So, I guess, I would say that we're not seeing a huge number of chronically ill members. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then, Joe, I think you might have just hinted on this, but the CMS update where they said you guys got to catch up a little on your accruals from last year. Did that inform your accruals for 2016? Did you make any catch ups in 2Q as to where you are now? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : In a nutshell, yes. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then just last question from me. On the Texas performance fees, I just want to understand what happened with the state. Did they actually prove out, yes, Molina satisfied all of the requirements to earn these performance fees, or was it just simply the state said, okay, everyone that thinks they're owed money, yeah, we agree at this point? Just it wasn't clear from your comments if there was something specific that you guys achieved that helps you understand how this works or if this was just simply Texas kind of clearing the decks for the last couple of years. Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Josh, this is Mario. Texas suspended the program, and so the revenue that we had not recognized, we were able to recognize. They are going to institute a new program. We are not sure exactly what that will look like yet, and we still have to perform all the quality measures and report those to the state. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. So, they sort of capitulated and just told everyone forget about the old program. We're going to start something new and recognize all the revenue that we've previously withheld, basically? Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That's correct. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks. Just wanted to go into the ramp that your guidance basically assumes for the rest of the year. In the press release, you guys outlined a number of things that were going to kind of inform and drive that improvement. I was wondering if you could maybe try to quantify each one of those buckets between medical management initiatives and rate increases, et cetera. Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : This is Mario. I think we've done that to the best of our ability. We've given you the factors. We've spelled out the rate increases. Beyond that, it's hard to quantify exactly how much each of those initiatives is going to contribute. But we have also told you that the back half of the year is where the lion's share of the profit is coming from this year. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch : So, I guess \u2013 so like the first bullet point in your guidance was savings realized from medical management initiatives. Would you say that those in aggregate are a bigger driver to the improvement in earnings than the rate increases are, or \u2013 just trying to get order of magnitude? John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Yeah. This is John. Yes, medical management is going to continue to be the biggest profit improvement driver. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then just trying to understand, you said that from a G&A perspective that you made a number of initiatives around assisted (22:32), et cetera, things that you'd planned for the year, but that you'd accelerated. Does that mean we should expect G&A to be a little bit lower in the back half of the year than it normally would be, because you moved what was supposed to be second half into the first half, or how do we think about modeling G&A as the year goes on? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : It's Joe speaking. Generally, a lot of those kind of expenses we're talking about are capitalized, so they would be reflected in the D&A rate. With that said, though, I would expect that we'll see a little bit of moderating of the G&A rate that you saw this quarter through the second half of the year. Our full-year guidance, I think, is about 7.8% G&A ratio. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch : Okay. Then just last question for me then, the fact that you're postponing the Investor Day until after Q3 results, is there something unique about this year or a lack of visibility, or a catalyst that you're going to get more visibility on in that October timeframe that makes \u2013 I guess, theoretically, you've had similar issues in years past, and you've always had the Analyst Day at the same time. What was the \u2013 what are you going to get by delaying it by a couple of months? Is there something specific you're looking for? Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Kevin, you're right. We've had this issue in the past, and we just felt that with the passage of time, we'd be in a better position to talk about things. It's a little awkward to be talking about issues that close to the end of the quarter. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch : Okay. All right. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hey, guys. Just on Puerto Rico, I just want to make sure I understand sort of the dynamic there at this point. You're going to \u2013 or you did get the rate increase earlier this month, but is the improvement at this point largely just going to come from medical management initiatives? And if that is the case, where are the areas that you feel like you were weakest sort of coming into this year and where the greatest improvements will come from? John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: I would say the answer is going to be both medical management and re-contracting, Chris. On the island, the provider groups are more accustomed to taking pharmacy risk than they are, for example, on the mainland. That will become an issue for us as we re-contract with some of the medical groups. In terms of the medical management and what needs to be done additionally, some of the hospitals that we've been dealing with are fairly restrictive in terms of concurrent and prior authorization for admissions. And so, we're working with them to beef up that ability. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. And then on the marketplace enrollment \u2013 or marketplaces, and the performance there in the second half, I think you mentioned Texas, specifically, as being a pressure point. I could have misheard you, but if that is, indeed, the case, can you give us a sense for what's going on there? John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Well, again, what we said was that Texas is not going to \u2013 shouldn't be expected to improve beyond what we did in the second quarter, once you take out the effect of the additional revenue. One of the reasons that Texas had a very good MCR for the second quarter was because the marketplace performed very well in Texas in the quarter, and we're not going to see continued increases in profitability on a percentage basis. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. And then just one last follow-up on the marketplace, where do you think the right sort of MCR should be for the year, or just maybe even what are you guys targeting sort of longer term? Thanks a lot. Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : It's Joe. I think, obviously, you have to consider all the stuff we've talked about, about higher admin burden and all of that. But I think an 83% \u2013 82%, 83% for the year might be okay. 80% to 82%. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Thank you, and congrats on the strong quarter. And I appreciate the level of detail you provided in the release. It makes things very clear. I wanted to talk a little bit about earnings progression. So, last quarter, on the call, you thought two-thirds of earnings would come in the back half, but this would put you guys above current guidance. So, should we think about there being some conservatism in guidance right now, or did some of the cost improvements in Ohio and Texas resolve faster than you'd previously anticipated? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : Hi, Sarah. It's Joe. Let me give a technical answer to caution everybody. Then Mario and John may have something to say more strategic. First of all, be careful extrapolating on anything per share related. We're at about 38% for the first half, at the midpoint of our pre-tax guidance. Remember, obviously, the share count is going to fluctuate depending on where our share price goes. So I don't think earning 38% of pre-tax through second quarter really contradicts saying about two-thirds of our income is going to come in the second half. So, I think we're being pretty consistent on that. Obviously, we hope to spend the second half of the year developing the medical management initiatives and the other initiatives we've talked about to drive sustained profitability into 2017. John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Yeah, let me just follow-up, Sarah. This is John. I think we've tried to be very consistent with what we've said this year. We're driving towards a 1.5% to 2% margin in Q4 of 2017. That's what we're focused on. And so, the plans that we've put in place are to get us at that point, or to that point, rather. Some of them may take longer. Some of them may catch a hold sooner, and that's what's going to be sort of the delta for 2016 as to where we are in our guidance range. But we're less focused on where we are in the guidance range this year and more, what are we putting in place to hit our commitment for next year. Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Thank you. I appreciate that. And just to clarify here on Ohio, historically, it's kind of been in the mid-80%s, but I know there's some mix shift going on. It sounded like earlier on the call you thought the majority of the improvement was done. So, should we think about this as the new run rate for Ohio, or is there still more improvement to be had? John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: I think this is probably the new run rate for Ohio. Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe just a couple of clarifying questions real quick here. On the comment about the 82% to 83% general MCR in the exchanges, I'm guessing that puts you solidly profitable on the exchanges this year. When you think about going forward in 2017, as you've said you've addressed what you've seen in the bids, are you thinking that you will maintain profitability or are you thinking you can improve it further from here? And I just wondered on the exchanges as well, is that \u2013 I can't tell from the comments, are you \u2013 is this the margin you thought you were going to have when you came into the year, or is the margin a little compressed versus what you thought when you came into the year? John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: This is John. The margin is tracking about what we thought, about what we've priced at. Remember, as we said, the back half of the year is going to be more challenging from a profitability standpoint on the marketplace for those four reasons that I identified. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Right. John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: And we think that for 2017, the margins are going to be similar to our Medicaid business. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then, just to clarify on Puerto Rico, I know last time \u2013 and I think you touched on it maybe in response to Chris's question, but last time you said that one of the big issues was around branded versus generic and maybe some cross-incentives there between what the government wanted and what was potentially best in terms of long-term costs dynamics. It sounds like you're working through trying to address those incentives for the physician to prescribe the generic, et cetera. How long do you think that takes to make that adjustment? When would you expect to see us benefit from that? And how might big might that aspect of the issue of Puerto Rico will be in terms of its impact on your results? Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : A.J., this is Mario. It's hard for me to quantify how big the impact will be. But I can tell you that we have put a pharmacy management program in place that's somewhat similar to what we use in other states and we're trying to get doctors to convert from more-expensive drugs to equivalent drugs that are lower in cost. At the same time, there are re-contracting efforts underway to give them some risk on the pharmacy side to give them an incentive to use generic drugs. That's going to take place over the course of the rest of the year, I think. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. But when you go into 2017, you think you'll pretty much have in that into place? Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think we will have improvement. I'm not sure exactly how much it will be in place at that point, but there will definitely be an improvement. And I think the state also acknowledged in the negotiations with us that the pharmacy costs had come in higher than they had anticipated as well. It wasn't just us, but I think the whole program seemed a little bit higher than they anticipated. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. All right. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good afternoon. So I just wanted to follow-up a little bit on your MLR guidance from last quarter, assuming that's still in place. It kind of implies a step-down both sequentially and, obviously, versus the first half, but you guys have just told us marketplace is actually going to get a little worse, Ohio and Texas are stable. So, what's really going to be driving a lot of that step-down there as the rate increases in other states, there's general cost-containment in the other states? What's moving the MLRs lower for the rest of the year. Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : Hi. It's Joe speaking. I mean, couple of points. The rate increases we've talked about are going to be a definite help. They're obviously directed at TANF and ABD. So we should see some sequential improvement in TANF and ABD margins, which given their relative size is going to offset anything happening in marketplace. So, that's really where you should look for it. Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. So it's kind of broad based any place we kind of got rate increases? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : Yeah. Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : I mean, you just have to look at relative scale of the ABD and TANF to our business, and it's very substantial. Yeah. Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, Texas quality, so you recognize this taking $7 million \u2013 taking last year out $7 million in the first quarter, do you also recognize $7 million in the second quarter? And are we assuming that it's $7 million every quarter for the year for 2016? How that kind of compare to the original assumption, back at the Analyst Day where I think you guys assumed 75% of total quality revenues, would be kind of realized there? And then lastly, understanding the Texas program is changing, do you think we should be assuming those 2016 numbers are, to some extent, going to continue in some form next year as we probably put a haircut on it, thinking going forward? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : It's Joe speaking. Compared to guidance for the back half of the year, it's probably closer to, yeah, $3 million, $3 million a quarter incremental. The states communication to us suggested that they're \u2013 that the program would not be resumed until 2018, but obviously they have the right to set the program how they want to. So, we'll have to see how that develops later. But the most-recent communication from the states said there would be no program in 2017. Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. So does that \u2013 so, what are you expecting to be total revenues related to 2016 that you're going to recognize in 2016? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : I mean the total \u2013 previously, the program had been $35 million to $40 million a year and we anticipated recognizing \u2013 I want to say, I think we talked about at Investor Day \u2013 maybe 70% of that. So, the difference of that would be to pick up. Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much. Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink. Please go ahead. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah. Hi. Thanks. Good evening. The first question was just on Ohio. I'm really glad you got the MLR down. Can you give us some color on what exactly was the approach taken? You had talked about systems capacity issues in Ohio more broadly and clinical staffing issues, and some of the standards you had on prior authorization. Is that all pretty much addressed? And can we be confident that there won't be something like this, again, perhaps in another state that is large enough for you to make a difference? Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That's a great question, Ana. And the answer is, yes, those are the things we talked about. Those are things that we did. And we've applied this across the enterprise, not just in Ohio. It's had the biggest impact in Ohio. And I think we're seeing nice results as utilization in the Medicare line of business is starting to come down. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. So, you're comfortable on that on. On Texas, I had thought also when we spoke last that it was going to be mostly the second-half thing, perhaps the contracting maybe with hospitalist contracts as well on utilization. So, what exactly was undertaken in Texas and that helped so much in the first half of the year, even ex- the Texas quality payments? Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think it's all the same things we've talked about. They may have taken hold little faster than we thought in Texas, but we're cautious. It's one quarter. So, we'll keep a close eye on that. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : All right. Then third, on Florida and Michigan, you're running at pretty high MLRs. You did get the rate adjustment in Florida. What type of MLRs should we be baking in on a go-forward basis from a structural perspective and then just for the second half of this year? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : Hi, Ana, it's Joe. We get into some of that disclosure on the state-by-state basis in the 10-Q that's been filed. I would take a look at that. Remember that Florida, in particular, had been impacted by the out-of-period marketplace adjustments. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Then finally, I think \u2013 maybe a couple more. One is on seasonality. As I understand, it is supposed to help you in the second half of the year. So, in terms of earnings progressions, what is the driver of favorable seasonality? It seems like on the health insurance marketplaces, it works against you. So, what is working for you in the second half of the year here? John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: You're right. Ana, this is John. The seasonality, typically when we were more pure Medicaid, the third quarter tends to have the lowest medical care ratio, because you're talking about summer months. However, more and more of our revenue now is coming from marketplace. And as we discussed earlier, the marketplace for the back half of the year has a deterioration in the medical care ratio, because people are eating up through their co-pays and deductibles, and then you've got a bit of adverse selection as folks who aren't utilizing the system drop off because they don't pay the premiums, and you've got people who are qualified to the special enrollment period. Marketplace hasn't been, up until this year, a significant impact on the consolidated business. So, it's been tough for us to see what the impact overall is going to be on seasonality. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : And with the variance that you came out with, I thought you had assumed a significantly higher risk adjuster payable after the first quarter. So, I was a little surprised that you had such a large negative variance on the RRs compared to what the 10-Q might have suggested in the first quarter. I'm not sure if I'm missing something. Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : It's been a tiger by the tail, Anna. And we were getting some information, I want to think, in May was the last likely number we came out with. But suffice to say we've got a lot more information in the second quarter that we didn't have in the first quarter. John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: And the risk adjustment program for the marketplace really is unlike the risk adjustment programs that we have experienced in Medicaid or Medicare. So, it's taken us a while to thoroughly understand a fundamentally-flawed calculation. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Got it. All right. Thanks so much. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Thanks. A couple of smaller ones. In the Florida premium adjustment that you show in the press release, I think the view is that that would also perhaps influence or lead into forward-looking rate adjustments. Do you have any greater visibility on that, or are those baked into kind of the overall rate adjustment that you may have already gotten? John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: We haven't received any \u2013 this is John. We haven't received any additional information on prospects for our rate increase in Florida effective \u2013 I think Florida is September 1, we're waiting to see. Certainly, the fact that they miscalculated the rates for a period of time and have adjusted those upwards will have an impact, as they calculate the rates on a go-forward basis. Just how much of it is, we don't know. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Okay. In California, the Medicaid expansion rate fell, a (42:34) reduction of 11%. I'm curious about how much were you perhaps already against an MLR floor where you were rebating back, such that that doesn't really affect the go-forward profitability, or vice versa, how much does it impact profitability? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : It's Joe speaking. We think we're still within the give back after that change, not by much, but we think we're still there. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Okay. So you still would be in a rebating situation? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : Yeah. Very marginally, but yes. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then, kind of on a different topic. Curious about how the series of acquisitions that the company has done, how have those integrated and how are those performing within the book of business? Not a topic that's come up yet. John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Hi. This is John. I think that they're all in various stages, because they closed on different dates. The plans in Illinois, for instance, closed January and March. But I would say that for the most part they're all performing as expected. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : And Total Care is still expected to close later in the third quarter? John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: We are expecting Total Care to close this year, yes. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And the last question. The marketplace revenue adjustments of $37 million in the quarter, is it possible to give us a sense, geographically, of how those would hit plan so that we can kind of make that adjustment? The Texas and Ohio \u2013 or excuse me, Texas and Puerto Rico are easy enough to do, but the marketplace seems like it could affect multiple states. Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : Yeah, it's Joe speaking. Obviously, it's going to be most pronounced in Florida, with the majority of it in Wisconsin. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Michael Baker with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. John, you kind of indicated some confidence around seeing some Puerto Rico improvement by the fourth quarter, maybe not so much in the third quarter. Is that just a function of the timing of provider re-contracting along the lines that you guys spoke about earlier in the conference call, or are there other factors as well? John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: I think that was Mario who expressed the confidence, but I would agree with him. It's probably going to be more fourth quarter than third. Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And what are \u2013 so is it pretty much just the timing of provider contracting, or are there other factors as well? John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: No, that's the big one, provider contracting. Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. Most of my Qs have been asked. Just had one clarification, just on the California Medicaid expansion rate cut of 11%, how does that compare? I remember at the Investor Day, you had talked about a rate outlook for a 13% cut in January of 2016. Is this essentially replacing that or is this on top of that? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : No. This is Joe speaking. You're correct. That January 2016 was meant to be July. Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Got it. Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : So, that was... Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): So, at the time, you were thinking 13% for July and it came in at 11%? Joseph W. White - Chief Accounting Officer : Yeah. Yeah. Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks, guys. Question on your pricing for 2017 in the marketplace. We've seen your California pricing and it seems, relative to other plans, you're increasing prices a lot less than some of the other plans, suggesting that perhaps you'll pick up some of their membership when people start to price shop. First off, question is, is that what we should expect to see, a much faster growth rate for you guys in California, and is your pricing in California in the marketplaces reflective of what you've done across the country? John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: So, this is John. I don't want to get into too much talking about enrollment for 2017. We went back a number of times and looked at pricing for all of our marketplace products, on a geographic-specific basis. We've factored in changes in our network, changes in utilization, and we thought the competition we would be doing, in order to get a competitive price product for the population we're targeting. And you mentioned California and LA County, we don't have Cedars-Sinai in our network, for example. Not that they're not a fine institution, but they're priced way above what we and our population we're targeting can afford. So, that's how we did it. We wanted to raise prices to protect ourselves against adverse selection as folks drop out. But we also didn't want to have a product that was priced so high that our people couldn't afford it. What happens in 2017 with the ultimate enrollment is going to be a function of education, broker, marketing and folks choosing our networks. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So, was California reflective then of what you've done in another country \u2013 in other states, rather? John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Yes. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And so, when I look at the low pricing, relative to others, and others backing out of the marketplaces or raising prices much more dramatically, are you concerned at all that you're going to pick up some of their less-healthy populations and create more of an issue for you guys, going forward? John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: I think if you look at the other Medicaid-focused plans, they're staying in the markets and we're priced competitively with them. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our last question is from the line of Tommy Carroll with Stifel. Please go ahead. Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Very, very nice quarter, like to see it. I think everything \u2013 most of my Qs have been asked and answered. One follow-up on from administrative standpoint, just cash at the parent. John, I think you mentioned that. I missed it. If you could just tell us that again. And also wanted to ask about some of the acquisitions that were done in the last 12 months, specifically drill down on a couple of the larger ones, like HealthPlus and Integral. I wonder if you could just make some comments about either one of those, anything of note. Thanks John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Well, Tom, I'm extremely disappointed that you tuned me out. The number of cash at the parent is $465 million. In terms of the acquisitions, Integral is doing very well for us. I think Integral is actually performing better than we initially modeled it. HealthPlus is likewise doing fairly well. Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So, you would that \u2013 you call those two performing better than planned? Is it fair? John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: I would, yes. Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Very good, very good. And I never tune you out. I think I was doodling or something. Have a good one. John C. Molina, JD - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Thanks. Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Tom. Operator : Thank you. Joseph Mario Molina - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, if there are no questions, we're going to sign off. Thank you very much for attending the call. We look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

The company's earnings release reporting its results was issued today after the market closed, and it is now posted for viewing on our company website. On the call with me today are Dr. Mario Molina, our CEO; John Molina, our CFO; Terry Bayer, our COO; and Joseph White, our Chief Accounting Officer. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. If you have multiple questions, we ask that you get back in the queue so that others can have an opportunity to ask their questions. Our comments today will contain forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. All of our forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to numerous risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. A description of such risk factors can be found in our earnings release, and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-K Annual Report, our Form 10-Q quarterly reports, and our Form 8-K current reports. These reports can be accessed under the Investor Relations tab at our company's website or on the SEC's website. All forward-looking statements made during today's call represent our judgment as of October 27, 2016, and we disclaim any obligation to update such statements, except as required by securities laws. This call is being recorded and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available at our company's website, molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Mario Molina. Joseph Mario Molina - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, Juan Jos\u00e9, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We are pleased with the results we reported today. Revenue and enrollment growth remained strong and medical margins across the majority of our products are improving. Today's results provide insights into the operational improvements we have made, as well as some of the challenges that we confront. While we have shared our strategies for addressing some of these challenges in the past, it is helpful to reexamine them by separating them into two categories : those that are specific to Molina and those that are environmental. As we communicated early this year, the internal challenges the company faced included weaker than anticipated operational performance at our Puerto Rico, Ohio and Texas health plans. We're making progress in Puerto Rico. But as we have said in the past, the turnaround there will take some time, given our recent entry into the market and the time needed to benefit from new provider agreements and from our care model. In contrast, our interventions at our more established Ohio and Texas health plans have yielded significant operational improvements, enabling us to overcome the challenges we discussed earlier this year. In addition to the improvements that we have made at specific health plans, we continue to upgrade our technology. During the third quarter, we upgraded the newer version of our existing enterprise core administration platform across 12 health plans. The upgrade allows us to continue to accommodate growth and increase administrative efficiency, while adapting to changing compliance and other business requirements. The second category of challenges includes environmental or external matters. The most significant of these challenges involve the Affordable Care Act's insurance marketplaces. Before I discuss these challenges further, we should not lose sight of the fact that the Affordable Care Act has been successful in providing health insurance coverage to 20 million people. We have always believed that participation in the health insurance marketplace is directly aligned with the Molina mission to provide healthcare to people receiving government assistance. The fact that we've enrolled over 550,000 marketplace members today confirms that many Americans value the combination of affordable and quality healthcare that Molina offers. Notwithstanding all of its benefits, however, the health insurance marketplace has suffered from its share of growing pains. I want to emphasize that no undertaking of this complexity and size is ever implemented perfectly. My remarks today are not meant to condemn a valuable and much-needed program. The marketplaces are generally performing well. They only require modification and adjustment, not wholesale change. We believe that risk transfer is one aspect of the marketplaces that requires immediate attention. Because this is the first iteration of the risk transfer process, we should not be surprised that it needs fine-tuning. Specifically, the marketplaces must modify their risk-transfer methodology so that low-cost and low-premium insurers are not penalized. The goal of the risk-transfer program is to encourage health plans to compete based on the value and efficiency of their services rather than by attracting healthier enrollees. This is a laudable and necessary goal, which we at Molina support. But we must be sure that the risk-transfer methodology used does not interfere with the equally laudable and necessary goal of affordable quality healthcare. As outlined by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in the Federal Register, the intent of the Affordable Care Act's use of risk adjustment was to reflect health risk, not other cost differences. The key weakness of the current marketplace risk-transfer methodology is that it redistributes dollars among health plans based on total premiums, not health risk. To understand this, we need to briefly describe the mechanics behind marketplace risk transfer. Risk scores are determined for each health plan, based upon the documented health status of that specific plan's membership. Risk transfer is accomplished when health plans with risk scores below 1 transfer money to help plans with risk scores above 1. Payments are calculated by multiplying each individual health plan's relative risk score by the state-wide average premium. But since premiums include medical and administrative costs, any transfer payment is based in part on non-medical costs captured in the state-wide average premium. This is in conflict with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' stated intent. Using premiums in the calculation rather than medical costs creates two distortions. First, the application of risk scores to premiums inappropriately transfers funds based in part on costs that are not medical in nature. Second, the use of a state-wide average premium also discourages health plans from lowering premiums. In order to offset risk-transfer payment in the future, plans have an incentive to increase premiums. In other words, if a health plan was to cut its premium, its risk profile remained the same and the average state-wide premium increased, it would owe more in risk-transfer payments in the following year. Fortunately, a risk-transfer fix can be implemented by simply modifying the transfer formula so that premium is adjusted based on 80% of the premium rather than 100% of the premium. This 20% reduction to the premium base would correlate with the statutory minimum medical loss ratio of 80%, as required by the Affordable Care Act. On October 6, we documented our concerns in a comment letter to CMS. Remember, the financial impact of spiraling premium increases will be borne not only by the insured, but also by the federal government and taxpayers because of associated higher premium subsidies. Currently, about 25% of Molina's marketplace premiums flow back to the government and then on to our competitors as part of the risk-transfer process. For the 2015 benefit year, our risk-transfer payments were approximately $254 million. And so far this year, we have accrued $372 million for the 2016 benefit year. As a result of this flawed risk-transfer methodology, we may be forced to curtail our marketing in certain marketplace states. I used the word curtail rather than terminate, because we remain committed to working with the government to create a competitive, stable and sustainable environment for the marketplaces. In addition to marketplace, another developing story is that of our proposed acquisition of the assets being divested from Aetna and Humana as a result of their proposed merger. This is a great opportunity for Molina to add scale to our Medicare Advantage offering. However, due to its ongoing nature, we cannot comment further. It is important to note that Molina has more than 10 years of experience in serving the most difficult of Medicare members, the dual eligibles. We are pleased that our Medicare plan in New Mexico has achieved a four-star rating. In addition, our Florida health plan improved to three-and-a-half stars and achieved a commendable rating from NCQA. This improvement to our star scores is no small feat. CMS and the publication Health Affairs have reported that social determinants of health impact star scores. I want to congratulate our health plans on their success on improving measurable quality. Great job. As a reminder, we closed on the Total Care acquisition in New York and began reporting on that business during the third quarter. We feel good about the prospects for this New York business as well as its long-term strategic value in one of the top-five markets for government programs in the country. Finally, I wanted to congratulate Molina Medicaid Solutions on two recent accomplishments. First, on October 6, our MMIS system in West Virginia was certified by CMS. West Virginia is the first state to fully participate in a new rigorous certification protocol. CMS cited West Virginia for successfully implementing an MMIS system on schedule and on budget. I would like to congratulate the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources as well as our team for accomplishing this significant achievement. Second, the State of Louisiana has extended our MMIS contract for another year, and we welcome the opportunity to continue to work with the state in 2017. That concludes my remarks. With that, I will turn the call over to John for a look at our financial performance in greater detail. John C. Molina, JD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, Mario. Good afternoon, everyone. Today we reported net income per diluted share of $0.76 in the third quarter, compared to $0.58 in the second quarter of 2016. On an adjusted basis, which we believe to be a more meaningful measure of our earnings, we reported $0.85 this quarter, up from $0.67 during the previous quarter. Revenue increased to $4.5 billion for the quarter and to nearly $13.5 billion for the first nine months of this year. As Mario discussed earlier, we have worked diligently on the issues we outlined during the first quarter, and we have overcome many of those challenges. Compared to the first and second quarters of this year, the results we reported today are relatively free of out-of-period adjustments. This makes the discussion of the results we reported today relatively straightforward. Put very simply, our Medicaid and Medicare businesses are doing better, but marketplace has lagged. I think the key points to draw from in the results that we issued today are the following : First, our business is headed in the right direction. Utilization of medical care services is trending downwards, and the issues we experienced earlier this year in Ohio and Texas are substantially behind us. And results in Puerto Rico, while still not where we want them to be, are improving. If we remove out-of-period revenue adjustments for Puerto Rico and Texas from our second quarter results, we see that our medical care ratio for all of our businesses combined, excluding marketplace, decreased by 70 basis points from the second quarter of this year. Second, we continued to benefit from greater administrative cost efficiency. Our general and administrative expense ratio dropped 50 basis points during the third quarter to 7.6%. This decline is partially the result of lowering advertising and broker expenses, and we will see higher G&A expense in the fourth quarter as open enrollment and advertising ramp up. Nevertheless, we are on track to finish 2016 with a full-year G&A ratio well below 8%. Third, the benefits of geographic and product diversification are real. If you study the health plan and product information in our earnings release, you will see that different states and different products often support earnings when other states and products experience financial challenges. This is why geographic and product diversification, for example our New York acquisition and our proposed Medicare transaction, are so important. This is why we stay the course in markets like Puerto Rico when other health plans might consider leaving. The ACA marketplaces provide us with a long-term opportunity for continued diversification that is consistent with the Molina mission. 20 million Americans have health insurance today as a result of the Affordable Care Act. Today, we provide affordable and quality health care to over 550,000 marketplace members, making us one of the top-10 largest marketplace providers. It is important to present the financial challenges we face in the marketplace into the proper perspective. By excluding adjustments made in 2016 that relate to dates of service in 2015, we can get a better sense for what the pure period performance is for the marketplace. Following this approach, the medical care ratio for the marketplace program increased to 89% in the third quarter from 80% in the second quarter. On our last call, we told you that we expected marketplace performance to deteriorate during the second half of this year. We expected lower financial performance as a result of normal membership attrition, the addition of higher-cost members through the special enrollment process, higher costs as members reach the limits of cost-sharing provisions of their coverage, and increasing utilization as members become more engaged with our care networks. All of those things happened, but they do not tell the whole story. We also recorded higher-than-expected risk-transfer liabilities in the quarter, which further reduced our premiums and our margins. As Mario said, we believe that the methodology used to calculate marketplace risk-transfer payments penalizes efficient and affordable health plans like Molina. And, as a result, those purchasing affordable marketplace policies ultimately pay higher premiums. Currently, about 25% of Molina's marketplace premiums flow back to the government and then on to our competitors as part of the risk-transfer process. For the 2015 benefit year, risk transfer payments paid by Molina were approximately $254 million. And so far this year, we have accrued $372 million for the 2016 benefit year due. If the risk-transfer formula were modified so that the state-wide average premium is reduced by 20% to reflect the minimal medical cost floor of the ACA, only 20% of our marketplace premiums would be transferred to competitors, and our liability at September 30 would have been reduced by $75 million. Nevertheless, we believe that marketplace performance for the full-year 2016 will be approximately breakeven, that is for 2016 dates of service. We continue to be cautiously optimistic that our marketplace business will generate after-tax margins consistent with the rest of our business for 2017. As Mario discussed, we remain actively engaged in improving the risk-transfer payments and the risk-sharing methodology. Turning to our balance sheet. As of September 30, 2016, the company had cash and investments of more than $4.6 billion, including almost $390 million at the parent company. Days and claims payable came down 1 day sequentially to 47 days. As a reminder, we do not provide quarterly guidance. As we have said repeatedly during past calls, we adjust guidance only when we believe there is a material change to the business from what we have previously communicated. There have been no material changes to our business since we issued revised guidance in April, and therefore, we are not making any adjustments to our 2016 guidance at this time. We have decided to wait until February of 2017 to host our next Investor Day. We strive to provide investors with relevant and quality information. However, we felt that the timing of this late fall potential conference combined with a lack of visibility into key events, such as the U.S. presidential election, a decision on the Aetna-Humana merger and greater clarity on marketplace risk transfer made it more prudent to wait. This concludes our prepared remarks. Ash, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of A. J. Rice with UBS. You may proceed with your question. A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Hello, everybody. I understand not wanting to speculate on what's happening at Humana and Aetna. But just from Molina's thinking about being ready to take on this if the deal were to be approved, it sounds like it would all happen very quickly in January. Do you have to make any spending investment? Is there something we should think about in terms of contingency that you're likely to need to invest either late this year or early next year as you start to consider that until you get a decision? Joseph Mario Molina - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: As we've previously said, we're not going to discuss the transaction. A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. But even if the transaction doesn't go through, do you have to do any spending that we should think about for the fourth quarter or anything? Joseph Mario Molina - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, this is Mario. We mentioned that we will see an uptick in costs related to the open enrollment period around marketing, advertising, broker commissions. A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. All right. And then, maybe just for my follow-up then. On the commentary around the exchanges, we appreciate that. I'm just trying to understand if your hope is to get to a target margin for next year, is that based on rate increases that you can foresee in your assumptions about where enrollment would be? Or is it contingent upon getting some changes in the risk adjusters? John C. Molina, JD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: This is John, A.J. No. We didn't price any changes to the risk-adjustment methodology into 2017. It's a combination of price increases and better medical management. A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. All right. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question. Christopher Benassi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Congrats on the quarter. This is Chris Benassi on for Matthew Borsch. Could you elaborate on where you're seeing pressure in the marketplace? And is this consistent with prior-year trends such as member churn and the SEPs? Or is this a more accelerated development? Thank you. John C. Molina, JD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: It really is along the lines of the four items that I've pointed out, which is attrition, higher cost for the SEP, people running out of their risk sharing and their out-of-pocket costs, and then increasing utilization as people become more familiar with our networks and seek care. It's not widespread. We are in the marketplace in a number of states and we have very good results in a number of those states. And for this quarter, we were hit with an adjustment to our risk adjustment liability of about $30 million that came from a catch-up, so to speak, as we get more information in from the outside actuaries. But I would say that we have a couple of markets that aren't doing well and we have a number of markets that are doing better. Christopher Benassi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. And just kind of one quick follow-up to that. Are you seeing less churn? Or have you seen any incremental improvement from the SEP measures that were implemented? Just trying to kind of dig a little deeper there. Thanks. John C. Molina, JD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: No. We're not seeing anything significant in terms of changes between 2015 and 2016 in the SEP. Christopher Benassi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. You may proceed with your question. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Good afternoon. Appreciate you taking the questions. So, in light of your comments about the marketplace, how do you view your expansion of territory, expansion of offerings and coverage in the marketplace for 2017 Joseph Mario Molina - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Hi. This is Mario. We are expanding in a number of counties but staying within our existing states. So we're expanding in Washington, we're expanding in Florida, and we're expanding in California. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : And do those states overlap with the limited areas where you're seeing some challenges that John just alluded to? Joseph Mario Molina - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: No, I wouldn't say that. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Okay. John C. Molina, JD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I wouldn't either, Dave. This is John. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then I guess, on Florida, you had listed in the press release a decent price or a decent rate increase there. MLR ticked up pretty significantly. I guess I was intuiting that that might have been marketplace-driven, but it sounds like from that answer that's not the case. So, maybe what is driving Florida cost performance up? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: It's Joe speaking, Dave. No, I think what's happening in Florida is tied to the marketplace, but I would associate it more with risk adjustment than I would factors that we were anticipating that played out that John listed. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Okay. Thank you for that. I'll drop out. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group. You may proceed with your question. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thanks. Just wanted to clarify a comment you made a minute ago, John, on the out-of-period risk adjustments of $30 million. Is that related to service dates in 2015 or is it all in-year? John C. Molina, JD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: It's all in-year, Chris, but out of quarter. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. Okay. And then I guess I'm just trying to \u2013 it's still not 100% clear to me whether you're saying that sort of the morbidity of your marketplace membership is trending worse than you thought, or it's simply a function of the risk-adjustment methodology that's \u2013 and that is the primary source of the problem right now. John C. Molina, JD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: That is correct. It is primarily the risk-adjustment methodology. About 20% of that relates to non-medical costs. So you exclude that, and the marketplace for us is great. It's pretty good now, but it gets great at that point. But it's not the morbidity is worse than we thought. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. And then last thing, I'm not sure what you're going to be able to say about this, but obviously the EPS range for the fourth quarter is $0.45 wide. Is there any color you can give us around that? John C. Molina, JD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: You're right, we can't say anything about that. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Figured. All right. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink. You may proceed with your question. Joseph Mario Molina - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Ana? Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi. Can you hear me? John C. Molina, JD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: We can hear you now. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Great. Joseph Mario Molina - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yes. We hear you. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Yes. I wanted to \u2013 is it better? Joseph Mario Molina - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yes. Go ahead, Ana. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah. All right. Okay. So, on the risk adjusters, the first question I had was you talk about this cost versus non-medical cost issue. Is this something that is specific to the managed Medicaid MCOs? And as a sub-lobby, if you will, have you all compared notes and are you seeing similar issues on the risk adjusters at all? Joseph Mario Molina - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: So this is Mario. This really we believe is the flaw in the methodology. It's not consistent with the stated intention of risk adjustment, as published in the Federal Register. I'm not sure what the other plans are seeing, but I think that this is a generalized phenomenon regardless of the plans. And we made our comments to CMS in a comment letter that was submitted October 6. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : And is this got anything to do with the level of quoting one plan is doing relative to the others? I've heard that anecdotally, in the marketplace, there are certain plans that have had to write large checks with big balance sheet coffered names like Empire and Anthem and all kind of think that it's a coding issue. Joseph Mario Molina - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: No. We think this is a flaw in the methodology. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Then, finally, the same question on the risk methodology, you had put out a press release, and this was right after CMS talked about the prescription drugs being included in the risk adjuster and a more, I guess, fair or something of that nature spread on the risk adjusters across various plans. So what prompted you to put that press release out? And were you viewing this as a positive thing? Or just any change is better than status quo, or something else? Joseph Mario Molina - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: This is Mario. No. We believe that was a positive change. Again, getting back to our comments today, the risk adjustment should be a reflection of the health status of the members. And we think that including pharmacy data is definitely a step in the right direction. Nevertheless, we think the underlying methodology is still flawed and needs to be corrected. This needs to really reflect health risk assessment and not total premium cost. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. I'll queue up again. I had other questions. Thanks. John C. Molina, JD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, Ana. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may proceed with your question. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. Just I'd ask a question, I guess, kind of about the Humana deal but I think it's to me you can't answer it because it's more about strategy. Because I guess when other Medicaid companies have said that they didn't really bid on the Humana assets because they wanted to maintain a target to the low-income population. And since you've had a lot of success on the exchanges because you stuck to that low-income threshold, how do you think about targeting Medicare Advantage in the higher income brackets? Is that something that you think is portable? Or is it really still the low-income side that you really want to be targeting? Joseph Mario Molina - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Hi. This is Mario. I think that if you look at Medicare and managed care, it is where Medicaid was a number of years ago. And we think the experience that we've had with Medicaid and with marketplace and with growing our brand and building out our networks will help us compete for Medicare Advantage patients and to grow our Medicare business. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. So it's not necessarily a low-income target. So, I guess, if for whatever reason Aetna-Humana falls apart, we should expect you to continue to be investing money in the Medicare business. That's a business that you want to grow kind of whether or not this deal happens. Joseph Mario Molina - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: That's correct. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. All right. Thanks. Operator : Our last question comes as a follow-up from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink. You may proceed with your question. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. So, on the Ohio and Texas again, what should we think about as the normalized loss ratio for 2017? And in Texas, I thought you had a sequential deterioration. Is that fair? I don't know whether I saw that correctly since the release came pretty recently. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Hey, Ana. It's Joe speaking. Yes, there was a deterioration in Texas sequentially, but remember we had that big out-of-period quality pickup revenue... Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: ...last quarter. So, that's a little bit \u2013 more than a little bit distorted. Again, as John said, we feel real good about Texas and Ohio. We feel real good about a lot of our health plans right now. But I think the Texas and Ohio numbers for the third quarter of this year are pretty representative. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Joe. Operator : Apologies. We do have another question from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. You may proceed with your question. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Thanks for taking the follow-up. So your release talks about the institution of an MLR floor in South Carolina. Your first \u2013 and I think effective date of July 1, your first half is below that level. The third quarter jumped significantly above that level. I wondered if the third quarter performance was simply kind of a true-up of that MLR floor? Or if there was deterioration in kind of underlying performance there and how might that floor affect you going forward? Thanks. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: It's Joe speaking. There's a little bit more disclosure about South Carolina in our 10-Q, but I'll save you the trouble of looking that up. South Carolina has had some pretty hefty rate increases over the last 12 months, but there have been benefit expansions that went to that. So we expected to see some tightening of margins in South Carolina that would probably take us above the MLR floor of 86% under normal circumstances. And that's okay. That health plan ran at a very low MCR for quite a while and it was running at MCRs that we don't expect to maintain long-term. But, in summary, it's more of a benefit premium issue than it is an MLR floor issue. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : here are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to Dr. Molina. Joseph Mario Molina - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us. We look forward to talking to you in 2017. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

Welcome to the Molina Healthcare Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2016 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, February 15, 2017. I will now turn the conference over to Juan Jos\u00e9 Orellana, SVP of Investors Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Juan Jos\u00e9 Orellana - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, George. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The purpose of this call is to discuss Molina Healthcare's financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. The company issued its earnings release reporting these results today after the market closed, and this release is now posted for viewing on our company website. On the call with me today are Dr. Mario Molina, our CEO; John Molina, our CFO; Terry Bayer, our COO; and Joseph White, our Chief Accounting Officer. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. If you've multiple questions, we ask that you get back in the queue, so that others can have an opportunity to ask their questions. As a reminder, we will be discussing the company's outlook for 2017 tomorrow during our Investor Day presentation. Today, we will only be taking questions on our earnings release related to 2016. Additionally, our comments today will contain forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. All of our forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to numerous risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. A description of such risk factors can be found in our earnings release, and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-K Annual Report, our Form 10-Q Quarterly Reports, and our Form 8-K Current Reports. These reports can be accessed under the Investor Relations tab of our company website or on the SEC's website. All forward-looking statements made during today's call represent our judgment as of February 15, 2017, and we disclaim any obligation to update such statements, except as required by securities laws. This call is being recorded and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available at our company's website, molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Mario Molina. Joseph Mario Molina, MD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, Juan Jos\u00e9. While the 2016 results we have announced today are clearly unacceptable, I want to remind everyone that outside of the Marketplace issues, 2016 was, in many respects, a successful year. It marked the third consecutive year in which our earnings (sic) [revenues] (02:38) grew by more than $3 billion. Strong enrollment growth generated 23% more premium revenue, when compared to 2015, despite a 4% decrease in premium revenue per member per month, driven primarily by cuts in Medicaid Expansion rates. We also lowered medical costs by approximately 3% on a per member per month basis. And we continue to reduce our administrative costs. Administrative costs decreased by 5% per member per month for the year. However, ongoing issues related to the Affordable Care Act's insurance Marketplace have continued and have had a significant adverse impact on our financial results during the fourth quarter. I want to emphasize that, while the losses that we incurred in the Marketplace program are likely to capture headlines and overshadow the operational progress we have made during 2016, it has not changed the positive trajectory in our core business. In order to stabilize the Marketplace program for 2017 and beyond, we believe that federal government must do four key things. First, the federal government must continue to provide cost-sharing reductions and premium subsidies. Second, there must be a strong incentive for individuals to purchase health insurance. Third, there must be more strict validation of eligibility for the Special Enrollment Period or SEP. We must not allow the Special Enrollment Period to become a substitute for open enrollment. Higher costs from people enrolling through the SEP force insurance companies to raise premiums for everyone. And finally, the flaws in the risk transfer methodology must be addressed now. Our Marketplace challenges are not new and have negatively affected many of the industry to a varying degrees. During our third quarter call, I spent a considerable amount of time outlining the deficiencies and the mechanics behind Marketplace risk transfer methodology. As a reminder, the program's key weakness is that it redistributes dollars among health plans based on total premiums and not purely health risk. The methodology penalizes low cost and low premium health insurers like Molina. This flaw has transformed Molina into one of the largest net payers into the risk transfer pools. To put this in perspective, 24% of our 2016 premiums were transferred to our competitors. During the fourth quarter alone, we accrued an additional $152 million in risk transfer payments. And for the 2016 benefit year, we have accrued approximately $520 million. As reflected in the Federal Register in late December, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services made changes to this methodology, and will reduce the statewide average premium in the risk transfer formula to 86% of the statewide average premium to account for the portion of administrative costs that do not vary with claims. This change is too little and maybe too late. Had the risk transfer methodology changes that CMS announced for 2018 been in effect for all of 2016, we estimate that our pre-tax income would have been approximately $70 million higher for all of 2016. We continue to advocate for changes to the risk transfer methodology. We are also seeking money owed to us for risk corridors. Molina has filed a lawsuit against the federal government in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims on behalf of its health plan subsidiaries participating in the Marketplace program. The lawsuit seeks the recovery of over $50 million in damages for 2015, and roughly $90 million owed for 2016 for the federal government's failure to honor its obligations related to Molina's participation in the healthcare marketplaces. Moving beyond issues of public policy to specific company related issues, I want to talk further about our Marketplace results in the fourth quarter. Many of you will recall that during our second and third quarter calls, we highlighted four factors that would reduce Marketplace profitability in the second half of the year. Those factors were : number one, normal membership attrition; two, the addition of higher cost members through the special enrollment process; three, higher cost, as members reach the limits of the cost-sharing provisions of their coverage; and four, increasing utilization, as members become more engaged with our care networks. John will go into more detail in a minute, but I want to point out that the financial impact of the last three of these items was more pervasive in the fourth quarter than we had expected. Those developments not only reduced fourth quarter performance, but also led us take a closer look at our 2017 pricing. As a result, we recorded a $30 million premium deficiency reserve in the fourth quarter. I noted earlier that our management team has identified the Marketplace challenges and remains focused on taking action to address them quickly and efficiently. We have therefore increased our Marketplace premium rates between 6% and 37% across all of our markets, resulting in an average of about 15%. And we'll continue to advocate for policies that stabilize the marketplace. With that said, and recognizing that we are one of the nation's largest marketplace providers, we believe there are simply too many unknowns with the Marketplace program to commit to our participation beyond 2017. We will wait and see how the new administration and Congress will adjust the program, and we plan to evaluate our participation on a state-by-state basis. On another front, we are disappointed by the court ruling last month, which blocked the merger Aetna and Humana. And while Aetna and Humana have terminated their transaction and consequently their divestiture transaction of Medicare assets to Molina, we remain committed to growing our Medicare Advantage program. We intend to build on the experience we have developed in delivering quality healthcare to nearly 100,000 Medicare beneficiaries in 11 states. And we wish Aetna and Humana the best of luck. Our company has always been committed to seeing that each of our plans is measured for quality by the National Committee for Quality Assurance. Why does quality matter and why is quality important? There are two important financial reasons. First, a growing number of states are tying reimbursement and patient assignment to quality scores. And second, Medicare links quality scores to our premium rates. We're proud that all of our eligible health plans, 11 in total, have been accredited by the National Committee for Quality Assurance. Furthermore, nine of our health plans have been accredited for Marketplace. Finally, our plans in New Mexico, Utah and Washington were top rated Medicaid health plans in their states. We're proud of our continued success as we work to deliver the highest quality care to the population we've served for the last 36 years. All of our eligible health plans maintained or increased their star ratings for Medicare. Furthermore, our Michigan health plan was the highest rated plan among Medicare Special Needs Plans for dual-eligible beneficiaries; and our New Mexico health plan earned four stars. Despite the difficulties we encountered in 2016, we are looking forward to improvement in 2017. As has been our practice, we will reserve our comments on our outlook for 2017 for Investor Day tomorrow. I would now like to turn the call over to John. John C. Molina, JD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, Mario. Before I get into the fourth quarter and year-end results, I wanted to correct what I believe is a misstatement you made, Mario. You said that this was the third consecutive year in which our earnings grew by $3 billion, and in fact, it was our revenues grew by $3 billion, not our earnings. Thank you. Today, we reported full year net income per diluted share of $0.14 and a net loss of $1.64 per diluted share for the fourth quarter. On an adjusted basis, full year net income was $0.50 per diluted share, and a net loss of $1.54 per diluted share during the fourth quarter. As Mario noted earlier, poor results in the Marketplace program was the primary challenge impacting our 2016 results. However, the results of our business is faring better. To be clear, fourth quarter results for our Medicaid and Medicare business were adversely impacted by about $60 million of out-of-period items primarily related to revenue. But even allowing for that, we have good reason to be satisfied with our Medicaid and Medicare performance in 2016. Entering this year, our Medicaid and Medicare programs were under considerable stress as a result of declining Medicaid expansion margins, and disappointing results at our Ohio, Texas and Puerto Rico health plans. For the full year 2016, however, the combined medical care ratio of our TANF, ABD, Medicare, and MMP membership decreased to 91.3% from 92% in 2015. In the past, when we've encountered problems, they were primarily related to medical costs. Our issues in the fourth quarter as we have outlined in the earnings release are predominantly revenue related. In the Marketplace, we continue to suffer from reductions to revenue as a result of a risk transfer payments that far exceed the favorable results we are seeing in the reduced medical expenses. In our Medicaid business, we continued to experience retroactive reductions to revenue that in some cases extend back a year or more. Unlike many of our competitors that have reported poor Marketplace results due to adverse risk selection, which raised their medical costs, our performance issues are linked to a risk transfer methodology that has depressed our at-risk revenue. Let's take a closer look at what happened in 2016 by starting with Marketplace. We think it is worthwhile to compare 2016 results to what we would have expected based on our 2016 pricing. It is important to remember that we developed our 2016 pricing with essentially no visibility into historic risk transfer payments. Based on our 2016 enrollment, our Marketplace program was priced to produce income before taxes of approximately $60 million for the year. Instead, we lost $110 million. The $170 million difference between our reported results and our expectations is due to the following four factors. Number one, risk transfer payments were approximately $325 million higher than anticipated in our pricing. Number two, despite this $325 million reduction in revenue for risk transfer payments, medical costs were only $120 million lower than anticipated by our pricing model. In other words, we lost nearly $3 of revenue per every $1 of medical cost reduction. Three, other items increased pre-tax income by approximately $65 million. And four, we reported a $30 million premium deficiency reserve for the Marketplace in 2017. Let me take you through these items in order. First, we must address the risk transfer payments. As Mario mentioned during the third quarter conference call, the Marketplace risk transfer methodology penalizes efficient and affordable health plans like Molina, harms our performance, and makes it harder for patients to purchase affordable Marketplace policies. And once again, risk transfer contributed to our Marketplace difficulties in the fourth quarter. Marketplace revenue decreased 16% in the fourth quarter of 2016, yet our risk transfer remained constant from the previous quarter. This had a negative impact of $24 million on the fourth quarter. Second, risk transfer payments do not offset higher medical costs on a one-for-one basis. While we recorded $325 million of additional risk transfer, we were only able to offset that with $120 million of lower medical costs. Last, regarding our premium deficiency reserve, accounting rules require the immediate recognition of a loss associated with the group of members as soon as that loss becomes certain. Our premium deficiency reserve is an estimate of the losses we expect to incur in 2017 for those members who had enrolled as of December 31, 2016. The premium deficiency reserve does not include estimated losses from members, including Special Enrollment Period members who will active in 2017, but who are not enrolled as of December 31, 2016. So the premium deficiency reserve does not capture all Marketplace losses we are likely to occur in 2017, but only those that are truly locked in for 2017 as of December 31, 2016. We will explain this further when we discuss our 2017 outlook at our Investor Day tomorrow. We evaluate our Marketplace programs for premium deficiency on a state-by-state basis. Now, let's talk about the fourth quarter. We have previously shared with you that we expected additional challenges in the Marketplace for the fourth quarter of 2016. We expected lower financial results in the fourth quarter as a result of four trends : normal membership attrition, the addition of higher cost members in the special enrollment process, higher cost as members reached the limits of the cost sharing provisions of the coverage; and increasing utilization as members become more engaged with our care networks. Throughout the fourth quarter, all of these trends except the first, that is normal member attrition, were more pronounced than we had expected. First, the number of members enrolled in the special enrollment process increased by an unexpectedly large amount in the fourth quarter. Because these members bring with them pent-up demand and lower risks scores, they're a drag on profitability compared to those joining us to the normal annual enrollment period. It has been well documented that SEP members come in with higher costs. Specifically, we estimate that the average medical care ratio for those SEP members that enrolled during the fourth quarter of 2016 was 185%. Increased utilization driven by special enrollment membership was compounded by higher pharmacy cost at the number of prescriptions filled by our members, especially early refills, increased during the month of December. Per-member per-month pharmacy cost increased by approximately 10% over the November run rate. Whether these developments were a result of patients being worried about losing their coverage after the November elections, we don't know. But there is no doubt that these developments put pressure on our fourth quarter results. The increasing costs borne by Molina, as members reached the limits of cost-sharing provisions of their coverage, was also a factor in our poor fourth quarter performance. The share of total member pharmacy costs borne by the company, for example, increased from 82% in January of 2016 to 88% by December. Marketplace medical cost trend was 4% for the year, but the per-member per-month costs spiked in December. Of course, the risk corridor program of the Affordable Care Act was designed to partially mitigate the damages of situations like ours. As all of you know, the federal government has not met its obligations under the risk corridor program, and we have not recognized any benefit from this program in the results we are sharing today. Nevertheless, we are pursuing collection of the amounts due us as part of that program. To support our belief that we're entitled to the risk corridor payments, consider that Judge Thomas Wheeler recently ruled that the federal government is liable to Moda Health for all unpaid risk corridor payments. This gives Molina reason for optimism as the facts in our lawsuit are similar to those in the Moda Health case. The $140 million owed to Molina for risk corridor payments, if realized, would give a truer picture of the financial results of the Marketplace program. Leaving the Marketplace and looking at our business as a whole, our total premium revenue for the year was up 23% from 2015 with year-over-year increases in all programs. It's important to note that nearly 75% of all new premium revenue came from programs other than the Marketplace. I want to emphasize that margins in our TANF, ABD and Medicare programs improved in 2016 over 2015. To put it another way, our traditional business lines of Medicaid and Medicare are improving, despite the deterioration we experienced in Marketplace. Our management of administrative expenses also improved in 2016. Our general and administrative expense ratio decreased to 7.9% for the full year 2016 compared to 8.1% in 2015. Finally, at December 31, 2016, days and claims payable was flat sequentially at 47 days. And the company had cash and investments of nearly $4.6 billion, including an excess of $260 million at the parent company. As disclosed Tuesday, the termination of our purchase agreements with Aetna and Humana will result in a $75 million breakup fee, which we will recognize in the first quarter of 2017. As a reminder, we will be hosting our Investor Day conference in New York City tomorrow, Thursday, February 16, at 12 :30 PM Eastern Time. At that presentation, we will be discussing the company's outlook and strategy for 2017. We look forward to seeing you there. If you're not able to attend in person, we encourage you to join the webcast. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions on the quarter and the year, but we'll save questions on our outlook for tomorrow's call. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead with your question. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Hello, everybody. I'm sure there'll be plenty of discussion about the Marketplace, but I thought I might ask you about some of the other states that you're flagging here. It sounds like more on the Medicaid side, I think you're flagging Ohio which it look like was an issue early in the year, but it sounds like that was turning around, and now, it sounds like the MLR increased 310 basis points. Can you tell us what's going on with that? Any update on \u2013 maybe a little more flavor on Puerto Rico? And then, Texas is one you've talked about but it didn't \u2013 wasn't flagged today. Any update on what you're seeing there? John C. Molina, JD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure, A.J. So, on the Medicaid side, we did talk about Ohio early in the year. The first quarter was a bit rocky for us. And then, we were able to bring the medical cost down in Q2 and Q3. I think that in Q4, it's just normal seasonality as opposed to anything else. In Puerto Rico, we did again flag that early in the year, and have had some very good results in improving the profitability of the Puerto Rico plan. Texas, again, we cited early, but the Texas issues again are largely behind us. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. I guess with the exchange business, if you could go into the little detail about the other items. I guess, there was a $35 million favorable number. What was that related to? And then, I think you said that you would look at exchange in a state-by-state basis. Are there any state exchange products that were profitable in 2016? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Hi. It's Joe speaking. To your first question, that $35 million variance from pricing is a combination of things. It's lower admin costs than we anticipated plus a little bit more revenue around some other aspects of the program, in total, it added up to about $35 million. Regarding the individual state performance, we don't normally give that, but I can speak to Texas particularly as being a state where we're doing relatively well on the Marketplace program. We feel really good about Texas. Florida is hanging in there. California hanging in there. So there's three states. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Actually, just to clarify that, SG&A will be a little bit lower. The number \u2013 is that like a bonus accrual? Like earlier we had like Anthem report worse numbers. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Oh, no. It's just about the usual things, commissions, just allocation of admin costs, things like that. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. All right. Great. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dave Styblo with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question. David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC : Sure. Thanks for taking (26:27) the questions. Maybe just to circle back to the exchange and then understand better the pressure, it looks like there's about $1.20 of pressure in full year 2016. Is that sort of the right way to think about it? At the end of the day, you were not able to participate and ultimately had to exit. Is that earnings release that we would think about on 2016 or are there some other puts and takes? And also, I'd like to ask about perhaps any negative SG&A leverage that might be associated with that. John C. Molina, JD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure, Dave. I want to be careful, because when you ask what would happen if we got out, we're beginning to get into forward-looking guidance type of things. But the way that you described \u2013 the way I would say, the puts and takes for Marketplace, it really relates to the risk transfer. If you look at that, we ended up transferring $350 million in excess of what we priced it at. Now, if the risk transfer methodology were structured in a more accurate way, you would expect almost a one for one decrease in medical expenses, idea being you would have helped your members, so their costs would be lower. But in fact, our costs were only $120 million lower than pricing. So that differential really speaks to where the miss comes in the Marketplace. David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then, on a CMS release today, they talked about some of the exchange rules, and I didn't get a chance to fully look through that being on the road today. Was there anything in there that really meaningfully will help you on that? I don't think I saw on the quick headlines there was anything on the risk adjusters there, but curious to hear your takes and thoughts about rules around Special Enrollment Period, and what they did right, and got right that should help you versus what else you need besides what you've discussed earlier about the risk transfers? Joseph Mario Molina, MD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Hi. This is Mario. We're going to discuss that tomorrow during our outlook discussion. But I do think it is a positive step, but it's not going to solve the really big issue that we have which is risk transfer. It addresses a number of other things and we'll go over those tomorrow. David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead with your question. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. I realize that HIQ (29:17) is fluid, so I'd rather focus on the core. You've been talking about high acuity numbers, ABD and MMP contracts continuing to mature towards a run rate in 2016. And if I look at the timing of contract wins that make sense, I can see an absolute improvement on year-over-year MLR, but I'm wondering about the pace. So is MLR on the new high acuity membership, I guess, those gained over the last, call it, two years or so, both ABD and MMP improving at the pace that you would have expected? How long do you think is the path to normal margins on that book? And do you still think that ABD and MMP is 1.5% to 2% net margin business? John C. Molina, JD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: That's a great question, Sarah. I would say that we are progressing along the plane that we wanted to for the higher acuity members. We did have a bit of a hiccup, for example, in Washington, when we rolled out the integrated program down in Southwest Washington. I think the state and the state's actuaries realized that they mispriced that business somewhat, and we've been working with them to correct that. But the medical management efforts that Dr. Wilson and his team have put in place have really stabilized utilization, brought it down, and we do think that we're making good progress. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got it. And then just a clarification. You mentioned in the press release some rate pressure being reversed in January 2017. I'm just wondering if that was specific to the fourth quarter, because it's a bit unusual to talk about rate pressure so late in the year for the rate resets. So if you could clarify that a little bit more. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sarah, it's Joe speaking. What we were just tried to point out there is that, in those three states, where we have seen some margin pressure \u2013 Ohio, Illinois and Washington \u2013 we did receive some pretty decent rate increases effective January 1, 2017, which we'll go into more detail tomorrow. But I would just say that in today's state funding environment, you generally don't get 4% to 5% rate increases without there being some pressure on margins. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink. Please go ahead with your question. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah. Okay. Thanks. The first question is around Medicaid expansion. It does look like you had a pretty big sequential MLR increase just on our early read of this as opposed to TANF and CHIP. I'm just trying to understand what's going on there. And you talked about December being the pressure point, was that flu and more cost-related or something else? And does that a big contributor in the deterioration in loss ratio in some of the states that you had, Ohio, California, Illinois, Q-over-Q? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, Ana, it's Joe speaking. Two points I'd make about Medicaid expansion. First, as we spoke about in the first quarter, just we started this year with rates on Medicaid expansion coming down, which lowered margins. We also \u2013 if you recall, we had a Medicaid expansion rate cut in California mid-year. The additional item that's happened regarding expansion in the fourth quarter is our determination that we were going to have to take a charge of about $40 million, $45 million out-of-period related to an item in New Mexico involving contractual interpretations on our Medicaid expansion contract. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : So, that was the only reason is New Mexico, wasn't anything you saw in some of the other states I just talked about that had the issue? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: No. Again, as far as Medicaid expansion, the big dip really took place January 1 of 2016 when new rates rolled in. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. So, you still maintain that the worst of the rate pressure is behind us and you're not going to see pressure going forward on expansion? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. I think we're certainly seeing \u2013 we'll talk more about this tomorrow. We've actually seen a little bit of relief in Washington. I think our point would be our \u2013 as you would probably be that over time, as the Fed stops funding expansion so much that those margins are probably going to approach the TANF and ABD margins, which is why we're so pleased with the progress we have made this year in TANF and ABD. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Then, on the exchanges, if I could get a little bit more clarity around, you talk about the risk (34:20) which I'm assuming is risk adjusters and those seem to have come in a lot worse than expected. And then, you talk about risk corridors not delivering and you saw some cost pressures, but you didn't see the relief from risk corridors. Can you talk about what percentage of the miss with risk adjusters relative to risk corridors? And I understand Moda might have won the case and all, but that's a lot more dicey, right, than risk adjusters? Joseph Mario Molina, MD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: So, this is Mario. First of all, on the risk corridor issue, we do believe that we are owed the money, and our case is very similar to the one that was filed by Moda, so we do believe that we'll prevail in that. The biggest single problem we have, and we started saying this earlier in the year, is the risk corridor methodology. The fact that we are a plan that has relatively low premiums, relative to the state-wide average, really hurts us. And to give you an example, in California where we operate only in Southern California, the costs in Northern California are about 30% higher, so it drags up the statewide average and further magnifies the problems that we have. The basic problem that we have today and going forward is around risk transfer. I think the secondary problem is the Special Enrollment Period, and perhaps the new regulations will address that. But we need to continue to press for some relief on the risk transfer issue. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : The risk transfer corridors or adjusters or both? I'm still not clear. Joseph Mario Molina, MD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: There are three Rs. So there's reinsurance, risk corridors and risk transfer. Right now, the first two have gone away, and the risk transfer remains. So, it's going to be a problem going forward, unless something is done, and that's what our advocacy efforts are focused on. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : And if you don't get... Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Ana, I'm sorry. It's Joe. Just to be clear, I think from the terminology you're using, you would relate risk transfer to risk adjustment. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Okay. And if you don't get what you have, what you need with advocacy, might you consider exiting for 2018? Joseph Mario Molina, MD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yes. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Thank you. I appreciate the color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good afternoon. I just wanted to get a little more color on page 2, and maybe I missed this, and I think Joe White has alluded to one of the items. But items two and three, so when you talk about items \u2013 $25 million related to 2014 and 2015, is that prior to your development or is that specific contractual issues? And it sounds like maybe number three was the New Mexico thing you'd just mentioned, but I wanted to clarify. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: That's correct. Both of those items relate to unique issues specific to states, one being the New Mexico item I talked about, the second one being in the state of Illinois, where the state cut back on Medicaid rates and risk adjusted been back to the beginning of 2016. So it's not prior period development issue we think of it in terms of the claims liability. It's specific contractual revenue issues. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. And the $1.21 per share loss related to Marketplace, that I presume I'm sure that includes the full risk adjustment payment you're talking about. But the PDR impact is also included in that $1.21? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Bear with us for a second. I'm trying to find the $1.21 you're talking about. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I thought you said... Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: (38:33) at the very beginning. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yes. Yes. That is correct. That $1.21 does include the impact of the $30 million PDR. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel. Please go ahead with your question. Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey there. So good evening, I guess, for us, and good afternoon to you guys. But your stock is going to be on sale here tomorrow and probably for a little while. Has the management team discussed doing anything like maybe pulling in the share repurchase sometime during the first quarter or discuss the policy like that especially with the breakup fee coming from the Humana deal? Joseph Mario Molina, MD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Hi, Tom. This is Mario. We do have an authorization for share repurchase from the board, but we're not planning to do a share repurchase at this time. Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So, you don't think that would be something that would maybe support the stock or show some confidence in your planning and everything that you're doing going forward? There's just hasn't been any talk of that at all? Joseph Mario Molina, MD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: No. Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to the presenters. Joseph Mario Molina, MD - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: All right. Well, thank you very much for joining us today. And just a reminder that tomorrow we'll be discussing the outlook for 2017; that will be at the Parker M\u00e9ridien at 12 :30 PM. And, please, join us in person. If you can't, it will be webcast. We look forward to talk with you tomorrow. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

I would now like to turn the call over to the Chairman of our Board of Directors, Dale Wolf. Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, Juan Jos\u00e9. Good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, I'll start by providing some context around the board's decision to make the leadership changes that we announced earlier today, and then I'll turn the call over to Joe White to discuss our results for the quarter. In light of the company's disappointing financial performance and after careful consideration and analysis, the board determined that a change in leadership was necessary in order to drive profitability through operational improvements and other initiatives. The board believes that now is the right time to bring in new leadership to capitalize on Molina's incredibly strong franchise and the opportunities we see for sustained growth going forward. To be clear, these changes represent targeted and deliberate actions to enhance the company's focus and improve our competitive position within the industry. We're pleased to have someone with Joe's experience, institutional and industry knowledge capable of serving as our Interim President and CEO at this time. Joe has over 25 years of financial management experience in the healthcare industry, and served as Molina's Chief Accounting Officer since 2003. He has led the company's most recent operational improvement initiatives and is a widely respected leader both within the company and in the greater healthcare industry. Separately, I'm honored to have the opportunity to serve as Molina's Chairman and lend my experience to help guide the company forward. The board remains sharply focused on ensuring an orderly leadership transition and is commencing a search process for Molina's permanent CEO. In the meantime, we're grateful to have Joe at the helm. I would be remiss if I did not say the board appreciates Dr. Mario and John Molina's leadership and contributions for more than two decades, and looks forward to their continuing insights as directors. I want to assure you Molina's business remains strong. The company has an outstanding brand and franchise built over three decades, based on a focused commitment to mission. The board is committed to continuing this mission, achieving operational excellence and improving the company's financial performance on behalf of our shareholders, our more than 20,000 employees and our over 4 million members. We believe we can capitalize on Molina's strengths to build significant shareholder value. Now, let me turn the call over to Joe to review the quarter. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, Dale, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Today, we reported net income per diluted share of $1.37 and adjusted net income per diluted share of $1.47 for the first quarter of 2017. This compares to net income per diluted share of $0.43 and adjusted net income per diluted share of $0.51 for the same period last year. First quarter results includes a $75 million pre-tax benefit from the receipt of our Aetna-Humana break-up fee. This break-up fee added $0.84 per share to both net income per diluted share and adjusted net income per diluted share for the quarter. Today's results which are consistent with our expectations represent a notable step forward for the company. Now, I want to speak to some of the line item details in the financial statement. Premium revenue increased over 15% in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016, while membership increased nearly 13% during the same period. We added more than 500,000 new members in the first quarter, most of whom are rolled into Marketplace. While we are still early in the year, we think that, as of today, both the operational and the financial performance of our Marketplace product is better than what we saw in 2016. Of course, just has been the case in previous years, we can expect our Marketplace enrollment to decline during the remainder of the year. Our medical care ratio in the first quarter of this year was 88.4% compared to 89.8% in the first quarter of 2016. This 140 basis point decline in the medical care ratio was a result of higher percentage margins in our Marketplace and Medicare products. Our consolidated medical margin measured in total dollars increased by more than 30% to $537 million this quarter when compared to the same period last year. Our general and administrative expense ratio increased to 8.9% for the quarter, a 110 basis point increase from the prior year. But as we outlined during our Investor Day presentation back in February, these results are in line with our expectations for the full year. As a reminder, we do not provide quarterly guidance. As we've said on past calls, we adjust guidance only when we believe that there is a material change to the business from what we have previously communicated. As we announced in today's press release, we have confirmed our previously issued guidance for full-year earnings per diluted share and adjusted earnings per diluted share, while also updating that guidance to reflect the break-up fee associated with the Aetna and Humana acquisitions as these were not included in our original outlook. It is important for me to reiterate that this change only adds the termination fee into our existing outlook and that we have not made any additional adjustments beyond that. Also, please note that our outlook does not include an estimate for severance charges associated with today's announcement. Looking beyond 2017, we continue to consider our options for marketplace participation in 2018. I think everyone is well aware of the variables in play here, funding of the cost sharing rebates for both 2017 and 2018, continuation and enforcement of the individual mandate and risks of adverse selection all create uncertainty around the future of the marketplace. We are currently evaluating all our options for marketplace participation in 2018. We expect to decide upon 2018 pricing, geographies and product offerings in the coming weeks. Finally, as of March 31, 2017, days and claims payable decreased sequentially by two days to 45 days and the company had unrestricted cash and investments of nearly $5.3 billion, including approximately $270 million at the parent company. While medical claims and benefits payable were flat between the fourth quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017, amounts due government agencies increased by almost $375 million or slightly over 30%. This concludes our prepared remarks. Colin, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you very much. Our first question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Ziv Israel - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, this is Ziv Israel on behalf of Kevin Fischbeck. Can you comment on the timing of the management change, just seems a little unusual to provide guidance in February, then have the Analyst Day, and then change management or reaffirming the outlook three months later. Was there any concern about the ability to achieve this year's guidance or a general concern about the ability to grow from 2018 and beyond? Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Hi, this is Dale Wolf. I think you're reading too much into any of those. They're unconnected. As Joe mentioned, we have affirmed guidance for the year. So it has nothing to do with that. It was merely a continuation of a process, of the board's evaluation of the road forward, and our sense that we were not keeping up with our competitors in terms of creating value for our shareholders. And that process obviously takes some time to work through and commentated in today's announcement. No more, no less. Ziv Israel - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. So when you think about what Molina has to do from here, where are the biggest areas of change that need to happen under the new management? What do you think they should focus on or execute on? Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I think it's premature to list out specifically. There's a lot of work to do both by new management and \u2013 with the oversight of the board in terms of what those areas of opportunity are, we have some thoughts based on experience, but they're merely that. And we will \u2013 this will fact-based and we will work with management of the company to identify those opportunities and communicate them when we can. Ziv Israel - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Josh Raskin with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good evening. So I understand, Dale, your comments around not keeping up with shareholder value and I think you can document that. I'm just curious in light of what appears to be a relatively quick decision, or at least one that was not inclusive of management in terms of that process, what sort of diligence did the board do around the impact on the business? I'm thinking about did you talk to some of the major states or stakeholders in the company? Did you guys look at RFPs that are coming up including rebids? Have you thought about a rebranding that maybe necessary? What's the total cost? Is there a potential impact to goodwill? All that sort of stuff, I'm just curious, I understand the perceived benefits, but I'm just curious on how you guys weighed that against the costs? Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: You asked a lot of questions in there, Josh. So I like to think that we considered all those factors and we do understand that there are a lot of RFPs coming up. I think those are pretty local market things, but we understand most of the other points you raised and it was just our sense that all things considered maybe not tomorrow or the next day, but this was the necessary and right thing to do for all of the constituencies of the company and not only the shareholders, but all the constituencies of the company. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: And Josh, it's Joe. I would just add we are feeling very confident about re-procurement of the various RFPs that are out there. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And can you share maybe some of the feedback from those various state constituents, were they comfortable with this change coming? Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: As you might imagine, Josh, there was no way that it was appropriate for us to go and ask them what they thought about this and so we don't have any feedback, we didn't do that. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then, I guess, just more internally, are there concerns over employee retention, just in light of the founder and family sort of having run the business for almost 40 years, I'm just curious if you've gotten any feedback since this afternoon. Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I think it's a little early to tell on that. Changes like this take a while to fit in with the company. I met with the leadership team of the company today to just assure them of the board's commitment to the future of this company and commitment to the mission, notwithstanding the need for operational and financial improvement. And one of the things we talked about is the communication that would be needed going forward with employees to say those kinds of things to them and make them feel comfortable and a lot of those people joined this company because of its mission or certainly stayed because of its mission. And it would be crazy to do anything different than that and we don't intend to, we just need to communicate that to people in a time like this. You can't over communicate. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. All right, thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Hello everybody. Maybe just first to ask, because I don't think it's been directly asked at least, so you're going through this process and you're now going to go out and look for a permanent CEO. Are broader strategic options on the table or is it strictly right now we just need to get a new CEO in here? Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: The latter. We've got a lot of confidence in the franchise that's here and the potential of unlocking shareholder value and that's what we're set about to do including hiring a new CEO. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And maybe Joe, if I could just ask quickly on two quarterly items, it looks like you reduced the PDR by $22 million from $30 million at the end of the year for the health insurance exchange and you said it performed consistent with expectations. Can you give us a little color on that? It also looks like you realized unfavorable prior period development in Illinois Medicare and Medicaid to the tune of $20 million or $0.22, can you give us some color on that as well? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure, sure, A.J. You have your numbers reversed on the Marketplace PDR. We brought in $8 million of the $30 million PDR we booked at 12/31. So we have $22 million left. So there is an $8 million PDR reversal in the quarter. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: In general, marketplace, as I said in my remarks, seems to be going better than it has in the past both operationally and financially. Unlike first quarter of 2016, first quarter of 2017 we didn't have a lot of unfavorable development of our estimates around risk adjustment, which was very welcome news. We feel like we're getting better setting those accruals. So in general, again, we're one quarter into the year, so I don't want to say too much. But so far, so good as far as marketplace for 2017. The Illinois situation, well, it's just one of those situations occasionally where in a given health plan, you have substantial unfavorable prior period development of claims. These are very complicated claims, often hospital claims that have extended back into 2016 and sometimes 2015. We feel like we gotten that cleaned up and feel like we're in pretty good shape going forward in Illinois, but it is about $20 million of unfavorable out-of-period development in Illinois this quarter for Medicaid, not Medicare. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Good evening. First question, just wanted to get a sense of \u2013 in terms of the longer term margin targets that John and Mario had discussed and committed to in terms of both the 4Q sort of exit trend on long-term margins and then what the company was aspiring to. Are you comfortable in sort of reaffirming those at this point or would that be sort of under review as Joe and then a newer CEO came in and sort of develop the strategic plan? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Excuse me. Well, Scott, to be clear, it's Joe speaking, to be clear, we walked those numbers back a little bit at Investor Day. We don't necessarily think we said in Investor Day in February of this year, we don't think we can exit that in that range, that margin range for 2017. So that's already been on the table. There's no reason, based on our confirming guidance today, we haven't gotten worse, but again, we need to go back and revisit those numbers. And as we said at Investor Day in February, we'll be back to you when we're more confident with something. Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Joe, I had just a quarterly question just on \u2013 in California, it looks like the MLR large there year-over-year was pretty low, it came at 79.2%. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Right. Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Was that just a function of the mix of the exchange numbers or was there anything sort of unique going on in the first quarter there? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: No, it was just a marketplace issue. I mentioned that in total we only came down $8 million in our PDR for marketplace in the quarter, but we rearranged between states, and California actually took about a $25 million PDR benefit in this quarter. If you take marketplace out of California results, it ran in the mid-80s this quarter, which is a good quarter, but nothing extraordinary. Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And then just one last question. Just on the sort of classic TANF and CHIP business, it looks like the MLR there was up around 260 bps year-over-year and it was sort of over 93%. So I know you cited some of the dynamics around Illinois. Just more holistically, though, just want to get a sense for the trends in that product line. And then was that segment profitable in the first quarter at that MLR? And if not, do you expect that to sort of be profitable for the full-year? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, to be clear, we've talked about over the last few years that premium increases for the TANF and CHIP business have been lagging what they need to be, have been lagging medical cost trend, and frankly, have been lagging other products. You're right that that $20 million unfavorable development in Illinois, that's predominantly TANF that has a huge impact on it. I would just say though, at a 93% MLR, I would say that TANF is borderline profitable. Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, all right. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah. Hi, thanks. Good evening. Well, again back to the management transition, I guess the question I had was, when the board was contemplating these changes and you were looking at the root cause of your financial performance in the last whatever time period, did you see it more around you don't have the necessary scale and the diversification to maybe take a blip in a state like Ohio or enter a very challenging new market, like exchanges, or was it more about we're not executing correctly and the organization needs to be turned around or is it a bit of both and how might that play into how things move forward? Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Ana, I haven't seen anything to suggest, and I think that I speak for the board, that we aren't big enough or not diverse enough to perform better than we have. And so until proven otherwise, I'm in the camp of it's just all about execution. Execution and paying attention to the day to day details of medical cost management, administrative expense control, and on, and on, and on. It's a great franchise. It's got great assets, and we just need to improve the results. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. I guess I'll just give like one example has been \u2013 I would say Aetna I think had some issues in the fourth quarter on exchanges and United sustained some unbelievable losses. But when you're making mid to high-single digit pre-tax margins on the rest of your book, and you have 10%, and exchange is losing 10%, it's still okay and you make your numbers, but in Molina you have 1% net margin on 90% of your business and then if you lose 10% on 10% that can be really move the needle, I mean that's where my questions is coming from. Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Exactly. So my response to that is not to get rid of the 10%, you lost 10% on it to make the 1% net margin better, and that's where we're headed. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Dale. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. It seems like the biggest opportunity for margin improvement is on the exchange risk adjuster, specifically the encounter data capture. What is Molina doing to improve capturing risk adjuster data on the new exchange members and is there any improvement over last year on the percent of members that you have data on so far? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sarah, it's Joe speaking. I think the answer to your second question is yes, we do have more information on our members. There are a couple of things at play here. First of all, we retained, I think, 80% or so of our December 2016 membership coming into 2017. We obviously have huge lag up in understating the healthcare conditions of those members. We've also taken a number of initiatives to improve data capture on risk adjustment and member targeting and member risk assessment. I think to some degree our ability to better estimate our risk scores at the end of last year might be a reflection of having better data on our members. And I think carrying over into this year, we've seen improvement. It's not a tidal wave, it's not a landslide, it's a lot of hard work, crawling through data, looking for clues and learning how to engage members. But I think we're doing well at it. And I think come 2018, where we have the change in methodology and we're allowed to bring on pharmacy data in support of risk scores, we're going to get even better. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thanks, Joe. And maybe if I take the comments that you made about spending more time crawling through the data and comments Dale made about an increased focus on medical management, how does that fit within context of your already planned IT investments for this year and where it might need to go under this new focus? Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: My opinion, Sarah, is that really a lot of our initiatives related to medical management, yes, there are technology initiatives, we're finding and implementing ways to reduce the number of screens, for example utilization management and medical management personnel have to click through as they address the members' needs, a lot of it is training too, and a lot of it is leveraging best practices from one health plan to the next and making sure that the knowledge is disseminated throughout the company. So it's not purely an IT solution. I don't think we're going to need massive increases by any stretch of the imagination in our CapEx or anything like that. I think what we're going to do is try to focus harder on learnings from one part of the company and bring them to bear in other parts of the company. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. What percent of your business is up for rebid this year? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I don't have that (26:57), honestly, I got that number here, states that are up for rebid, probably about $700 million or $800 million of revenue, so $700 million or $800 million of revenue on our $18 billion \u2013 I'm sorry, 3.5%, sorry, doing this in my head, $3.5 billion to $4 billion of revenue on an $18 billion or $19 billion base. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And that includes the Texas STAR+PLUS Program and the Florida Medicaid LTE program? Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Peter, I'm sorry for my voice. It's really concentrated in Florida, Illinois, New Mexico, Puerto Rico is coming up in 2018. So that's a little bit beyond a year. But that's \u2013 it's really Florida, Illinois, New Mexico, Puerto Rico and Texas. Juan Jos\u00e9 Orellana - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah, Peter, this is Juan Jos\u00e9. There's a slide in the Investor Day deck. You can take a look at all the markets and the estimated timeframes for when those businesses are going to be reprocured. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Right. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yes, but doesn't have the revenues associated with it (28:10). Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. Juan Jos\u00e9 Orellana - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Right. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And moving on, there's a question regarding the process that you're going to go through for looking for a new CEO, so we kind of track that. What is your timeframe you expect that process to go through and when should we have a result from that? And then Dale, are you a candidate for that because you've run health plans before? Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Let me take the easy one first. No, I'm not. I actually have a full-time job today. I have a company in Florida, a private equity company that I run and that's where I live and that's what I'm going to keep doing. So no is the answer to the second question one. The first process is just getting started. We will be interviewing search firms over the next several weeks. We hope to have a search firm under contract within 30 days and then the process will be the process. I think that those who've been through this before would tell you that it might takes six months, that would be very disappointing to me. I hope to have it wrapped up well before that. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then maybe this is a question more for Joe. Joe, you tapped 27% of your PDR in the first quarter here, given that the claims tend to grow in the ACA business through the year, don't you think your \u2013 that would imply you've got more risk going into the back part of the year for your guidance to be maintained? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I don't really look at it that way. As the year rolls out, obviously, we've got nine months, we've got nine months of PDR to focus on versus 12 months that we had at the beginning of January and we've gotten better insight into developments this quarter with the benefit of three months of experience. So no, I'm feeling pretty good about our PDR right now. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And did you have any other PDR left \u2013 or any charges left from last year that can be applied for the risk adjusters when they come out in June for last year? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I'm sorry, could you ask that question again, Peter, I didn't quite follow. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : When we were in the risk adjusters for last year in terms of how that played out, do you have anything left in reserve for that at this point or is that expected to be booked \u2013 you booked it already? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I think we're pretty tight on our reserve estimates, I don't think they're overly conservative if that's what you're asking. So no, I don't think there'll be a benefit when we settle up. I think we're pretty much spot on in terms of our estimates of 2016 risk adjustment right now. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And the last question is just sort of a detail. It looked like the guidance is down by about $0.03, is that correct, or is there something else that I'm not understanding about the overall guidance number relative to where you look for? Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: No, what we've essentially done is, we've confirmed guidance. We then added on to that the benefit of the Aetna-Humana break-up fee. And again, we haven't put any potential severance in there, so that's open. But no, I think what might be confusing you is guidance assumes a higher share count than is in our first quarter results. So that creates about a $0.03 difference between the $0.84 we reported in the benefit for the Aetna-Humana transaction this quarter based on first quarter share count, but for guidance share count it would only be $0.81. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Got it. That makes sense. Thank you gentlemen. Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: It's all arithmetic. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Tom Carroll with Stifel. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Thank you. If I could just follow-up on Peter's question initially Dale about the CEO search, I wonder if you could give us a sense of kind of your thinking about that role going forward at Molina? I mean, thank you for the timing, less than six months sounds great. But is this a person that, maybe came directly from the Medicaid world in the past, is this a person that came out of Medicare or is it maybe a combination of government focused candidates you're going to look at or everything really on the table in terms of options? Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Everything is on the table in terms of options. I think it would be a great benefit to have someone who is pretty damn familiar with the government business, Medicaid for sure and hopefully some Medicare. So you know how you do these things, we're going to look for best athlete, but part of best athlete is having the right sets of experience. Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And then is there the beginnings of maybe an operational improvement plan outside of what we've already heard from the company that you could tell us about or is this something that really is going to be formulated by the new leadership? Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I think that somewhere in the middle, it's nothing we're prepared to share today, but while we're searching for a CEO this place isn't going to stand still. And the team here with interim leadership by Joe is going to be focused with the board on what we need to get going. And we're not going to wait for the new person to come, they will certainly be a big player in that, but we'll be working in the coming weeks and months on some of those initiatives directly. Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So, it's fair to assume you've got a kind of a punch list of things to do that you're starting on right away as opposed to waiting? That's what it sounds like. Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Punch list makes it sound too flushed out and specific, but thoughts would be a better description. Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, very good. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good afternoon. I guess I just want to make sure I'm not reading too much into the delay in the annual shareholder meeting and the management changes, but was there anything, and clearly you're now appointing the people as executives, Dr. Molina and John, but was there anything as a part of sort of the normal proxy process that sort of raised some additional red flags with regard to the management team. Thanks. Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: So the reason for the delay in the shareholder meeting is that it is a requirement that all material information be in the hands of stockholders with sufficient time to evaluate and consider it before they cast their shares. So we therefore deemed it would have been inappropriate to hold the meeting tomorrow with this important news today, and that is entirely the basis of the one-week delay, it is to make sure we complied with that rule. Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just wanted to circle back up on the letter that the company had sent to congressional leadership last week. One of the things that jumped out to me was the comment that said if the cost sharing reductions or subsidies remained in place that Molina would continue its participation in the health insurance exchanges in 2018, and that seems to run a little contrary to the way management had talked about their participation at the Investor Day. So I guess is that the company's stance right now. So as long as the subsidies are maintained, you guys will continue to fully participate next year regardless of how things ultimately track through the quarter here? Thanks. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Hi, it's Joe speaking. I think a better way to express that would be that funding of the CSR is almost certainly a requirement for our participation in the exchange. It doesn't make it this positive (35:59) that we would indeed participate, but it's difficult, it probably can be done, but it is difficult to price around the absence of a CSR. Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right. But I guess \u2013 and sorry to push you, Joe, but I guess the way I think a lot of people interpreted what you put in there was the CSRs alone were enough to ensure participation, not your financial performance? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I think that's a little \u2013 yeah, I think that's a little bit of a na\u00efve reading of the letter, obviously, there is everything that goes into pricing from the rates to your provider network to competition to everything else. So I wouldn't read it in that light. Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with Raymond James. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Just wanted to get an updated view on Medicare and how that will fit, because I know recently there was kind of more of a focus in on potentially expanding that more aggressively and just wondering some updated thoughts on that front. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: It's Joe speaking, couple of thoughts on that. First of all, in terms of Medicare, as you can see by the results we published today, we're having good progress, good success in terms of managing costs and improving margins in our Medicare products in general. So that's certainly a highlight. It is a long-term, the company does indeed wish to participate further in the Medicare market, that's going to be a deliberate and measured approach. And to how we do that is not going to be broad-brush, but it is company policy and company practice to engage in markets such as Medicare and we will do that again in a measured and deliberate way. Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Barrett with TCW. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Patrick Barrett - The TCW Group : Hey, thank you for fitting me in. Given the unusual timing of the dismissal, I just want to ask you all to confirm that there was, aside from just performance, there was nothing that we can expect to hear regarding any kind of fraudulent activity or any reason, be it criminal or civil that you decided to make this change in what is certainly perceived as an abrupt way? Thank you. Dale B. Wolf - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: The information that we shared in the press release as to what was behind the board's thinking and what we've shared on that call today is exactly what we said it is and it's all we said and it's all there is to say. And so all of the things that you've suggested were never a part of that consideration. Patrick Barrett - The TCW Group : Thank you. Operator : And we have time for one last question, coming from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Yes. Hi, thanks. So just a follow-up on the base business on Medicaid, and as you're looking at your plan for margin expansion as you said on your base business, are there any kind of systemic things that you think you can do to improve margins across the board or is this more kind of a local market, state-by-state phenomenon? And finally, as you're talking to governors and if they're concerned at all and I know the vote and all is up in the air, but what might the rate environment look like, and if repeal and replace goes through, might they start crawling backwards in advance of potential cliff in 2020? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Ana, it's Joe speaking. First of all, I think it is a state-by-state effort. There are certainly certain centralized activities in terms of collecting data, collecting encounter information and there are a number of standard activities that go into getting the right rates for our members. But yes, I think it's fair to say that it is a state-by-state basis. As far as future funding in Medicaid, we as a company understand that government spending for Medicaid, whether federal or state, is going to be constrained more in future years and we're trying to build a company that is a low cost provider of care for just that reason. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. All right. Thanks, Joe. Operator : And there are no further questions on the phone lines at this time. Mr. Orellana, I'll now turn the presentation back to you, you may continue with your closing remarks. Juan Jos\u00e9 Orellana - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, thank you very much everyone for joining us today, and we will be updating you next quarter. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you all for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on today's date, Wednesday, August 2, 2017. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Juan Jos\u00e9 Orellana, Senior Vice President of Investors Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Juan Jos\u00e9 Orellana - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, Donnie. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The purpose of this call is to discuss Molina Healthcare's financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2017. The company issued its earnings release reporting these results today after the market closed, and this release is now posted for viewing on our company website. On the call with me today are Joseph White, our Chief Financial Officer and Interim Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Bayer, our Chief Operating Officer. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. If you have multiple questions, we ask that you get back in the queue, so that others can have an opportunity to ask their questions. Our comments today will contain forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. All of our forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to numerous risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. A description of such risk factors can be found in our earnings release and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-K Annual Report, our Form 10-Q Quarterly Reports, and our Form 8-K Current Reports. These reports can be accessed under the Investor Relations tab of our company website or on the SEC's website. All forward-looking statements made during today's call represent our judgment as of August 2, 2017, and we disclaim any obligation to update such statements, except as required by securities laws. This call is being recorded and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available at our company's website, molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to the Chief Financial Officer and Interim CEO, Joseph White. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, Juan Jos\u00e9, and thanks to all of you for joining us this afternoon. The last few months have been an exceptionally busy time at Molina Healthcare, and I will do my best to bring you up to speed on everything that has happened since we last spoke. But first, let me be clear, the results reported today are disappointing and unacceptable. We must and we will do much better. And we are taking aggressive, urgent and determined actions to improve our financial performance. Those actions, which include a comprehensive restructuring plan and 2018 Marketplace exits in Utah and Wisconsin, will put Molina on secure financial footing and allow us to continue the Molina mission. My remarks today are going to touch upon four general areas. First, I will review our quarterly financial performance and our immediate financial outlook. After that, I am going to speak to how we reached the place where we are at today. Then I will discuss our path forward and our plans for restoring and reinvigorating our great company. Finally, I will conclude with some personal remarks about how I regard our current challenges at Molina Healthcare. So, taking these topics in order, I will turn first to our financial performance. Today, we reported a net loss per diluted share of $4.10 for the second quarter of 2017. This compares to net income per diluted share of $0.58 for the same period last year. High medical costs were a key contributor to our poor performance in the second quarter and our medical care ratio was nearly 95%. This high medical care ratio was the result of several issues. First, we adjusted our medical cost estimates for 2016 dates of service. As a result, we recognized in the second quarter about $85 million worth of medical costs that were actually related to 2016. Some of these adjustments to our prior-period estimates resulted from claims payments, others resulted from legal settlements with providers. As part of the broader restructuring program that I will discuss later in the call, we are undertaking a thorough and comprehensive redesign of our provider payment process. This will address issues that extend from the design of our provider contracts to the actual payment of providers. We expect this process redesign to result in greater transparency and improved administrative cost efficiency. Continued challenges in the Marketplace were another cause of our poor performance in the quarter. Settlement of risk transfer and cost sharing rebate liabilities related to 2016 dates of service reduced pre-tax income from the quarter by $44 million. We also recorded a $78 million increase to our 2017 Marketplace premium deficiency reserve. The increase in the Marketplace PDR was driven by our assessment that, based upon trends observed in the second quarter, Marketplace performance in the second half of 2017 will fall substantially short of our previous expectations. The increase in the Marketplace premium deficiency reserve, along with our decision to curtail our Marketplace presence in 2018, were both outcomes of a hard look we have taken at our business over the last few months. Finally, profitability at four of our health plans this quarter, Florida, Illinois, New Mexico, and Puerto Rico, was disappointing, even after allowing for out-of-period items. Inpatient and pharmacy costs were major contributors to performance of these health plans. Our restructuring plan includes a concerted effort to remediate high-cost contracts and to build around high-quality, cost-effective networks, even if those actions result in lower enrollment and revenue. In addition, we have recently made management changes at three of these health plans. Our administrative cost ratio was flat quarter-over-quarter, and for the first half of 2017, it was running at a much lower rate than anticipated in our original 2017 outlook. With the major step we took in our restructuring plan last week, we can expect further reductions to our administrative cost ratio in the future. There are also two other items of note that contributed to our second quarter loss. We recorded an impairment charge of $72 million, primarily related to the goodwill and intangible assets of our Pathways subsidiary. As part of the comprehensive review of our entire business, we have determined that the anticipated benefits from Pathways, including its integration with our health plans, will be less than originally anticipated when we closed on the acquisition two years ago. We also took a charge of $43 million in the second quarter for restructuring and separation costs. This charge is primarily for the termination benefits for our former chief executive and chief financial officers, and represents the contractual obligations under their employment agreements. You may recall that I told you to expect this charge on our previous earnings call. This line item also includes consulting costs incurred through June 30 for the implementation of our restructuring plan. We are withdrawing our previously issued 2017 outlook as a result of our second quarter performance, uncertainty around the funding for Marketplace cost-sharing subsidies in 2017 and the uncertainty around the timing of benefits achieved and costs to be incurred as a result of our restructuring plan. Now that we have discussed our second quarter results, let's talk about how we got here. I believe that our current situation is a result of three key factors. First, we did not properly adjust our business to absorb the growth that resulted from the Affordable Care Act. Second, we did not fully appreciate the growth in the ACA Marketplace required robust development of new capabilities that we did not have. And finally, our direct delivery network is simply not competitive with other care delivery channels available to the company. Fortunately, we are well on our way to remediating these issues. Let me talk about them one at a time. The implementation of the Affordable Care Act brought a sudden growth. We prepared for that growth by spending more on existing processes, procedures, capabilities and technologies. In hindsight, this was a mistake. As a result of trying to manage our rapid growth within an infrastructure design for a much smaller, simpler business, we experienced breakdowns in areas like provider payment, utilization management, risk adjustment and information management. The utilization management issues we saw last year in the first quarter of 2016 and the out-of-period claims expenses occurred in this quarter were emblematic of these difficulties, as are the challenges we had faced in adequately measuring our exposure to Marketplace risk adjustment liabilities. In retrospect, a better approach would have been to undertake a full review of the organization in anticipation of the potential growth resulting from the Affordable Care Act. Instead of increasing investment in existing processes, we should have conducted the full redesign of our business that we are doing now. Our challenges in the Marketplace point to the second source of our current difficulties, the failure to fully appreciate the unique demands on the Marketplace product. While our Marketplace members share many characteristics with our Medicaid members, the Marketplace is fundamentally an individual insurance market, and in some respects, very different from the Medicaid market. To be clear, our Medicaid-based provider network is an important competitive strength in the Marketplace. However, there were other aspects of the Marketplace business for which we were not as well-prepared: member billing, risk adjustment and pricing, to name a few. We have learned much about these activities, but we have paid a price for that learning. We continue to monitor our Marketplace business and remain committed to making tough decisions should they be necessary. Finally, our direct delivery network is simply not competitive with other care delivery channels available to the company. But, as with Marketplace, we have learned a great deal and we are now ready to put those insights to use. So, that is how we arrived where we are today. Now, what are we doing about it? How will we become the high-value health plan serving people receiving government assistance? We have taken a hard look at our financial performance and have developed action plans to address the issues we have identified. Fortunately, we had better visibility now into the causes of our financial performance than we have had at any time in the recent past. With improved visibility comes greater confidence that we can fix what is broken and return the company to profitability. We are streamlining our organizational structure to improve efficiency and the speed and quality of decision-making. We expect those changes to be largely complete by the end of 2017 and anticipate that this effort will ultimately yield an estimated $200 million in annual run rate savings. We are re-designing core operating processes such as provider payment, utilization management, Marketplace risk adjustment, and quality monitoring and improvement to achieve more effective and cost-efficient outcomes. While this effort will extend well into 2018, we hope to see our first meaningful results by the end of 2017. We are remediating high-cost provider contracts and building around high-quality, cost-effective networks. This initiative will take time and will likely not show meaningful benefits until 2018. We are restructuring our direct delivery operations. We expect these changes to be complete by the end of 2017. Finally, we are reviewing our vendor base to ensure that we are partnering with the lowest-cost, most effective vendors. As with remediating high-cost provider contracts, we do not expect meaningful results from this part of our plan until 2018. Of course, we are also taking precautions to ensure that our actions do not impede our ability to continue to deliver quality healthcare to our members, secure new managed care contracts and retain existing contracts. We estimate that our restructuring plan will reduce annualized run rate expenses by approximately $300 million to $400 million by the end of 2018, including the $200 million of these run rate reductions that will be completed in time to be fully effective for all of 2018. I have given a lot of thought as to how I might convey to you the sheer size of this opportunity. We have pulled guidance for 2017, and it is too soon to speak of 2018 in detail. So I think the best way to scale these potential savings is to measure them against our 2016 performance. The low end of our estimated cost improvement range of $300 million is almost 1.5 times the size of our entire income before taxes of $205 million in 2016. Obviously, our financial statements will look much different in 2019 when the full benefit of our restructuring plan is realized than they did in 2016, but I think this example captures the general magnitude of the results we are seeking. As part of our organizational Restructuring Plan, we are reducing our workforce by approximately 10%, or 1,500 employees. The reduction is designed to increase operating efficiencies, while reducing cost is part of the reorganization of our corporate and health plan operations. This was a very difficult decision and one that we do not take lightly. We never want to lose any of our talented and dedicated colleagues. We are committed to treating our departing colleagues with dignity and respect, and we'll be providing severance and outplacement assistance to those affected. We initiated the first wave of the workforce reduction last Thursday, July 27. This single action will reduce annualized run rate expenses by $55 million and constitutes a substantial down payment on our commitment to build a profitable business that delivers better shareholder value. We estimate that total pre-tax cost associated with our Restructuring Plan will be approximately $130 million to $150 million incurred in the second half of 2017, with an additional $40 million to be incurred in 2018. To be clear, these are one-time costs as opposed to the recurring nature of the benefits that we expect to see. In addition to our restructuring plan, we are taking the following steps to manage our Marketplace exposure in 2018. We are exiting the ACA Marketplace in Utah and Washington (sic) [Wisconsin], effective December 31, 2017. For the six months ended June 30 of 2017, these two health plans contributed only 60% of our total Marketplace revenue, but they constituted slightly more than half of our consolidated Marketplace operating loss. We are also reducing the scope of our 2018 participation in the Washington Marketplace. In our remaining Marketplace plans, we are increasing our premiums for 2018 by 55%. Our premium increase assumed the absence of cost-sharing reduction subsidies. Had we assumed that the CSRs would be funded for 2018, the premium increase would still had been 30%. It is also important to note that the performance of our Marketplace products in California, Michigan, New Mexico and Texas remain acceptable. We will continue to monitor political and programmatic developments in the Marketplace, and we may withdraw from additional markets for 2018, if necessary. I want to emphasize that neither our focus on profitability, nor the reduction to our Marketplace footprint suggest any diminished enthusiasm on our part for growth in the Medicaid managed care space. As demonstrated by our recent wins in Washington and Mississippi, we remain committed to Medicaid managed care and expect to claim more than our share of the growth expected across the country over the next few years. We are taking extra care to be certain that our restructuring activities improve our contract retention and capture capabilities. Our recent RFP wins demonstrate that the improvements we have made in our revenue procurement capabilities are bearing fruit. Finally, some personal remarks. The path we are on is by no means an easy one. But, as we work to place our company on a solid foundation, we are reminded that many high-growth companies have walked a similar path. We will move forward and continue our mission of providing high-quality healthcare services to people receiving government assistance. Despite the results we reported today, I want to stress how excited I am about our future. There has never been a more challenging time to work at Molina Healthcare, but there has never been a more satisfying, a more stimulating, or a more meaningful time to work here either. Today, more than 20,000 Molina employees carry a rich tradition forward into a better future. I am grateful to be one of them. On a final scheduling note, we have not settled upon a date for our next Investor Day. We are, of course, eager to meet with all of you and look forward to phone calls or face-to-face meetings as you may see fit. We will let you know as soon as our next Investor Day is scheduled. This concludes our prepared remarks. Donnie, we're now ready to take questions. Operator : Certainly. Thank you. It appears our first question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Hello, everybody. I guess I want to ask about the restructuring a little bit. Is there any need to put more capital into any of the subsidiaries as a result of today's announcement and the things you're doing? And then also, can you give us some flavor on the restructuring and the layoffs you're taking? Is it sort of reducing head count 10% across the board or is it concentrated in certain areas? And do you have to communicate what you're doing in any way to the states' Medicaid programs? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: A.J. \u2013 and I think, Juan Jos\u00e9, did you want to make a clarification? Juan Jos\u00e9 Orellana - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. I just wanted to make a really brief clarification. We are exiting the ACA Marketplaces in Utah and Wisconsin. We had said Utah and Washington. It's Utah and Wisconsin. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Oh, I'm sorry for that. So A.J., I think your question had been \u2013 was your first question about capital requirements that's tied to the Restructuring Plan? A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. And the earnings release today, and where you're at, does it require you to \u2013 is there any need for incremental capital? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: No. The restructuring plan in itself does not pose capital demands for the health plans. The financial performance of some of the health plans, particularly as they relate to Marketplace performance, do indeed create capital demands for the health plans, which we are funding. But the restructuring plan itself does not touch on the capital needs of the health plans. It's funded through the parent. To the second point \u2013 I think your second point is, is we believe we're in compliance with all notice requirements in regards to any actions we are taking under the restructuring plan. And we are very closely engaged in discussions with our state partners and letting them what happens. Your third question, I think, was about the nature of staffing reductions we've implemented. I don't think you can say they reach into any specific areas more than others, with a general caveat that most of these reductions are reflecting managers and affect people leaders, individuals higher up in the organization. As part of this effort, we are trying to expand spans of control for managers, which unfortunately is resulting in the exit of a large number of our management personnel. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Okay. And I guess all of this \u2013 just maybe clarifying one last thing. I assume this is all the result of the strategic review you talked about in the last quarter. Are you pretty much done with the strategic review, or is that ongoing? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: The strategic review initiated very early this year, back in February. I think we're done with the outlines of the plan and the path forward and the setting of savings targets. Of course, there's going to be modifications as we go along. And many of these activities, such as provider re-contracting, vendor re-contracting, will continue well into 2018. But I am confident in saying the plan is fleshed out and is built and is complete in terms of planning and design. Now, again, the operation and the roll-out of the plan will continue through 2018. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. The first question, just, Joe, can you talk about how you're thinking about some of these RFPs that are ongoing or upcoming, just in the context of the financial pressures that you've seen in some of the markets? And just in particular, I was hoping just to drill in a little bit into Illinois and then into Florida, saw that the MLRs did spike there pretty materially, and those are markets where there are pretty active RFP processes in place right now. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Right. Sure. I think the most important thing to grasp, Scott, is that the savings we are deriving from the restructuring plan are not going to interfere with our ability to capture or retain any of our Medicaid managed care business. We are not retrenching from Medicaid managed care. We think these savings actually better position us to compete for contracts and better position us to compete particularly as a low-cost provider. I think everything we've seen out of Washington lately, while the developments in Washington are very murky, I think what is becoming crystal clear to everyone is that the open-ended nature of the Medicaid entitlement is coming to a close. And we are going to see more and more efforts by the federal government and the states to reign in Medicaid growth. That can be growth in spending. That can be very good for Molina. There is no doubt that managed care is a documented cost effective way for states and, by extension, the federal government to manage growth in Medicaid spending. We are taking efforts to make sure that we are indeed a low-cost provider and we are there to serve states as a low-cost Medicaid provider. So, in a nutshell, this restructuring effort is a huge benefit to that effort. I'll take your states in order. In regards to Illinois, there's no doubt that the path for the company in Illinois has been a rocky path. We are gratified that the state budget crisis is resolved. We actually received a payment on premium, I think, probably two weeks ago now. So it's good to see the premium money starting to flow. There is no doubt that we've had our challenges from a cost management area there, but we've installed a very capable new management team in that state, and I think they're already making progress in that regard. We're watching it very closely. This quarter they continued to be troubled by provider settlements and claims payments from 2016, but nevertheless, I've been gratified by my engagement with the new management team there. Florida is a situation that's colored by our experience in the Marketplace. When you take that Marketplace experience away, while Florida has not had a great year by any stretch of the imagination, again, we have a very good management team in place there, we have some very good people working there and I remain very optimistic about that health plan, too. We'll have to watch Marketplace in Florida in particular. The increase we're putting forward there is north of 50% when you include the assumption that CSRs won't be funded; around 30% if they're not. I think we're pricing appropriately, but we'll have to watch Florida Marketplace too. In general, that health plan though, I think, is on a sound footing. Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. And I just had one follow-up question. Just if you can talk about how you feel about the adequacy of the medical claims reserves at this point? And just given the extent of the negative reserve development that you highlighted in a number of the markets, I felt maybe would have seen a bit more of a bump in the claims payable for the second quarter. So, maybe just sort of talk about your comfort with reserves adequacy at this point. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Sure. We beat the bushes pretty hard on claims reserves this quarter. We looked very closely at certain states, Illinois being one of them, that were having provider settlement issues. And we've really pushed the staff, the local staff and the corporate staff, to come forward with their best estimates. We emphasized that this constant drip-drip, I think it was probably more than a drip-drip, of old claims coming through and settlements coming through is simply not acceptable. And I think the staff has stepped up and I'm very confident we've got reserves appropriately set. Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thanks, Joe. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please proceed. Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good afternoon. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Hey, Chris. Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Just want to try to connect the dots a little bit on your sort of historical commentary about the exchange performance versus sort of what you're, call it, spiking out now. I guess, my understanding in the past was that the core medical cost trends were sort of running reasonably well and most, if not all, of the problems were related to the risk adjustment monies. Now it seems like you're actually seeing some real issues in the business. I guess, was the 2016 performance maybe \u2013 was your view of it maybe a little off-base or has there been sort of a fairly remarkable shift in the utilization on the exchange population for you guys? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, there's no doubt, Chris, that our experience has been \u2013 certainly we saw this in the second quarter. Our experience has been some pretty dramatic increases in pharmacy utilization among the Marketplace membership. If you look at the population as a whole compared to other membership groups, they are lower utilizers, particularly on the inpatient side. But, certainly, pharmacy trends have been much higher than we expected this year. Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just when I think about how you're evaluating the participation next year, I guess are there certain indicators that you're looking for in the other states that would make you more likely to exit at this point? Like, just trying to figure out, like, where your mindset really is in terms of the level of participation in 2018 outside the two states you're calling out already. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, the first thing we're looking at is strategic fit. Looking back on our involvement in Wisconsin and Utah, the populations in those states were probably not significant enough to move the needle for the company in a positive way. The cost experience certainly moved it in a negative way. But, frankly, I think the markets there were just so small as to just not offer a lot of upside. So, as we look at other states, we're looking very closely at the degree to which Marketplace can support or is, in some way, advantageous to the Medicaid line of business. I think that would be most critical. But, again, we've got a little more time to decide on this. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we're prepared to make hard decisions. There's no doubt performance in Texas has been very nice. Performance in some of the smaller states, Michigan and New Mexico, has been nice. California has been okay. Florida, though, has not been a good market for us. We're going to have to look closely at it. Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. I'll leave it there. Thanks a lot. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Please proceed. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. Maybe I could go at medical costs a little bit of a different way. If I look at it by product, it looks like there's more headwinds than just on the exchange book. It was kind of up across all products but Medicare. So I'm wondering if this is the PYD. Because if I run the math, I feel like there's more than exchanges and PYD. Maybe you can talk through some of the other things that are driving up medical costs across, like, the CHIP, TANF, ABD book? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. And I think you're correct. I think you're correct, Sarah. We called out specifically inpatient issues in the four states that are most problematic, higher inpatient costs than we anticipated. We're seeing it in places like neonatal ICU. Pharmacy, while it is most pronounced in trend on the Marketplace product, is also an issue in certain states. So I think, in general, yes, you're correct. We are seeing cost pressure. I would say it is more outside of Marketplace, it is more inpatient than anything else, and there are specific pockets : neonatology, radiology, things like that. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got it. And on the restructuring plan, I understand the staff reduction portion, but I'm wondering if there's also any additions being made to key areas like medical management or the actuarial team? And just big picture-wise, post-restructuring, should we still think about fixed cost leverage as about 10 to 20 basis points SG&A reduction per $1 billion in revenue added, or is the fixed cost leverage changed now? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: To your first question, there are pockets of the company where we will see additional resources directed. So, for example, contract procurement, business development, RFP team, we'll see more resources directed in that area. There may be some aspects of medical management that we will indeed direct more resources to. But I think that will be a reshuffling of resources more than the assignment of new resources. We'll probably beef up our contacting capabilities, both in terms of provider contracting and just basic vendor administrative costs, vendor contracting; we think there's some opportunities there. So there are places in the company where we will see increased resources directed. To your other question, I have not gone back and looked at that scaling lately of $1 billion of revenue to what it compares to G&A lift. I think that got a little bit skewed when we went so deeply into Marketplace, which obviously has a very different administrative cost structure. I will say this though, the savings we anticipate from the restructuring plan, which at the high end are split about 50%-50% between medical and admin; and at the low end, they're probably 65% admin. The restructuring plan has the potential to lower our administrative cost ratio by as much as 100 bps. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Thank you. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Hey, Ana. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah. Hi. Thanks. Hi. How are you, Joe? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Good. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Good evening. I wanted to check in. So it's kind of a follow-up again on some of Sarah's questions. Just doing rough math, and pardon me if this is all very quick, obviously, you just reported. Like, $1.50 or so of your EPS loss seems to be coming from continuing ops. And we've had a string of hospital reports where fallings (35:03) are clearly seeing pressure and insurers are talking about how, I mean, the MLR, at least they attribute it in part to value-based care and all of that. So, operationally, it seems like there are a lot of challenges and you're going through all these layoffs. And I understand the 50% rate increase and even 30% with CSRs and all that. But aren't you taking on a lot with everything you've got going right now? And how do you see yourself coming out of this? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, I'm not sure where your $1.50 from continuing operations, how you derived that, Ana. And it's probably not that. We can probably go into that in a separate call. Pre-tax, our loss was $314 million for the second quarter. The items we called out, which included the Marketplace premium deficiency reserve, were about $330 million. To me, that suggests more or less running at break-even for the quarter at least. But I think what we're essentially finding, and I come back to what I said in my prepared remarks, a lot of the build we've done in this company in 2012, in 2013, into 2014, when we were talking to you all about the way we were spending more money on admin, honestly, I think we placed it in the wrong direction. And I think we were doubling down on existing processes, existing methods of doing things, when we actually needed to just essentially strip down to the fundamentals and rebuild the chassis of the business. That's something we've been spending a lot of time among ourselves and the leadership team and with our consultants over the last six months or so. And I really think there is enough spend in this company to \u2013 more than enough spend in this company to manage it very well. I think we simply have to redirect people's energies and redirect people's focus to more productive activities. For example, to be revisiting... Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. So you... Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. Go ahead. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : No. So I'm happy to know that I might be wrong and... Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : ...at least on the Medicaid you're saying the dollar amount that I came up with was \u2013 and I'll have to refine my math but... Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. But we'll talk about it. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : (37:29). You were saying? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, well, there is a lot of out-of-period activity, which I think we've closed the door on this quarter. And you look at the impairment, you look at the PDR, which is forward-looking, I think we're running at about break-even for the quarter pure period. But others may have a different opinion. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Now, with these losses and with this report, in terms of your capital adequacy, and how do you think your conversations would go with the ratings agencies? And because one cannot say that for sure, especially with the Marketplaces performing the way they are, that even this year, leave alone next year, despite the (38:09) things won't be bad. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. And we've been engaging, obviously, with the rating agencies over the last couple of days. They are appropriately asking hard questions. I think they welcome the Restructuring Plan. I think as we've walked representatives of the rating agencies, both of them, through that Restructuring Plan, they understand that the Restructuring Plan has real teeth. There was $55 million of cost take-out last Thursday and that is, obviously, not reflected in these numbers because it was a July event. So we're already $55 million down the path to that $200 million we've committed to for the full year. But, again, the rating agencies see the numbers you see, and they're asking hard questions and we're engaged with them. And we'll have to see how that plays out. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Thanks so much. I appreciate the color. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Hi, Peter. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, guys. How are you? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Great. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I'd like to dig a little bit more into your cash position and capital position at this point. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Cash at the parent was $270 million at the end of the first quarter. Where is that today? You did the bond offering. So can you kind of go through with what you have today at the end of the second quarter? What you know you've already funded down to the sub level? What you're planning to fund down to the sub level? And then whatever you think has happened with the convert? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Okay. So to take that in order, just to be clear, the notes we issued back in early May are, in effect, set aside for payment of the 2044 converts that become potentially put-able to us next year. So that is down in a segregated cash account. So that is outside of any discussions, the rest of anything else I'm going to talk about. So that's set aside, again, to protect us in the event the notes that could be put to us in 2018 are, indeed, put to us. So at the parent company, at the end of June, we had about $165 million of cash. We're going to do some further funding of our subsidiaries in the next day or so that's probably going to take perhaps another \u2013 probably bring that down to $100 million. We are also going to take a draw upon our revolver. We've spoken to our bank syndicate. They're very supportive. We're going to take about $300 million draw on our revolver, either tomorrow or the next day. With that, we should be fine. What's going to happen, obviously, is we'll incur some pretty hefty cost, as you can see, on the Restructuring Plan for the latter half of the year, but only about two-thirds of those are cash. Some of the items we have as cost for the Restructuring Plan that we talk about in the 10-Q are going to be lease terminations and all of that. And then, by the time we roll around into January of next year, in five months, we're going to have the benefit of about $200 million of run rate reduction off of where we're at right now. So I think we're in a decent position in terms of liquidity. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So, where do you think your cash will be at the end of the year, cash at the parent? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: My bet would be $200 million or $300 million. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then, I just have to ask. In Ohio, you signed this agreement with the Cleveland Clinic. Don't you think that's going to bring less healthy people to you in your Medicaid book. And at this point in time, signing up with a premier facility like that makes you concerned that you're going to get an adverse selection. Why would you do something like that at this point in time, given all the other things going on? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I'll let Terry Bayer answer that question. Terry P. Bayer - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. This is Terry. We were successful in negotiating a very competitive rate with the Clinic, and we're confident that our commitment to that market will assist us in managing those patients. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Do you think you're going to get an adverse selection from having that in your network? Terry P. Bayer - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: We'll know after we're in business. The Cleveland Clinic also is attractive in terms of drawing the broader population. They've been in the Medicaid network in Ohio, and that'll come into our rating as we go forward with the state agency. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And my last question, just on the Medicaid rate increase in Puerto Rico, you didn't mention that. What did you get for rate increase in Puerto Rico? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I think it's in the neighborhood of 5%, 5.5%, effective July 1. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And what do you think that will do to your operating performance there? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: It will certainly help. We'll have to see how trends roll out in terms of medical costs, but it's a nice increase. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. I guess, first, the $400 million number of savings that you're talking about, how much of that is in G&A versus in medical cost? Because it sounds like you are doing some things around networking and contracting and things like that, so I just wondered if you could break out... Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Oh, absolutely. Kevin, at the lower end of the $300 million end, it's probably 60% to 65% admin. Bear in mind that probably 3% of our MLR is administrative-related medical costs. So as we reduce staff, we reduce not just the admin, but we reduce medical costs. But again, at the lower end of $300 million is probably 60% to 65% admin. By the time you get to that higher end, it's probably 50%/50%. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And so when you talk about that 3% MLR, that's kind of admin costs. Are you including that in the 65% admin, or are you just kind of saying G&A is admin for this purpose? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Oh, no. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Everything else is MLR? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: No. No. No, we're assigning them to the right cost category, either medical or admin. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. So in the $300 million number, 65% comes out of G&A and 35% comes out of MLR. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. I would assume so, yeah. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And you kind of gave the numbers \u2013 I'm sure we can back into it from what you gave us. It'd be just easier if we get that exclusive number. What does the guidance assume for Wisconsin and Utah exchange losses this year in absolute dollars? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: We certainly haven't shared that, and I don't have that handy right now. Sorry. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And I guess these numbers \u2013 it sounds to me like you're not really looking to invest a lot of money. So when we think about $300 million to $400 million, these are both a gross and basically a net number. There's not going to be $50 million of investment somewhere else that comes up later on. This is both a gross and a net number. Is that right? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. Well, I think you're looking at it correctly. Just remember, though, that as it is disclosed in our 10-Q that we filed and also in the AR, there's about $150 million \u2013 I think it's maybe around a $150 million cost to the plan in the second half of this year and maybe another $40 million or $50 million in 2018. But beyond that... Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : These are the kind of the one-time severance costs? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. And again, as I said, they are purely gross and net numbers. There is increased spending to support RFP and business development efforts. There is some increased spending in terms of contracting. But most of it is \u2013 to the extent we are putting more money into places, we're redeploying existing spend. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. I guess I think certainly the impression of Molina from the outside is not necessarily that the company was fat from a G&A perspective. I mean, obviously, there's always room to cut in any organization. But I guess the perception had always been that you guys needed to do more work around the medical management side of things. And I look at the quarter, this quarter, it seems like medical costs are the problem, not that G&A somehow exploded in the quarter and that created a problem. It's really that medical costs were out of control. So I guess I just want to understand why the solution here is about cutting G&A, when I think most people would expect you to be saying, no, we should be putting more money into systems and medical management initiatives and things like that. That's usually the gameplay and we always hear from other companies is we're going to spend $100 million more on XYZ to deliver twice as much or three times as much savings in years two and three. This is just unusual to me to hear it this way. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: And I'll be honest with you, as the last four or five months have unfolded, I have been surprised too. I was not alone as you thinking that at Molina we were essentially lean from an admin perspective. What I don't think that assumption recognized was that over the last four or five years we have become probably the pure-play Medicaid, outside of Marketplace/HMO. And the reality of it is, is that with such a focus on Medicaid, we can and should run much lower than the competition. So, that's been something, frankly, of a learning process for me because I think I would have had your point of view six months ago. But as we've dived into the numbers, and we've done a deep dive, there's clearly spend we can take out of Medicaid \u2013 out of admin without harming the business. And, again, there is going to be, as I said, by the time we get to $400 million in savings, there's considerable medical cost savings tied to better provider contracting. Essentially, the restructure of our direct delivery organization is going to bring some money to the bottom line. So there are medical savings there. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And I guess maybe last question. When you talk about the provider contracting process that you're fixing, what exactly is it that was wrong with the process as it was historically? How are you fixing it? Is it just a matter of going back and taking out high-cost providers in the network or is there something else in that process? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: There is no doubt, bluntly, in terms of how we've engaged particularly certain inpatient facilities, certain hospitals, over the years. There is no doubt, frankly, that we've left some money on the table. We've come across, for example, at our New Mexico health plan. We've come across it and a few other health plans. We've had to make some tough decisions. I mentioned the fact that we've replaced leadership teams at three health plans in the last eight months. Honestly, we've just left some money on the table when it comes to engagement with providers. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And then I guess what is leading you to think that you've left money on table? Is it that you've kind of benchmarked against what Centene or Anthem are getting? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Exactly. The benchmarks tell the story. The speed with which clients become outliers, things like that, tell a story that we could've been more efficient in how we contracted. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Well, now I like it. I think I've got one more question. So I guess to the extent that... Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : ...a third to half of these savings are going to be medical management in nature, I guess it's always easier for us to model in G&A savings. I think we did some pretty good visibility and you're achieving what you're talking about really when you talk about G&A savings. Medical management is always a little more difficult to kind of rely on. To what extent do you believe that the medical management savings are kind of high-visibility things, I guess, just getting a better price and your ability to get a better price versus what you've gotten historically, versus something else that may be a little bit more nebulous as far as, like, provider engagement to change outcomes and shift volumes to lower cost settings, et cetera? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. Well, there's no doubt that it's going to be \u2013 there's no doubt that it's a little harder \u2013 because we're modeling this out for that exact purpose you've spoken to, there's no doubt that it's going to be harder to track and firmly identify savings on the medical side. But we can certainly see changes in unit costs per contract. It gets a little bit murkier when you talk about trying to encourage members to see more effective what we would call preferred networks. That becomes a little bit harder. But I think we're going to be able to measure that too. And frankly, I also think we're going to be able to measure some of our utilization improvements, as we have more time and more resources to direct to patients we can influence, to the complex patients. And I think we'll be able to see that on the utilization side too. But you're correct, it will be harder to measure. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Great. Thanks. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you for your question. The next question comes from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Good evening. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Hi, Gary. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : A couple of questions. So, going back to that $300 million to $400 million savings figure, and you've provided some context, like, comparing it to 2016 pre-tax income, I guess the question is do you have confidence that that level of savings makes its way down to the pre-tax line by 2019? Is there any reason why that level of savings, if you achieve it, doesn't find its way to the pre-tax line, ultimately? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I have very high confidence we can do that. Again, we've already got visibility into a lot of the stuff we're going to do. We've already done this summer. We're going to do this fall. Now, certainly as part of this process, we're going to have be disciplined to make sure that cost doesn't creep back in. I think everybody who's been through one of these restructuring exercises understands you've got to make sure the rubber band doesn't snap back. But we have \u2013 it's a very detailed process we're going into. We're basically developing staffing ratios. We're developing spans of control. And we're going to be looking very closely at this going forward. So I certainly feel very good about the low end of that range, the $300 million. Obviously, as you move more up toward $400 million, I think it becomes more speculative. But to answer your question succinctly, yes, I'm confident we can do that. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And in terms of \u2013 you had responded to an earlier question about, obviously, remaining committed to the Medicaid market, et cetera. What about the RFPs for new populations? It seems like it'd be reasonable to think, in the rest of this year and probably even in 2018, you may not be participating in RFPs for new chronic populations, et cetera. So is that fair or unfair? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: You're talking about Medicaid populations? Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Correct. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: We're all in. And that's not a correct statement. We are all in. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : On assuming and entering into new populations over the... Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yes. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Even in the near term? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yes. We're all in. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then my last question is, when you talked about direct delivery network not being competitive, I presume you're talking about owned physician practices and clinics. Is that fair? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Correct. And I would say owned at \u2013 managed in the way we've managed direct delivery heretofore. Correct. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And so the question was just why? Is there a little more color? I'm not sure I understand why, upon review, those weren't being managed how you think they should be or can be. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I think there are a few points. First of all, there's a matter of where our expertise is at, as part of our direct delivery strategy with our captive professional corporation. For example, we felt the need to retain our own in-house management service organization, our own in-house MSO. The MSO is the entity that does all the administrative processes for the medical group. Well, as a practical matter, we simply do not have the expertise to provide efficiently administrative services for a medical group. Secondly, it is probably just by recent definition of scale, it is impossible to build an MSO out to provide administrative services to a single medical group that's only seeing Molina members. So, right off the bat, we've really struggled with the maintaining of a full direct delivery administrative infrastructure. This is everything from setting up appointments to providing office space, to providing equipment, to providing office help. We just haven't been able to do that efficiently. Part of it is a question of expertise but part of it, frankly, is a question of scale. So, from a direct delivery perspective, I think entities that look outside to leverage third-party MSOs are going to be more effective. The second issue we've struggled with is with an in-house medical group, or what's called a friendly professional corporation. We've struggled to incentivize physicians to manage care appropriately. A third-party IPA simply has every incentive to manage care in the most effective manner. When the individual physician doesn't have a profit incentive, you're going to get a different outcome. So I would point to those two things as being the key catalysts for that decision. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Last quick one from me. I apologize, we're all digesting a lot, so I can't remember... Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : ...if you said this or if I read this. But I know there was a comment somewhere along the way that the permanent CEO search was underway and you were encouraged by the responses or something to that effect. Do you have kind of a \u2013 or when should we expect to see that announcement made? Is this by the end of the year thing for sure, or by the end of the year hopeful? Or any tighter framework for us? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I mean, I can't commit to a timeframe. I will say that the search is narrowing. There have been a number of very qualified candidates, a number of whom remain in the pool, and it's proceeding very well. I hesitate to give a timeframe. But, boy, I would be surprised if it took me to the end of the year. I'd be very surprised if it took that long. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Stephen Baxter - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi. This is Steve Baxter on for Justin. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Hey, Steve. Stephen Baxter - Wolfe Research LLC : I just want to ask a couple of questions. Hey, how are you? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Stephen Baxter - Wolfe Research LLC : Want to ask a couple of questions about the business as it kind of is today and underlying trends there. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Stephen Baxter - Wolfe Research LLC : So I was hoping that you could maybe provide an update on the outlook for rates in the Medicaid Expansion business and what the profitability of that business is currently running at today. I mean, our understanding is that plans are looking at a pretty meaningful rate reduction in California. So we were hoping you could share what you're expecting to see there in terms of rates that you guys have. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. There was a pretty hefty rate reduction on Medicaid Expansion in California July 1. I don't have that handy. With that said, though, there was also activity in the other direction in terms of the other Medicaid products. We had guided back in January to an overall fully-blended 4% rate decrease in California, which would include all lines of business. It looks like what we've seen of a July rate's effective, it's come in closer to 2% decrease. So that's actually been a bright spot for us right now. In general, we continue to see Expansion rates move more towards the other Medicaid, the TANF and ABD rates, as we see margins move in that direction too. But I think, in general, the outlook for Medicaid Expansion is still pretty good. So I guess I would say, Steve, that and slightly (01:00:48) just to be a little more concise, even with the drop in California July 1, we've got pretty good relief on other product lines. Stephen Baxter - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thanks. And then thinking just about the exchanges and sort of the volatility that's ongoing with CSRs at the moment, can you give us I guess an estimate, assuming that CSRs are paid for the balance of the year, how much will you have been reimbursed by the Federal Government in total for the 2017 plan year? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: CSRs, for the full \u2013 all of 2017, we expect that to run around $400 million. We expect to give back \u2013 right now, we expect probably to give back half of that. We're always in a... Stephen Baxter - Wolfe Research LLC : In terms of giving it back, sorry, what do you mean by giving it back? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Excuse me. My voice is breaking. We're always in a position, at least have always been in the past on CSRs in most of our states, where the amount funded by the Feds is in excess of what our members utilize. So at that point, we have to repay the Feds the amount that the member in effect doesn't utilize. It's a process of repricing claims and seeing what the members' co-pays and deductibles would have been. So basically, we think it's going to be about $400 million for all of 2017, and we think we'll probably give about $200 million of that back. Stephen Baxter - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. So then about $200 million net. All right. Thank you. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thanks for your question. Our next question comes from Patrick Barrett with TCW. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Patrick Barrett - The TCW Group : Hey. Thank you for taking my question. Just wanted to ask about the way that you all report EBITDA. So when you came to market with the note, it was $544 million on an LTM basis. Would be curious to know if you have the number as of this quarter and if you'd be willing to share with us which of the items you've identified that are sort of non-recurring in nature that are permissible to be added to that EBITDA number. Thank you. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Actually, Patrick, I don't have that indenture information handy. We can certainly have a call on that. The EBITDA we share is a non-GAAP measure. It is a traditional EBITDA. I would imagine the notes probably adjust for stock compensation and items like that. So I don't really have that. I really don't have that number. I think it might be running around $470 million LTM. But we should probably have a talk with you about that, Patrick. Let's have a call afterwards and we can track that down. Patrick Barrett - The TCW Group : Perfect. Thank you. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Michael Baker with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yes. Thanks a lot. Joe, I was wondering if you could give some color on the shortfall on Pathways relative to what you were expecting. And is that another kind of delivery area where you may look to do some outsourcing as well? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Certainly. Pathways is a very interesting business. I want to be clear, it is a functioning business and it is \u2013 the fact that we took an impairment on Pathways, bear in mind, we did not impair the full amount of the Pathways goodwill for this exercise. So I want to be clear. We wrote off about 40% of their goodwill. So it's still a functioning business. From an operational point of view, we've had several challenges with that business. One challenge has been simply the retention of staff. Without the front-line client-facing psychologists and counselors, you can't build the revenue. So it's very much a business that's tied to your ability to retain individuals who can do the work to get you billed. The second issue we've run into in terms of Pathways related to that is we've had to increase various employee incentives, compensation related benefits, to retain staff for that very reason. And I think the third issue we're running in at Pathways, frankly, is some of the payors are becoming more demanding in terms of their reimbursement. The business has moved a little bit away from fee-for-service Medicaid, a little bit more to third-party payors, other insurance companies. And we've had a little bit of an issue adjusting to what they require in order for us to get reimbursed. So again, it's a good business. But those three issues I think, retaining staff, the admin costs in retaining the staff, and again, a shift of movement in terms of payor behavior have been a little bit challenging. Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks for the update. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking my question, squeezing me in here. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure, Dave. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Joe, I think before the Aetna-Humana deal break, the company had added some Medicare resources in anticipation of the divesture. And I wondered if Medicare was an area, one, of continued commitment, relative to earlier questions about Medicaid. And, second is that an area where maybe, because of those added costs prior, that might be a disproportionate area of cost reduction in your restructuring? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. We're still very enthusiastic about what I call the Medicaid adjacent Medicare space. The SNPs, the MMPs, those are just parts of the business where we continue to want to play. I don't have the full list in front of me, but we are moving into a few new geographies coming in 2018. The Medicare spend, while we're talking about ramping it up, it hasn't been astronomical by any stretch of the imagination. We'll weigh decisions like how much advertising we do and stuff like that. Let's see where we are in November and December. But I would say, in general, we remain enthusiastic about anything related to Medicare that in any way abuts the Medicaid space, and there's a lot of that. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: So I think overall it'll be positive. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then just one more on \u2013 you talk in the Restructuring about consolidation of regional support services. Not sure how significant that is, but I guess I would think that you would have to be running kind of the regional services in parallel with what, say, new centralized group you might build out. Could you talk about how you manage that in a non-disruptive fashion and what the cost implications are of that? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: That's a great question. When you talk about these kind of transitions, whether physically from one location to another, or just in terms of individuals assuming new duties, it has to be managed very carefully. What we're trying to do as we look at that is we're trying to look at health plans with similar characteristics. Initially, looking at this very simplistically, what I had in my head was you'd group everything geographically. And that's the way I looked at it. And the operations team spent some time with me and I think clearly demonstrated that it isn't about the geography. It's about the characteristics of the health plan. So, for example, a smaller health plan with essentially a TANF-type membership base, you want to group those together. The health plans with the more complex members, you probably want to group those together. You need to consider things like just management stability in a health plan, management capabilities. You need to consider where they are in their re-procurement cycle. So there's a lot of stuff to be considered as you create these regional capabilities. You also just want to make sure that your staff, again, have the right knowledge mix and capabilities mix. And that's a big part of what we're trying to do with our restructuring is make sure we attract and retain capable, highly motivated, highly talented people. So it needs to be done very carefully, but I think the key to it is look for the similarities that are not just obvious, like geography. And we've been very thoughtful about that. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thank you. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : All right. Thanks, Joe. Good luck. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your question. And our last question is a follow-up from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Hey. Thanks for accommodating me. I didn't want to hog my time earlier. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure, Ana. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : So, on the CEO search, it sounds like it'll be pretty quick. Do you think there's any chance that you might still consider exiting exchanges? And might that not mitigate your risk of having to raise equity or whatever? But the ratings agencies, it'll certainly kind of improve sentiment on the Street? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, I certainly think we are \u2013 we said in the call \u2013 or in the prepared remarks, Ana, all of the exchange participation is up in the air right now. As I like to say, with the company right now where we're at, we have to do what the numbers suggest to us. The numbers kind of tell us what to do. There is no doubt we do have a strategic advantage in the Marketplace with our Medicaid network. But I understand investor concern about the volatility of the Marketplace. We understand the frustration there. And essentially, we've exited two of our markets, and it's up in the air on the rest. We're going to look very closely at developments, particularly in the political area, over the next month or so. We've got until September 27, and we're taking a very hard look at that. So it would not surprise me if we had further exits. We'll just have to wait and see. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. One final one or just to follow up on that. When the state insurance commissioners are talking to you about all this, and they're equally concerned it sounds like on CSRs and everything, are they more focused on just your synergies and adjacencies, as you say, the Medicaid HMO? Does it put your Florida RFP or Illinois or anything else at risk? Or are they saying, hey, it's okay, 55% is so big that even under a stressed capital situation everything's going to be fine? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, I don't think anybody is going to explicitly link the retention of a Medicaid contract to staying in the Marketplace. Certainly we know that the departments of insurance we deal with, who do not control the Medicaid contracts by the way, nevertheless have an interest in the stable insurance market. They have a very difficult situation and that stable market, number one, is a balancing act of having insurers in the market, but also making sure those insurers have financial stability. In general, we have found the regulators very supportive of our situation. They, like us, though are sometimes caught between a rock and a hard place. And it's a case-by-case basis. We made the decision to exit Utah and Wisconsin. There may be more states. And again, we'll have to be guided, right now, by what is best for the company. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks so much. I really appreciate the color so late in the day. Juan Jos\u00e9 Orellana - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, thanks, everyone, for joining. That concludes our call for today, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thanks, everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We do thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, Juan Jos\u00e9, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. The results we reported this afternoon demonstrate that we are strengthening our business and positioning it for long-term success. While we still have much work ahead of us, our third quarter results demonstrate that we are moving in the right direction. Today we reported a net loss for the quarter of $1.70 per diluted share, but restructuring charges and impairment losses net of adjustments to our marketplace premium deficiency reserve amounted to $2.83 of that loss. If we look past those items, we can see that underlying operations show substantial improvement this quarter. I am pleased with the progress we have made on the restructuring initiatives we outlined last quarter. Once I have discussed our financial performance, I will provide more detail on those efforts. When I told you last quarter that we were taking aggressive, urgent and determined actions to improve our financial performance, the benefit of those actions was only potential in nature. Today we can point to the first actual measurable reductions in both medical and administrative costs. Let's start with medical costs. Our medical care ratio was 88.3% for the quarter, or 89% after we removed the benefit of a $30 million reduction to our marketplace premium deficiency reserve. To be clear, the medical care ratio for our core business, Medicaid and Medicare combined, remains unacceptably high at 91%. But we did see some meaningful sequential improvements in some of our most challenging markets, with Illinois, New Mexico, and Puerto Rico reflecting noticeable improvement since last quarter. Also as part of our restructuring effort, we are now refining medical cost improvement work streams that we believe will benefit our overall medical cost performance between now and the end of 2018. As with medical costs, general and administrative expenses are also moving in the right direction. Our general and administrative expense ratio of 7.6% for the third quarter of 2017 was 50 basis points lower than in the second quarter of 2017 and, if we adjust for the impact of higher marketplace enrollment, 30 basis points lower than in the third quarter of last year. Our marketplace performance also improved noticeably this quarter. In addition to the reduction in our marketplace premium deficiency reserve, we've benefited from other positive developments. Specifically, risk transfer is developing more favorably than we had expected and our 2017 premium increases are providing partial relief from the medical cost trend that has continued to rise faster than we expected at the start of the year. While these developments are indeed favorable, let me spend some time on the topic of cost sharing reductions subsidies, or CSRs, and their potential impact on 2017 and 2018 performance. First, I want to emphasize that our third quarter results do not include any impact from the recent decision by the federal government to cease payment of CSR subsidies. To be clear, this development may lead to an $85 million drag on fourth quarter pre-tax earnings. The key question is how CMS will perform the annual reconciliation of CSR payments. I need to explain that a little bit. As of September 30, we owed the federal government approximately $220 million for CSR subsidies already received this year. CMS has paid us about $515 million in subsidies, but we have only incurred about $295 million in related expenses. The remaining $220 million overpayment constitutes our liability at September 30. Second, we expect in the fourth quarter alone, we will incur another $85 million in unreimbursed expenses that were formally reimbursed by the federal government. Now, here is where the reconciliation process comes in. CMS reconciles the amount it pays to health plans for CSRs against the actual expenses incurred by those plans. This reconciliation is normally conducted over a full calendar year. If CMS keeps the same practice this year, our $220 million payable at September 30 will more than offset our fourth quarter expense and there will be no impact from the cessation of payments in the fourth quarter. But if CMS changes its practices and performs the 2017 reconciliation over a nine-month period ending September 30, our payable position at that date will not offset expenses incurred in the fourth quarter and we may experience an adverse impact of $85 million pre-tax. Please note that regardless of the reconciliation process, we believe that we are owed CSR payments as a matter of law and we are willing to pursue our rights in court, if necessary. For now, all we can do is wait for further news from CMS. Regarding the marketplace in 2018, there are two important points. First, 28 pricing in all of our markets is based on the assumption that CSR subsidies will not be funded by the federal government. And, second, we have already taken steps to limit our 2018 presence with the reduction of our Washington footprint and marketplace exits in Utah and Wisconsin. Turning back to our third quarter results. I mentioned impairment losses and restructuring costs as a large expense this quarter. We recorded $129 million, or about $1.77 per diluted share, in combined goodwill impairments for our Pathways Behavioral Health and Molina Medicaid Solutions subsidiaries. These are non-cash charges. We also recorded $118 million, or $1.39 per diluted share of restructuring cost. This expense includes about $50 million in additional non-cash charges for the write-off of capitalized software costs. It is important to remember that these charges are the result of the bold steps we are taking as a company to improve our performance. We look forward to moving past this stage in our process and emerging as a stronger, more profitable company. Now I would like to turn to an update on our restructuring efforts. Last quarter, we told you that we expect to reduce annualized run rate expenses by $300 million to $400 million in total by the end of 2018 and that we expected that approximately $200 million of those reductions will be achieved by the end of 2017. I am pleased to report that at the close of the third quarter, we believe that we have already reached our goal for 2017 and have lowered annualized run rate expenses by $200 million, which will be in full effect starting January 1, 2018. So that sums up the anticipated financial benefit of our efforts. Now I will talk about some of our specific work activities. You will recall that we are streamlining our organizational structure to improve the efficiency, speed and quality of decision making. Although we continue to adjust the organization as we learn and evolve, this task is now largely behind us. One result of this effort with a reduction in force of approximately 1,500 positions. We are redesigning core operating processes, such as Provider Payment, Utilization Management and Quality Improvement to achieve more effective and cost-efficient outcomes. While this effort will extend through 2018, we are already seeing improvements in some of our provider payment metrics regarding payment accuracy and inventory management. We are also remediating high-cost provider contracts and building networks around high-quality cost-effective providers. While this initiative will not show meaningful benefits until 2018, some successes have already been achieved. We are restructuring our direct delivery operations and have closed many of our clinics outside of California. We continue to evaluate the future status of our California direct delivery operation. Finally, we are reviewing our vendor base to ensure that we are partnering with the lowest-cost, most-effective vendors. As with the remediating the high-cost provider contracts, we do not expect meaningful results from this part of our plan until 2018, but progress is already being made. All of these initiatives are operational and incremental in nature. They require changes in process and culture rather than new technology or ideas. We are on a path that has been traveled by other organizations before, which gives us confidence in our ultimate success. We do not expect to see our full restructuring plan benefit until 2019, but we are already seeing some of those benefits. We estimate that the restructuring plan increased income before taxes by approximately $10 million in the third quarter of 2017. Of course, we continue to take precautions to ensure that our actions do not impede our ability to deliver quality health care to our members, secure new managed care contracts and retain existing contracts. Moving to other topics. At September 30, days and claims payable were up four days sequentially to 50 days. Cash on hand at the parent company was approximately $390 million at September 30, and we have about $200 million available through our credit facility. We took the opportunity in the third quarter to modify certain definitions in our credit facility so that we can incur the cost of our restructuring program without tripping financial covenants. We will continue to monitor our cash needs and act upon any financing needs as we deem necessary. So, to sum up our performance this quarter, while there is much left to be done, we are making good progress, we remain a company in transition and we will emerge from this process as a stronger company, proud of our heritage, focused on our mission and eager to embrace the new future. We look forward to welcoming Joe Zubretsky to the company this coming Monday, November 6. As Joe takes Molina forward into its next chapter, he will shape the future of our company with the support of thousands of superb, dedicated and determined employees. Our future is indeed compelling and exciting. Alex, this concludes our prepared remarks and we can take questions now. QUESTION AND SESSION SECTION Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi. Thanks. Good evening. So, the first question is... Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Hi, Ana. How are you? Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Good. Thank you. How are you, Joe? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Good. Juan Jos\u00e9 Orellana - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: So, the first question is \u2013 and it's encouraging to see that you are at least sequentially improving your loss ratios in some of the Medicaid \u2013 the state Medicaid books. So, can you talk about some of the changes that have happened sequentially and, still, you have issues in some of your books like California and all what's going on there? Where is it that you've seen underlying improvement and why? And where is it that you're not? And how does this become a systematically improved kind of consistent Medicaid result on the base book? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure, Ana. Let me say \u2013 that's a lot to talk about. I'll do my best. Let me first emphasize that we clearly understand here we have a long way to go. The process of bringing the company to a focus on successful growth and profitability with the emphasis on profitability first is a process which takes time. It involves some cultural shifts. It involves changes into a lot of practices we have. It involves a greater focus on things like capital allocation. Nevertheless though, much of what we have in front of us to improve our financial performance is what I would call basic blocking and tackling. I think you can see the impact of some of the basic actions in what's been happening in this previous quarter, in the third quarter, because the initial aspects of our restructuring plan have been much more about organization and staffing. What we're seeing helping the health plans, I think, right now in this third quarter is just a benefit of having new management teams and a handful of our most problematic health plans. In Puerto Rico, Illinois and New Mexico, we spoke to earlier in the year about how we had to swap out leadership teams. Those leadership teams have had some time to get established and I think just do some basic management, which is helping us. Now, again, these aren't fixing every underlying problem we have. That's going to be for the future. And Joe Zubretsky is going to be a big help in that. But I think what we're just seeing is, is the benefits of just a general focus on more business-centric practices. I also think in the Medicare, Medicaid plans, we are seeing some rather pleasing utilization trends which are helping us. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Just one follow-up, if I could ask; on the workflow production... Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : ... and the systems. Are there any system changes that you're likely to undertake? Or is it within the existing systems you can just change your processes around medical management? What is the path or the glide path to that 1.5% to 2% margin? And how long is this going to take with what you've done so far diagnostically? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, taking that in reverse, we haven't tied a year to that kind of profitability level. We obviously hope to get there and we hope eventually exceed it. But we haven't tied a year to that profitability level you're talking about, Ana. What I will say, though, about the systems issues is, what we are finding through this process is that many of our challenges are process-related, culture-related, not necessarily tool-related. So, for example, we operate on the QNXT HMO platform. That's a fine platform. There's no need to change that. We just need to find ways to utilize that more effectively. Hardware is hardware; pipes are pipes from an IT perspective. We're adequately resourced there. There are some areas, utilization management being one, where we are in the process of installing a new system. But, in general, again, I would just say that the issue isn't so much our systems, it's how we use our technology to achieve a desired business outcome. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Thank you. That's really helpful color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Good evening, guys. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Hey, Justin. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : So, first question is just on the medical cost payable. I was looking at that line versus the second quarter. It looks like it's up about 20% or about $400 million sequentially. And when you take that and you combine it with flat sequential premiums, I don't think I've ever seen anything like that in terms of magnitude of change. Just wondering if you could tell us what drove that and maybe share what's increased conservatism given the previous issues seen versus maybe actual trends seen in the quarter. What are the drivers there? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: It's a good question, Justin. I would start by pointing out that we've obviously had some challenges this year in terms of adverse out-of-period claims development. That's made us a little bit more cautious than we would normally be in terms of our reserve setting. If you look at our claims payable roll-forward from December of 2016, you'll see we actually had some further adverse development this quarter, not nearly as much as last quarter, but nevertheless, had a little bit of adverse development. So, we think it's just appropriate right now to be a little bit more cautious on our reserve setting. In some respects, medical utilization trends do look like they're moving in the right direction. I mentioned Medicare and the MMP plans a minute ago. But we do have other states where the trends are not so favorable. So, without going overboard, we're just trying to strike a cautious tone given where we've been the last year. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Got it. And then just you mentioned that I think you're up about $90 million sequentially in parent cash. First, is that correct? And then second, how should we think about the major inflows and outflows over, let's say, the next three months, six months, nine months, and when you'd have dividends available to come up from the subsidiaries and stabilize that cash position? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, if you think of how the parent company of a collection of regulated subsidiaries operates, essentially the parent can only be supplied, other than from external funds, by its regulated subsidiaries. The flow of cash to the parent comes in two forms; it can come in dividends as you mentioned. It also comes in the form of reimbursement of expenses incurred by the parent on behalf of the subsidiaries. So, with a few exceptions, nearly all of our parent's cash expenses are reimbursed by the subsidiaries through management service agreements filed with the various Departments of Insurance. So, again, most of the operating expenses, including cash interest payments of the parent, are paid for by the subsidiaries. The other source of cash for the parent, again, is dividends. We can ask for a dividend from a state at any time in which the state exceeds, the health plan exceeds, its required net worth requirements. Generally, though that's a process at work required regulatory approval, generally through the Department of Insurance. So that's an activity we engage on during the course of the year and generally just as we find as we come to believe that subsidies are perhaps overfunded. The pattern of that can vary. I wouldn't tie it to any kind of seasonal pattern or anything. It's just something you go out and pursue, again, when you think a subsidiary is overfunded. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Got it. Thanks for all the details, guys. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Getting back to sort of the first question. You saw the big improvement in the medical loss ratio, sequentially about 650 basis points. We know there's some one-time things in there, like the hurricane savings perhaps or maybe clinic closings causing people to have to find new doctors or whatever. But what other things are in there that are sort of one-time in nature that maybe made that quarter, third quarter, so much better than we saw in the second quarter? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, to be clear, Peter, I'm not aware of any disruption to our members' care off of the clinic closings. We make every effort to make sure that our members do indeed have physicians they can see as needed in a convenient manner. So, I'm not aware of any disruption there. You mentioned the weather. I should say that if we think the impact of the very difficult experiences in Puerto Rico in September, and our heart goes out to everyone on the Island, experiences in Puerto Rico in September, probably reduced medical care expense for the quarter by between $4 million and $5 million. The medical cost impacts of the events in Florida and Houston, which were very sad too, as far as we can tell, had very little impact on our medical cost trend. They were more or more short-term in duration. And it appears as if those communities were able to recover faster. So, if we look at hurricane impact between Irma, Harvey and Maria, probably $4.5 million to $5 million reduced medical costs for the quarter. There were other aspects of the financial performance that I think we would call out in the quarter. One, we did not have the degree of adverse claims development in Q3 that we experienced in Q2. We also had some more favorable developments in terms of marketplace risk adjustment, which resulted in increased revenue, which has the same effect of lowering our medical cost. There are certain states, Puerto Rico, Illinois and New Mexico come to mind, where, again, I think our new management teams are starting to get their feet on the ground and they're starting to make a difference in performance. And then lastly, again, the Medicare and Medicare, Medicaid plans, there've been some favorable trends there all year that I think for the first time this quarter we saw in our financial statements. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Just as a follow-up, on you quantify the adverse claim development change from Q2 to Q3 and the risk adjustment change from Q2 to Q3? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: As far as the adverse development impact, if you look our roll-forward table in the back of the earnings release, you'll see that at second quarter we were looking at favorable development of about $31 million. We've shifted to unfavorable development of about $9 million, so that's about a $40 million swing there. The risk adjustment piece as far as Medicaid is a little bit harder to tease out. I'm checking my notes here as we speak. I would think it's probably in the \u2013 bear with me here since you asked, sorry. Probably on the CSR side for benefit probably in the neighborhood of $60 million to $70 million. I'm sorry, for the risk transfer, probably in the \u2013 I'm sorry \u2013 bad number there. In terms of risk transfer, probably in the neighborhood of an $80 million pick-up. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then just back to the roll-forward table for a second. So, risk adjustment got worse, is that what you're saying as opposed to better? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: No, risk adjustment is not affected by the roll-forward table. I would say that the relative risk score of our members as we got assessments from various third-party players, Wakely Consulting comes to mind, indicates that our members' risk scores are relatively higher to the population than we had thought. So, the outflow... Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Then maybe I misunderstood. Is the adverse claim development then what got worse? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Correct. That's correct. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : From 2Q to 3Q? So, that actually was a negative impact. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. But the swing itself from quarter-to-quarter was not as great in Q3 as Q2. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: All right. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you and congratulations on the quarter, reaching your initial savings one quarter early and improvement in many MLR lines. Against that positive backdrop, a few items stood out. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Right. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: First on ABD MLR, can you tell us if there was any contract pressuring that? And then second was DCP increase. Should we think of that as related to some of the more conservative reserving strategy, changes to its adjudication, timeline from restructuring efforts or is there something broader going on because your peers had all posted DCP increases as well? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I think the first question on the ABD development for the quarter, the only thing that sticks in my mind as far as ABD is some adjustments we had to go back in California related to certain long-term care benefits that required a true-up on premium rates from California. So, we took a little bit of a hit for that. That's the only thing that really comes to mind on ABD unique. It's tended to run a pretty high MCR lately. And Sarah, I didn't really understand your second question. You broke up there a little bit. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Sure. Sorry Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: After ABD... Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Yeah, there was a days claims payable increase. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Correct. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: And I'm just wondering if that's related to the more conservative reserving strategy, adjudication timing changing from restructuring, or if it's broader because your peers also saw a DCP increase this quarter? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I think, certainly, the timing of certain activity, particularly in Puerto Rico, where we have a claims shop, I think certainly there were some slower payments that added a little bit of that increase to days claims payable. But, in general, the increase in days claims payable just reflects a more conservative posture to our reserves. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got it. And last, if I could, just thinking about sources and uses of cash, in the release, you commented on Pathways and MMIS not providing as much benefit to health plans. Is it possible that you could consider strategic alternatives for these businesses or is it still something that you feel Molina needs to own? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: A lot of that, Sarah, is going to have to shake out of further engagement in terms of our restructuring plan. And frankly, Joe Zubretsky is going to have to come in here and look at the entire company and make decisions about that. I would just say for now that those are indeed viable companies with established revenue streams and I would say business propositions that are attractive. What we've struggled with and, particularly, as we've engaged in our restructuring over the last six months, we've come to realize that some of the synergies we were hoping to realize in our health plan business from those benefits are not necessarily materializing. Again, though, that doesn't mean that they are without value as businesses. They are, again, very successful businesses in their own right, and we'll have to assess just about every aspect of this business as we improve operations and continue with our restructuring plan. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. So, this quarter looks pretty good, but it really kind of forces me to go back to some of the questions I was asking last quarter about the decision around cutting G&A. Because when I think about this quarter, it kind of reminds me of normal Molina where you would see a couple of quarters in a row of blowout numbers and then a couple of quarters of misses and then you kind of go back and forth. And really looking forward is not only improved MLR, but also stability in MLR. So, I guess, when you think about the G&A savings number that you're targeting of $200 million, is there any way to put some sort of different spin on it as far as maybe is the number really $300 million, but you're reinvesting $100 million? Is there something else? Or I mean how do I think about that? Because it is hard for me to get my head around having this volatility in MLR from quarter-to-quarter and then cutting G&A and expecting to get a better result at the same time. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, to be clear, we definitely understand that one quarter doesn't set a trend. And I think we've been at pains to say this is \u2013 we're far from satisfied with these results. And this is a process to building a stable and more profitable company. Much of what we're trying to do, though, in terms of the restructuring plan, even when we talk about our reorganization is to develop clearer lines of communication, clearer accountabilities and responsibilities so that we can act and react in a more facile manner. So, I think building an organization and a culture more focused on profitability and more focused on operations is a key to the kind of stability you're talking about. One great example of that is we've spoken about challenges we've had in provider payment processing. Uncertainties in that area make it difficult to operate the company always in a predictable manner. So, the restructuring effort, which has a substantial medical cost component, you just haven't seen it yet, because much of that takes more time to develop, is an attempt to develop that more profitable company. I can only say, though, honestly, nothing is going to prove success like success. And we're going to have to put in multiple quarters of satisfactory performance to evidence that we're the kind of company we need to be. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So, I guess it sounds like what you're saying is a lot of things that you want to achieve don't necessarily require a specific investment as far as... Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, there's are pretty hefty \u2013 and we don't have our 10-Q out now, but if you look at our 10-Q from second quarter, there's a pretty hefty investment there and that investment, you can see, carries over to up to $40 million of investment in Q4 in 2018. So, there's definitely investment there. It is not though, again, this process is not about bringing in all new tools that are going to miraculously help us run the business. It's about changing how we do things and our culture and our attitudes toward accountability and profitability. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then I guess when we think about the $200 million number, when I think to get to $200 million, $400 million, the other $100 million to $200 million is more on the medical cost side, if I remember correctly. Juan Jos\u00e9 Orellana - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Correct. It would be \u2013 go ahead. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : How do we think about the starting point for both of those numbers? I mean, is there like a core G&A number, I guess, that you're saying where we're going to save $200 million off of this base number. And then, I guess, maybe we could just say a $100 million to $200 million would be 50 basis points or 100 basis points to MLR? I guess that might be the other way to think about MLR. Is that what we see at MLR? And then I guess is there a G&A number base that we should be starting off with to apply the $200 million to? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, we haven't give any guidance for 2018. But I think the best way to look at this is we talk about these in terms of run rate reductions. So, I think as you try to model what you can expect in 2018 and 2019, you should probably look toward 2016 and first half of 2017 performance. Because we really saw our first actual savings from the restructuring plan in this quarter, third quarter. So, I think, again, you would look to 2016 and the first half of 2017. That's the run rate we're comparing to. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Last question. I guess WellCare took a PDR as far as Illinois goes. Any thoughts there for you? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, I can't speak to their situation. We feel good about, or at least good enough, about our position in the Illinois bid that we don't feel it's necessary to record a PDR at this time. We've bid right around the midpoint of the rates offered. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Great. thanks. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Christine Arnold with Cowen & Co. Please proceed with your question. Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi there. The 2018 marketplace footprint, you're existing few markets going back in some. Overall, do you expect to grow your membership next year? And how do we think about the potential profitability shift now that you've seen where you stand relative to others? And you did bid assuming the CSRs would be in? Thanks. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, a couple of points on that. Again, we haven't given 2018 guidance. But I think we've been pretty clear in communicating that the exits in Wisconsin and Utah, the curtailments in Washington and the rate increases that we put out for the remaining markets, which are about 30% before the adjustment that assume no funding of CSR, so about a 58% blended rate increase, I would expect that our membership in marketplace is going to drop considerably next year. As far as CSR the impact in rates and everything. As I said, all of our rates assume that CSRs are not funded. So, we should have some protection there. Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC: And given the movement in the risk-adjusted, $80 million this year. I assume that was related to 2017, right, because it was in the third quarter? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: No. No. No. It was movement from one quarter to another, yeah. Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. So that was inter-year. So, what is your expectation for individual profitability this year? And can I assume that it'll improve from that level next year given the way you bid? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: We think overall as we look pure period basis for this year, we're still not approaching what we had in pricing. We're quite a ways from it. Hopefully, with the rate increases next year, we obviously price with the intent that we will be profitable. That doesn't obviously guarantee profits, as we've seen in 2016 and 2017. And we'll have to see how everything plays out with that regard. Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC: Do you have a revised 2017 public exchange or individual loss assumption for this year given the movement you've seen? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: No. We've pulled guidance last quarter. Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. One last question, you talked... Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC: ...about prior year development. Did you have any prior quarter development in this quarter? Or that maybe you makes us think if the first half was perhaps better than you'd reported. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: There's always an element of development from the prior quarter. But, again, I wouldn't read too much into that. I didn't see anything really surprising. Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please proceed with your question. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research : Thanks. Good evening, guys. Just first question around the big payable boost. I guess the question would be, what was the catalyst for that? Why this quarter and not last quarter? Was there some sort of external consulting review done? And then was this a sort of one-time catch up and you now feel as though with another $400 million going through the income statement you're there? Or is this a process by which over time you're going to get to sort of that new targeted level, be it more conservative? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I would describe it, Josh, it's just more a reaction to the facts and circumstances of the position we found ourselves in as we closed the books on September 30. To be clear, days and claims payable I understand is a very valuable quick and dirty measure for outsiders to the company. We've never targeted a certain days and claims payable. I think I would just say that in general given the experiences we've had with the prior-period development, earlier in this year we just thought it was prudent to be a little bit more cautious in our reserving. I don't think I can commit to anything in terms of philosophy beyond that. We've always tried to set an appropriate reserve level. Most times, we've succeeded. It just so happens that at 12/31/2016 was one of those rare circumstances where we were indeed under-reserved, as you can see in the roll-forward table. And we're just reacting to that. It doesn't, though, reflect any sort of outside engagement or any sort of master plan as far as where we want to move reserves, though. We want reserves, it's outlined in our 10-Q, we seek to set reserves that are 8% to 10% in excess of the ultimate run out. Sometimes you miss though, and I guess you could say we're catching up. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research : Okay. So that 8% to 10%, that was sort of my next follow-up. So, the 8% to 10% hasn't necessarily changed and there wasn't some sort of... Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Correct. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research : ...consulting actuary that came in. It's just you guys have a different view of what 8% to 10% looks like now. Is that the idea? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yep, that'd be a fair statement. We set the reserves and again we usually run out a little bit better than that. Obviously in 2016 with 2017 activity, bluntly we miss by a country mile. So, we just need to reset reserves and try to get to the level, in effect restore margin. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research : Okay. And then just more of a strategic question. I know the board's been undergoing strategic reviews. And you now have named as CEO and I know Joe starts next week. Should we think about more to come on that, or did the board do their analysis, think the restructuring and the hiring of an experienced CEO like Joe Zubretsky is the answer? Or is that process still ongoing? Where are we in that strategic review? Juan Jos\u00e9 Orellana - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I would express it this way. I don't think there's ever been much doubt, and today, I would say there is no doubt, that the company is strategically positioned in the right place. We think being Medicaid-focused and then playing in certain Medicaid adjacencies is a very sound strategy. We also think that the company has not always performed from an operational level the way it should have. So we think operationally, the basic blocking and tackling, we just need to be able to do better. Among many other skills, Joe has substantial skills in that area of operation. So, he can provide a lot of help in that way. But, Josh, I would describe the strategy again as play in Medicaid, play in related adjacencies, MMP plans, SNP plans, perhaps some degree in the marketplace. But play in Medicaid, focus on Medicaid and excel in operations. And that's the path forward for us. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research : So, I guess I was thinking more on asset base than overall corporate strategy. And I mean there was question earlier about Pathways and the MMS business. I don't know if there are certain health plans that may be suited better in others' hands. I meant more of a repositioning of the assets. Is there more to go on that one as opposed to shift away from Medicaid or something like that? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah, I think the focus right now, Josh, is operations and improving operations. As I said with MMS and Pathways, they have businesses in their own right that are good businesses. We always look at that. But right now I think it's fair to say that we don't have any major strategic directions. We've always believed in being a geographically diverse HMO. We need to do that because we are so focused on Medicaid. So, I don't think there's any grand re-strategization of the company in mind. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research : Okay. Perfect. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Zack Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Zachary W. Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. And congratulations on the quarter. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you. Zachary W. Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I wanted to ask first about renewals. Given the amount of changes with the company and within the local leaderships, as you've described, how is your renewal pipeline looking? And then, with that, the RFP pipeline opportunities over the next year or so? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, sure. I think the progress so far and the outcome so far in contract renewals have been very gratifying. In early June, we won a rebate of a substantial region in Washington. In July, we won as a new entrant in Mississippi. Then in late July, we won in a rebid in Illinois that involved a geographic expansion. So, again, I think overall, we're feeling good about our ability to retain contracts. We focus on it, we pay attention to it every day and we understand how important that revenue stream is. There is a table in our 10-Q from last quarter that speaks to upcoming rebids. Florida has we've just submitted a response to an RFP there. New Mexico, we've submitted a response to an RFP there. We feel very good about our responses. We feel very good about our relationships with providers and regulators and communities and, most importantly, members in those two states, Florida and New Mexico. So, we'll have to see how they play out, but we feel good about that. Next up is going to be RFP activity in Texas. We've also bid as a new entrant in Virginia. We should hear about that soon. Following Texas, there'll probably be activity next year in Washington. And then we hope some expansions into the LTSS, Long-Term Services and Support markets in Ohio and Michigan. So we have a pretty strong pipeline now, I think a rather rich pipeline. We've also so far been very successful in retaining contracts and we're optimistic about the future. Zachary W. Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. Sticking with the change theme and maybe a little bit more on the internal looking side. You may have gone through a lot of changes obviously in leadership and the way you operate and sounds like in the strategy going forward. Having gone through a reduction in force, which is never easy for anybody, can you just talk about morale in general, how retention is internally and how maybe the company is looking forward to this change? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, I will say one thing that I've always believed about Molina, but it's certainly been brought home to me over the last six months. We are blessed to have a very dedicated, very committed, very focused workforce. The last six months have indeed been a time of great change, and, frankly, a degree of pain. The combination of the staff reductions along with what's happened in Texas and Florida and Puerto Rico, have created enormous challenges for our staff. But I think morale is very high. Our staff remains focused. They're doing their jobs. You always have to work hard to retain your people. But I don't think statistics show we're seeing any kind of major departure of people. I think, in general, the morale of the staff is high and I think they understand that that focusing a little bit more on profitability, focusing on crisper operations is the path to the long-term success of our company. Zachary W. Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks for the questions. Just wanted to sort of get your sense on the poor performance in the marketplace. Because when I look at the reported MCR in the tables in the back of the press release, even if I normalize that for the PDR, it doesn't look that bad. I guess I'm just trying to get a sense for where things are trending relative to what you expected coming into the year at this point? Thanks. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure, Chris. They are certainly not favorable compared to the pricing we put out for 2017 and the expectations. I'd also remind you that Q4 is traditionally a very rough quarter in this business. You do have to be careful too, understand there's a pretty substantial admin load on marketplace. So, the incremental admin load from brokerage commission and exchange fees can be in the neighborhood of 12%, 13%. So, the MCRs need to be low to be able to support the business, frankly, comparatively low to Medicaid. I guess what I would say on the favorable aspect of marketplace right now; special enrollment is decreased compared to where it was last year. You'll recall that we, like every health plan, we really experienced adverse selection with special enrollment last year. It's too soon to know the full cost trends obviously of the third and certainly the fourth quarter. But, again, we're seeing lower special enrollment in terms of numbers. I think that's helpful. And frankly, I think in some degrees, we have benefited a little bit from our relative size in terms of the risk adjustment pool. Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then just changing gears a little bit, if you do see a substantial decline in the ACA enrollment next year, do you have a health insurer fee problem, just sort of an unencumbered membership problem that this could be an unusually large drag next year although albeit sort of one-time in nature? Thanks. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I wouldn't necessarily call it a problem. I think it's a reality. Any insurer that experiences a decline in enrollment is going to pay a relatively higher ACAP in the following year. A couple of points that are going to mitigate that for us; the first one is, is while enrollment we expect to drop for us, we're also going to be raising rates. So, our relative share of the market in that respect won't be dropping that much. We've built the ACAP into the new rates. So, we'll receive a little bit of a relief there. But, yeah, I think, in general, there is a little bit of a headwind from just I guess I would say a retroactive or a retrospective impact to the ACAP. Yes. Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good afternoon. A couple questions. I hate to come back to this reserving, but I do want to start there.... Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : ...to make sure I understand it. So the reserve is up about $400 million sequentially. $200 million of that's in the other category, which is passthroughs that don't impact your P&L as I understand it. And it looks like it's up \u2013 the IBNR is up about a couple hundred million sequentially. So, if that's mostly conservatism, that's $2 a share, that's 500 basis points of MLR. So, are you suggesting that ex-charges, without that conservatism, the earnings this quarter could have been $2 higher? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, I wouldn't express it that way at all because for the simple reason, again, as we rebuild margin, yes, we are trying to be cautious. But your question presupposes that the smaller number of reserves is indeed the right number. So, honestly, I can't agree with that necessarily, Gary. Again, I would say that there are \u2013 there's a pass-through effect, there's also some issues on timing of payment, what we saw with Puerto Rico. There's some delay in payment. And that seems to me to be a dangerous supposition you're making. I'll just say that. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then if we look at the roll-forward table, the claims payed relative to the current year in the current period dropped about $150 million sequentially. Should that give us some indication of what the timing element could be? Or is it just too many moving parts with the risk adjustment changes and so forth that... <: Well, I don't think risk adjustment would impact that. I would say, though, that when I just penciled out the impact, because I thought we might be asked on days and claims payable from timing differences, I thought it was probably somewhere between a half and three-quarters of a day of the DCP increase, if that helps. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I'll think about it. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: We can always talk later. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Thanks. Just two more quick ones. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I missed the first five minutes so just refer me to the transcript if I missed this. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : But when we look at the Chip MLR trend up 250 bps in the first quarter 210 bps in the 2Q and now down 170 bps year-over-year. I've heard you talk about just obviously more favorable utilization trends. But is there anything else that moves that TANF MLR trend so materially in your favor this quarter, just outside what you're seeing on utilization? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Bear with me; I'm flipping to that page. I would just point to what I spoke to when you particularly think of where we have heavy TANF and SHP membership proportionally, it would be Puerto Rico, it would be Illinois and a fair amount in New Mexico. And, again, those health plans are performing better. I think the shorthand answer to why they're performing better right now is simply better local management teams that have had time to get their feet on the ground. So certainly, though, the improvement in Puerto Rico and Illinois would be more dramatically reflected in TANF. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Last question. I want to make sure I'm thinking about the cadence of the savings correctly. So, you've realized this run rate of $200 million, so that's $50 million a quarter. Only $10 million was realized in this quarter, so that means you should see $40 million pre-tax just in a vacuum sequential pickup in the 4Q from this... Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : No, you need to think about that many of those costs, the benefit is not going to be realized until January, starting January of next year. So, various people are still working wrapping up their work, transitioning assignments and things like that. So, you should really think about all of our savings, predominately the number of our savings not starting until next year. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And of the $200 million, have you told us how much is G&A versus medical? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: We spoke a little bit about that. The bulk of the $200 million right now is staffing reductions. And I would bet the split in those staffing reductions between medical and admin is probably between medical and admin it's probably, $65 million admin, $35 million medical. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Just a few clarifications left. Joe, if I take the $30 million reduction in PDR and the $80 million risk adjustment benefit that you highlighted in recalc MLR, I get something in the neighborhood of 210 basis points higher. I wondered if you agreed with that. That's kind of leaving you aside of your conversation you just had with Gary on the claims increases. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, I know the impact of the risk adjustment was basically 70 bps. So, from 83 bps to 89 bps if you take out the benefit of the risk adjustment. I think we have the Tables in the back. It's a little difficult to do that calculation on the fly. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Juan Jos\u00e9 Orellana - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: But you've got the stuff in the back, so we can talk later. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : You said risk adjustment was $80 million, right? Risk adjustment is $80 million. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: That's correct. That's correct. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Yeah. And so then from a question on exchange and the shrinkage in exchange, broadening the question out from not just the health insurer fee but just other stranded cost-type thought process. And has that been contemplated in your restructuring? Ae you already taking costs out in anticipation of the reduction in the individual book? Or should we think about some amount of negative leverage beyond health insurer fee calculation? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, there will indeed be a degree of negative leverage for the drop-in of the size that is possible. Our general rule of thumb is that once you take out obviously broker commissions and exchange fees fall off right away. So, there's a lot of admin activity that takes care of itself. But we are aware of the possibility there's going to be some admin cost stranded as a result of that, and we're looking closely at that right now. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : And that would be over and above the numbers that you're talking about in the $200 million and $400 million? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Correct, correct. Because that's going to have to be pulled out of, for profitability reasons, yes. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Yeah. Okay. And then final question. It sounds like you're comfortable with not taking a PDR relative to Illinois. Do you have an expectation around the change in, call it, wallet size that you will end up with Illinois? Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: That's a really tough number to model right now because there's been some changes since the award was originally granted in Cook County in particular I think, which is creating some more competition. So, we don't really know that number yet. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And we have no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call back to you. Joseph W. White - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, thanks to everyone for joining and listening. We appreciate your interest in Molina Healthcare, and we'll be talking to you soon. Thank you so much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

This call is being recorded and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available at our company's website, molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joseph Zubretsky : Thank you, Ryan, and thank you all for joining us this morning. This quarter's results reflect a significant transition we are undertaking here at Molina. The disappointing contract losses in New Mexico and Florida, and the related goodwill impairment charges, the continued expenses for restructuring and the cash up adjustments related to the poor performing marketplace business are all legacy issues that we believe are now behind us. The performance of the core business however, which we define as a Medicaid and Medicare was respectable and when viewed on a run rate and full year basis provide a solid baseline from which to achieve our margin recovery and sustainability plan. We are squarely focused on improving our operating margins and creating an earnings profile that is less volatile and more sustainable. Only when we have accomplished this, we'll be able to reap the full benefits of this franchise, with its strong revenue base, across well diversified geographies and product lines. This morning, I will be discussing the sustainability of our revenue base, the key operating and financial results from the fourth quarter and the full-year and connecting them to our 2018 preliminary guidance, and to the vision that I provided at a presentation to investors last month. First, with respect to the disappointing news related to the re-procurement of our Florida Medicaid contract, we are taking urgent and focused actions to secure this revenue base. Today, we operate in 8 of 11 regions throughout Florida, serving approximately 350,000 Medicaid members, with $1.5 billion of annualized revenue. The entire state is currently up for re-procurement, effective January 1, 2019. As we announced last week, we have been selected to negotiate to the award of a managed care contract in only one region of the state, that region, Region 11 comprises Miami-Dade at Monroe County, where we currently serve 59,000 Medicaid members. This outcome posted significant challenges, as a first step, we will do our best to secure contract at Region 11. Beyond that we will pursue the various protested appeals as appropriate. In New Mexico, we were surprised last month that the state chose not to invite us into the next round of the re-procurement process. Our New Mexico health plan has a long history of offering high quality service to our members. Upon review of the procurement materials made available, we have concluded that our re-procurement loss was primarily based on the rating factor in the bid and not the service aspect of the bid. With that back in mind, we are currently working to the appeals process in an effort to retain this business. That said, if the current decisions regarding our Medicaid participation in either Florida or New Mexico stand, they would have a significant negative impact to the company's revenue. Although our Florida and New Mexico health plans have been unprofitable in 2017, to say that their loss is therefore not challenging, would ignore the more significant issue. The lost opportunity of returning those health plans to profitability is of serious concern. Our plan with respect to Florida and New Mexico is as follows. First, it is critical that we manage our 2018 operations in both states to achieve our 2018 plan. We will launch the appropriate protested appeals necessary to ensure that we have exhausted every avenue available to us for retaining these contracts. If the outcome of these RFPs proves to be unsuccessful, we will transition our operations in an orderly fashion and in a financially responsible way and then we will adjust our cost structure accordingly to mitigate any percentage margin impact on the consolidated enterprise. The long-term headwind therefore is not against our target margin percentage, but against the absolute value of operating profit we can achieve. We are particularly sensitive to this situation, as we prepare for two other near terms re-procurements, Texas and Washington where we will compete vigorously to win. We have always taken major steps to improve our RFP response process to better articulate and present the Molina value proposition. First, we have marshaled more internal and external resources to support both efforts. We have engaged a broader and deeper array of very senior subject matter experts, clinical, operational, regulatory and financials. We have infused more local market knowledge into the process and we have retained outside experts in Medicaid procurement to pre-score our proposals and conduct marked reviews. While this may sound like we are blocking and tackling, it is precisely these technical qualities that are the foundation for successful bid. The combination of a well-executed proposal leverage with our deep community ties and long history of quality servicing in these states and our two recent wins in Washington give us confidence in successful outcomes. Now turning back to our earnings, we reported a net loss for the quarter of $4.59 per diluted share and $9.07 for the full year. Looking more deeply into these unacceptable headline numbers, I would like to call out three important dimensions of our fourth quarter and full year performance. First, we incurred $342 million for the quarter and $704 million for the full year of impairment and restructuring cost. Second, we experienced poor marketplace performance as demonstrated by a quarterly medical care ratio of 102.1% for the fourth quarter and 88.1% for the full year. Our product that should run at 78% or below based on 2017 pricing. Finally, looking over the entire year and stripping away a number of legacy items, we were able to develop a clear view of the underlying earnings base of our core business. I would characterize that underlying earnings base as stable. Allow me to spend a little more time in each of these dimensions. First, the impairment charges were the result of the unfortunate combination of expensive legacy acquisitions giving rise to significant intangible assets and the unsuccessful re-procurements relating to those same geographies. Relatedly, the restructuring charges were the result of the company growing its cost structure beyond its profit capability and this lack of discipline has now been corrected with improved monitoring and control. Second, with respect to the marketplace, we have taken significant actions to improve performance in 2018, as well as to reduce our overall exposure to this business. Specifically, we had implemented premium increases averaging 59% effective January 1, 2018. Those premium increases included a 20% increase for the absence of federal funding of CSR subsidies and a further 39% increase for medical cost trend anti-selection risk, demographics and a variety of other rating factors. These price increases along with our market exists in Utah and Wisconsin have resulted in substantially lower membership. So in response to our marketplace challenges, we have increased premium rate significantly, eliminated our exposure to uncertainties around CSR funding and reconciliation and priced up with the full expectation we will reduce our overall membership. Finally, the fourth quarter performance in our core business was respectable. Our medical care ratio excluding marketplace, declined 210 basis points to 88.8% when compared to the third quarter of 2017, reflecting decrease inpatient utilization as compared to the third quarter. This improvement was achieved despite an increase in flu related cost estimated to be $20 million. Looking at 2017 on a full year basis, it is important to remember that our medical care ratio of 90.6% is burdened by substantial unfavorable out of period or nonrecurring items. These include approximately $150 million of unfavorable prior period claims development and another $90 million of unfavorable marketplace items, most notably the lack of CSR reimbursement in the fourth quarter. Absent these items, our medical care ratio for 2017 would have been approximately 89.3%. In that context, I would like to provide some commentary on our core business portfolio. Looking at our core business by product line for the full year 2017, TANF represented approximately 40% of our total Medicaid revenue and had a medical care ratio of 92%, which was above our 2017 target of approximately 90%. Improving profitability for this product will require more effective utilization controls and care management, particularly with respect to High-Risk Pregnancy, reducing unit costs of high cost providers and more effective rate efficacy. Our Aged, Blind and Disabled product represents approximately 37% of our total Medicaid revenue, and had a medical care ratio of 94.7% for the full year. As oppose to our 2017 target of approximately 91%. Keys to improving ABD performance include, improved care management in coordination of services for high acuity populations focusing on the integration of behavioral and physical health services, targeting high risk members for care management intervention and more comprehensive documentation of medical conditions and improved management of community and other long-term care services for members in this product line. Expansion represented 23% of our total Medicaid revenue and at a medical care ratio of 84.9%, which was above our 2017 target of approximately 83%. Expansion continues to contribute favorably to our overall profitability and was responsible for approximately 40% of our total Medicaid medical margin for 2017. While premiums and margins for expansion have been declining in recent years, the rating environment appears to have stabilized. States generally look at rate adequacy holistically across all of Medicaid. Strategically this product may be an important companion product to our marketplace business as certain states contemplate merging the two markets. In 2017, Medicare and MMP combined generated approximately $2 billion of revenue, and had a medical care ratio of 88.4%, which was below our 2017 target of approximately 92%. These products are important because they present opportunities for the integration of care, on an even more comprehensive basis that is the case with many of our ABD members. The MMD [ph] plans in particular provide the opportunity to demonstrate that all aspects of care behavioral health, physical health, and long-term care services can be delivered more efficiently through managed care. As I presented to investor last month, we have a very well diversified geographic portfolio, the majority of which is already operating at our target margin level, and the minority of which is profitable, but below target and the remainder unprofitable. Moving from a product line our company to a geographic view, I have the following commentary. Of our four largest health plans that generated over $2 billion annually in core business premium revenue, three California, Ohio, and Washington operated at medical care ratios that were at least 200 basis points below our consolidated core medical care ratio of 91%. Texas is the fourth of our health plans with core business revenue over $2 billion has a heavy concentration of members receiving long-term care services, which explain why its core medical care ratio of 92% exceeds the company's overall average. These plans are operating at target margins have long tenured and experience management teams, excellent product diversification mix and excellent standings in the respective states. Although it is midsized I would also include Michigan on this list of well performing plans. Our underperforming plans Florida, New Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Illinois are under intense review for performance improvement, irrespective of their re-procurement status. New Mexico's performance improved in the last half of 2017, and is projected to be the marginally profitable in 2018. Florida's issue largely stem from aggressive marketplace membership growth in 2016 and 2017, that combined with Medicaid challenges over taxed many core operations. With its reduced marketplace profile in 2018, combined with our improvement initiatives already in flight this business should improve. Puerto Rico's performance, and that of the entire Island was impacted by the hurricane as utilization abated dramatically and then bounced back. In the back half of the year performance stabilized, and to note the entire Island will be re-procured this spring. In Illinois we had significant unfavorable prior period development due to a variety of issues. In 2018, with a new state wide contract we will start the year with a slight premium revenue increase. We are working toward rebuilding relationships with the providers in the central part of the state, as we reenter those areas at the beginning of the year. Our fourth quarter SG&A ratio of 7.4% represented a 20 basis point decline from the third quarter, and was 60 basis points lower than the full year ratio of 8%. This improvement reflects the actions taken in 2017. The tighter controls in productivity standards that we've implemented will ensure that our costs stay in line with our revenue base. And we expect to continue to find additional savings above the $235 million we have already announced. Moving on to the subject of capital management, enhancing our balance sheet and staying capital disciplined are also key parts of our plan. We took a number of steps in this regards during the fourth quarter. We strengthened our liability for medical claims, marketplace CSR and risk adjustment. In December, we repurchased the portion of our 2044 convertible debt in exchange for equity. This transaction enabled us to lower our total debt to capital ratio by approximately 5 percentage points, while also allowing us to release for general purposes approximately $157 million of restricted cash. Finally, we entered into a bridge loan that will provide funding in the event that our $550 million face value of convertible notes, due in February 2020 are presented to us. While we think it is unlikely that those note will be presented to us in the near future, we concluded that it was important to may gain this risk. Our total debt ratio remains too high, and we will continue to delever and improve our overall capital structure to achieve our target. I turn now to the preliminary 2018 guidance. We describe this guidance as preliminary because of the inherent uncertainty around achievement and timing of our numerous profit improvement initiatives. While these initiatives extend across the various dimensions of managed care fundamentals that I described to investors last month, many are in the early stages of development and implementation, and therefore not included in guidance. Therefore, our guidance should be viewed as preliminary estimate of what we expect to achieve until we see the profit improvement from these in flight initiatives manifest themselves in the earnings stream. Once we have the benefit of first quarter earnings, and further insight into the execution of our profit improvement initiatives, we will be able to update you with the firmer view of our guidance. To provide for an appropriate amount of execution risk, our preliminary guidance has therefore been developed with appropriately conservative views of medical cost baseline in 2017, medical cost trend for 2018, potential rate increases and retained amounts of revenue at risk, and the turnaround of the marketplace business until we can observe the achievement on the margins implicit in our 2018 pricing. With that said, our preliminary guidance is as follows, for 2018 on a preliminary basis, we expect earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $3 to $3.50 on a GAAP basis. We expect premium revenue to decrease from $18.9 billion to approximately $17.5 billion. The vast majority of this decrease is driven by lower marketplace enrollment, which is only partially offset by higher premium rates. Our preliminary guidance anticipates that marketplace membership will begin the year at approximately 450,000 members from 815,000 at December 31st and decline to approximately 300,000 members by the end of 2018. We expect our 2018 medical care ratio to be approximately 89% compared to the 90.6% medical care ratio, we reported for 2017. Although, our preliminary guidance takes a cautious view of the medical cost improvement in 2018, we expect our 2018 performance to benefit from an absence of the unfavorable prior period claim development we experienced in 2017. That unfavorable prior period claim development in 2017 amounted to $150 million. We expect to manage our administrative cost ratio to approximately 7.3% for all of 2018. This reflects the full year run rate value of the $235 million of savings that we announced last month as part of our restricting efforts. We will update you with a firmer view of our 2018 preliminary guidance on our first quarter earnings call and at our Investor Day. I have also spoken about the need to bring additional talent into our company, while we have many talented leaders at Molina the regress demands of our turn around require that we continue to assess our talent needs across the company and expand our leadership team. Mark Caim [ph] our new Executive Vice President of Strategic Planning, Corporate Development and Transformation, will be the chief architect of our continued restructuring and will lead the analysis of the business portfolio and work to unlock value in all of our major vendor and ancillary cost contracts. Mark's years of recent experienced with [indiscernible] where he performed similar activities will surely create a significant amount of value. I would also like to announce the hiring of Pam Sedmak, Executive Vice President of Health Plan Operations. Pam will be responsible for health plan operations, turning around the underperformers, solidifying our re-procurement efforts and executing on margin recovery and sustainability plan across the fundamentals of managed care. Pam has a long and successful career of managed care particularly in her role as President and CEO for Aetna Medicaid where she oversaw 17 health plans, whose Medicaid business achieved over $9.5 billion in premium revenue. Most recently, Pam was a Senior Advisor at McKinsey & Company servicing clients in the healthcare servicing space. In closing, I am excited about 2018, and I look forward to providing more details on our longer term strategic plans during our Investor Day on May 31st in New York. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe White for more detail on the financials. Joseph White : Thank you, Joe and hello everyone. Yesterday we reported a net loss for the quarter of $4.59 per diluted share, and a net loss of $4.52 per diluted share on an adjusted basis. As Joe mentioned, embedded in these results are several significant items outside of our normal operations that were in further discussions. First we took a $73 million charge as a result of the federal government's decision to stop paying cost sharing reduction rebates or CSRs to health plans beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017. To be clear, we believe we are legally entitled to those payments and will pursue all available means to collect them. We recorded a further charge of $50 million to increase liabilities for marketplace risk adjustment in CSR that related to the first nine months of 2017. Our marketplace premium deficiency reserve was reduced to zero as of December 31, 2017. This was a $70 million benefit in the quarter. We recognized approximately $20 million in incremental flu costs in the quarter. We recognized $269 million of non-cash impairment losses at our Florida, New Mexico and Illinois health plans. The impairments at Florida and New Mexico was a result of our recent contract losses. The Illinois impairment is purely an issue of historical costs. While we are confident that we can improve profitability in Illinois so that it is a meaningful contributor to our company that current profit profile of the health plan does not support the purchase prices paid for certain membership years ago. We recognized approximately $73 million of restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of 2017. In the fourth quarter we also incurred approximately $14 million in expense related to the exchange of equity for $141 million of face value of our 2044 convertible notes. Finally, we recognized approximately $54 million in additional tax expense during the fourth quarter due to the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. It is important to keep the transitory nature of these items in perspective as we continue to evaluate the business, through the lens of the margin recovery and sustainability plan that we announced last month. A full understanding of our underlying business requires that we look beyond the disappointments of our 2017 marketplace performance. The items I outlined a minute ago, and the $150 million of unfavorable prior period development that we experienced in 2017. As Joe noted, we have five large health plans California, Ohio, Washington, Texas and Michigan that are operating at target margins. Additionally, several of the health plans have good prospects for ultimately achieving their target margins. We also saw continued administrative cost improvements in the fourth quarter. The quarter benefited from about $60 million of the annualized administrative cost savings of $235 million that we achieved in 2017. Let me now take a few minutes to discuss our marketplace performance during the quarter. First and keeping with our commitment to resolve legacy issues, we booked a $73 million expense for the termination of CSR reimbursement in the fourth quarter. As I said a moment ago, we believe that we are legally entitled to these federal payments and we will pursue all available means to collect them. We also recorded $50 million of marketplace risk adjustment in CSR expenses related to the first three quarters of 2017, as a result of updated third-party data that we received during the fourth quarter. As a reminder, the estimates we book for risk adjustment are a result of our own member risk scores measured against those of the overall market. The blending of estimates for both our owned and peer performance is necessary because the final true-up for risk adjustment is based on our performance relative to our peers. After the change in CSR and risk adjustment estimates, the $70 million premium deficiency reserve, we accrued at September 30th for our fourth quarter performance would have been adequate. As Joe noted earlier, we have taken significant actions to improve marketplace performance in 2018, as well as to reduce our overall exposure to this aspect of our business. We believe that our more robust pricing in 2018 will lead to improved financial performance for our marketplace product. And keeping with our focus on enhancing our balance sheet and improving our capital management discipline, we have made it a priority to closely manage our subsidiary capital position and dividend excess statutory cash to the parent company when possible. In the fourth quarter, we were able to dividend approximately $150 million, up from our subsidiaries and as of December 31, 2017 the company had cash and investments of approximately $695 million at the parent. In addition, our days and claims payable at December 31, 2017 increased sequentially by four days to 54 days, approximately two days of this four day sequential increase were due to the timing of provider payments, while the remainder was a result of our strengthening of claims reserves. Finally, I will add a few additional thoughts related to our 2018 preliminary guidance. As Joe said a few minutes ago, to provide for an appropriate amount of execution risk, our preliminary guidance has been developed with appropriately conservative views of medical cost baseline in 2017, medical cost trend for 2018, potential rate increases and retained amounts of revenue at risk and the turnaround of the marketplace business until we can observe the achievement of the margins implicit in our 2018 pricing. Our 2018 preliminary guidance anticipates that our Medical care ratio for the full year of 2018 will be approximately 89% compared to 90.6% for all of 2017. It is important to remember, that our 2017 medical care ratio was burdened by approximately $150 million of unfavorable prior period claims development and a net $98 million of unfavorable impact from various marketplace CSR risk adjustment and premium deficiency reserve items. Absent these items, our medical care ratio for 2017 would have been approximately 89.3%. The relatively small improvement we are anticipating in our medical care ratio when compared to an adjusted 2017 medical care ratio reflects the conservatism built into our preliminary guidance. For example, we have taken a conservative position on the turnaround of the marketplace business by adding an appropriate level of contingency for not realizing the margins implicit in our pricing. Looking beyond 2018 preliminary guidance, here are some important facts regarding what we know about our marketplace product today. We priced to a pre-tax margin of 4.6% and a medical care ratio of 65%, this compares to a pre-tax margin of 3% and a medical care ratio of 78% that was priced in 2017. Approximately 70% of 2018 members are renewals from 2017. Acuity of our 2018 membership appears to be within our pricing expectations. In general, 2018 marketplace membership appears to be tracking with our 2018 pricing, which would represent substantial improvement over 2017. Nevertheless, due to the volatility we experienced in 2017, we are taking no credit in our preliminary guidance for marketplace improvements until such improvement manifest themselves in our results. SG&A costs are expected to drop by approximately $200 million in 2018, broker and exchange fees associated with our marketplace products are expected to drop by approximately $150 million. The costs savings taken out of accounts [ph] in 2017, will reduce cost by another $160 million on top of the $75 million already recognized in 2017. These savings will be partially offset by a replenishment of our variable compensation and employee merit increase pools in cost associated with new activities such as our Mississippi and Idaho startups. We have received a significant number of questions relating to our share count and our effective tax rate. We have observed that there is a wide range in estimated share count for our company as well as a wide range in estimates of our effective tax rate for 2018, with that mind let me share the following assumptions that underlie our 2018 preliminary guidance. First our preliminary guidance assumes a diluted weighted average share count of 67.3 million shares and is based on a share price of $100 per share. This share count maybe higher than what some of you are expecting, it is primarily the result of the diluted nature of our convertible debt at higher share prices. For example, our convertible debt is not dilutive at a share price of $55, but at a share price of $100 that same convertible debt will add about 7.4 million shares to our diluted share count. As a further example, at an average share price of $80 for the year our diluted share count would be 65 million shares, at an average share price of $120 our diluted share count for the year will be 68.8 million shares. Regardless of the assumptions you make around the dilutive impact of our convertible notes please remember that we issued 2.6 million shares as part of our exchange of equity for $141 million of face value of our 2,044 convertible notes last December. These additional 2.6 million shares should be included in our share count regardless of assumptions you may make around dilution cost by our convertible debt. Second as many of you know, our effective tax rate is higher than the federal rate of 21% due to the non-deductibility of several items, but most notable the health insurance provider fee. Regarding the impact of tax reform the preliminary guidance effective tax rate of 41% to 43% would have been approximately 64% based on our 2017 tax rate. On another note, our 2018 preliminary guidance assumes that state Medicaid agencies will reimburse that in four for both the ACA health insurance provider fee and the tax impact of that fee is non-deductibility. Even if all Medicaid agencies ultimately reimburses for that fee, we will not be able to recognize the added revenue until we receive assurances from those agencies that the fee will indeed be reimbursed. Any delays in receiving such assurances will result into late recognition of the related revenue, which would sharply reduce our earnings until such assurances are received. Please keep this in mind as you assess our quarterly earnings reports in 2018. Finally, our 2018 preliminary guidance does not contemplate any restructuring charges. Cost and benefits associated with our restructuring activities in 2017 are now captured in our 2018 run rate. While we may undertake further restructuring activities in 2018 and beyond the cost associate with those activities have not been fully scoped. While we can't say with certainty that we will not incur additional restructuring charges in the future, we have not contemplated additional charges in our 2018 preliminary guidance. As a reminder, we will be providing additional detail about our margin recovery and sustainability plan in preliminary guidance on May 31st in New York City. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator we are now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Sarah James of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Sarah James : Thank you. And I appreciate all of the detail about 2018 guidance. But there is a couple of pieces that I was hoping to get more clarity on tax reform benefit how much is the net on that? How much turnaround savings is assumed if we assumed flat, is there is still a drag from Pathways and then on tax, you previously talked about it and [indiscernible] similar admin cost but now it sounds like it may be offset by comp changes. So how should we think about the health contribution changing? Thank you. Joseph White : Hi, Sarah, its Joe White, we struggled to hear you, could you ask those questions one at a time please? Thank you. Good morning by the way. Sarah James : Sure, good morning. So, just trying to look through a few of the moving pieces on guidance that weren't spiked out, the one being tax reform, how much benefit how much benefit realized on tax reform? Joseph Zubretsky : Sure, hi Sarah, its, Joe Zubretsky. On tax reform, if you just look at the 35% statutory rate versus the 21%, it created a $59 million benefit to our 2018 guidance, which is about $0.87 of earnings per share. I will remind everyone that as we either exceed our plan or missed it for every dollar of earnings above or below our marginal tax rate is 21%. And the reason our guidance is at about 42% is the result of a non-deductibility of the HIF. Another question we are often asked is did we change our spending outlook for 2018 because our rates were set, when tax rates were 35% versus 21%. And I would say, no, we had a plan in place of our margin recovery and sustainability plan, it does require investments to be made. Those investments were fully baked in our SG&A roles for 2018 and we did not change the course of that spending as a result of the new tax rates. Sarah James : Thank you. And the other moving piece I was hoping you could spike out flu if there is any change from 2017 to 2018 on your assumptions there. The Pathways which has been a drag in the past if it assume to continue and then exchanges in the past you have talked about there being a tailwind from a lower admin load. I'm not sure if that still assumed going forward. Joseph Zubretsky : With respect to flu as we said we recorded our $20 million top up to our fourth quarter. As we observed pharmacy and physician cost higher than normal particularly in the CTC Hotspots. I would tell you that that trend continued into January, pharmacy and physician costs were higher than normal due to the flu season that we are experiencing and others are as well. With respect to Pathways and our other sort of non-core subsidiaries, I mean say the earnings picture is just not material. It's stable, they're performing well, and it's just not a material part of the story. Sarah James : Got it. And one more clarification if I could and then I'll hop off, you talked about unwinding Florida if the appeals are not successful. How long should you think about that taking. So how much time to get the SG&A overhang if no matching revenue if the appeal in Florida is unsuccessful? Joseph Zubretsky : Sure, if we are unsuccessful in Florida and or New Mexico then we have a plan in place where we will try to transition our service profile in those states and in orderly fashion. Whether we transition it to another incumbent or new player or whether we just educate ourselves entirely. Obviously, when the revenue stops on January 1st, you still have a claims tail to service, you still have member calls that need to service. And so we'll have to hold on to part of the operating platform for the tail period. But we're not going to let the administrative costs and bringing those plans and runoff be a drag on our earnings. We'll have to educate ourselves quickly, but there would be a slight drag on 2019 as we work the claims tail off. Sarah James : Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks, good morning. Few questions here, just wanted to start off on the marketplace. You talked about the membership numbers and the pricing. So the math should be pretty straightforward there, but I want to make sure I got it right. I think your revenue was about $3 billion in premium in 2017. Can you give us the number there for 2018? Is it around $2 billion? And then it sounds like that you said there was no improvement assumed in terms of the economics on the margin. And I think you lost about $100 million plus for 2017, is that the right ballpark for 2018? Joseph Zubretsky : Yes, Justin the revenue number for 2018 contemplated in our guidance is about $1.5 billion. And you have the pricing right. I mean obviously at 102.1% for the quarter 88% for the year against a target of 78%. We lost money in the marketplace this year. The way I would characterize our guidance is we cleared the clutter around 2017. Obviously getting the one timers behind us getting a cleanse claims view of the 2017 run rate projected forward our pricing at the 4.6% target margin. But until we see the effects of our profit improvement initiatives and that pricing take hold in the market, we did not include a lot of that turnaround benefit in our guidance. We need to see it emerge in the first quarter before we firm up our guidance for improved market place performance. Justin Lake : Okay. So the $1.5 billion of premium just sound a little bit low relative to the declining membership and then adding in a 50% price increase, am I missing something there or is it geographically bias to some of the lower premium states? Joseph White : Justin, its Joe White speaking, there are a few issues that play there, one would be the shift downward to bronze relative to sliver, the other would be geographic matter as we continue to see rather proportion stronger enrollment in Texas. Joseph Zubretsky : Also bearing in mind that\u2026 Justin Lake : Okay. Joseph Zubretsky : We always project a 2% monthly decline in membership, so while we are starting the year at 450,000 it's going to end the year at about 300,000 at least in our project. Justin Lake : Okay. And then just it staying on premium guidance for a second, premium guidance going to be - it looks like it's down about $1.5 billion when you adjust for the reclassification of some of the HIF collection or I should say the HIF collection. So that makes sense to your point the marketplace is a big part of that, but beyond that it doesn't seem like there is any organic or same store growth assumed in there and I would have thought there would be 2% to 3% which should add up $500 million to growth there. Am I - is there any offsets or any other bad guys when you think about besides marketplace? Or we just assuming kind of not much in the way of organic kind of same contract growth in 2018? Joseph Zubretsky : So, Justin, we have slight Medicaid membership decline particularly in Michigan with an after profit are taking share. In Ohio where we run into some redetermination issues, slight not a lot but enough to matter in the bridge year-over-year. Our Medicare is up slightly we are holding on to our membership and getting good rates. And we do have two new markets, we have [indiscernible] and Idaho and the inception of our Mississippi TANF contract, which will begin in October of this year, and that's of $200 million all in. So Medicaid membership, a little bit of a slip two new market entries and Medicare is growing nicely to the rates. Justin Lake : Okay. If I could just ask one more numbers question, I think Sarah asked around flu, is there a dollar number you can give us Joe in terms of what you think we could be looking at here relative to last year in terms of flu cost in the first quarter? Thanks. Joseph White : Honestly not yet. We just closed the books, just literally within the past few hours and we've intentionally looked at the underline trends in pharmacy and physician, which is where we need to look and while we know we're experiencing a higher than normal flu season continued in 2018, I really can't peg a number for you right now Justin. Justin Lake : Thanks. Operator : The next question will be from Matt Borsch of BMO Capital Market. Please go ahead. Matthew Borsch : Hi, thank you. If I could ask about, Joe, your view on margin levels and I know you have your preliminary guidance out for 2018 and we appreciate getting that, I'm not looking for guidance for another year. But when you think about the net margin that we see it say peers companies it's a little above 2%. Is that structurally a place that you think Molina can get to overtime because prior to this year the trailing or trailing five year average is something like 0.5%? It just seem that there is us then a structural barrier to getting to the margins that are comparable to peer companies? Joseph Zubretsky : Well Matt, I appreciate the question, but no I really don't think there are any structural impediments in our portfolio. As I said to investors last month, this is clearly a question of performance and not a question of portfolio. We have many high performing plans, we need to fix the hotspot. As I said in my prepared remarks all of our products are just running slightly north of where they need to be to hit their target margins. And you can book inside the numbers and you can go around sort of the wheel of performance in terms of what you need to do with your network, what you need to do with utilization controls. What care management protocols for high acuity populations, holding on to more of our revenue at risk. As I said to investors last month, we are holding on to fewer dollars of revenue at risk than we think our competitors are, we need to get better on risk scoring and quality scores to hold onto the quality withholds that the states hold out to. So I clearly believe it's a question of performance and if we look at the fundamentals of managed care, on a mix adjusted basis, I still feel confident in saying we can get to the competitors range of 1.5% to 2% after tax. Matthew Borsch : That's great, thank you. And also just one more if I could. I don't - I may have missed it, did you touch on your diagnosis of the reasons for the downsizing of the Florida arrangement? Joseph Zubretsky : The reasons that we lost? Matthew Borsch : Yes, yes, sorry. Yes, I know you touched on New Mexico, I didn't hear Florida? Joseph Zubretsky : Well, we touched on New Mexico, we actually have the scoring and we're able to conclude pretty much that it was rates and not service and technical capabilities. In Florida, we have not seen the scoring yet. As part of the process, we will get the scoring, we'll analyze it and then structure our appeal or protest around the scoring parameters. Matthew Borsch : Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Chris Rigg of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Chris Rigg : Good morning. Just wanted to get some clarification on the cost savings from the restructuring plan that are in 2018. It sounds like the run rate savings achieved by the end of 2017 were 235, I mean, you are expecting $160 million to be realize this year with the delta being realized last year. Is that correct and do you still think you're going to get the $300 million to $400 million target by the end of the year - run rate target? Joseph Zubretsky : Those numbers are correct, $15 million in the third, $60 million in the fourth for a total of $75 million and incremental of $160 million for 2018. And bear in mind, when Joe and his team put out that longer-term target, that was not merely SG&A savings, but were cost structure savings across all the dimensions of managed care including network and care management. And yes, if the 1.5% to 2% after tax margin and EBITDA margins north of 5% are in our future, which we predict they will be. Then yes we have to achieve those types of cost savings over the next two years. And as I mentioned previously, we have not included many of those cost structure improvements and performance improvement initiatives in our 2018 guidance, we'll wait to see them emerge, before we adjust our guidance accordingly. Chris Rigg : Great. And then along the same lines, in your prepared remarks you have noted that you guys are in the process of retaining several subject matter experts to help you with upcoming re-procurement and maybe to even do a look back analysis on the state's rate and win. Are those people that should be employed full time by Molina, are these people probably like industry standards that normally are consultants? And then are the costs associated with these experts in the guidance or are these can be treated as one-time items? Thanks. Joseph Zubretsky : The - all the costs are in the guidance. And yes, because these proposals are in flight, we decided to add to the complement of resources, we have internally with outside resources. But ultimately if we are going to turn-on the new business and the re-procurement machine permanently, begin growing again after we return to our target margin profile then yes, we will build internal teams that are capable of routinely winning re-procurements and new bids. So because that were in flight we went outside, but ultimately they need to be built inside. Chris Rigg : Great, thanks a lot. Operator : The next question will be from Peter Costa of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Peter Costa : Good morning. And hi Joe welcome back to the earning conference calls. I wanted to ask you couple of questions. So first one is just, you have done a lot of talk about the MLRs for the marketplace business, but if we exclude the marketplace business and look at all the rest of the businesses is your expectation to get to the 89% loss ratio that the MLR will improve or decrease for that business or will it get worse? Joseph Zubretsky : Well if you look at and again, 2017, very noisy year, and so you have to sort of clear the clutter on 2017 where the reported MCR consolidated was 90.6%, 130 basis points of which was prior period development. When you started looking in at the detailed product lines, TANF reported at 92%, ABD 94.7%, Expansion 84.9%, and so on and so forth. You can pro-forma and project network contracting, retaining more revenue, better utilization controls in care management to get to our 89% and beyond. So we were very cautious on 2018 guidance not to include the results of those performance improvement initiatives, but they are in flight and we expect them to work. But because of this company's past history of execution we were hesitant to put them in our guidance are very comparable with the approximately 89% for 2018. And when we see our performance initiatives manifest themselves in earnings, we would just accordingly. Peter Costa : So beyond the prior period development going away, you're not expecting necessarily for that other rest of the business to improve, is that correct? Joseph Zubretsky : Yes, that's a good assumption. Our guidance for 2018 is just slightly better than the pure period for 2017. Peter Costa : Okay. And then moving on Joe, you've come from a background with having seen far more advanced systems. How difficult will it be to get Molina's systems to the point where you need them to be, so that you can avoid fighting hotspots and instead be proactive and be sure of the performance you have going forward. Joseph Zubretsky : Very logistic question and you're right. In this business, this is an information business primarily, and the veracity and velocity of medical cost trend information is critical to the life blood of a well-managed, managed care company. The systems here okay, we have many sources of data warehouses that create good medical insights. We have an actuarial community that I believe is very, very good. We can get better, and the investments needed to create higher velocity and more veracity of information are baked into our plans. And I think as part of our margin recovery plan we contemplate getting better information on a real time basis and reacting to the trends that are emerging in the marketplace more quickly than this company has reacted in the past. I'm running this organization a lot flatter. And I'm closer to 13 health plans than the predecessor management and with Joe and his team, Pam Sedmak on board, we're going to make sure that we serve the emerging trends more quickly and react to them on a more real time basis. Peter Costa : Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Dave Windley of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi there, it's Dave Saddle [ph] on for Windley. Thanks for the questions and welcome over Joe again. Want to just to come back to comments that you made at a prior conference kind of laying out the 1.5% to 2% in our debt margins. I'm just curious do you have an updated view of that considering the negative fixed cost leverage that comes from the unexpected New Mexico and Florida RFP headwinds. Does that changed or picking about getting to those margins or perhaps the timing of being able to do that in the one to three year target that you previously talked about? Joseph Zubretsky : Sure, Dave. Whatever we thought we were going to achieve. And I still believe 1.5% to 2% is achievable. Obviously if there is some stranded fixed cost as a result of withdrawal from a market or two that would create a headwind. But as we've analyzed this, I don't consider any cost to be fixed. Obviously the variable costs of the plans operating the plans are easy to identify and educate. Variable's very easy to identify and we're going to right size the enterprise to the new revenue base. And so the headwind in my opinion is not in the percentage of target margin, but in the actual dollars of underwriting margin and operating profit will produce, which to some extent has been compromised if we lose these two contracts. So no, I'm not backing off the long-term margin percentages. Although, if there are fixed costs that need to come out and it becomes stranded, then we just need to work hard to get them out. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And just to be clear, is that target range excluding upside from tax reform or not? Joseph Zubretsky : Yes, we haven't updated our long-term view, because as I've said publicly it's not clear to me and while there is no specific past line item in the rate development in state contracts whether states at least contemplate or consider the new tax regime as they structure rates on the various rating factors it's not clear to be that - it's not going - rates are not going to settle back to the after tax margins that we are seeing today. And until we see that prove out, I am not going to increase the target, but certainly there would be upside if the rating environment does not consider the new tax regime? Unidentified Analyst : Right. Got it, okay. And then apple to apples on the non-exchange MLR improvement of 210 basis points sequentially, I think my understanding is that 4Q have less unfavorable development than 3Q, so maybe that explains some of the improvement. But I am curios what some of the other factors could have been in there I guess flu you spiked out and that was something that you had to overcome, but is there some - some approach that you could provide to 3Q to 4Q MLR. Joseph Zubretsky : So I am going to turn it to Joe since he was obviously heavily involved in those quarters. Joseph White : Sure, I think as you take a look at quarter-to-quarter fluctuations you obviously have to be careful in this business about what you read into them. But I think it is a pure statement to say that excluding marketplace where we made some out of period adjustments in Q4, I think your statement Dave, that there was less unfavorable development in Q4 than Q3 is correct and just reflects the general trend we have been making to improving the quality and the sustainability of our reserves. I think there is also there were some pleasant surprises in patient utilization in a couple of parts of the business and particularly on the Medicare side. I also think in some cases in some of our plans that hadn't performed as well overtime or recently as we would have liked we are seeing the benefit of new management teams settling in. New Mexico showed some improvement in the second half for the year. Puerto Rico while it had - continues to have some one-off issues related to provider sharing accruals and things like that they continue I think the positive trend. So I think overall it just reflect a general stabilization of the business, the benefits of certain cost take outs we took last year, and the - just essentially getting a lot of the heavy lifting around the increasing of reserves behind this. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. Operator : The next question will be from Josh Raskin of Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Joshua Raskin : Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys. Wanted to touch basically sort of on a longer term revenue perspective and not much organic change expected in the current year and we think about in Mexico I think you sized that $1.5 billion and in term could be your 2018 expectation I don't think I heard a Florida expectation maybe we just assume the 2017 numbers pretty similar. But I want to understand you talk a little about these changes there are a few process bringing in new hires, congrats to both of them as well. And hiring external but I am just curios what you think about revenue run rate once you kind of rebase the business take out let's call $2.5 billion for the lost contracts in 2019 add back them the HIF. So really just what do you think this business grows at when do you think you will sort of be back in the RFP wining game. And then I guess on the side question the marketplace is that a business you are still in, in 2019 and beyond? Joseph Zubretsky : Sure, Josh, this is Joe. The revenue trajectory hasn't changed in my view and all I said was we are pushing the pause button on new business growth, while we repair and restore the margins to target. I am very hopeful that that's a 2018 exercise. Meanwhile during 2018, Pam, myself, and others will be rebuilding the new business procurement machine so that we can began to participate in 2019 pipeline. So, this is not a story without growth, we are just pushing the pause button on North Carolina and Kentucky and a few other opportunities until we can actually see the margin restored and start moving to target levels. So, I would - for the long-term I do not view the story as anything different from the growth story that any other Medicare and Medicaid company is portraying. With respect to marketplace, well early on there were all the strategic views of you needed to be in the marketplace if you were in Medicaid and vice-versa. And I think the market has learned that while there are similarities in network configuration and costs that these two businesses are quite independent on each other. And that you can't really warm transfer a member between the two markets, they go into the exchange, they go into exchange. So in my view the business has to produce a target margin and cash flows that fit with the portfolio stands on its own. Our marketplace business in Texas is incredible profitable. It was Florida that was the problem and in the five other markets it's not at its target, but it is still profitable. And so, we're going to final rates in April. We are going to see how our profitability emerges this year, make that final call in August and September when you need to, but we're pretty confident that with 59% rate increases, 4.6% pre-tax target margin that this could be and is a sustainable business for the enterprise. Joshua Raskin : Okay. And then just on New Mexico Joe, you made the comment that you know the loss was on the cost proposal portion, certainly looking at that, I think the average you guys were 150 points off the average, I think 275 points of the winners. And so I conquer with that, but there were some areas in technical that were noticeably below average around care coordination and in post-systems and some of those. It didn't look to me, I think you guys would have been fifth-place just looking at the technical scores didn't look to me like Molina was really that well positioned as an existing plan, even if you through the whole cost proposal out. So you know I assume as part of this RFP revamping and revitalization plan, I assume there's more going into that, I was just curious if you could provide some color on how do you kind of fix that sort of stuff, is it capabilities or is it just the proposal responses weren't really perfectly written and I'm just curious what your thoughts are there? Joseph Zubretsky : First Josh, as we gone back and reverse engineer the scoring, we have us actually closer to being a third than fifth or sixth as you suggested when you remove pricing, but we going to pay that back and forth all day along. The real issues the one you suggested, I don't think our proposals as we go back and look at Florida and New Mexico reflected the capabilities that we have. We have been in New Mexico a long time, we enjoyed a good relationship with the state. Our service to members and to providers has been very good and I don't think we reflected our capabilities in the proposal well enough. And then clearly, when you're participating in a rate auction and purposely did at the 75th or 80th percentile on the range just pure auction theory is you are not going to win. And during that period of time, there was a very unclear view of how New Mexico was performing, it was all types of backlog claims and prior period development and it wasn't performing well. And so the management team at the time bid higher in the range, hindsight maybe we would have or wouldn't, but clearly due to rates in that performance in our opinion. But we are revamping the entire proposal writing machine to better reflect the capabilities that we do have in these markets. Joshua Raskin : Okay, that's perfect. Thanks, Joe. Operator : The next question will be from Steve Tanner [ph] of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks a lot, guys. Good morning. Just wanted to clarify some comments around target margin rates, the timeline and also tax reform as it relates to those items. So it sounds like Joe you don't expect to keep the tax benefits, but in 2018 they do represent you guys said $0.87 in the outlook. So for kind of pulling that out, it seems like the net margin goal for this year is closer to sort of 80 or 90 basis points and assuming that math is right, where should we think about the next sort of 70 to 110 bps of margin improvement coming from in 2019 and beyond and is the timeline for 1.5% to 2%, still kind of two to three years? Joseph Zubretsky : Yes, and that's exactly the math and you've capture it appropriately, in terms of the tax impact on our guidance for 2018. In the first year of the turnaround, where we are trying to get to 1.5% to 2% after tax. All in having and after-tax margin of 1.2%, we should suggest it slightly below 1% when adjusted for sort of the tax benefit of the tax law change is a good starting point. As we said, as we look at the back half of the year, most of our businesses, at least are operating in a stable way, we have identified the underperformers. And the next margin enhancement benefit is again I hate to coming back to managed care 101, but our utilization controls are not consistent across the country in our health plans, our care management for high acuity members, our integration of behavioral and medical is very good in some places and lagging in others. Our networks contracts are - in certain places are price too high the networks are too wide. Some of our insulated contracts have unit costs that are far too high for the volumes for giving our venders. Our retained revenue, our risk adjustment scores are not keeping pace with the acuity of the population. We're getting too much back on the revenue withhold. So I keep coming back to all of the performance measures that one looks at throughout the managed care program and we can see outlook for meaningful improvement across all those measures. And that's where the arrival at a target margin will come from. Unidentified Analyst : Understand. And just one follow-up for me, just on Illinois trying to think about that rate increase as well as the statewide expansion, I guess just most helpful maybe is just to understand what MCR is assumed in guidance and maybe would also be helpful to understand where the plan would have ended the year not for sort of the unusual items that that occurred over the course of last year? Thank you. Joseph Zubretsky : Sure, with the rate increase we're giving and with the major corrective actions that we had to put emplace in Illinois, Illinois is in our guidance at just about breakeven for 2018. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Joseph Zubretsky : And for 2017, it was - it lost money, was unprofitable for 2017. Unidentified Analyst : Got it, okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Great, thanks. I just wanted to ask about the top-line, you mentioned that losing New Mexico and Florida would be bad from an earnings power perspective, I guess, if we assume that those contracts were lost and then you kind of annualized the contract 51 at the end of this year and I guess maybe your view about exchanges. And what is the right kind of normalized run rate as we enter 2019 from a revenue perspective? I do you expect revenue to be down year-over-year if you loss those two states. Joseph Zubretsky : Yes, I mean, if we lost the Medicaid business in New Mexico and let's say if we lost the - we kept Miami Dade in Florida of lost the other regions then yes, revenue would certainly be down in 2019. There is no way that the new launches that we've had were small, I mean, Mississippi is going to be 100,000 to 120,000 TANF members to start, there is probably an ABD contract on the backend of that. But yes, I don't think there is any question that if we are unsuccessful retaining the majority of those two contracts revenue would be down in 2019. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And then you talked about DCP in the quarter, I guess, DCP is being up four days and two of those it sounds like just timing, but due to reserve strengthening, is that - is the reserve strengthening in your view because it's really just the under reserving heading into the period previously or is there in your view kind of extra cushion now because of all the moving pieces that have been going on, but you kind of view this as I don't want to say over reserve, but conservatively reserved? Joseph Zubretsky : Yes, we are appropriately and conservatively reserved. Joe? Joseph White : I think that's fair statement, given everything we've developed in 2017 from the 2016 reserve we thought it was appropriate to not only replenish reserves to previous levels, but to allow additional cushion for everything we've seen happen this year and the variability in our reserve development. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And then last question, how do you think about leverage because, I guess, when you just look at it on a gross basis you are like 60% debt to cap obviously you have some cash on the balance sheet, how do you think about where you debt to cap is now when you kind of look at all the pieces there? And then what's the target and what's the reasonable timeframe to get that target? Joseph Zubretsky : Bear in mind I'll kick it to Joe in a minute but bear in mind that we were after our note exchange we have moved down from about 57% I believe on measured on the GAAP basis. And the reason we popped over 60% isn't because of leverage, it's actually because of the reduction to equity due to the charges we took. So Joe do you want to expand on that. Joseph White : Yes, I think the best way to express it is that we are viewing leverage really in the same line we are as our expectation for 2018. We'll be able to make better informed decision once we see the profit improvements driven by everything we've talked about today manifest themselves in our earnings. So, basically what we're going to do now is we're going to manage cash and leverage as appropriately as we can we going to bring much discipline to it and we're being more focused on the management. But as far as any major decisions going forward, we're going to foresee how much we can grow our way into a lower debt to cap ratio through retained earnings. Kevin Fischbeck : But right now it looks like you guys think that if you hit your plan and execute you'll be able to grow into the balance sheet you want overtime there is no need to do anything if you're hitting your targets? Joseph Zubretsky : Yes, it's all about earnings and the sustainability and the lack of volatility in earnings. Sustained earnings is actually as much the problem with our capital base as the capital is itself. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Ana Gupte of Leerink. Please go ahead. Ana Gupte : Yes, thanks. Good morning. On the Texas and the Washington contracts, can you give us a sense of what the states you're thinking about on these two in terms of seen a supplier consolidation. Is it a price bid or something else around member, provider and networks or quality? And how do you feel about the positioning of Molina? And what is also the timing of the submission and the awards? Joseph Zubretsky : Let's take them - hi, Ana, it's Jose. Let's take them one at a time. Texas the response to the Texas ABD proposal is in flight and is due to be submitted in early March. And we are told that awards will be announced as late as October of 2018. We're in 6 of 13 regions in Texas right now. And it's a statewide proposal. So obviously our first focus is to retain what we have. But there is actually room to grow, and with our service profile deep provider relationships, skilled nursing facility networks and a really good service platform, it's possible that we can actually grow in this RFP. I will remind you that rates are not part of either one of these proposals. It's all capability and service profile rates to be negotiated later. So that that phenomenon where a new player can come in and try to sort of invest in the state that doesn't exists in either one of these. In Washington with 55% market share, a great platform of integrating behavioral and medical, a track record of having won two of the nine regions already, two of the nine regions in Washington actually went into procurement in the past two years and we won them. And we actually grew our membership after we re-procured. We have 50% of our cost base in Washington running to value based contracts, which we believe is best in market. So we're feeling pretty good about both of these both from a market share perspective, the ability to grow and our service profile and track record in either state. The Washington RFP hasn't arrived yet; it's supposed to arrive in the next couple of weeks. And I'm struggling to remember the actual submission date, but we can get to back you on that. Ana Gupte : Thanks, Joe. Just one follow-up more broadly on the states and the discussions you're having around rates and what you might expect this fall. Is the environment likely to be supported despite tax reform and might this become a tailwind to your margin expansion goals for 2019 or are you hearing anything around claw backs and does that differ by red or blue states or specific states. Joseph Zubretsky : No, we haven't heard - first of all on 2018, we haven't - there is no discussion about claw backs. The rates on 80% of our revenue are locked in. And due to various renewal dates throughout the year 20% or not. But 80% - rates on 80% of our revenue are locked in. So 2018 we think is the avoid of any renegotiation. And look, all the rating factors with the states argue about various medical cost trends sort of back to our rate increases by including benefits and service profile, these are all types of way to structurally negotiating rates. And I'm just guarded that I'm not yet ready to declare of that the after tax margins in the Medicaid business are now going to be higher than everybody projected because of the new tax regime. But there has been no discussion specifically about taxes vis-\u00e0-vis the rates that we're negotiating, which I think is a good sign. Ana Gupte : Got it. Thanks, Joe. Helpful, color. Operator : The next question will be from Lee Pressman of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Zachary Sopcak : Hey, sorry, this is Zack Sopcak from Morgan Stanley. Quick question Joe, as you think about the overall Medicaid opportunity now versus back when you were doing a due diligence stepping into the November, is there anything from a regulatory standpoint that's surprising you, work requirements, states that may or may not be expanding or anything else? Joseph Zubretsky : No, not really. When you are in this business you have to make sure you can tolerate through the necessitude of legislative and regulatory affairs and keeping track of all that is quite challenging as you know. But no, as we look at the regulatory environment, as we look at very legislative proposals, Medicaid is here to stay there is contemplation of perhaps certain states sort of merging the expansion market with the marketplace market, that's possible. There still a round flow of support for having the higher acuity populations ABD and long-term services and support in a managed environment. And I think the industry has done a great job demonstrating that these managed care savings by having those high acuity populations in managed care versus fee for services. So no, I don't think there is anything legislatively or regulatory that causes me to think differently above the attractive growth aspects of this business. Zachary Sopcak : All right, thanks for the questions. Operator : And the final question this morning will be from Gary Taylor of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Gary Taylor : Hi, good morning. Just a couple of questions, one for 2018 marketplace of that $1.5 billion of premium you're talking about, how much of that would in Florida, ballpark? Joseph Zubretsky : Of the 450,000 members, I believe Florida is projected to have around 50,000, down from over 200,000 in 2017. So I would tell you that it's probably between $300 million and $350 million. Gary Taylor : Okay. And then my other question is, I guess, I'm in the camp of one of those having little trouble on the share account I think I understand the convert dilution pretty well, but maybe I'm just missing, where you ended the quarter. So 57.1 million average diluted shares for the quarter, could you give us end of quarter basic and diluted kind of as the jumping off point? Joseph Zubretsky : I'll take it to, Joe. Joseph White : Sure, it's right around - end of quarter it's right around 60 million. Gary Taylor : Okay. Joseph White : I think what you are missing there is the impact of the exchange of equity we did for our some of our convertible notes and in middle of December, which involve issuing about 2.6 million shares. Gary Taylor : Okay, thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen this will conclude our question-and-answer session. And it will also conclude our conference call for today. We thank you for attending today's presentation. At this you may disconnect your lines.",

I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joseph Zubretsky. Joe Zubretsky : Thank you, Ryan, and thank you all for joining us this morning. The financial results that we announced today reflect a good first step toward our goal of sustainable margin recovery. First quarter earnings were $1.64 per diluted share and included $0.38 of net favorable impact not contemplated in our original preliminary guidance. These results are a significant improvement over 2017 and are favorable to our expectation. As a result of these developments, we have increased our full year 2018 guidance to a range of $4 to $4.50 per diluted share. When we analyze the business by key operating metrics, product line or local health plan, we met or exceeded our expectations, modest as they were along nearly all dimensions. To summarize the key takeaways from the first quarter, our medicated Medicare products combined performed well. This improvement despite a higher than normal flu season was primarily due to our medical cost management initiative and better than expected retention of at risk revenue. The performance of our marketplace business exceeded our expectations as the significant price increases replaced into the market were more than competitive and allowed us to surpass our membership forecast particularly in Texas, our most profitable market. From a local market perspective, our large high performing plans continue to perform well in the aggregate despite higher than expected medical costs in Washington. In our underperforming markets, our newly implemented intense and rigorous performance improvement processes began to show signs of success particularly in Florida and Illinois. Our administrative cost improvement plan continue to reflect favorably in our results as evidenced by our lower administrative expense ratio. Finally, our focus on balance sheet discipline not only avoided the unfavorable prior year reserve development that we saw throughout 2017 but rather produced significant favorable prior year development in the quarter as a result of a more conservative approach to estimating our claims liability at December 31. We attempted to maintain that same degree of conservatism when we established reserve at the end of the first quarter and if time proves we were successful in doing so, the net impact of prior period development on our first quarter results will have been minimal. Taking a step back, we see an emergency theme. Our operating metrics on a consolidated basis developed favorably with respect to revenue, medical care ratio and G&A profile by both product line and local health plan. Reviewing the results from these different vantage points helps us test and evaluate the quality of earning and the sustainability of our first quarter trajectory. After this multi-dimensional review, I will then consider the company's revenue and growth profile and conclude my remarks with a discussion of revised guidance. First, revenue; premium revenue decreased approximately 7% when compared with the first quarter of 2017. This decrease was a direct result of the membership declines related to the significant marketplace price increases that we implemented as part of our margin improvement and sustainability plan. We now have over 450,000 marketplace members which exceeds our forecast as our prices while having been increased by an average of nearly 60% remained competitive. Medicare and Medicaid revenues were essentially flat as a slight membership decline in Medicaid was offset by a low single-digit rate increases and favorable at risk revenue retention. Second, our medical care ratio, removing the impact of the 2017 CSR benefit recorded in the quarter, our consolidated medical care ratio improved to 87.7% from 88.4% in the first quarter of 2017. This improvement reflects stronger medical management performance resulting in favorable medical cost trends that were partially offset by a lower mix of marketplace revenue. On balance inpatient and physician utilization as well as unit costs were well managed in the quarter while pharmacy costs ran higher than expected. This netted to an overall favorable medical cost trend despite the higher pharmacy costs and approximately $18 million of above normal flu expense. We have also started to see some of the early benefits from contracting efforts that we undertook last year in California, Florida, South Carolina and Texas where we eliminated or renegotiated high cost provider contracts for inpatient and ancillary services. The catch all of our performance, our net profit margin was 2.3% and benefited from the net favorable impacts not contemplated in our original preliminary guidance. Without accounting for these net favorable impacts, our net profit margin squarely landed at 1.8% a significant improvement over any prior period. We will continue to make every effort to ensure this progress is sustainable. Third, I would like to take a deeper look at performance by product line, starting with Medicaid. In [indiscernible] product, the medical care ratio of 92.7% was slightly improved from the 93.1% ratio in the first quarter of 2017. This result modestly underperformed our expectations due to high acuity inpatient cases in Washington and higher behavioral healthcare costs in New Mexico. We continue to work to improve utilization controls in the care management for this product line. Our Medicaid expansion medical care ratio was 85.2% compared to 84.4% in 2017. This was in line with our expectations as the increase over the prior year was primarily due to the premium reduction that took place in California last July. This product has remained very successful for us as rate adequacy has trended favorably and membership is concentrated in our higher performing health plans particularly California, Michigan and Ohio. The aged blind and disabled product perform notably better compared to the first quarter of 2017 as it's MCR improved to 92.1% from 94.5%. The year-over-year improvement can be attributed to our continued advancement of the following key high acuity management fundamentals. First we are improving our care management and coordination of services for high acuity populations focusing on the integration of behavioral and physical health services. Second, we are targeting high risk members for care management intervention and more comprehensive documentation of medical conditions. And third, we are improving our management of community and other long-term care services for members in this product line. Continuing the product line review, and turning now to Medicare. For our SNIP and MMP programs combined, the medical care ratio improved by nearly 300 basis points to 84.8% this quarter from 87.7% in the first quarter of 2017. Much of this improvement is a result of increased retention of at risk revenue. The Medicare business also benefited from favorable medical cost trends and improved medical management of inpatient utilization. Michigan which has about 25% of our Medicare membership has shown particular improvement this quarter. Accurate and complete risk for documentation and effective management of chronic and high acuity conditions are critical to the successful management of this product. To round out the review by product, now with respect to the marketplace business. Marketplace is off to a stronger start this year compared to last and has performed above our expectations. The medical care ratio for the marketplace business decreased to approximately 67% excluding the impact of the 2017 CSR benefit recorded in the quarter down from 75% in the first quarter of 2017. This 800 basis point improvement is a direct result of our pricing strategy. When considering this improvement, it is important to note several factors. First, approximately 70% of our members this year are renewing members from 2017. And as such we believe we have a more stable risk pool. Second, member demographics, risk scores and acuity all generally came in within the assumptions used in our pricing, which as you recall targeted a 4.6% pre-tax margin. Third, while it is still early in the year and our membership remains largely similar to last year, we have seen a change in composition to more brands and fewer still members. Since we have priced all of our products to the same target margin on a standalone basis, this shift should be margin neutral. I turn now to the fourth dimension of my review of the quarter a review by geography of the individual performance of our local health plans. The majority of our large health plans have produced and continued to produce after tax margins that exceed our target. The combined performance of these large well performing health plans, California, Michigan, Ohio, Texas and Washington remain consistent with our expectations. Ohio's performance improved over the first quarter of 2017 across all products. While we saw pressure in Washington related to high acuity inpatient cases. With respect to Washington we believe this experience is within the level of quarterly variability in medical cost that can be experienced from time to time. One of our greatest margin enhancement opportunities is to turn around our underperforming health plans. Florida and Illinois are excellent examples of how our rigorous management process and a disciplined Profit Improvement Plan can produce positive results. Illinois in particular has improved across all lines of business and the new health plan management team has been extremely focused on improving operations. Fifth and finally, I turn to corporate administrative expenses. We continue to see the full run rate impact of our prior cost actions reflected in reduced administrative expense and a correspondingly lower G&A ratio. Our G&A ratio in the quarter was managed to 7.6% down from 8.9% in the first quarter of 2017. If we exclude the impact of marketplace broker commissions and exchange fees, our G&A ratio declined to 6.8% in the first quarter of this year from 7.5% in the first quarter of 2017. This improvement highlights the effects of our previous restructuring efforts and we continue to identify additional cost reduction opportunities across the organization. For instance, we recently eliminated approximately 100 positions for an annual savings in excess of $10 million. We will continue to restructure inefficient processes and find opportunities for headcount reductions as doing so has a very short payback. I will now briefly discuss the company's revenue and growth profile although we have pushed the pause button on new revenue opportunities while we execute our margin recovery plan, reprocurement of existing revenue remains an intense focus. We have submitted bids for Texas Starplus, Washington Medicaid and the Puerto Rico Medicaid program because we are in a mandatory quiet period with respect to each of these submissions, I must limit the scope of my comments. That said I will repeat that we have spent a significant amount of time improving our proposal development process ahead of these submissions. We have given our local plan substantially more responsibility, an edit authority to ensure that we capture as many state specific nuances as possible. We also brought in external resources to mock score, review and otherwise provide an independent assessment of each response before submission. I will also note that the senior executive team, myself included has been deeply engaged in each of these bids submissions. I would now like to say a quick word about the Puerto Rico RFP. Puerto Rico is making a number of changes to its Medicaid program. They are moving from a regional managed care model with only one plan in each region to an island wide model with multiple plans competing against each other. Additionally, the Commonwealth is moving from regional to island wide rates and has expressed its intent to change the profit modifier process to potentially include a minimum MLR. These changes require intense scrutiny on our part. For now, we are pursuing the reprocurement and we will continue to evaluate our position as information about the rating structure becomes more clear. In Florida, the state notified us last week that we were not awarded a contract in Region 11, the only region in which we were invited to negotiate. While we are somewhat disappointed with this outcome, it does not alter our course and we will continue to pursue a major retrenchment in Florida. However, we are still evaluating our options for participating in the marketplace, which has shown signs of improvement while we continue to protest the Medicaid awards. In New Mexico, while we continue to pursue our protest rights, we remain focused on managing our 2018 operations. Without a decision to reverse the award, our New Mexico Medicaid business is in runoff and we will soon determine what our future instate profile will be. I turn now to our revised guidance. As you will recall from February, the 2018 guidance we presented was preliminary. This was due to the inherent uncertainty surrounding the achievement and timing of our profit improvement initiatives conservative views of our 2017 medical cost baseline and 2018 trends and caution about the ultimate performance of our marketplace business. Although some element of uncertainty remains, we have raised our full year 2018 guidance for earnings per diluted share to a range of $4 to $4.50 due to the insights we have gained over the past three months. Simply stated here is our reasoning. The midpoint of our preliminary guidance range was $3.25, first quarter non-recurring benefits now in our actual results were $0.38 per share and we outperformed our own first quarter expectation and expect to continue to outperform the remainder of the year by a total of $0.60 to $0.65 per share. All of this supports, our revised guidance range of $4 to $4.5 with a midpoint of $4.25. While this level of revision may seem modest, we have good reason to remain cautious. Let me highlight a few of the factors that inform our measured approach to guidance. First, we must ensure that favorable medical cost trend performance in the quarter is the result of our actions and not merely a product of random variability. Second, we are mindful that our marketplace results while favorable still rely on managing the higher utilization months in the back half of the year. Third, in prior years, we haven't been accurate with our marketplace estimates of risk adjusted revenue and we want to observe emerging experience to support our forecast. Fourth, the full effect if any of favorable prior year development of claims reserves on our 2018 results will be determined only with the passage of time. Fifth and finally, Florida and New Mexico are challenging environments as the teams are working hard to turn a reasonable profit while managing plans that are technically in partial runoff. For all of these reasons, we believe that the revised guidance is appropriately calibrated. Our second quarter results will be key to validating the sustainability of our improved first quarter results. I will conclude by saying we are increasingly optimistic that our profit improvement initiatives are taking hold and that our medical cost trends in 2018 will be better than we anticipated in our conservative preliminary guidance. However, we still have a long way to go and we remain eternally vigilant. All of that said, we believe we have taken promising first steps toward our profit improvement goals. I look forward to sharing the details of our longer term margin recovery and sustainability plans during our Investor Day on May 301 in New York. There we intend to give you a detailed view of which profit levers we will pull, in which products, in which geographies and by whom with great specificity and detail. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe White for more detail on the financials. Joe White : Thank you, Joe and hello everyone. Today we reported earnings per diluted share of $1.64 and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.71. As Joe mentioned these results reflect a good first step toward our goal of sustainable margin recovery. I will briefly discuss the items we called out in the earnings release, prior year development of our claims reserves, our March 31 balance sheet and our revised guidance before we open up the call to take questions. We have highlighted three significant items in today's release that were not included in the preliminary guidance we shared with you in February. First, we recognize the benefit of approximately $70 million or $0.83 per diluted share and reduced medical expense related to 2017 when the Federal Government confirmed that the reconciliation of 2017 marketplace CSR is up to-date will be performed on an annual basis. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we had assumed a nine month reconciliation of this item pending confirmation from CMS. Second, we recorded a $10 million charge for the retirement of an additional $97 million of face value of our 2044 convertible notes. This action had the double benefit of strengthening our balance sheet, while also reducing the volatility in our earnings caused by the optionality of convertible debt. As part of this transaction, we issued 1.8 million shares of common stock. On a time weighted basis, these additional 1.8 million shares added 0.5 million to average shares outstanding for the quarter and a 1.4 million to average shares outstanding for the full year when calculating our revised full year 2018 guidance. Third, we recorded $25 million in restructuring charges in the quarter, these charges primarily related to the write-down of capitalized costs for an in-flight software implementation that did not meet our needs. Let me now spend a few minutes discussing prior year development of our claims reserves. As you can see from the roll forward table in today's release, we have had about $240 million of favorable prior year development this quarter. This favorable claims development is the expected result of the more conservative approach we took to the estimation of reserves during the second half of 2017. We have attempted to include the same level of caution and conservatism in our first quarter balance sheet as we did in our year end balance sheet. We have done this through the application of a consistent reserving methodology in both periods. Days in claims payable are down one-day sequentially and are up eight days from the first quarter of 2017. While days and claims payable are a gauge rather than a measure of reserve adequacy the slight movement in this metric quarter-over-quarter supports the view that prior year claims development did not have a significant impact on first quarter earnings. Nevertheless, we will not be able to fully determine the impact if any of prior year development on our first quarter results for some time. This is one of the reasons why we are taking a cautious view in our revised guidance. Turning to our capital structure and balance sheet, we have continued to take advantage of the opportunities to delever the company. In March, we issued common shares in exchange for $97 million in principal of our 2044 convertible notes. This transaction further reduced our debt profile while also allowing us to release another $94 million of restricted cash on the balance sheet. With this transaction the outstanding amount of our 2044 notes has been reduced to approximately $65 million. As of March 31, 2018, the company had unrestrictive cash and investments in excess of $700 million to the parent. This amount provides us with an appropriate amount of capital to manage possible redemptions of our $550 million of 2020 convertible notes. As of March 31, 2018, our health plans had aggregate statutory capital in surplus of approximately $1.9 billion compared with the required minimum level of approximately $1.2 billion. While we would have preferred to have been awarded new Florida and New Mexico Medicaid contracts those two health plans hold in excess of $380 million of statutory capital should current RFP results stand, we expect that we will be able to dividend at least a portion of those funds back to the parent company as soon as the first quarter of 2019. Overall, we are optimistic that the operational improvements we are seeing at our health plans will allow us to establish regular and predictable dividend flows from our subsidiaries to the parent company. We will be discussing more details of our capital plan during our upcoming Investor Day. Finally, some additional thoughts in our revised guidance. Our first quarter performance exceeded expectations even after removing the impact of the 2017 CSR benefit recorded in the quarter. We have increased our full year 2018 guidance to a range of $4 to $4.50 per diluted share. Some important points relating to our revised guidance are as follows; our revised guidance assumes no material impact from prior period development. Our revised guidance includes the net benefit of $0.38 per diluted share from the 2017 CSR reconciliation benefit, restructuring charges and loss on debt extinguishment that we discussed earlier. These items were not included in our original preliminary guidance for 2018. Revised guidance does not include any restructuring or employee separation charges that we may incur in the last three quarters of the year. The effective tax rate in our revised guidance is based upon the Federal statutory rate of 21% adjusted for state taxes and the impact of non-deductible items such as the health insurer fee and portions of our executive compensation. Diluted shares used in calculating revised guidance are 68 million shares. This share count includes the effect of our recent equity of our convertible debt exchange and assumes an average share price of $100 for the period April 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018. We have maintained an appropriate amount of conservatism as we constructed our revised guidance for the remainder of the year and the second quarter will be key to validating the sustainability of our improved first quarter results. Finally, we will be providing additional detail about our margin recovery and sustainability plan on May 31 in New York City. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from Josh Raskin of Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Josh Raskin : Hi. Thanks. Good morning guys. Just wanted to talk about Florida, New Mexico briefly from a balance sheet perspective. And I don't know if you guys have specific goodwill totals associated with those plans and maybe help us with the timing of when a write-off would come, is that after all of the appeals are done or is that kind of done now. And I guess part of that is, what's the expected sort of debt-to-cap what do you think your leverage looks like post those changes? Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : Josh, its Joe. We rewrote the goodwill associated with Florida and New Mexico off when it was announced we lost the contracts in the fourth quarter of last year. So there would be no additional goodwill or intangible write offs in those particular markets. Obviously, with nearly $400 million of capital as the reserves run-off and the premium flow stop we'll approach each of the state regulators with the dividend plan, to dividend that cash to the parent company to provide excess capital which is used to retire debt should have a meaningful impact on our leverage ratio next year. So, obviously disappointed, we lost the contracts but additional capital will be released from those entities. Josh Raskin : Nice. That's a positive. And then, the Texas reprocurement could you just walk us through the timing in terms of award dates and contract dates? And then, what's Molina's current run rate in terms of revenues on that business? Joe Zubretsky : The Texas Starplus program bid was submitted. Awards will be announced in October of 2018, with a January 2019 inception date to the contract. Bear in mind, we are only in six regions in Texas and we are bidding on all 13, so we actually view this as a potential revenue upside for us. Any comments on the tactics\u2026 Josh Raskin : The question I got Joe was just the -- I just wanted to know what the -- on the Starplus portion of that in Texas, what's the total revenues that you guys are -- at the run rate today? Joe Zubretsky : It's approximately $1.5 billion. Josh Raskin : Got you. And then, just last quick one on the flu, I know you said the $18 million was that relative to prior year or relative to guidance? Joe Zubretsky : Both. We expected a normal flu season which averages between $15 million and $20 million and it came $18 million higher which is about 40 basis points in the MLR for the quarter. Josh Raskin : Thanks. Perfect. All helpful. Thanks Joe. Joe Zubretsky : Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. First question is on the marketplace. Can you talk to us about what the updated margins assumed in your new guidance for the marketplace for the full year? And then, any early thoughts on your marketplace footprint for 2019? Joe Zubretsky : On the marketplace results Justin, we're still taking a very cautious view of the balance of the year. We beat our expectations in the first quarter with a 67% adjusted, MLR adjusted for the CSR benefits, 800 basis point improvement over last year. Obviously, the result of nearly 60% price increases we put into the marketplace. And as we said, we will confirm that those prices perhaps will be uncompetitive, but they weren't. And we beat our membership forecast by 50,000 members. We now have 450,000 members and a significant portion of that beat was in Texas, our most profitable state. The reason for the cautious approach is utilization is very back ended into the last three quarters of the year as each quarter progresses, you have special enrollment members utilizing enrollment generally is of healthier members during the year. And of course benefit design out of pockets and out of pocket maxs and copays obviously have an impact on the back half of the year. But, we want to make sure that we have our seasonality projection correct. And we also want to make sure that our estimates of risk adjusted revenue are accurate. As you know, we haven't been as accurate as we needed to be in prior years. We think we have a better methodology now, but we have not included a lot of outperformance in the back half of the year for marketplace. Justin Lake : Okay. So is there margin I think you said 4.6 was what you expected for the full year on your bids, but you were only in your guidance were flat to maybe a slightly positive margin. I'm just trying to figure out where on that -- cycle are you? Joe Zubretsky : You recall when we did our preliminary guidance when we announced our fourth quarter. We said that the marketplace had a low single-digit loss last year. And in our guidance, we reversed the loss and basically forecasted a breakeven result even though we price to a 4.6% target margin. And what I would say in our revised guidance is the first quarter beat in the market place is in our guidance, but certainly not a lot of improvement in the back half of the year. So we want to wait and see the second quarter before we get a really robust forecast of what the marketplace is likely to produce this year. But the target is still 4.6% on gross revenue. Justin Lake : And then, any early thoughts on marketplace footprint for 2019? Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : Yes. We are obviously in the process of developing our preliminary rate bids which as go in early June. We have decisions to make in Florida and New Mexico, if we lose our Medicaid contracts marketplace will be the only substantial business we have in those markets. Florida is seeing improvement this year and New Mexico is doing really well. It is possible, we would resubmit rates in Utah and Wisconsin. And certainly, the other states are performing well so there's no reason to believe that we wouldn't still be successful in our other states such as Washington, Ohio, in Michigan and California. Justin Lake : Great. Thanks. Operator : And our next question today comes from Zach Sopcak of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Zach Sopcak : Thanks for the question and congrats on the quarter. I want to circle back on the comments in Washington state. It sounded like it was within the expected variability. Just wanted to understand a little bit more what happened in the quarter those related at all to some of the expansion you had into the north central region starting this year. And if that's something that could occur in other states similarly as we progress through the year? Joe Zubretsky : It really wasn't related to the two regions that we procured. In the fourth quarter of 2017. We began to see the emergence of high acuity inpatient cases. We thought we had captured it in our reserves, but early in 2018, we saw some negative development in Washington related to high acuity inpatient. That trend continued for the first quarter date of service. I will tell you that inpatient cases are over $50,000 in total cost. The reported number of those cases increased by over 65% in the quarter. And I also think we dropped our guard a little bit on some of our utilization controls. In those cases hit the stop-loss threshold and revert to build charges you need intense concurrent review procedures and the resources to make sure that you're paying appropriate amounts. And I would say that our concurrent review resources in Washington will not keep pace with the additional volume. So we of course corrected that and we project Washington to have better performance in each of the next three quarters than we had in the first, but probably not back to our full year annual expectation. Zach Sopcak : Hey, guys. That's helpful. Thanks. And then, as you've brought in outside consultants to help with your RFP process. Can you contrast it all where you are now in that process as you look forward versus maybe when you were on the last quarter call and it sounded like you're just recently started engaging them? Joe Zubretsky : Well, I think the way I would characterize the entire process has been reengineered not just with external resources, but now that we have new leadership of our health plan operations bringing more local knowledge and subject matter expertise there and writing the proposals. It's just a better and more robust process that it will get better with time. So it's been reengineered from the bottoms up and we have a high degree of confidence that our Texas, Washington and Puerto Rico bid submissions were written in a high quality manner very responsive what the state wanted to hear about our capabilities and service profile. Zach Sopcak : Hey, great. Thanks for the questions. Operator : And our next question comes from Ana Gupte of Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Ana Gupte : Yes. Thanks. Good morning. The first one is on the guidance and it sounds like it feels like you've put the entire workforce reduction run rate in there in part on the marketplace and Medicaid and potentially not much else on the PBM. And you're at about 35 basis points you raised your net margin guidance. Wanted to get a sense for -- do you think assuming everything goes okay on the upside, will you get to your original target margins, net margins of 1.5 to 2 potentially this year and then you can you talk about the trajectory in 2019. And is there any upside there as well with any of additional levers? Joe Zubretsky : The way we think about it is, if you just ignore the $0.38 which are onetime operating items that we raised our guidance by $0.60 to $0.65 and we view that as a $0.40 [beat] [ph] on the first quarter. And $0.20, $0.25 raise on the rest for the year. That's just a cautious approach we're taking not only on marketplace, but across all our business lines, we want to see another quarter of positive experience emerge. As you know our previous guidance on net margin basis was 1.1 to 1.3. That's now 1.3 to 1.5 adjusted for the CSR. And if that's the starting point for a trajectory marching toward our 2% after tax a goal, we think that's a great starting point. And we'll talk more at Investor Day about what profit levers will pull to make up the rest of the way. So, if we can hit it, it's a great starting place. Keep in mind that this is the year where we got the benefit of a tax rate decrease and premium rates were already set. So there could be some \"tax windfall\" in our current profitability and we're mindful of that. But, if we could hit that net after tax margin included in our guidance great starting place to get to our ultimate goal of 2%. Ana Gupte : Okay, great. Thanks. On the risk adjusted, I noticed you had raised your payable estimate a little over $200 million from the fourth quarter and is that contemplate any third party data with weekly, you said you have a new methodology. And is that assuming the 350,000-ish that you have now on marketplace membership and do you feel it's adequately conservative. Joe Zubretsky : Joe, you pick up. Joe White : Sure. Its Joe White speaking. We have the -- we continue to refine our procedures for estimating risk adjustment liability. We have the same basic processes, we've always had we've had our internal estimates. We have third party estimates and we merged those two to develop an estimated at any given point in time. But I think it's fair to say we are being more conservative. This goes back to last year when given our experience with this, we thought it was appropriate to take a more conservative approach. So as you can see the balance has increased a bit this year that's a combination of just taking a conservative approach to 2018 and a little bit of adjustment in 2017. So we feel confident in the numbers right now. Ana Gupte : Maybe one final one, on Florida with Region 11, you had the ITN, was this something partly driven even by you and that you didn't want to incur any more runoff G&A and the state reduced the rates as well or was something else that came up during the negotiation process that caused you to not\u2026 Joe Zubretsky : First of all, we don't actually know yet why we were not awarded a contract in Region 11. We will potentially learn the reasons, but we don't know yet. But no, in full transparency, we went in attempting to secure the region whether it be the service profile and rates. And we were not awarded the contract. So as we learn more, I will certainly communicate that. And as I said, we're pursuing all avenues available to us to a) learn, why you weren\u2019t selected and b) is there anything we can do to reverse the decision? Ana Gupte : Got it. Thanks for the color. Joe Zubretsky : Welcome. Operator : And our next question today comes from Sarah James of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Sarah James : Thank you and congratulations on a great quarter. You've mentioned a few times today that there are multiple points of conservatism in your guidance. You've flagged specifically development in tax, so just wanted to make sure, if there are any other points that you feel you're being conservative as you view guidance now. And then, can you frame up the potential tax windfall for us. I know that the tax rate is variable, but maybe you can help us with the framework around the scale of variability there? Joe Zubretsky : Well, on the tax windfall for lack of a better term when we gave preliminary guidance assume all other things being equal, I believe is about 40 basis point; 40 basis points from the margin. And that doesn't mean that it will or will not be considered as we said future rates. But I just wanted to remind everybody that the rates -- premium rates were set before the tax regime changed. We're just being cautious and conservative across the book of business particularly on marketplace. I wouldn't cite any one reason -- any one product or any one geography. We had some outperformance this quarter, our [outperformance] [ph] doing well. But, we did not project a sustainability of outperformance throughout the rest of the year. Again just being cautious and conservative given the company's past track record of missing estimates and not forecasting properly. But I think with a really good second quarter data point, we should be able to give revised guidance at the end of the second quarter that hopefully is reflective of what we are [Technical Difficulty] full year rate. Sarah James : Great. You talked about hitting margin target through achieving medical management with an eye on SG&A cost maybe using external vendors or rent to buy strategy. Then, today you announced the termination of utilization and care management project. So I'm wondering is that the start of outsourcing some of this analytics work and can you provide any details on to what the alternative plan is for the -- start new project. Joe Zubretsky : Sure. First thing, I would mention is that the technology platform that was in-flight in our view was misaligned with our goals and objectives. It was implemented to produce administrative efficiency, but did not focus on clinical efficacy, UM, CM and DM. And so we want a business process and our technology platform to be squarely focused on managing our members to high quality care while producing a competitive MLR. And if it happens to save a few bucks of SG&A all the better. But we've got the platform that was being implemented with misaligned with that primary objective. Now we're not going to outsource core care management that is proprietary that's a differentiator. Our strategy that's emerging is one of -- who can manage high acuity members better than their competitors. So there might be technology components, there might be business processes that are very administrative that could be outsourced. But the core clinical activities of the company is a differentiator, is proprietary and will remain owned and operated by Molina. Sarah James : Great. And last detail here, was there any impact of the carve out of California, IHSS in the quarter or that could be reflected in full year guidance? Joe White : Hi, it's Joe White speaking. The impact of the IHSS carve out in 2018 was already reflected in our preliminary guidance and isn't particularly substantial anyway. Sarah James : Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Matt Borsch of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Matt Borsch : Sorry. Yes, thank you. Could you just a question on Texas and the market place in particular, I just noticed you cited the Texas market particularly for improvement and yet there's also a market where your enrollment expanded where it dropped very significantly in some others. So I'm just trying to understand is that, it looks little contrary to what I might have expected. What is it about the Texas situation that's different? Joe Zubretsky : I think Texas, Matt is simply a combination of two things. One, a very good and highly leveraged provider network and a stable risk pool. You have a combination of those two factors and you can actually make your target margins in this business with a great deal of predictability. And Texas has been the outstanding performer in the marketplace since we launched this business a few years ago and continues to be. So with 245,000 members up from 196,000, 197,000 last year, it's adding meaningfully to our earnings profile. Matt Borsch : Great. And also if I can just confirm, I think you had suggested that both Florida and New Mexico pretty sure New Mexico are running net unprofitable, is that correct? Joe Zubretsky : Are you referring to the marketplace, Matt? Matt Borsch : Oh, I'm sorry Joe. I was referring to overall. Joe Zubretsky : Overall? New Mexico struggled on Medicaid due to higher behavioral costs, but did well in the marketplace. Florida did as expected as you know it was in our list of turnaround plans and it performed better in the first quarter than prior year and in line with our expectations and the marketplace did show signs of improvement in Florida. Matt Borsch : And Joe if I may on both Florida and New Mexico, as you've done maybe some postmortem on the contract losses there. Do you see a common thread that you can point to or do you think they are truly one offs? Joe Zubretsky : I think there are much different situations. In New Mexico, we scored highly on technical competence service profile and all the technical components of the proposal that we lost on rates. We made a calculated judgment at the time that we did in the top quartile range -- the range of rates that was offered and still win. And that wasn't true. We have to bid at the medium, your rate taker in this business, not a rate maker and yet the profitability stresses of the company at the time it took a very conservative approach to bidding on rates. I come at it from a different point of view that you need to build medium and then figure out how you are going to make your cost structure work to squeeze out of your 2% after tax margin. In Florida -- being a Monday morning quarterback and having the benefit of hindsight. It was a not a well written proposal that wasn't responsive to the state's needs. And we did have some service issues in Florida caused by the incredible growth of the marketplace that sort of tainted our operating excellence in Medicaid costs and service issues. So I think that of the two quite different reasons. They are quite specific to those situations and certainly not the case with Texas and Washington which are two very well performing health plans in great businesses run by great teams. Matt Borsch : Joe, thank you very much and thanks to you and the team for the quarter and also all of this visibility on business. Joe Zubretsky : You are welcome. Thank you, Matt. Operator : And our next question today comes from Gary Taylor of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Gary Taylor : Hi, good morning. Just a couple of questions. One just looking at the California revenue run rate, is that just going back to the in-home support services, is that 100 million plus revenue drop just passed through and that's why the revenue is down, but the MLR is fine. Joe White : It's a combination. Its Joe speaking. Hi, Gary. It's a combination of that along with the fact we took a pretty substantial Medicaid expansion cut, I think in the neighborhood of 10% effective 71 last year. So it's those two factors. Gary Taylor : Okay. And then that's great. That goes to my next question, when we look at the Medicaid expansion revenue is down about 8% versus enrollment down 3%, you took that cut in July, but the per member per month for Medicaid expansion were kind of flat to down slightly 3Q, 4Q now suddenly they are down a fair amount? It looks more like something happened in the first quarter or is there some nuance to that? Joe White : Not that I'm aware of that Gary. We'll have to go back and look at that. Again that we don't see the major cut was for Medicaid expansion in California was in July. So essentially if you have some of what you're talking about essentially a mix issue among the states. Gary Taylor : Okay. And then, last question just getting to guidance. Why include the net non-recurring items in guidance particularly if it sounds like there is potentially some severance cost in the back half of the year, why not just guide an operating number excluding the CSRs and the severance, so the guidance doesn't get impacted in the second half, if there's some additional severance cost? Joe Zubretsky : Gary, really is just a stylistic question, we debated whether to leave it out of everything or putting in everything. We chose the latter. Certainly, we could have done that. But I would say that around the edges there will be restructuring continuing as you suggested. We continued to chip away at our administrative infrastructure. Keep in mind that as we unwind our operations in Florida, in New Mexico, there could be and there will be perhaps some severance costs, perhaps some lease write offs as we downsize those operations. We would prefer to transfer that infrastructure to one of the incumbents or one of the winners. We'll certainly try to do that, but there will be some restructuring probably whether we are due to those contracts. But including it was stylistic if anything -- is that responsive to your question? Gary Taylor : Do you have an Investor Day where will we have some additional visibility and magnitude of what some of those restructuring costs might be. I think generally the street would exclude those, but in this context they would obviously impact the guidance. So can you or will you give us some more insight into the magnitude of those? Joe Zubretsky : Yes. We have already started our unwinding plans. We certainly know the magnitude in ranges around what the potential these write offs, potential severance costs are. We will clearly update you at Investor Day on that. Gary Taylor : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Steve Tanal of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Steve Tanal : Thanks guys. Good morning. And just one thing on the MLRs, if we sort of X out or just look at an ex-PPD and MCSRs, it looks like MCR would have been up about 160 bps year-on-year about 40 of that from flu, it's ex-flu about -- up 120. Just sort of curious how you'd frame the conservatism you spoke to with respect to that number versus the core business and how we should think about that? Joe Zubretsky : I think the first thing, we have to do is parse the [indiscernible] development that Joe White and I talk about this often. So the $240 million number is certainly sizable and noticeable. Bear in mind that approximately $150 million of that is the explicit margin, we rolled into our reserves that due to the way it's accounted for in our disclosures always rolls off into the prior year and is then reinstated. So it's pretty much a wash. Therefore, you're really looking at $90 million of what I call actuarial base run-off in the quarter. We fully intended and our actual techniques to reinstate that level of conservatism in the first quarter date of service January, February and March reserves. And so, we believe that the P&L impact of reserve run-off in the quarter was negligible to minimal. If there was any impact, it's likely to be in the marketplace business because we are ultra conservative on setting those reserves at year end for a variety of reasons including our pricing repositioning. But our view is that we reinstated that level of conservatism into first quarter reserves and therefore the impact on the MLR in the quarter was negligible. And certainly the other puts and takes are our flu and some of the other smaller items. But I think the MCR except for that fact is actually pretty reflective of our performance in the quarter. Steve Tanal : Okay. Fair enough. And just a quick follow-up on guidance, the non-marketplace enrollment reduction of 64,000, what is behind that number, that's not Region 11, right which would take effect in 2019? Joe Zubretsky : Joe? Joe White : I know it's not Region 11. There's a -- that will be more or less consistent through the year. Couple of things are happening. One thing it'd been New Mexico where the loss of the contract there we're going to see an enrollment, an assignment for it beginning in the first quarter. We're also -- fourth quarter, I'm sorry, beginning in the fourth quarter of this year. We're also seeing a little bit of pressure in different states as a result of recertification and lower enrollment. So it's nothing dramatic, but there is a little bit of enrollment pressure. And as a practical matter we may see some loss of enrollment in Florida beginning in the fourth quarter just like we did in New Mexico. Steve Tanal : Got it. Thanks. Just lastly, out of Florida, what should we expect kind of closure on this the appeals and such you guys have a sense of that? Joe Zubretsky : I'm sorry, can you repeat that, we couldn't hear the first part of your question. Steve Tanal : Sorry about that guys. I was saying give a sense when you think you get closure on Florida, at this stage it sounds like the appeal is ongoing? Joe Zubretsky : It's a process that you go through. It will be resolved soon. And as I said before right now we are considering these contracts plus we are pursuing all of the avenues available to us but we are contemplating the unwinding of our Medicaid operations each day. But also focusing on whether we should stay in the marketplace in each state. But, the process goes through a very as you know winding and arduous process of meetings and filings and those types of things, which we don't -- can't talk about. But it will evolve here over the next few weeks, it will resolve by Investor Day, we certainly will report to you on the outcome. Steve Tanal : Thank you. Operator : Our next question today comes from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. Wanted to go back to the tax reform comments that you made sustainability when you mentioned the 40 basis points to margins from taxes, was that an overall benefit to the business in 2018 or is that a comment that that's kind of what potentially that risk because you look at just the exchange in the Medicare business and potentially seeing pricing pressure on that into next year? Joe White : Hi, Kevin. Its Joe White speaking. That's just basically an arithmetic calculation of moving from a 35% effective tax rate to 21% that 40% drop in tax rate would move up 1.5% after tax returns in the neighborhood of 1.8% and 2% to the neighborhood of 2.4%. So that just that would apply to anybody measuring the tax benefit on an after tax basis, is purely arithmetic going from 35% to 21%. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. So I guess is there a way for you to kind of quantify what you think that tax [Technical Difficulty] 2019 might be. I guess it's not clear 100% to me what you're assuming as far as 2018 benefit that gets maybe recouped by the states this year. Any color on that? Unlike what you think tax adjusted normalization and if they have got long term tax rates for you and it will get recouped by the states or not, repriced away or not where you think your run rate earnings are this year that we can kind of -- if you don\u2019t have a headwind that we're trying to fight against next year we understand what's the base number is this year? Joe Zubretsky : Well, you have the right question, the question that needs to be answered that is, what's the rate setting process going to take into consideration going forward? And as you know we are rate takers in this business, taxes are not as explicitly cited in rate reconciliations but they could be taken into consideration as states are projecting either what they're allowing for medical cost trend or [Technical Difficulty]. Now that the 21% tax rate is in the run rate of the business, I think we can stop talking about it and talk about rate adequacy going forward. And we'll certainly give you a view of what potential stresses there are from rate adequacy going forward as we talk about our future on Investor Day and how much of that we can erode through profit improvement initiatives. As our MCRs, as you can see by our disclosure are still running much higher than our competitors. So there's plenty of room for opportunity. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And then last question. It looks like you took down the Medicaid enrollment a little bit, you took up the exchange enrollment a little bit. How much of the MLR improvement is because of that mix shift into 70% MLR versus 90% of our business? Joe White : Hi. Its Joe White speaking. I think very little of that. That's all on the margins. Not going to have a huge\u2026 Kevin Fischbeck : Fine. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Jason Twizell of MUFG Securities. Please go ahead. Jason Twizell : Hey, thanks for taking the question. Just quickly around capital deployment given your improved outlook for EBITDA this year. And then also the dividending in capital associated with Florida and New Mexico to the parent in early 2019 is the expectation of whom to use it for debt reduction or is there a potential, do we looking at new markets or M&A or share buybacks? Joe Zubretsky : Jason the first thing you have to do is move toward a balance sheet that a managed care company ought to have. Obviously, the optionality in the balance sheet due to the converts need to be reckoned with. We took care of the 2024, 2020 is still out there. And so we'd have to deserve a cash position to \"funded demand\" for those notes should they be presented. Are part of our revolver still outstanding? So we could repay that and have some interest expense left. So yes the first thing to do is to sort of correct the balance sheet, the optionality in the capital structure. Delever get it down into a comfort zone of 50% to 55% percent initially, but that's we have earmarked for the cash generation initially. Before we start contemplating M&A or share buybacks or any of those other capital deployment techniques that once we hit steady state and start growing again we certainly would contemplate. Jason Twizell : All right. Appreciate the color. That was my only question. Operator : And our next question today comes from [indiscernible] of Baird. Please go ahead. Hello, Mr. [indiscernible], your line is open. It appears we have no further questions. I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. Ryan Kubota : Thank you all for joining us today. And we appreciate the time. Operator : Thank you, sir. Today's conference has now concluded and we thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, Ryan, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Last night, we've reported second quarter earnings of $3.02 per diluted share. This includes a $79 million positive impact or $0.92 per diluted share from settling the 2017 Marketplace risk adjustment payment. This also includes $0.09 per diluted share negative impact of net expenses primarily related to restructuring and debt extinguishment. Therefore, from a pure performance perspective, netting the $0.83 per share positive impact of these two items, we achieved second quarter fully diluted earnings per share of $2.19. These financial results are a strong indication that the early stages of our margin recovery and sustainability plan are working, as our focus on managed care fundamentals and a more rigorous performance management process is reflected in our improved earnings. Summarizing the key takeaways from the second quarter. Our Medicaid line of business performed slightly ahead of our expectations, and performance improved sequentially in the TANF line of business. The primary driver of improvement was contained to medical cost, particularly inpatient cost. Medicare continued to perform well in the second quarter as the medical care ratio remained flat at 85%, meeting our expectations for the first half of the year. Our SNP and MMP lines of business each contributed to this favorable result. Our Marketplace business has continued to outperform our forecast. It is becoming clear that the price increases we placed in the market along with improved retention of risk adjusted revenue are producing results that are projected to outperform our pre-tax target margin of 4.6%. From a local health plan perspective, our large, high-performing plans have generally continued to perform well. Many of our previously underperforming plans have improved considerably. Additionally, our health plans that are expected to experience major membership transition are also performing well. Our administrative cost ratio decreased to 6.9% in the second quarter and 7.2% year-to-date. This improvement is a combination of continued administrative cost containment and better than expected revenue. And we are committed to harvesting the benefits of administrative cost leverage over time. Finally, we have continued our focus on optimizing our capital structure and business portfolio. We have further reduced our debt, repaid the outstanding balance on a revolving line of credit, simplified our capital structure and have contracted to sell a non-core operating asset to produce additional excess cash at the parent company. Let me now provide a deeper look into the underlying operating levers and metrics. First, with respect to revenues, premium revenue increased by more than 4% from the first quarter of 2018. After setting aside the benefit from the 2017 Marketplace risk adjustment, premium revenue increased by more than 2% sequentially, and met expectations for the quarter. The increase in Medicaid revenue is largely attributable to the nearly 70,000 additional members we awarded in the new statewide Illinois contract that went live on April 1. Second, with respect to our medical care ratio, after removing the impact of the 2017 risk adjustment and CSR subsidies for Marketplace, our consolidated medical care ratio decreased sequentially by approximately 20 basis points to 87% in the second quarter. Across all product lines, we managed to a medical care ratio favorable to our expectations, despite cost pressures in our Washington and New Mexico plans. These results reflect the ongoing medical management improvements and provider contracting initiatives that we outlined at Investor Day as well as a continuation of the stable medical cost trends that began to emerge in the first quarter. Third, with respect to product line performance, our Medicaid business performed better than expected in the quarter. Medical cost trend was well managed, driven mainly by lower than expected inpatient costs. The medical care ratio improved sequentially by 100 basis points from 90.8% to 89.8% with meaningful improvement in the TANF line of business. With a medical care ratio of 90.3% for the first half, our Medicaid product line is performing better than expected, though still with room for continued improvement. Our Medicare line comprising the SNP and MMP products outperformed our expectations. And the medical care ratio was essentially flat compared to the first quarter at approximately 85%. We continue to demonstrate that we have a strong operational foundation for managing high-acuity members, and this point remains important as we contemplate the future growth phase of our long-term strategy. Our Marketplace business has continued to outperform our expectations. As you will recall, despite pricing the business to a 4.6% pre-tax margin, we remain guarded in our assessment of the performance of this business at the end of the first quarter. Now with the benefit of second quarter results, it is becoming clear that our Marketplace performance is exceeding our initial pricing target. Among the factors contributing to this improved performance are three specific insights we have gained as we pass the halfway point of 2018. First, our membership is attriting more slowly than expected, so our premium volume is better than expected. Second, we are outperforming our risk-adjusted revenue forecast. While the positive impact of the 2017 risk adjustment liability settlement is in a sense, non-run ratable, it does however indicate that we will likely outperform the risk adjustment pricing assumption for the 2018 underwriting year, which is now included in our revised guidance. And third, the risk profile of our reduced membership base and the related medical cost experience are consistent with our pricing assumptions. In summary, when scrubbed for the various out of period items, our Marketplace medical care ratio is approximately 69% for the quarter and approximately 66% for the first half of the year. This result is better than our pricing target and significantly better than our previous guidance. I turn now to the individual performance of our local health plans. The majority of our large health plans have continued to perform well and have met or exceeded our expectations. California, Michigan, Ohio, and Texas representing more than 50% of our premium revenue base continued to perform well across most lines of business, earning well in excess of our cost of capital. Washington continued to experience inpatient cost pressures in its Medicaid line of business, though through intense performance management improvements, medical costs have stabilized. We should see improvement in the second half of the year, which will be especially important because our successful re-procurement will yield projected membership increases starting in early 2019. Our two plans that are undergoing significant transition due to contract losses, New Mexico and Florida, continued to produce respectable results. In New Mexico, the Medicaid line has been pressured by higher than expected behavioral cost trends, but Marketplace has exceeded our expectations. Florida is also continuing to experience improved performance sequentially. However, the core performance improvement has been more than offset by a nine-month retroactive increase to the EAPG outpatient fee schedule for $26 million on a pre-tax basis. I turn now to administrative costs. We are continuing to improve our administrative cost structure and lower our G&A ratio through a number of ongoing initiatives. These ongoing efforts, timing effects and the leverage effect of incremental revenue have improved our G&A ratio in the quarter to 6.9%, down from 7.6% in the first quarter. Our near-term focus will be to extract the expenses related to the lost contracts in Florida and New Mexico, and limit the impact of stranded fixed costs for 2019, an outcome we remain committed to achieving. I turn now to the company's revenue and growth profile. We announced three significant RFP awards in the second quarter. First, we won all eight of our Washington re-procurement regions in May, maintaining our statewide presence and adding behavioral health services in all regions. As a reminder, the state has fully carved out the pharmacy benefit effective July 1 of this year which will cause our Washington revenue to decline in the second half by approximately $100 million. This should be offset by membership gains in the behavioral health benefit carve-in in 2019. Second, we were awarded two regions in the Florida Medicaid re-procurement. We are pleased that our negotiations resulted in the award of Regions 8 and 11, overcoming the initial loss of all of our Medicaid regions. In these two regions, we served approximately 100,000 members at the end of the second quarter with approximately $500 million of annualized revenue. Most importantly, this award preserves our ability to continue improving our margins in Florida, while expanding our Marketplace and Medicare businesses in this most important managed care market. Third, and most recently, in Puerto Rico, we've secured an island-wide contract currently scheduled to commence in November. With respect to membership, we had 326,000 members at the end of the second quarter in our two current regions. We are projecting at least a similar number of members in the new program, as we should be well positioned in the auto assignment process. We have also carefully analyzed the rate methodology to assess the profit potential of this market, and we are confident that we will be able to earn and sustain a return in excess of our cost of capital. Finally, a brief update on our New Mexico protest. Our protest is expected to be heard by the court in September. In the interim, a temporary stay we secured allows us to participate in the readiness review process for the new contract award. Until a different outcome is determined, we continue to manage the business as though it is in a run-off status. Changing topics to capital, we made significant progress in the quarter related to our capital structure and free cash flow at the parent. We repaid the outstanding $300 million balance on our revolving line of credit. We repurchased approximately $95 million of our 2020 convertible notes for a total cash outlay of approximately $210 million, reducing both our debt and the dilutive effects of the embedded call option. And as we announced in June, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell Molina Medicaid Solutions to DXC Technology for $220 million. We expect this transaction to close sometime in the third quarter. Net of transaction costs and taxes, this sale will generate between $150 million and $180 million of additional parent company cash. I turn now to our revised guidance. Our revised guidance for the year is $7.15 to $7.35 earnings per diluted share on a reported basis, an increase of $3 at the midpoint of our previous guidance range. However, from a pure operational performance perspective, we consider our full year guidance to be approximately $6.30 per diluted share. Allow me to unpack some of the components of our revised guidance. Our first half earnings per diluted share was $4.68. Excluding non-operating, non-run ratable items, we view our pure operating performance in the first half to be $3.70 per diluted share. For the second half, we are projecting earnings of approximately $2.50 to $2.70 per diluted share. Therefore, our full year guidance based on pure operating performance is approximately $6.30 per diluted share at the midpoint. Adding back the $0.96 of previously reported non-operating, non-run ratable items, yields revised guidance of $7.15 to $7.35 per diluted share. Through yet another lens, we view our $3 guidance raise as a $1.20 performance beat for the second quarter, a $1 performance raise for the second half, and an $0.80 increase to the non-run ratable items for the full year. The net income margin in our guidance for the full year is now a range of approximately 2.5% to 2.6%. Excluding the non-run ratable items of $0.96 per share mentioned previously, our guidance net income margin is approximately 2.2%, clearly exceeding our previous guidance range of 1.5% to 1.6%. We are mindful that these results have emerged from improving basic utilization control, claims management, care management and revenue retention processes, all of which are now governed through detailed and rigorous performance management. However, we remain cautious in our outlook as we are still in the early stages of our margin recovery and sustainability plan. We are pleased with the current trajectory of our financial results. If we continue to deliver on the elements of our turnaround plan for 2018, we will have built a strong baseline from which to achieve the 2019 and 2020 margin targets that we conveyed to you at our Investor Day in May. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom Tran for more detail on the financials. Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, Joe, and good morning. As described in our earnings release last night, we report earnings per diluted share of $3.02 and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.08, excluding the amortization of intangible assets. As Joe commented, these results were largely driven by our margin recovery initiatives and disciplined performance management. First, let me quickly highlight a few of the items that we call out in our earnings release. The incremental restructuring costs in the quarter are primarily related to the true-up of our initial lease abatement estimates, as we continue to rationalize our office space. We will likely continue to see additional lease restructuring costs over the next few quarters as we continue to rationalize our office space. As part of the 2020 convertible notes and embedded call option repurchase, we incur approximately $5 million of expenses. These costs primarily related to the acceleration of the remaining interest payments on those notes. I will now spend a few minutes discussing our reserve position. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and our position continues to be strong. The favorable development we experienced in 2018 from 2017 has held steady at approximately $220 million, including the explicit margin that we hold. We experienced intra-year favorable development in the quarter, but we intended to and believe that we have re-established the same level of conservatism in the second quarter's days of service medical costs. Days in claims payable are down approximately four days sequentially. The decrease is partially attributable to a reduction in the outstanding balance of provider settlements. Reducing our overall provider settlement balance is a testament to our focus on improving our claims handling protocols. Also, contributing to the decrease were continued improvements in our claims handlings, abilities and improvements in speed of payment. In addition, days in claim payable were also impacted by reserve related to flu costs that were established in the first quarter, but released in the second quarter. And while this may have had a sequential quarterly earnings impact, it has no impact in our first half run rate earnings. Turning to our capital structure and balance sheet, we will continue to look for strategic opportunities to de-lever the balance sheet as we outlined during Investor Day. As of June 30, 2018, the company had unrestricted cash and investments of approximately $350 million at the parent company. We intend to be more capital efficient at the health plan level, ensuring a well consistent and regular dividend flow to the parent company. At the end of the second quarter, our health plans had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately $2.2 billion, which represents approximately 350% of risk-based capital. Let me offer some additional thoughts on our revised guidance. We have raised our full year guidance to a range of $7.15 to $7.35 per diluted share, an increase of $3 at the midpoint from our previous guidance issue on April 30. This increase is comprised of the following. We exceeded our expectations in the second quarter by approximately $1.20 due to strong performance across all product lines. Secondly, we're adding approximately $1 to our original guidance for the back half of the year. We are cautiously projecting that our businesses will continue to perform well even with a substantial seasonal effect of the Marketplace business. The Marketplace medical care ratio excluding non-run ratable items was approximately 66% in the first half of the year. We expect the medical care ratio for the second half to be in the upper 70s as utilization is back-end loaded due to product design and natural shifts in membership mix and acuity. And third, adding approximately $0.80 to the non-operational non-run-rate items for the full year. In developing a revised guidance, we have considered the experience from the first half of the year in projecting the second half. However, we have maintained disciplined and cautious views of our lines of business throughout. Now, to bridge from our results in the first half of the year to our revised guidance in the second half. Our pre-tax income, excluding $84 million of non-run-rate items from our performance in the first half, is approximately $400 million. This compares to a pre-tax income of approximately $250 million in the second half. Approximately two-thirds of the difference in pre-tax income between the first and the second half of the year is related to the seasonality of Marketplace earnings. The remaining difference reflects higher administrative costs in the second half of the year due to the timing of technology and operation initiatives, marketing expenses and transition expenses in Florida and New Mexico. Regarding tax, the full year effective tax rate is approximately 35% to 36%, which is lower than our previous estimate of 38% to 40%. Due to higher pre-tax income in our current guidance, which is taxed at our marginal tax rate of approximately 22%. Finally, let me offer a few additional points of consideration relating to our revised guidance. The 2018 full year impact of our credit facility of repayment and convertible note repurchase, including the impact of the recent 2020 notes repurchase is approximately $0.10 to $0.15 per diluted share. Based on the information we have today, we have not included any potential impact of a retroactive change in the California minimum medical care ratio related to the expansion business for the period July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017. The guidance assumes no prior period development and does not include any additional restructuring costs that we may incur in the back half of the year. Our guidance was developed on the basis of GAAP rather than adjusted earnings per diluted share, which would exclude the amortization of intangible assets. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Josh Raskin of Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Good morning. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC : I guess the big question \u2013 morning, Joe. The big question I guess for me is just the one quarter significant turn in the MLR and the operation improvements that you made and I guess I'm just curious more color on exactly what you're doing and if you could just give us some color on maybe denial rates or pre-authorizations or things like that? Just so we understand what exactly is changing here, especially on the inpatient side? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure, Josh. At Investor Day, we laid out a very clear path to our margin expansion and recoverable \u2013 expansion strategy and sustainability, and we identified a portfolio of nearly $500 million of profit improvements to be harvested over a two- to three-year period. Many of those are raw execution at the local level, tiering out high cost providers, re-contracting ancillary services locally, achieving better and more consistent execution of basic utilization controls. This company had inconsistent processes. It had, in some cases, poor execution in some of our local health plans and by a rigorous performance management process, leading indicators that identify the number of authorizations that are going in, so that we can head off high acuity inpatient trends that are emerging, all of these are contributing to the very favorable medical care ratios that we're experiencing in the first half. And I will tell you that the more complicated end of those profit improvement initiatives, outsourcing, co-sourcing some of our specialty utilization controls in other things like that, including PBM re-contracting or adjusting the planning stages and we can provide more margin upside in the future. So at the early stages, we're executing well locally and its managed care fundamentals. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC : Got you, that's helpful, and it kind of leads into what my follow-up question would be, which is talk \u2013 you guys are sort of at that 2.2% which is kind of you were just at the $6.30, implies sort of a 2.2% margin which is at the low end of that target range that you guys laid out for 2020 or 2021, so it sounds as though you guys are two, maybe even three years ahead of schedule, your comments there make it sound like there's actually more opportunity, so I guess, as we think towards 2019, are we already in a position to say that that 2.2% to 2.7% is too conservative? Is there more upside in the potential margin going forward? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: At this early stage, Josh, we're willing to say and express a high degree of confidence in the margin ranges that we conveyed to you at Investor Day. I think as we get closer to developing our 2019 plan and look at where medical cost trends are landing, or looking at the strength of the rates that we're receiving from the states, we'll be in a better position to perhaps update those target margins, but at this point, at this early stage, we will convey to you that we are expressing a high degree of confidence in the margins that we projected. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC : And one last one, I apologize for asking third one, but the 2019, as you guys look at it today, assuming that maybe New Mexico doesn't go your way or what have you, do you know what is your run rate? What is your 2019 revenue run rate look like today excluding any other additional changes? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I think if you take a look at the Investor Day projection which included the complete loss of Florida Medicaid and the complete loss of New Mexico Medicaid and just pro forma back in $5 million to $550 million of recovery for Regions 8 and 11 in Florida, that's probably the one adjustment I would make to the revenue outlook we gave you at Investor Day. There's other puts and takes. Washington will probably have better membership next year due to our successful re-procurement. That might be aided by the behavioral benefit carve-in, but offset by the pharmacy carve-out. So there's all types of puts and takes, but I think the major item would be Regions 8 and 11, $5 million to $550 million of revenue in addition to the outlook we gave to you at Investor Day. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC : Okay. So Washington... Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: (32:02) offer one additional data point there is that we're obviously looking at the Marketplace and there are two markets that we have filed rates for which is Wisconsin and Utah that we may consider a re-entry. We will make that decision until a little bit later in the year, but that's also a potential upside in our premium income as well. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : The next question comes from Matt Borsch of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Matt Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yes. Thank you. Maybe I just pick up on that last comment. What is it that you would be waiting to see regarding the decision to re-enter or not Wisconsin and Utah? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Our decision to file the rates and then just pause until open \u2013 you have until open enrollment to make that decision. And I just think it's prudent to see every bit of data off your 2018 performance. The issues we had in Utah and Wisconsin were mostly related to a network that was too wide and too highly priced. And the team is working at developing a network that will support the prices that we file. I would suffice it to say that I'm inclined to say that we would re-enter, but we don't have to make a decision until the end of the summer. We're going to watch every bit of data emerge on 2018 to make sure we have this right and then we'll make the call at that point. Matt Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): That makes sense. And can you just talk to us about the \u2013 you mentioned probably not a huge thing, but the little bit of pressure in New Mexico from higher behavioral costs? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. New Mexico obviously is experiencing an epidemic of sorts of opioid substance abuse, opioid use disorder and the incidence rate is quite high. And it is putting pressure on the Medicaid line of business. We're on it. We're delivering the services we need to deliver. It's really not been reflected in the rates we got. So it's putting pressure on the MLR, but it's really that pure and simple that's what it is. Matt Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Does that relate at all to the IMD exclusion lifting in terms of what might be new? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: No, I don't believe so. I think it literally is just a one component of medical cost trend that is racing ahead of our price to expectation. Matt Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): All right. Thank you. Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : The next question comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Joe, you mentioned being well positioned to hit 2019 and 2020 margin targets. But obviously, your current 2018 guidance is already at the high end of the 2019 1.9% to 2.2% target. Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Obviously a high class problem to have, but I was hoping you can give us some color on where you think 2018 results may not be sustainable, like what portions of this 2018 upside might not be sustainable into 2019. Particularly, can you tell us where exchange margins sit for 2018 versus that 4.6% target? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. With respect to the Marketplace business, the rates that we filed are no longer what I'll call corrective. The last two rate filings were clearly corrective rate filings to get our prices where they needed to be in order to have a margin that is in excess of our cost of capital. The prices we put into the market this year that we filed are more reflective of the acuity of the members we think we'll attract, any benefit changes, although that's pretty limited in this product line, and medical cost trend. The strategy for 2019 in the Marketplace was to optimize our contribution margin, not to grow membership considerably, but not to allow it to attrit considerably due to competitive pressures. So, our outlook for 2019 Marketplace should be maximize margin, hold onto membership and let's see what happens, so that we can perhaps grow this business more aggressively in 2020. With respect to the core business, look, we're operating pretty well. Our Medicaid line of business at 90% for the first half. TANF at 90%, we think can still be a little bit better. ABD at 93%, we think there's more opportunity there. Expansion at 87% is probably where it needs to be. And our Medicare line of business at 85% is doing well from a medical margin point of view. The SG&A ratio is still a bit high. So there is more opportunity here. It's all about the rates and the strength of the rates you get. And as we also said at Investor Day, we always put in a hedge for medical cost trend inflections that you don't anticipate or a bad rate here and there. So, we remain guarded and cautious, but obviously, we're off to a good start and we still think there's plenty of opportunity for improvement. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Got it. So, if I could just follow up here. One, I'd asked about where your exchange margins are for 2018 versus that 4.6% target. Can you give us an idea? I mean, are they closer to 10% than 5%? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: In this first half... Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : (37:19) but I'm just trying to figure out magnitude. Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. On an adjusted basis, I mean, you really have to scrape out the CSR subsidy and the noise. If you scrape out the noise, we did just under 10% for the first half and I'll remind you that has the seasonality effect of the business. In the back half, we're projecting to be slightly over breakeven. And on the same basis of the target pricing margin of 4.6%, the guidance margin for Marketplace is just under 5.5%. So, we're beating the \u2013 our guidance calls for a beat to our 4.6% target pricing margin. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Got it. So then, I guess, so if margins and exchanges aren't going to be that big a headwind considering they are only slightly above your target and you're pricing to your target next year, what is the big headwind to next year? I think a lot of people when they look at these margins that you reported this year, that you updated guidance for, would look and say geez, it looks like it gives you the opportunity to kind of get to the 2020 margin in 2019. What's going to \u2013 in your mind, what are the key factors that kind of keep you from doing that? Are you going to guide to that 1.9% to 2.2%, meaning earnings is actually down next year versus this year, because that's what it sounds like you're saying. Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Obviously, we're not going to be giving 2019 guidance at this early stage, but... Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Sure. Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: ...in tracking the moving pieces, the major profit improvement initiatives that are what I call enterprise-wide, re-contracting our PBM, perhaps re-contracting some of our specialty UM, perhaps outsourcing or co-sourcing some of our IT and transaction services operations that would provide significant benefits along the lines that we conveyed to you at Investor Day, those are still in the planning stages and will provide benefit in 2019 and 2020. I always remain cautious about the rates we're going to get. Right now, the rate environment is what I consider stable. It's mostly meeting the actuarially soundness standard. It generally reflects the trends we are experiencing, but I always just remain guarded on the strength of the rates we're going to get. So if rate environment remains stable and strong and our profit improvements take hold as we think they will, perhaps there is upside, but again, it is too early in our turnaround plan to begin conveying expanded margins to what we conveyed to you at Investor Day. Let's wait till the end of the year, see how 2018 plays out, and when we give you 2019 guidance, hopefully there could be positive news there. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks for all the color. Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : The next question comes from Ana Gupte of Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Hey, thanks. Good morning. So the first question was about the SG&A guidance which you reiterated rather than I thought might be that there may be some improvements for 2018 and can you give us any sense of the outlook into 2019, given you've been taking down a lot of your corporate overhead and the like? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. We remain committed to the operating leverage, that is we're holding our operators accountable to actually holding fixed costs fixed and only adding a variable cost when volume is involved. Second, we continue to chip away. No major announcements, but every day, every month we find new opportunities. In the quarter, our administrative costs were sort of flat quarter-over-quarter. So the reduction in the G&A ratio was actually a function of the revenue line, rather than the cost line, and we do have a backend loaded SG&A forecast. The SG&A forecast is $50 million higher in the back half of the year than the front half as we deferred some improvement projects. We have the New Mexico and Florida transition cost to incur, and Medicare marketing season opens as you know in October, November. So there's potential upside there, but right now we're comfortable at our original guidance of 7.4%, and any reduction in that clearly is coming from the revenue line and not the cost line at this early stage. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : That's helpful. Thanks. So moving to revenue, can you give us an update on the Texas RFP and the resubmission by the 22nd, what is the timing on that and what kind of converse are you having? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: The resubmission was actually almost a nonevent. The RFP came out on July 23rd I believe, we have 30 days, so it's late August when it's due. There was only one noticeable change. So there was no change to the very technical requirements. They only gave you 30 days to respond, so they couldn't change much technically, what they did include was a more subjective element to the evaluation process to where the raters and the evaluators can inject more subjectivity and judgment into the raw scoring. Rates were still not part of the bid. We were comfortable and confident in our original submission. We remain comfortable and confident with our resubmission, and we're still hopeful that our six regions in Texas can expand to something north of 6% and south of 13% and we can expand our ABD revenue in Texas as a result of this. So we still remain very bullish and optimistic on the prospects there. Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I would add one more data point to that, to what Joe said is that the go live day has been pushed back... Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: ...by approximately five months, so it is now June 1, 2020. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : And the awards will still be in October to choose, I couldn't find that on the website? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: They have not given a date. They have not updated the date that they indicated they would announce the award. So we don't actually know. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Got it. One last one then, just you're getting to a point where just within a pretty short period of time you have shown remarkable turnaround, but there still seems a lot of runway for MLR improvements and broader margin expansion, would you consider maybe as new RFPs like North Carolina in particular, which is coming any day, bidding for that at this point or might you just stick with the, let's get through our margin turnaround and be cautious and that does put a dent a little on the potential growth for 2020? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Ana, it's the latter. We have to stay focused and committed to our margin recovery. And the keyword here is sustainability. That's the key question for us, that's the key question for you. And we actually think we are at the early stages of improving our core processes, the infrastructure to support the complexity of the revenue we take on in order to sustain these margins. And as I mentioned before, if we continue to be in a stable and actuarially sound rate environment and those profit improvement initiatives we conveyed to you at Investor Day, there could be margin upside here, but we remain committed and focused to the sustainability and margin expansion. And we have enough revenue right now to consider this a very solid franchise. We have a Mississippi implementation going in. We have an Idaho expansion. There's a potential LTSS opportunity in Ohio a year, year-and-a-half out. So there's plenty of growth opportunity in our existing footprint that we can focus on as we expand our margins and not get distracted with greenfield opportunities. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Super helpful. Thanks so much. Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Tanal of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess, just on the risk adjustment side, while certainly, I guess, not run ratable at this level, it does seem like you'd be setting up for another risk adjustment gain next year related to this plan of yours, so how do you suggest we sort of think about that year-to-year step down given the smaller overall footprint? And is that something you'd include in guidance as you approach next year? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, I think, Steve, I would make two comments. One, getting better at accounting for it is only half the battle, we actually have to get better at doing it and getting risk scores that are commensurate with the acuity of our population. We clearly got better at accounting for it, but we are actually getting better at actually doing it, and having a profit improvement emerge out of the improved risk scores that we're harvesting. I would tell you that the first half of 2018, our revenue profile on the revenue that we booked for the first half is reflective of the experience that emerged off of 2017, whether there's upside to that or not we'd have to wait and see. But the 2018 revenue is being recorded on the same basis of the experience that emerged out of 2017. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And then, so would 2019 guidance include some expectation of how that will run rate next year or would you exclude that from guidance kind of going forward? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, I'd answer the question maybe slightly differently than you even asked it, it's a question of how did we price? And again, when you're filing rates three, four months into a year that has experiences yet to emerge, you're forced to be cautious and conservative. So the 2019 rates that we filed actually included a risk adjustment outlook that was pretty consistent with the 2017 experience that emerged into 2018 and the 2018 experience that we have currently. If we get better at actually harvesting the risk adjustment scores that would be upside to our 2019 performance. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Understood. That's helpful. Okay. And then just excluding the risk adjustment, it would still look like there was a big drop in marketplace PMPMs especially sequentially I guess is the way we'd look at that. And I'm kind of curious to understand what drove that and I guess in doing that math, are we correct to adjust the CSR out of expenses as opposed to premiums? Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: That's correct, Steve. CSR is really a adjustment to the medical costs and if you look at the Q2 premium for marketplace, it is benefited from the risk adjustment from 2017. So that's why you had a little bit of a artificial lift, if you will. If you adjust it out, then Q1, Q2, they're fairly stable, Q1 stepping up to Q2 slightly roughly about $15 million, $16 million. So that's really the picture. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. So follow-up, it looks like a bigger step-up, but okay, and just lastly for me. In Washington, can you give us a flavor for the PMPM value of the RX carve-out versus the behavioral carve-in, are those pretty similar? And then may be just a little color on sort of the net impact of both of those as well as the membership gains as you enter 2019. It sounds like you're saying are net positive overall. And that's all I had. Thanks. Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Let me comment on the pharmacy carve-out, which was effective July 1 of this year. So, as Joe commented before, it's approximately $100 million of back half premium reduction. So behavioral health, on the other side, does not kick in until the first part of 2019. So there is a timing issue there, but what Joe commented before is that we feel optimistic that we will expand membership in 2019. So on top of picking up the behavioral health premium, then it possibly may more than balance out the loss of the pharmacy revenue. Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: The behavioral carve-in was worth about 10 percentage points in the rate, if you can use that in your model that might help you. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. And I appreciate the detail on the clean EPS, it's very helpful. But I was hoping you could also put the progress in terms of the $400 million to $600 million savings target laid out at Investor Day? And then which buckets would you say you're close to hitting the goal on? So, for example, it sounded like network and payment integrity were maybe the furthest along, this were laid out as being maybe up to $85 million, so if you could give us some perspective on those buckets and where you are in achieving them? Thank you. Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. I will say in the early stages here, the profit improvement is emerging out of better execution of utilization management on the front lines in the local health plans, one. Second, re-contracting, tiering out high cost facilities, re-contracting with re-contracted behavioral services in various geographies with outsourced vendors. So re-contracting utilization control and we've gotten a lot better at claims handling. When we say there's less going into the provider settlement pot, I mean that gets expensive. And so we're just getting better at straight through processing, auto adjudication, our rework rates are down, our provider settlements are down, more to go there, but it's all contributing to the early success we're experiencing here. I'd say those were the three major categories and better risk adjusted revenue retention. Those are the four categories that we're probably hitting hard right now. The enterprise-wide initiatives, all the re-contracting, potential outsourcing in the works, plans in place, execution for 2019 and 2020. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Can you comment to where you are towards hitting the $400 million to $600 million target? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: It's really hard to say. Many of the let's say locally deployed initiatives are hitting, the bigger ticket ones or not, but clearly when we developed our 2018 plan and looked at the strength of our rates, we know we needed more locally deployed profit improvement initiatives. In fact, when Hampstead Mac joined us we added over 100 basis points of revenue to everybody's profit improvement plan. So it's hard to say how much of the $500 million was actually harvested to date, but most of this is raw execution on the front lines on the three or four core processes that I mentioned. When develop our 2019 plan or perhaps at our next Investor Day, we'll do our re-accounting for the $500 million of opportunity, so you know how much is left, but I would tell you that a significant portion of that, the enterprise-wide initiatives has yet to have been harvested. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: That's helpful. And then on California, it looked like there was a good improvement on MLR there. I wanted to understand, was that just tax related or was there a meaningful improvement on the Medicaid side or anything out of period impacting California? Thank you. Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: These are basics fundamental of execution on our plan and that's why you see California has some improvement. There's also some \u2013 if you look at California first half \u2013 first quarter, second quarter, I mean loss ratio improved quite a bit. And that's pretty much across a lot of lines of business as well. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Dave Windley of Jefferies. Please go ahead. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, Joe, in your prepared remarks, you talked about the better performance on risk adjustment, and you expected that to flow through and that that was specifically now incorporated into your guidance. And so, I guess I'm wanting to perhaps parse apart the benefit that I believe you're calling out for 2Q from 2017 risk adjustment and perhaps the benefit that maybe you're including as run ratable in 2018 that would have come from what I believe you're saying is a lower risk adjustment payable accrual for 2018. Am I understanding that correctly? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. I think it's fair to say that our first half results, there's always puts and takes for the quarter as you adjust your outlook. But the first half results are a fair reflection of the strength of our risk adjustment position for 2018. So I would ask that \u2013 as we talked about a $3.70 pure performance first half that is reflective of our 2018 risk adjusted revenue outlook for the marketplace. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Got it. And similarly all incorporated into the 5.5% that you answered to Justin? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: That is correct. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Right. Okay. And looking at some of your variance around your rates in the exchange business, you have a couple states where it looks like you're looking for double-digits in a couple of states, where you're bigger, you're looking Texas and Washington for example in the low double digits and New Mexico, Michigan may be closer to flat. Can we think about kind of specifically in exchange, are those being reflective of particularly the lower ones, where maybe you're kind of over earning and believing that you're hitting caps and essentially bidding back to a normal margin? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Fair point. The only plan where we're bumping up against the minimum MLR is New Mexico. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Because it's a three-year rolling average, we still have enough of the old experience in the calculation where we're generally avoiding that for this year and probably for next. It's a very fair characterization that our rates are no longer corrective. They are now reflective of the acuity of the membership we believe we will track, of the trends we are experiencing and always with an outlook of where the competitors are. So this is a blind bidding process as you know, so you could talk to yourself and convince yourself that your rates are okay and you'll track membership, but you always have to have an outlook of where is your product price juxtaposed against the competitors, where do you think they'll land so you have an outlook of what type of membership. So we do a very detailed elasticity of demand study on where our pricing is. And that's how we prepare our rates, whether they're mid single-digits or low double-digits, it's always reflecting trend and then juxtaposed against where we think our competitive pricing is, and where the competitors will land, so we can attract the membership we plan to attract. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Appreciate that. And then last one real quickly, as you've now made substantial progress in cleaning up the balance sheet and you're obviously focused on profit improvement and organic operations here, but as you start to generate some cash flow and don't have balance sheet applications for that in the immediate, how do you think about capital allocation, say, beyond the very near-term? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, right now, we're still focused on our recovering sustainability plan. We are not really looking for inorganic opportunities. I will tell you that in the near-term opportunities that we've identified in some of our existing footprint, if we can harvest that revenue over the next year or two, it will require risk-based capital to be deployed in our local health plans. So as we outlined to you at Investor Day, there is $1.5 billion to $3 billion of opportunity, we only squeeze $600 million out per year for each of the following two years. If we went more aggressively at that, figure around 10% to 15% of that revenue being tucked away as statutory capital, which by the way is the highest and best use of excess cash flow, as it produces north of 30% levered returns. So we're very focused on driving the value of our business through our existing footprint first. We will look to then greenfield opportunities later and if our currency trades well and we can get back in the M&A game at some future date, then we would do that. But right now focusing on organic growth opportunities that will require our free and excess cash flows to be deployed locally as statutory capital. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Appreciate the answers. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. Just wanted to kind of follow up on one of some of the earlier lines of questioning just because the order of magnitude of performance and improvement this year is pretty surprising. So I just wanted to understand if there is anything else kind of this year that looks maybe one-time in nature. I guess you mentioned $26 million of Florida retroactive payments. But is there anything like that that says that this base might not be quite the starting point when thinking about 2019? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: No, I think we tried to give you all a very clear picture over how the business was performing and we actually think that first half sort of pure performance picture of $400 million pre-tax, 240-plus million after tax and $3.70 is a very clean and accurate view of how the business is performing. There's puts and takes all over, but for the most part with respect to our product lines, our local health plans all aggregating to the consolidated view we, think that's a pretty good picture. Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I would also add to what Joe said here. I'm sorry. But we have a very high visibility to our premium rates already for the year. So that's pretty good locked in pretty close to 100% that we know about. So the balance is really managing our medical cost structure. So we have good sense on that side, so that give us comfort level to look at second half of the year. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then, with the Medicaid Solutions sales, it looks like they didn't generate much gross profit at all. Does that mean that it was losing money on a net income basis, so divesting that business is going to be accretive even before you take into account what you do with that cash? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: No, it's pretty much a push on the EPS line. If you assume you're going to repay debt with the proceeds, it's a push on the EPS line. It generated about $30 million of EBITDA and $7 million of EBIT on an annualized basis. So the multiple we got for it was actually quite attractive. But it's a push on the EPS line if you assume we'll repay debt. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Great. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. You touched on this a little bit but for the Marketplace business, just to kind of clarify a little bit further. Separate from your decision whether or not to re-enter Utah and Wisconsin, just based on your pricing strategy, are you budgeting right now for membership growth in the Marketplace in 2019 in the existing states or do you anticipate just based on your pricing strategy it's more likely it could be down or is it still really just too early to tell? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: It is too early to tell. But I can only tell you what we strove to achieve in our pricing strategy, which was to \u2013 except for Utah and Wisconsin which are separate, to maintain the membership profile that we have and maximize the contribution margin dollars. And so put a price in the market that remained competitive juxtaposed against the competitors that would show well on the exchange, maintain the membership profile, don't try to grow it, but make sure it doesn't attrit, and maximize the contribution margin dollars. That was the strategy. And then of course, if we're successful in launching Utah and Wisconsin, that would be added membership. But the strategy wasn't to grow it or let it attrit. It was to maintain it and maximize profit. Steven J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Then just a real quick housekeeping question, for the $79 million risk adjustment payment, thinking about how that may have been allocated by state, is it safe to assume that some of the states where you have the lowest Marketplace MLRs like in California and Florida probably had the heaviest weighting of the risk adjustment payment in 2Q 2018? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. Steven J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I mean, you obviously had a 28% Marketplace MLR in Cali, 39% in Florida. But then Texas is your biggest state but that actually had one of the highest state MLRs in the Marketplace at 73%. So I was just kind of curious just to kind of confirm what's probably obvious around the allocation there. Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Sure. Very fair question. And the bulk of this risk adjustment item from 2017 pertain to the largest states such as Texas, and the rest I won't go into the detail of that, but certainly if you look at from an allocation perspective, the typical market share that you see from our Marketplace state-by-state, that will be a way to look at it. But Texas is certainly the lion's share of that adjustment. Steven J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: No, it is. Okay. Okay. All right, great. Thanks. Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Operator : The next question comes from Gary Taylor of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. A lot of my questions have been answered. Just one quick one on the Florida out-of-period benefit which looks like it would've been $0.31. I mean, the reason you don't I guess sort of back that out of kind of the clean earnings number or the go-forward number is just that there's probably other smaller positive, negative adjustments throughout the quarter or various quarters. Is that why that wasn't explicitly sort of backed out like say $0.96 plus? Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Gary, I'm not sure when you say the Florida adjustment, I'm not sure, what you... Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah, maybe we didn't understand. This was a earlier comment, but I thought you said the quarter included $26 million pre-tax of out-of-period payments in Florida related to I think the higher outpatient fee schedule which... Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah, yeah. That's correct. Yes, the industry in Florida was handed $185 million update to the EAPG Fee Schedule, $26 million of it related to us, we recorded it in the quarter. Yeah, there were other, I mean, there's so many other puts and takes in the quarter, we thought we'd call it out, because it was sort of an industry phenomenon and it was sort of known out there and clearly something that masked the true performance, the core performance of Florida was actually pretty good this year and it sort of masked that. So we thought we'd call it out. But that's what that's related to. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then my other question is as we think about, Joe you had mentioned this, limiting, minimizing the impact of stranded costs as you exit New Mexico and Florida Medicaid revenues. And you said you're committed to that, I guess the question is how should we think about that in terms of a 2019 headwind. When you say limit the impact, is it plausible to get that to something that's fairly de minimis in terms of EPS impact or it's going to be a measurable impact regardless but you're going to get it as low as possible? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, if you recall in our margin projection, we included $50 million pre-taxed of a headwind in 2019 due to stranded fixed costs for the combination of New Mexico and Florida. The fact that we've actually now retained over $500 million of our Florida revenue, that $50 million is more like $40 million. So it's already included in our margin forecast for 2019, but I'm not satisfied until we actually try to solve for it. We just thought it was prudent and cautious to say it could get stranded, but we have teams of people who are working on extracting the variable costs, the step variable costs and the next step would be get at the fixed cost that could get stranded if we don't get at it quickly. So we are committed to trying to outperform that assumption, but it was already included in our 2019 margin projection. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That's a good reminder. I appreciate it. And last follow on to that would be New Mexico, I think, has been unprofitable from Medicaid perspective, you talked about behavioral being an issue, so I'm presuming kind of all-in that's still unprofitable, so is there a measurable EPS tailwind as you exit the New Mexico Medicaid or that's sort of encapsulated in some of the stranded cost estimate also on a net basis? Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: No, when we projected 2019 margins, we extracted the contribution margin from the Medicaid business. As I said, included the stranded fixed cost, that's already been embedded in there. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Got it. Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yes. It's already been embedded in our forecast. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: You're welcome. Operator : The next question comes from Zack Sopcak of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Zachary Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, thanks for the question. Can I just ask quickly on cash flows in the quarter, operating cash flows turned negative after a strong first quarter, anything in there surprising or was that in line with how you're thinking about how they would sequence through the year? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Mostly timing of \u2013 I'll kick it to Tom, but mostly just the timing of cash flows related to some of the receivables we carry. Tom, you want to elaborate? Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Sure. I mean, you look at the operating cash flow, it was down definitely and primarily related to the receivable and the timing of receipt of premium in certain states, some of the larger states California, Florida, Ohio, Washington, they're more or less temporary in nature. And also we have HIF, health insurance fees receivable that we don't get settled with say until later part of the year. And one other data point is that with the reduction in our Marketplace membership, went down by more than half, you would see that medical claims payable related to that also came down. Therefore it'll affect cash flow as well. Zachary Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That makes a lot of sense. That helps, thanks. And quickly just one of the first questions I asked about 2019 revenue discussion you had at Investor Day, and you talked about potentially a tailwind from Florida and you talked about puts and takes on Washington, does Puerto Rico expansion at all factor into that or is it too early to have an idea of what impact that could have for next year? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Puerto Rico could provide some upside, but we did not include any upside. At the time, we prepared our forecast... Zachary Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: ...it was unclear whether we'd even be successful in Puerto Rico. Now that we have been, we're actually pretty confident that we'll do very well in the auto assignment process for the Commonwealth, and we could see some membership growth from our 320,000 members, but that was not included in our forecast at the time, nor was any loss of membership. We pretty much forecasted status quo. Zachary Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, great, thank you. And congrats on the quarter. Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's question-and-answer session and today's conference call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, Ryan, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Last night, we reported third quarter earnings of $2.90 per diluted share and $7.60 per diluted share for the nine months ending September 30, 2018. For the quarter, net non-run rate charges were $30 million or $0.35 per diluted share. These charges resulted primarily from a mandated retroactive adjustment for a minimum loss ratio floor and risk corridor on the 2016 California Medicaid Expansion business, partially offset by the gain on the sale of MMS. This adjustment is described in our earnings release. For the nine months ending September 30, 2018, net non-run rate benefits were $54 million or $0.59 per diluted share. Therefore, from a pure performance perspective, after considering these non-run rate items, we achieved fully diluted earnings per share of $3.25 for the third quarter and $7.01 for the nine months ending September 30, 2018. I also note that the quarter included $0.34 in tax benefits, mainly to adjust our year-to-date effective tax rate to a lower projected tax rate in recognition of our improved outlook for full year earnings. The nine month results however fully reflect our projected full year tax rate. We are very pleased with the continued improvement in the performance of our business, and our financial results reflect the significant progress we are making in executing our margin recovery and sustainability plan. Now, for a deeper look into the underlying operating leverage and metrics : First, with respect to revenues, premium revenue decreased by approximately 4% from the second quarter of 2018, and approximately 2.7% after removing the impact of the retroactive California risk corridor adjustment. The decrease is largely attributable to the expected seasonal decline in Marketplace membership, the Washington Medicaid pharmacy carve-out effective July 1, and the effective rate changes for July 1. Our Medicaid and Medicare volumes remained strong. Second, with respect to our control of medical costs and the resulting medical care ratio, we continue to produce sequential MCR improvement. Our pure performance medical care ratio excluding the retroactive California risk corridor adjustment was 86.4% in the third quarter, a 60 basis point improvement over the second quarter MCR of 87% on a pure performance basis after adjusting for the benefit of the 2017 Marketplace risk adjustment and cost-sharing reduction. Medical costs across all the health plans and product lines were largely stable, and in many places improved when compared to prior quarters. Our medical cost baseline continues to develop favorably, and we have managed cost trend to below our forecasted trend rate. Now that we have credible nine-month data with good visibility into the underlying medical economics, we can attribute the improvement to many of the early actions the company has taken to improve its performance. Most notably, we have re-contracted high-cost providers in our networks. We have added additional resources to frontline utilization management and improved execution of utilization controls and care management protocols. This has resulted in lower rates of hospital admissions, ER visits and short in-patient stays, as well as reduced lengths of stay for hospital admissions. We have improved claim payment integrity processes by enhancing our software platforms to ensure we pay for services appropriately, reducing errors and duplicate claims and executing better on coordination of benefit recoveries, and we have achieved better performance in retaining at-risk revenue by improved risk borrowing (06:50) and quality measurement. All-in-all, we have enhanced our ability to manage and forecast medical costs, all while ensuring our members receive the high-quality service they deserve at the right time, at the right price, and in the right setting. I turn now to our control of administrative costs. We have continued to improve our administrative cost structure and to lower our G&A ratio through a number of our ongoing initiatives. We have reduced our administrative expense sequentially in each of the last three quarters through the following actions : First, we have managed our head count to align with activity and transaction volumes. Since the beginning of the year, we have reduced our head count by more than 600 positions, or over 5% of our workforce. Second, we have continued to streamline our management ranks and managed bands (07:43) of control. Third, we have eliminated spending on certain IT projects that in our view were not creating value. Fourth, we continue to steadily reduce our excess real estate capacity. And fifth, we have negotiated lower unit costs in many of our labor and non-labor contracts. We will continue to scrutinize all aspects of our administrative cost structure. However, we anticipate that administrative expense in the fourth quarter will increase due to the seasonality of some marketing programs and the commencement of many of our transformation initiatives that will produce benefits in 2019 and beyond. We also made significant progress in the quarter related to our capital structure and free cash flow to the parent. In the quarter, we continued to deleverage and reduce the share count volatility associated with our convertible notes. We closed on the sale of MMS, delivering approximately $230 million of cash to the parent, and we recently announced the sale of Pathways, a non-core asset for a nominal purchase price. The transaction closed in October, and we estimate that we will record a loss on the sale of approximately $0.60 per diluted share in the fourth quarter. Our capital structure is stable, cash flows to the parent entity are strong, and our credit metrics are sound. This positions us well for beginning the conversation about a potential credit rating upgrade which could lower our future cost of debt. I turn now to the performance of our product lines. Our Medicaid product performed well compared to the second quarter. On a pure performance basis, our Medicaid MCR was 89% compared to 89.8% in the second quarter. Our ABD and Expansion products drove the improvement, while we experienced slightly higher medical costs in our TANF product which still has much room for improvement. Medicare generally performed in line with our expectations, but deteriorated sequentially with a combined medical care ratio of 87.3% compared to 85% in the second quarter. On a nine-month basis, the total medical care ratio is in line with our expectations at 85.7%. The sequentially elevated MCR was in the integrated MMP plans, and largely attributable to certain revenue transfers between the Medicare and Medicaid lines of business, which had no impact on our consolidated result. Our DSNP product continues to perform very well and serving the dual-eligible population is a key area for our future growth. Both our MMP and DSNP products benefited from our improved collection of risk score data and our ability to retain quality withholds. Our Marketplace business has continued to perform well, achieving a pure performance medical care ratio of 65.3% compared to 68.4% in the second quarter after removing the impact of the non-run rate items. This 310 basis point improvement was driven by lower medical costs and higher revenue from better risk score performance and better-than-expected membership retention. We have not yet observed the seasonal in-year utilization increase we experienced in prior years. Marketplace is now performing at an after-tax margin of approximately 9% to 10% for the full year, well ahead of our pricing expectation while only triggering the minimum MLR in one market. The pricing actions that we took in 2018 increased our average rates by nearly 60%. Based on our performance year-to-date, we are pleased at how well our forecast of expected cost trends and membership mix aligned with the rate increases we delivered. I turn now to the performance of our local health plan. The majority of our health plans have continued to perform well, as a result of our new operating model, which mandates local execution and decision-making with stringent enterprise oversight and performance management. Michigan, Texas and Washington continued to perform well across most lines of business. Michigan saw improvement from slightly higher premium revenue and continued in-patient cost improvement, as the health plan is focused on reducing short-term in-patient stays. Texas with more than 50% of our Marketplace revenue, improved sequentially. While much of the improvement was due to lower medical costs and improved revenue retention in Marketplace, the Medicaid and Medicare lines of business combined also performed slightly better than expected. We remain positive on our prospects with the reprocurement of the STAR and the STAR+PLUS contracts. Washington has continued to reduce the in-patient cost pressures in the Medicaid product that were identified earlier in the year to a more intense utilization management approach. Also, as you will recall, Washington carved out the Medicaid pharmacy benefit in the third quarter and our results now reflect the corresponding premium and medical cost declines associated with that carve-out. In the quarter, we also made significant progress on many future value-creating initiatives. Most notably, our Mississippi Health Plan went live on October 1 as a new entrant into a market with two existing health plans. As a start-up plan, we will receive all of the auto assignment membership until our health plan reaches 20% of the total membership in the program. We currently expect to end the year with approximately 20,000 members and the projection for 2019 could be as high as 90,000 members by the end of the year. Our new island-wide contract in Puerto Rico is expected to go live with approximately 290,000 members, a slight decline from our prior two region membership roles, but with significant potential for additional membership. We remain confident that we will be able to earn and sustain a return in excess of our cost of capital. And finally, the court has not yet issued a ruling on our protest in New Mexico. Pending the court's decision, we are managing the run-off of the New Mexico Medicaid plan and transitioning the membership. We will remain in the Marketplace and Medicare business in New Mexico in 2019. I turn now to our revised guidance. Our revised GAAP guidance for the year is $8.80 to $9.00 earnings per diluted share, or an increase of $1.65 at the midpoint from our previous guidance. On a pure performance basis, our revised guidance is a $2.60 per share increase. Our GAAP guidance and our pure performance guidance are expected to be nearly identical, as the non-run rate benefit for the first nine months will be offset by the loss on the sale of the Pathways business. Tom will elaborate on guidance in a few minutes. Assuming the achievement of our full year guidance, we step back and look at our businesses for the full year 2018 through the lens of our margin recovery plan. Our Medicaid business is a solid franchise, has a diversified footprint, great product depth and with an after-tax margin between 2% and 2.5% is now performing very well, although there is still significant room for improvement. Our Medicare business with annual revenue of approximately $2 billion is favorably positioned in the duals market and is performing well having now achieved after-tax margins between 3% and 3.5%. And our Marketplace business, after years of corrective pricing actions and instability, is not only stable, but is now producing after-tax margins of 9% to 10%. Measured off of any starting point we could choose, Marketplace is a significant part of this overall margin recovery story. On a consolidated basis, we expect to achieve an after-tax margin of 3.2%, which, for the first year of this turnaround, is a result we are very pleased with. I will close with some preliminary thoughts on 2019 as we head into the fourth quarter. While it is too early to provide detail on 2019 earnings, I can provide the following observations as we see them today. At the midpoint of $8.90 pure performance guidance EPS for 2018, we have a very solid earnings baseline, and within a range margins that are sustainable and have less potential for volatility. In short, the quality of earnings in 2018 is high. Against this backdrop of a solid 2018 earnings baseline, we are currently in the process of developing our 2019 financial plan and evaluating all of the factors that will impact our 2019 earnings trajectory, including the continuation of the positive momentum we have in managing medical cost trend, the continued adequacy of our Medicaid rates, the competitiveness of our Medicare and Marketplace rates once our competitors rates are known, how much of the significant profit improvement plans we previously communicated will manifest in 2019 earnings, and while we are effectively managing the total and partial runoff of the New Mexico and Florida Medicaid contracts, the potential for some level of stranded fixed cost still exists. Over the long term, management is committed to increasing both operating earnings and earnings per diluted share above the levels of our 2018 full year guidance. We are currently developing our 2019 financial plan. This plan will fully consider the solid 2018 earnings baseline and these other factors, all of which will determine the 2019 earnings trajectory. We look forward to reporting that outlook to you in February when we announce fourth quarter earnings. We are very pleased with our results to-date. We remain committed to executing the fundamentals of managed care and ensuring that our operating and financial platforms can produce sustainable results. When this is done, we will turn our focus to positioning the company for the inherent growth in this very attractive government managed care sector. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom Tran for more detail on the financials. Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, Joe, and good morning. As described in our earnings release, we report third quarter's earnings per diluted share of $2.90 and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.97 excluding the amortization of intangible assets. These strong results were driven by the continue improvement of our day-to-day operational processes that affect medical costs and administrative expenses, favorable cost trends across most of our products, as well as our ongoing margin recovery initiatives. First, let me quickly highlight a few of the items that we call out in our earnings release, particularly as it relates to the $0.35 earning per diluted share of out-of-period non-run rate items. Regarding California, the state imposed a retroactive risk corridor for the state fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, which we noted last quarter as a potential exposure. The state formally present their contract amendment this quarter, which we then agreed to. As a result, we record in the quarter a $57 million pre-tax charge or $0.65 per diluted share. This charge has little impact on how we view the profitability of our California Medicaid business going forward. Excluding this charge, the California Medicaid Expansion product operated within an acceptable medical care ratio in the quarter. We recorded a $5 million benefit in the quarter for Marketplace cost-sharing reduction or CSR subsidies for 2017 days of service. This benefit relates to the reprocessing of claims data for CSR-eligible members and allow us to reduce our liability with CMS. We recorded a $37 million pre-tax gain on the sale of our MMS subsidiary, which we sold for approximately $230 million. We recorded $5 million of restructuring costs in the quarter primarily related to two items : the ongoing true-up of our initial lease abatement estimates, as we continue to rationalize our office space; and cost associated with our 2018 IT restructuring plan that is focused on improving our IT operations with outsourcing and/or co-sourcing various aspects of the technology function, which will provide significant future cost savings. Finally, as part of the repurchase of the 2020 convertible notes and related embedded call option termination, we incur approximately $10 million of expenses. These costs primarily related to the acceleration of the remaining discount amortization on those notes, as we continue to simplify our capital structure. Regarding our tax position, our full year effective tax rate improved to a range of 32% to 33% from 35% to 36% per our previous guidance due to improved earnings for the year, as our marginal tax rate is approximately 22%. This improvement result in a third quarter benefit of $0.34 earnings per diluted share. However, for the nine month ending result fully reflect our expected annual tax rate, so our nine-month result need not be adjusted for tax items. I will now spend a few minutes discussing our reserve position. Our reserve approach is consistent with prior quarters, and our position remains strong. The favorable development we experienced in 2018 from 2017 has increased slightly to approximately $230 million, including the explicit margin that we hold. We continue to have favorable intra-year reserve development and as we have stated in the past, we intended to include the same level of conservatism in the quarter and reserve balances. Days in claims payable are up approximately 4 days sequentially. Approximately 2 days of the increase are attributable to the expansion of the quality review process for claims payment, which involves certain extra review steps prior to finalizing payment. The remaining 2 days are due to normal fluctuations in the reserve balance. Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow, we have continue to look for strategic opportunities to delever the balance sheet as we outlined during Investor Day, and our capital actions year-to-date have result in a benefit of approximately $0.30 earnings per diluted share for the year. As of September 30, 2018, the company had unrestricted cash and investments of approximately $390 million at the parent company. We continue to be more capital efficient at the health plan level, ensuring a more consistent and regular dividend flow to the parent company. At the end of the third quarter, our health plans had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately $2.1 billion, which represent more than 350% of risk-based capital. Our operating cash flows are strong. However, operating cash flows was negative in the quarter, primarily due to our payment of the Marketplace risk transfer for fiscal year 2017. Let me offer some additional thoughts on our revised guidance. We have raised our full year guidance to a range of $8.80 to $9.00 per diluted share, an increase of $1.65 on a GAAP basis and an increase of $2.60 on a pure performance basis at the midpoint from our previous guidance issue on August 1. This increase is comprised of the following : First, our medical cost baseline continues to develop favorably, and we have managed cost trend to below our forecast trend rate. Second, we project that our Marketplace product will perform better than we previously projected due to better revenue retention and lower medical costs. And third, we expect that performance of our Medicaid product will remain steady in the fourth quarter. Now, to bridge our result in the first nine months of the year to our revised guidance in the fourth quarter; our pure performance earning per diluted share was $7.01 for the nine months ending September 30, 2018. We estimated that our fourth quarter earnings per diluted share at the midpoint of approximately $1.90. On a sequential basis, our fourth quarter earnings per diluted share is projected to be lower than our third quarter's earnings, primarily due to three reason : First, the expected Marketplace seasonal decline in membership and increase in medical costs. Second, the catch-up benefit from the lower effective tax rate in the third quarter will not repeat in the fourth quarter. And third, an increase in our general and administrative expense ratio for the fourth quarter, which is projected to be at 8%. This increase is due to seasonal spending, including sales and marketing initiatives related to the open enrollment period for Marketplace and Medicare, expenses related to certain IT projects that were delayed from the third quarter into the fourth, and expenses relate to certain transformation initiative that began in the third and fourth quarters which will contribute to 2019 earnings and beyond. Finally, let me offer a few additional points of consideration relating to our revised guidance. Our guidance assumes no prior-period development, and our guidance was developed based on GAAP rather than adjusted earnings per diluted share, which would exclude the amortization of intangible asset. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Joe, thanks for the 2019 outlook. Maybe you can give us a little more color there in terms of just starting with the 2018 numbers. Can you talk about what you think a reasonable jump-off point for 2018 is versus the $8.80 to $9.00? Are there areas where you don't think the margins are sustainable, like potentially the 9% to 10% in the individual business? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure, Justin. When you cut through all the puts and takes of the quarter, it's a solid $3-quarter and a very solid $9-year, our guidance at $8.90 at the midpoint. The quality of earnings in 2018 is very strong, and we think that's a great jumping-off point for planning our trajectory into 2019. I cited the various factors that one always takes into consideration when forming a plan : the continued strength of our Medicaid rates; the competitive positioning of our Medicare and our Marketplace rates, can we continue to manage our medical cost baseline and trend as effectively as we have this year. And then certainly, the $500 million of profit improvement initiatives we outlined for you at Investor Day certainly some of that has inured to the benefit of 2018, but most of that is still yet to be harvested. So, the 2018 baseline is a great jumping-off point. I think we've outlined the puts and takes that are endemic to the industry and those specific to Molina. And over the long term, we are committed to growing earnings per share and our pre-tax earnings off of the 2018 solid baseline. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : That's helpful. And then just a follow-up there, maybe another way to come out of this is just net income margins. Clearly, relative to peers, they're now towards the higher end of the range. To grow off here with a shrinking \u2013 with a topline that \u2013 looks like it's going to be down next year given the membership losses before accelerating in 2020, where do you think the margins on a net income basis can kind of sustain relative to what you've kind of put out there at the Investor Day given you're already there? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: We've challenged the operating team to aspire to be the best margin producers in our space. We're going to produce Medicaid margins just under 2.5% this year after tax, Medicare margins at nearly 3.5%, and Marketplace at nearly 9%, averaging to the 3.2% after-tax margin in our guidance. Clearly, the Marketplace has outperformed our expectation this year, without question. We managed it effectively. We've put 58 points of rate into the market last year. But this year, we only put low-single digit rate increases into the market because our rate actions no longer needed to be corrective. And so I think the question on the Marketplace isn't whether we can sustain the margins, is can we continue to hold on to the membership at the margin we produced this year. But it's a solid product, it's performing well. And we're just now learning how our prices are comparing to our competitors, and we'll have a better outlook for you when we report our fourth quarter. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Raskin of Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC : Hi, thanks. I guess similar sort of line of questioning around margin sustainability. And I guess the first thing is, I think you mentioned, Joe, long term you guys want to keep I think 2018 levels of profitability, and so \u2013 or I'm sorry, levels of earnings. And so should we think about on a lower top line this 2019 \u2013 does that mean 2019 steps back and then longer term we get back to the $9.00, or is that not what you were saying? And then the second question just in terms of the sustainability looking at the G&A side, you guys are running at about a 7% ratio. And so, I'm just curious, is that a sustainable number in light of the fact that you're going to be trying to reinvigorate the growth engine? I look at things like $24 million of CapEx through the first nine months, and it just feels like that can't be sustainable if you're really trying to grow the business. So, maybe just help with the couple of those questions. Thanks. Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. With respect to 2019 revenue, at our Investor Day, we laid out an outlook which suggested that the 2019 premium revenue will be about $15.6 billion. At that time, of course, we were accounting for the total loss of Florida and the total loss of the New Mexico Medicaid contracts. We've since recovered two regions in Florida $0.5 billion. And the Mississippi implementation will be an incremental $300 million to 2019. There are other growth opportunities in our existing portfolio. Our Marketplace business should grow next year with rates now filed in Utah and Wisconsin. As you know, we are very successful in our Washington reprocurement where we have fewer competitors and many other regions we won, and so our membership will grow. Ohio carved in the behavioral benefit halfway through this year, we'll get a full year of that next year. And we picked up 70,000 members mid-year in Illinois, and we'll get a full year effect of that in 2019. So, all-in-all, I think the premium revenue picture, without giving you a specific forecast, is a lot better than what we outlined at Investor Day. Your second question was about G&A, there is more G&A to harvest here. We've redeployed a lot of that G&A to the frontlines. Our net 600 head count reduction was net of resources we've put in the field to control medical cost. We will spend money on many of our transformational initiatives that will produce better baseline medical costs that will put a little pressure on it next year. But we are very determined to control our fixed cost and to leverage our fixed cost, and we think there's upside to the G&A ratio as well. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC : Got you. And I'm sorry, so just to clarify, my question on 2019 was with the understanding that premiums probably go from about $17.5 billion this year to maybe just under $17 billion next year now, obviously, a lot better than what you guys were talking about previously. My question was around the earnings. I think you'd made the comment that 2018 that long term you wanted to maintain that level of profits that you're seeing in 2018, that run rate $9.00 number. So, I was just asking more on the combination, if you've got a little bit lower top line on a year-over-year basis, did it sound like earnings per share in your mind for 2019 just directionally would have to take that step back on lower revenues and then eventually get back to where you were, what was that now what you were implying? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Again, without giving a specific forecast, even with the revenue declines next year, we are pretty committed to growing earnings per share and pre-tax earnings off of the 2018 base. Too early to give you the specific 2019 trajectory, but we are committed even in the phase of the revenue decline on the two lost contracts, we're committed to that long-term objective. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC : Got you. Got you. That's perfect. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Ana Gupte of Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Ana Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Yes, hey. Thanks. Good morning. Yeah. So, again, following up on the margins with the 3-plus net margin that you have right now, do you expect there's still runway for expansion? And is that likely to come mostly from additional mix shifting to the exchanges which are really high margin? Or is there still core MLR improvement from claims editing, payment integrity, PBM, or anything else in Medicare/Medicaid? And then on G&A, are you still looking to drive more efficiency, or are we just looking at leverage at this point as you grow on the cost side anyways? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: With respect to our margins, you specifically, Ana, mentioned Medicaid, with an 89.9% year-to-date MCR, there's still room for improvement in our core Medicaid business, maybe 100 basis points or 200 basis points long term in the MCR. And we're committed to improving our Medicaid margins. On the G&A side, yeah, there's more efficiency, there's fixed cost leverage as we grow, there is more efficiency, and we will redeploy some of that efficiency back to the frontline to make sure that we do not skimp on utilization control resources, which was part of the medical cost problem the company experienced. We also are going to invest in some of these transformational initiatives. It will cost money if we outsource or co-source our IT operation. We are spending more money on payment integrity routines and frontline utilization control. So, there will be a little bit of upward pressure on the G&A ratio as we improve our processes, but it should have a corresponding and exponential effect on our medical cost line. Ana Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : And then on the rate side, just finally, you have like a mid-60s exchange loss ratio, and you said only one region had the MLR floor issue. But are there any rate pressures that states may be bringing to your attention with such low loss ratios, you're probably not alone? And then on the tax reform side, might they start to put pressure on the rates in Medicaid, is that sustainable over the long run? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: On the second question, the Medicaid rates, it's a very rational rate environment right now as we accept the Medicaid rates that are being offered to us. For the most part, the rates are actuarially sound. They always seem to come in a little bit lower than your absorbed medical cost trend, but they'd suspect you to find managed care savings, and we do that routinely. The tax reform conversation really isn't part of the rate dialogue with the states. On the Marketplace side, we're just now learning how our rates are going to stack up against our competitors. Our average rate increase for the Marketplace that we filed in 2018 for 2019 was 4%. These rate increases no longer need to be corrective, they just need to accurately reflect medical cost trend, the acuity of our population and the metallic benefit designs that we've put into the market. So we're pretty comfortable that our strategy in the Marketplace which was to hold on to our membership ranks and maximize contribution margin dollars for 2019 will hold, and that will position us well to file rates in 2019 that will allow us to grow into 2020. Ana Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks for the color. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Sarah James of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thanks, and congratulations on the turnaround execution. You've previously talked about focusing on the turnaround before you turn back to top line growth acceleration. Given the progress is running ahead of schedule, how are you thinking about when it's right to explore top line opportunities again thinking specifically of non-incumbent RFPs, M&A, but also anything like organic M&A or fixed (41:30) market expansions? Thanks. Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, as we continue to focus on our margin recovery and sustainability efforts, as you suggested, there is still more to do. Some of those opportunities have yet to been harvested. And that is our primary focus here at the company. In the meantime, we also recognized that the sales cycle in this business is very long. And if you don't start building the engine today to grow, then you won't grow in 2019, 2020 and 2021. So we are hard at work rebuilding our RFP response unit, we're hard at work rebuilding our new contract business development unit. In the meantime, there are plenty of opportunities in our existing footprint, in our existing product line, to grow. If we can win more regions in Texas, when Texas finally announces the STAR+PLUS contract, if we won seven more regions and add our current market share, could be over $1 billion of incremental opportunity. Ohio strongly considering putting their ML \u2013 their long-term services and supports business into managed care. So there are plenty of opportunities in Marketplace. We believe that business could be twice the size it is today, and we can hold onto our margin, and have it be a very good allocation of capital in the portfolio at a very attractive margin. So before we go into new-new, I think there's plenty of opportunities in our existing footprint and our existing product line to grow. But in the meantime, we are rebuilding that greenfield business development operation so we can participate in RFPs in 2019, 2020 for the benefit of 2021. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: That's very helpful. And one more, you've previously talked about $0.50 upside not in guidance from capital deployment related to debt and converts, can you update us on how much of that has been achieved, and if the remainder is on the table for 2019, or if we should be thinking further out? Thanks. Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: We originally \u2013 I gave you a $0.50 estimate, and if you recall, I think at the time, our share price was about $85, which meant that the cash that we've used to buy in the converts was purchasing a lot more of the converts than it is at $125, $130. So, that estimate for the full year is now $0.30, but we've bought in a lot of those convertible notes. We've reduced our share count and the potential volatility in EPS as a result of it. But I think Tom said in his prepared remarks that the estimate for the year on our capital actions is about a $0.30 benefit for the entire year. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tanal of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. So, it seems like you're implying further improvement in the Medicaid loss ratio next year will offset likely lower margins in the Marketplace. And I guess if I think about that, is that now about the TANF population with where the Medicaid sort of loss ratio is running there? And does that become inevitably more dependent on rate updates to the extent that's sort of a lower acuity, lower utilizing population where there's maybe I guess in theory less you can do? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, we definitely think there's upside to our core Medicaid performance. Citing some facts here, TANF is still running over 89% year-to-date. ABD is running at 92% \u2013 just under 92%, which is respectable. But we actually think that we can more effectively manage the long-term support and services benefit that's embedded in the ABD product more effectively and we can improve on that 92% performance. And Expansion is doing well at 87%. We're still getting very, very effective rates. So, the business is performing well. I think that there is upside in our ABD line and upside in our TANF line. Just being more effective on the frontlines and the utilization controls, the rate environment if it continues to be stable and we can continue to effectively manage our medical cost baseline and trend, we all believe that there's upside to those performance statistics. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay, that's really helpful. And just sort of separately on the Marketplace business, kind of given the way minimum MLR rebates are assessed on a rolling three-year basis, is there anything you can tell us about the impact of I guess what would effectively be swapping 2018, obviously really strong year with 2015 less strong on sort of the outlook for earnings or margin next year? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Good observation. The old, poorly-performing years are rolling off, but we still have room. As you suggested, it's a three-year rolling average. We only triggered the minimum MLR in one state, that being New Mexico. And we fully considered our position as we filed our 2019 rates. So, no, we don't expect \u2013 the rates that we filed still do not imply a triggering of the minimum MLR in any of our other states. And if we did, we certainly would include it in any forecast we give you for 2019. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Awesome. Really helpful. Just lastly for me, just on Marketplace enrollment, the expectations for increased enrollment there, can you talk about any new markets or geographies you're entering, or should we think about that as more of a same-store end-market growth rate? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: We're in seven. We re-filed \u2013 if you remember, we were in Utah and Wisconsin a year ago. We came out in 2018. We're going back in for 2019. We expect that Wisconsin and the positioning of our pricing and our product will provide some meaningful membership growth in Wisconsin. Utah, probably less so. But those are the two states. So, we'll be in nine states in 2019 and we're going to consider expanding our Marketplace footprint to be everywhere we're in Medicaid in 2020, which would be I think South Carolina, Illinois and New York. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Awesome. Very helpful. Thanks a lot, Joe. Operator : Our next question comes from Dave Windley of Jefferies. Please go ahead. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So, Joe, thinking about your $500 million plan, just a few sub-part questions here. One, has this year benefited from anything that would have been, say, outside of that plan? Two, you mentioned that you've harvested some of that plan, but still a lot of it to go. Would you care to put numbers on or maybe a proportion of the $500 million that you think you're already seeing flow through the P&L? And then, as you I guess in the extreme, and it's been asked a little bit already this morning, but in the full harvesting of the $500 million, Molina would seem to get to margin levels that would be very high relative to peers. And I guess I'd be curious your view on the difficulty or the reasonableness of pushing margins at Molina kind of to that spread against similar books of business. Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, thanks for the question. And as a reminder, I always remind folks when we talk about these profit improvement plans that one, it first goes to fund any deficit you get in rates. Rates always seem to lag medical cost trend by 1 basis point here or there, and it first goes to fund that. If you remember the charts we showed you at Investor Day, we had this sort of contingency reserve sitting out there suggesting that somewhere you'll get a bad rate, somewhere the rate might be actuarially unsound. And you're always using your profit improvement issues to first offset that deficit before anything drops through. And as you suggest, you're absolutely correct; we would then look at our profit improvement plans and the margins that we're creating as a result of it to reinvest in growth. We would not push margins up as high as you suggest and sacrifice growth when the time comes. So, the $500 million could drop through to margins. And if we aspire to be the best margin producer in the industry, maybe we get there or maybe we'll reinvest it in top line growth. Your original question was about how much of the $500 million has fallen through to 2018. And without parsing it item by item, we definitely benefited this year by more effective utilization management. We definitely benefited this year by working the network harder, claim payment integrity certainly added some benefit this year to our medical cost line. And as we suggested, we continue to be more effective at SG&A control. I would say that the more technically challenging, the more operationally complex items that you saw on our chart at Investor Day still have yet to be harvested. So, bottom line, I would say a significant amount of the $500 million has yet to have been harvested and manifest in earnings. You'll be seeing over the next two to three months announcements from us on partnerships that we are creating with world-class vendors to partner up and take advantage of high acuity care management, maybe a re-contracting of our pharmacy. Clearly, we are anticipating co-sourcing or outsourcing our IT operation, you'll see some announcements for us on that front over the next two to three months. David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC : Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette - Barclays Investment Bank : Yeah, thanks, and good morning. I think most of the good questions have been addressed already. Just talk a little bit on that last one. Looking at your citing and throughout this year that some lower in-patient cost has also been part of the upside. So, I was curious kind of where you stand just because (51:44) a little bit deeper on that last question just on the contract renegotiations on the in-patient side, whether that's something that has played a role this year or that's something that's also still kind of ahead of you, just thinking about that category in particular? Thanks. Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah, I think we'd managed our in-patient cost very effectively. We had some cost pressures in Washington that we previously announced. We had some behavioral in-patient pressures in New Mexico that we previously talked about. But for the most part : one, trend seems to be very stable in most regions around the country, so just the general environment for trend; and second, we have been managing it more effectively. And we can see it in all our statistics, admits per 1,000, short in-patient stays, average length of stay, ER visits, admissions out of the ER, whatever stat you want to focus on, we have been managing it very effectively. And so the in-patient and facility costs a component of trend has been : A, stable and performing well; and secondly, we've been managing it better than we had in the past. Steven Valiquette - Barclays Investment Bank : Yeah, okay. All right. Great, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. I just wanted to circle back with the G&A commentary because it seems like you're talking, on the one hand, about significant savings, but then also kind of making some investments that might push up G&A with the MLR benefit. And then I guess separately, I guess you're talking about maybe investing for growth in RFPs in the future, I wasn't sure if that was going to put upward pressure on G&A. I guess when you put that altogether, are you looking for G&A as a percentage of revenue to continue to trend down, or this is more about, hey, there's savings that we can reinvest elsewhere to drive improvement elsewhere, either top line or MLR? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Kevin, we're not prepared to give sort of a pinpoint forecast on our G&A ratio beyond 2018. But those are the headwinds and tailwinds to our G&A ratio. And I view the upward pressure \u2013 if we continue to invest in things that improve our medical cost baseline; I consider that to be -have an excellent return, and we would make that trade all day long. So, yes, there are going to be some upward pressures as we invest in some of these processes that will produce significant benefits to the company. Certainly, when you're chasing top line revenue, it costs money. But there is more fixed cost leverage and there's more efficiency to be gained in our operation. Those are the ups and downs, but we're just not prepared yet to give you a pinpoint SG&A ratio forecast beyond 2018. But it's there, we're managing it very effectively, and we definitely think there's a more effective way to deploy our SG&A dollars. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then, I guess, when we think about getting back to the growth side of the equation, Molina has been historically much better at protecting and expanding in markets where you already are located. I mean, what do you have to add capability-wise to be successful in entering new markets? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Well, we are currently sketching out the rebuilding of our business development engine. You need to have a ground game, you need to be in the states developing network relationships and governmental relationships before the procurement drops. And in the past two years, this company has not really invested in any of that given the issues it was going through. So, we're rebuilding all that under Pam Sedmak's leadership. We will develop a new business development engine that we think can compete with our rivals, and we can win our fair share. It's really not about the money, it's about really establishing yourself locally building the relationships with the Department of Health Services and the regulators and making sure you have great network relationships, so when the RFP drops, you're prepared to go. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay.. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Gary Taylor of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. Really amazing performance this year. So you've done a great job. Two questions about that performance. The first one, just going back to exchanges a little bit, can you help us bridge this comment that you're looking \u2013 you're either running or anticipating for the year 9% to 10% after-tax margins in the exchange business with the 58% year-to-date MLR. And I guess presuming some seasonal uptick in the 4Q, maybe you end the year closer to 70%, but still implies somewhere between a 20% and 30% G&A load to only get to a 9% to 10% after-tax margin, can you bridge that for us? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Go ahead, Tom (56:54). Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. Your numbers are directionally in the right zone there. So in this business, the G&A tend to be high. You have commission, you have sales, marketing. So certainly, it's really in the upper-teen to as much as 20%. And our fourth quarter, you're right, the medical care ratio is going to be higher than what we experienced so far year-to-date. In the last earnings call, we talk a little bit about that, that they tend to be somewhat in the 80s, but we believe that given the trajectory that we are in today, it will be much less than that, more likely start with a seven as opposed to an eight in front. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So, if we think about ultimately minimum MLRs at 80% in this business and G&A in upper-teens to 20%, I mean that would imply a longer-term after-tax margin significantly lower than the 9% to 10%. Is that how we should be thinking about this? Or do you think you bring G&A down over time to seeing something mid-single digit or better? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Our G&A loads in our product lines that aren't fully scaled are too high, and they can be scaled. If we double the size of the business, our SG&A would not double. There's fixed cost leverage there very, very clearly. The other thing, as a reminder, in the minimum MLR, there's all the add-backs, right? The number we produce for GAAP, there's all kinds of additions and subtractions to get to the number. So, if we're operating in the mid to high-60s with our G&A load of 15% to 20%, we're still floating below the minimum MLR in many of our placements (58:49). But your point is well taken. There is a practical cap in the margins you can achieve because of the minimum MLR, and if we ever get there, it's a high-class problem to have and we'll fully consider it in the rates we file and we'll grow more. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : One other question for you, Joe. Just thinking about your comment that there's still significant amount of the $500 million opportunity you identified that could flow through to earnings. When that takes place, if that does take place, it really seems that you're completely redefining the margin profile with still primarily Medicaid business and redefining that margin profile versus your peers and versus history. And we've always heard companies in this business talk about over caps at the state level, politics and visibility of margins, et cetera. So, in just six months here, you've redefined the profile to some degree and you suggest there's still further to go. How do we think about this historic concept that there were \u2013 these are pre-tax caps at the state level... Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Sure. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : ...and just sort of the visibility of the margins politically? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Oh, it's a very fair comment. And that's why every time I show a forecast or a projection, I always have what I call the rate yield decrement in the analysis because you're never sure that you're going to get fully paid for your medical cost trend. And I always say that over time profit improvement always ends up in rates somehow and somewhere. So, you're right. Over time just through the \u2013 the process of negotiating and accepting rates from states, profit improvement will end up in rates over time. That in itself puts a practical (01:00:43) cap in what you can achieve. But again, our goal is to be low cost. We want to be very effective on the frontlines, service our members and our provider partners well, but be low cost. And if we can continue to do that, we can either drop it through or we can reinvest it in top line growth. And that's our aspiration and that's what we're trying to achieve here. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Zack Sopcak of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Zachary Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, thank you for the call, and congrats on the quarter. I wanted to ask first about exiting the Pathways business. If you forget about the \u2013 I guess the loss you're taking on the sale of the business, was it a negative or positive earnings contributor in 2018? And should we think about that exit as a tailwind or a headwind going into 2019? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: The exit is clearly a tailwind. It was running an EBITDA loss for the year. If you recall, the goodwill associated with that purchase was written off in the third quarter of 2017, which left a little bit of working capital and fixed assets in the business, and selling it for a nominal purchase price still produced a loss. Negative EBITDA contributor, and it would have required us a lot of future investment in order to fix the business, and there's always a private equity firm around who sees value in that, wants to put the hard work in, but it's just not core and was not a financial contributor. Zachary Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And just on that non-core comment, now that you've exited MMS and Pathways, is there anything else in your portfolio that you would consider non-core that you're still working on, or do you think it's where you wanted to be? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: No, we like the portfolio, we like the geographic diversity, we like the product line depth and breadth. The portfolio right now is fine, and we're focused on managed care and that's what our focus is on. Zachary Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, perfect. Thank you for the question. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Newshel of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC : Thanks. Do you have a timeline in mind for retiring the remaining convertible debt and warrants? And also do you expect to have more deployable capital from subsidiary dividends next year than you talked about at the Investor Day just given the earnings outperformance this year? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: I'll kick it to Tom in a minute, but bear in mind that the 2020s are due in January 2020. So, whether we buy them in the open market or they're presented to us by January of 2020, they will be totally out of our capital structure. Tom, do you want to (01:03:24). Thomas L. Tran - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: That's right, Joe. There's a balance remaining of approximately $315 million. So, between now and January 2020, we will retire those convertible. Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC : All right. And then to retire the associated warrants as well, it's like a total of like $1 billion close to? Joseph M. Zubretsky - Molina Healthcare, Inc.: Exactly. And we're sitting now with close to $400 million in parent company cash. Obviously, with the outlook for next year, I have \u2013 we'll harvest more cash flow to the parent. We have the $500 million revolver. So, we have plenty of capacity.

I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joseph Zubretsky : Thank you, Ryan, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Last night, we reported earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of $3.01, and $10.61 for the full year ending December 31, 2018. For the full year 2018, we produced pre-tax earnings of $9,99 million and after-tax earnings of $707 million, resulting in pre-tax and after-tax margins of 5.3% and 3.7% respectively on a reported basis. As these results indicate, we have accomplished much over the last year as we executed the first phase of our margin recovery and sustainability plan. The rapid improvement in our operating margin profile has allowed us to shift our focus to driving our profit improvement initiatives for continued margin expansion, while we are quickly pivoting to achieving top-line revenue growth. The quarter itself was very strong with pure performance earnings per share of $3.82 and an after-tax margin of 5.4%. Continuing the momentum, we established early in the year. All-in-all we are very pleased with the results for the quarter. The scope of our prepared remarks today will focus primarily on the margin expansion success we have already achieved and our confidence in sustaining it. However, to be clear, we are equally focused on and have already invested in top-line revenue growth and our very attractive lines of business, Medicaid, Medicare and marketplace as well as our existing and potential new geographies. We plan to showcase this growth plan at our Investor Day in May. Now returning to our financial results, in order to provide the context for our 2019 guidance, it is best to focus much of our commentary on recapping the full year 2018, a year in which we produced pure performance earnings per share of $10.83 far surpassing our initial and revised guidance. This result includes on a consolidated basis, a pure performance MCR of 86.3% and a G&A ratio of 7.1%, both of which enabled a pure performance after-tax margin of 3.8%. Now commenting on 2018 by line of business, the Medicaid business with $13.7 billion in pure performance premium revenue ended the year with an 89.4% pure performance medical care ratio and a pure performance after-tax margin of 2.8% which is within our revised long-term target margin range. Several factors contributed to this result, we were able to skillfully manage medical costs all against a backdrop of a reasonable and rational rate environment and we were successful in executing on a variety of profit improvement initiatives including network contracting, frontline utilization control and retaining increased levels of revenue at risk for quality scores. Our $2.1 billion Medicare business comprising our DSNP and MMP products also delivered favorable results in 2018. Managing to a medical care ratio of 84.5%, we produced an after-tax margin of 4.8%. Specifically, on Medicare, we have proven, we are adapted at managing high acuity members who have complex medical conditions and comorbidities. We have also proven to be proficient at managing approximately $2 billion of long-term services and supports benefits an important and fast-growing benefit across all of our products. And the risk scores of our members continue to improve resulting in increased revenue that is more commensurate with the acuity of our population. Finally, our marketplace business was a significant contributor to this year's favorable results with $1.9 billion in 2018 pure performance premium revenue and exceptional margins. If you recall in 2017 and prior, this business was severely challenged and at that time we set a corrective 2018 pricing action of nearly 60% was warranted. With that as the backdrop, the business produced a pure performance MCR of 65% and then after-tax margin of 11.4% in 2018. Several factors contributed to this result. Our prices in the market although they increased significantly over 2017, we're still very competitive and thus we are able to be retaining membership profile that could be adequately scaled. Many of the core and routine managed care fundamentals are applicable to our other businesses, also helped to produce favorable results in the marketplace business. Our ability to capture and forecast adequate risk scores has improved dramatically and our differentiated strategy of serving the highly subsidized working poor produced the right acuity mix and the right metallic [ph] tier mix, all of which worked well within our pricing parameters. Now commenting on 2018 through the lens of our locally operated health plans, we vastly improved the performance and balance of our health plan portfolio during 2018. Our largest health plans, Ohio, Texas, California, Washington and Michigan continue to perform well and established themselves as worthy of winning re-procurements. The underperforming aspects of our portfolio which we described at the beginning of the year were much improved in 2018. One year ago, we said that 25% of our revenue was in plans that were not profitable. In 2018 all of those plans were profitable. Florida and New Mexico where challenges for obvious reasons but performed admirably as they faced the run-off of large portions of business. In Washington, stage that recovery midway through the year and is now well positioned to return to target margins on its expanded revenue base. In summary, the health plan portfolio is in excellent shape. Now to recap the full year 2018 from the perspective of the operational improvements we implemented and the operating efficiencies we gained. From a pure efficiency perspective, we continue to improve our G&A profile, managing to our ratio of 7.1% for the full year 2018. We've reduced our headcount by more than 800 FTEs or nearly 7% from the beginning of the year. More importantly, we continue to invest in the business, we improved the performance of our core processes, claims, payment integrity, member and provider services and a host of others, all of which create lasting effect. And finally, in 2018, we set the stage for ongoing improvement by making significant progress on a variety of outsourcing initiatives some recently announced which benefit 2019 and beyond. Turning now to addressing the 2018 improvements to our balance sheet and capital structure, our improved operating performance allowed us to dividend approximately $300 million to the parent company. This owed us well for producing excess cash flow in the future. And we deployed approximately $1.2 billion to retire highly volatile and expensive convertible debt and repaid the outstanding amount drawn on our revolving line of credit. This reduced earnings per share volatility and lowered our debt to cap ratio to approximately 47%. In summary for 2018, across all of our product lines, health plans, operating metrics and with respect to capital management, we are very pleased with our 2018 performance. Now I will address our 2019 earnings guidance. We are establishing our initial earnings per share guidance for 2019 in the range of $9.25 to $9.75. As Tom will describe later, this is on the basis of GAAP reporting. The headline for 2019 is continued margin strength and sustainability, despite the previously announced revenue decline, all without the benefit of anticipating any prior year reserve development. On 2019 revenues, overall, we expect premium revenue to come in at approximately $15.8 billion in 2019, a decrease of approximately 10% due to the contract losses in Florida and New Mexico and the membership attrition as a result of the conservative approach we have taken to marketplace pricing. Despite these revenue challenges, we are encouraged by multiple new revenue foundations we laid in 2018 that will carry into 2019 Specifically, within Medicaid, we invested heavily in new business development, winning three RFPs, the largest being Washington, but also Puerto Rico and Mississippi chip. We also submitted what we believe to be a winning proposal in the Texas Star Plus program. The Washington reprocurement award expanded membership in regions where we best hit the competition in the consolidation of health plans and also enabled us to participate in the caravan [ph] of behavioral health services. In Florida, we were able to recapture a third of our Medicaid contract and retain approximately $500 million of revenue positioning us well for Medicare and marketplace expansion. In Illinois and Mississippi, we will benefit from membership gains in 2018 which will achieve full year run rate revenue in 2019 and for the 2020 marketplace price filing in early 2019, we will equally focus on growing membership while maintaining profitability. We are forecasting the continued strength and sustainability of margins in 2019. The following points are relevant to that forecast. First, given the significant operating leverage in the managed care business, a 10% decline in the premium revenue base is difficult to overcome from a margin expansion perspective but we are forecasting being successful in doing so. Second, we have taken a cautious view in forecasting the impact of our profit improvement initiatives in our 2019 guidance, although, we maintain a high degree of confidence that we will capture them. And third, while the 2018 results included significant prior year reserve development as a matter of policy, we do not forecast any prior year reserve development and our guidance although we maintained a consistent reserving policy throughout the year. Taking these points into account, the after-tax margins in each of our lines of business will remain strong in 2019. Medicaid margins remain flat at approximately 2.8%. Medicare margins are up approximately 20 basis points to 5% and marketplace margins are down slightly but still in double-digits at 10.8%. Taken together, we expect a consolidated Medical cost ratio between 86.7% and 87%, a consolidated after-tax margin in the range of 3.7% to 3.9% and net income in the range of $600 million to $630 million. The margin improvement trajectory we've experienced is consistent with both our prior disclosures and the discussion of the profit improvement opportunities we have identified. Recall, in 2018 of the original $500 million projection, we harvested $200 million which is now embedded in our run rate earnings. Earlier this year, we increased our projection of opportunities by $250 million to a total future improvement opportunity of $550 million. Our 2019 guidance includes harvesting over $200 million of the revised profit improvement opportunity which is more than offsetting the slightly negative spread between trends in yield of approximately $80 million. These ongoing profit improvement initiatives help create nearly $2 of earnings per share benefit in our 2019 guidance. Overall, our margin recovery efforts have been successful to-date and our margin sustainability plan is well established. While we will remain focused on further margin improvement throughout 2019, we have simultaneously pivoted to growth, we are carefully evaluating new geographic opportunities as well as the adjacent product and benefit carbon opportunities in our existing geographies. With such a successful year now behind us I would like to take a few moments to acknowledge the people who have made all of this happen. The executive leadership team we have assembled have proven their ability to successfully execute on the first phase of our turnaround plan. And still in confidence that they will likewise be able to execute on the next phase and a special note of gratitude to the 11,000 plus associates on the front lines every day caring for our members and delivering high quality service. In conclusion, we are very `pleased with our 2018 results and the strong foundation we have built. There is still significant opportunity for creating value and we are excited for the future and what awaits us in 2019 and beyond. I look forward to sharing more about our future growth plans and longer-term strategy at our next Investor Day on May 30th in New York City. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom Tran for more detail on the financials. Tom? Thomas Tran : Thank you, Joe and good morning. As described in our earnings release, we report fourth quarter earnings per diluted share of $3.01 and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.07, excluding the amortization of intangible assets. We reported full year 2018 earnings per diluted share of $10.61 and full year 2018 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $10.86, excluding the amortization of intangible assets. First, I will highlight the non-recurring items that occur in the quarter, resulting in fourth quarter pure performance earnings per diluted share of $3.82. It is important to note that these items are included in the fourth quarter GAAP reported numbers that we cited in the earnings release. Specifically, we recorded a $52 million previously-tax loss on the self of our pathway's subsidiary. $8 million of restructuring expenses primarily related to costs associated with our ongoing IT restructuring plan. A $3 million gain as part of the repurchase of the 2020 convertible notes and related and medical option termination. And a $24 million pre-tax expense for a retroactive risk corridor adjustment or a California expansion business, primarily related to the state fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. Next, I would like to make some comments on the fourth quarter earnings beat of over $130 million pre-tax or approximately $1.90 per diluted share on a pure performance basis, relative to the top and about pure performance guidance range. That beat can be attributed primarily to the following four items. First, we had prior period development of approximately $90 million in a quarter, most of which is in for a year development and therefore is accounted for in our pure performance result for the full year. Second, our marketplace product continues to perform exceptionally well. The seasonal increase the medical costs we have historically seen did not materialize in the fourth quarter and member retention was better than expected. Third, administrative costs were lower than expected that spike increase sales and marketing costs associated with open enrollment in Medicare and a marketplace. Lower labor cost was the primary driver of this favorable DNA ratio. And fourth, as a result about improved fourth quarter performance and tax benefits on the loss related to the sale for pathways, the effective tax rate for full year 2018 at 29.2% was lower than we expected would result in a fourth quarter benefit of approximately $20 million. Turning to our balance sheet, cash flow and cash position for the quarter and a full year, our reserve approach is consistent with prior quarters and our opposition remains strong. We continue to have favorable into year reserved development. And as we have stated in the past, we intend to include that same level of conservatism in the quarter end reserve balances. Days and claim payables remained flat sequentially at 53 days. While operating cash flow were strong throughout the year. It was negative in a quarter primarily due to our payment up the health insurer fee, on October 1st. As of December 31, 2018, the company has unrestricted cash and investments of approximately $170 million at the parent company. The reduction to parent cash from the end of the third quarter of 2018 primarily relates to the purchase of the 2020 convertible debt. As of December 31, 2018, our health plans had aggregated statutory capital and surplus of approximately $2.4 billion which represent approximately 400% of risk-based capital. I will now quickly discuss capital actions. We have continued to look for opportunities to delever the balance sheet. Our action in a quarter reduce average diluted share outstanding to $66.6 million at year end from $67.9 million at the end of the third quarter. Finally, while not related to 2018, we recently complete a new $600 million term loan to finance the repurchase conversion and redemptions of our 2020 convertible notes that are currently in the money and eligible for early conversion. This is a temporary facility which allows us to keep our $500 million revolver capacity undrawn. Shifting to 2019 guidance, I will ask some detail to bridge our 2018 performance to our 2019 pure performance guidance of $9.50 per diluted share at the midpoint. First, converting 2018 full year reported result to pure performance. The significant items that we call out in our earnings release added $0.22 to our 2018 reported earnings per diluted share of $10.61 for pure performance earning per share of $10.83 for the full year 2018. Second, prior year development which we do not include in our 2019 guidance positively impact 2018 earnings per share by approximately $1.55 per diluted share Third, we believe that the shrine is overhead and resulting negative operating leverage related to the lost contracts in New Mexico and Florida negatively impacts the earnings trajectory by approximately $0.75 per diluted share. Fourth, the negative spread between trend and yield in Medicaid is projected to impact 2019 by approximately $0.90 per diluted share. And fifth, our projected net profit improvement is forecast to increase full year earnings per diluted share by $1.87 combined we arrive at our guidance midpoint of $9.50. The following points are also important relative to our 2019 guidance. First, 2019 guidance assumes consolidated net margins will remain flat at the midpoint. Specifically, we expect Medicaid to remain flat. Medicare to improve approximately 20 basis points and marketplace to decline slightly but remain in double digits off our 2018 pure performance based which include prior year development. Second, our G&A ratio increased 50 basis points to 7.6% in our 2019 guidance. This increase is primarily driven by the incremental G&A costs incur to realize the profit improvement initiatives that will benefit our medical care ratio and result in an overall net profit improvement and the stranded overhead costs due to revenue loss in New Mexico and Florida. And third, 2019 guidance does not assume any impact from prior year development positive or negative. All things being equal if we have favorable development as we did in 2018 our forecasted result will be higher and conversely if development is unfavorable our forecasted result will be lower. You should note that our reserve methodology has been consistently applied. Finally, in conjunction with our earnings release last night, we include a supplementation presentation with additional detail on our financial results and 2019 guidance. Going forward, we planned to provide this additional detail alongside future earnings release as a way of providing further insight into the business. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator we are now ready to take questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. The first question today comes from Joshua Raskin with Nephron Research. Mr. Raskin, please go ahead. Joshua Raskin : Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Wanted to ask a little bit more about the revenue bridge and sort of backing up to the Investor Day, where you guys started with the $15.6 billion of premiums. And I know you've got $500 million back in Florida, you talked about I think Mississippi being about $300 million and then Illinois, Ohio, some other growth et cetera. I guess what are the offsets? It looks like only $200 million higher. So, it sounds like some stuff has add, but I don't know how much of that is asset sales versus the exchanges. And then, I think last quarter, you guys were a little bit more optimistic about potential growth in the marketplace, and so just wanted to hear a little bit I guess within that answer what changed there. Joseph Zubretsky : Well, Joshua, on the revenue bridge, very clearly Florida and New Mexico were a major component of the decline at $2.2 billion. We also note that if you're looking at total revenue, you always have to adjust where they have of $400 million. And yes, the service businesses that we divested in 2018, NMS and Pathways have $400 million in revenue, which effectively disappears in 2019 guidance. But we did pickup $900 million of organic growth, and you cited all the reasons, Mississippi, Illinois full year run-rate of increased membership calling back to $500 million in Florida certainly helped. Washington as we bested certain competitors in various of the regions, we will have increased Medicaid membership and the behavioral caravan. So all-in-all, $900 million of organic growth embedded and what was a disappointing year of contract losses certainly bode well for our revenue pickup in the future. Joshua Raskin : Got it, got it. And then just a quick question on the outsourcing you guys announced recently. Could you just walk through a little bit more of the specific functions that were outsourced and maybe how much of that savings is in guidance? Joseph Zubretsky : The contract we just signed the outsourcing arrangement with Infosys related to our IT infrastructure, datacenters, user services et cetera. So, at the hardware. We think it as the hardware. It will result in rebadging certain employees to Infosys that will result in certain number of position eliminations. But we also have increased the effectiveness of the operation, better up times, better response times and just more effective operations. That agreement has already incepted. There is a 90 to 120-day transition period. So, the outsourcing will actually occur to about until about the middle of the year. And so, the savings in 2019 guidance is modest, but we'll ramp the full run-rate in 2020. Joshua Raskin : Perfect. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew Porsche [ph] with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you and congratulations. Thank you for all the disclosure. So, can you just help us think about where you would like to get to in terms of a run-rate on the operating cost ratio, if that's even the right way to think about it? I mean I know that there are structural differences depending on how much you grow to the various parts of the business, but I'm just trying to look at your mid-7s guidance for 2019 relative to the low-7s that you achieved in 2018 and then the stranded overhead in the G&A that you're spending to achieve savings. Joseph Zubretsky : Sure Matt, while we're not giving a forecast for 2020 and beyond. We certainly believe there is more upside to our G&A ratio than downside risk. So you're right about the puts and takes in 2019 painful reminder of how the operating leverage works in this business this 306 cost of the loss contribution margin from the Mexico and Florida put 30 to 40 basis points pressure on that ratio, but more importantly we're investing $90 million to $100 million in lot of G&A to invest in medical cost improvements and other improvements to our core business. I believe in the future we will as we grow we'll get positive operating leverage we'll continue to invest in the business and of course you cited the mix effects that we're likely to get depending on how big the marketplace business in the future so we believe that the G&A ratio as we move for improvement going forward but we're not giving a forecast more room for upside and downside. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. So, the focus shifts to the top-line growth just hoping you can walk us through any kind of early view of your exchange strategy for 2020 as well as any key RFPs or opportunities for state membership transactions that could fuel revenue growth into next year? Joseph Zubretsky : Sure, Justin on the exchanges as we said in a public forum just about a month ago, we plan to grow this business. We actually think we can double with size and still have a proportional relationship between our exchange business in our Medicaid business in the states in which we do business. Obviously, that won't come in one year and the interesting thing about this business is as you know the prices are in relation to the competitors, so we've done a very exhaustive pricing elasticity study. We know where our prices are to ridge against the competition, we plan for 2020 to ease up on price we certainly are going to price to 50% pre-tax margins and 10% after-tax margins. But we believe we can grow the business have the MCR move up from the mid-60s to 70% maybe into the low 70s, maintain a high single-digit margin without ever tripping the minimum MOR. So, we're feeling really good about the growth prospects of this business and the ability to grow it, produce a high single-digit margin and have the pool of profits grow overtime. Justin Lake : Any Medicaid opportunities? Joseph Zubretsky : Right now, the early lead I can give you on growth for 2020 beyond would be in Medicaid and Medicare. In DSNP, we plan to file a Notice of Intent to play in 170 additional counties in DSNP alone, two states of which would-be brand-new Ohio and South Carolina. With respect to Medicaid there are $30 billion of opportunities coming into the market in our estimation over the next three years, way one Louisiana, Minnesota, Hawaii, Kentucky and possibly Pennsylvania, way two, Tennessee, West Virginia and Indiana. We have a newly developed business development team we vent our key team we're on the ground and many of these geographies are doing a feasibility study, the regulatory environment strength the competitors, our ability to build networks so we're actively at work working on the growth phase of this turnaround. Justin Lake : Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Ana Gupte with SPV Leerink. Please go ahead. Ana Gupte : Hey, thanks good morning. Congrats on 2018 a great performance and just wanted to question about what you put out in January which I thought was a very nice logical presentation on your opportunities to grow. But when you kind of look at the Medicaid if you start with Medicaid benchmarking again the commentary and performance you're seeing from near the national competitors doesn't look like it's that easy to expand margins neither unite it or health care or Cetin [ph] have shown great performance on margin expansion there and trends the spread as you see ups and pressure. And while I can look at all of your margin expansion drivers and they're on the expense I mean is there any read across or why does it look like you can do so much better than yourself and other I guess one on the projector? Joseph Zubretsky : Well, I think Ana, I think the first thing I like to remind folks is that the cost structure that is built into the rating structures is the entire market. And so that, if you can create a cost structure, both your G&A profile and your medical costs profile, that is better than your competitors, you get the lifting rates from the market cost structure. And then you can operate at a more efficient structure and produce best-in-class margins. Now, whether it's sustainable, or now we have to prove that. But to your point about Medicaid, we broke through the 90% barrier on pure performance Medicaid for the year at 89.4. But I would remind everybody that ABD still at 91%, that's $5.5 billion of premium in 2018 alone. So, I do believe there are still is room for modest improvement and our Medicaid line, which obviously is a $13 billion line of business for us. Ana Gupte : Okay. All right. And then just following up on the earlier question related to marketplaces and margins and growth. It's going to go from low-double to very high-single and this year, you'd see, you're not going into 2019 and margins look like there are a bit under pressure. The overall exchange book is down a bit year-over-year and their policy changes and competitive forces at play. Do you think that will remain a big growth driver, I mean looking at 2019, it seems challenging to me to see that happening? Joseph Zubretsky : Well, I think, our market niche is very differentiated. We are servicing, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. the working poor 20% of our membership are fully subsidized, another 70% are partially subsidized. We get to leverage our Medicaid network not only the network itself, but the cost structure in the network to give us very, very competitive cost structure. So, look, for 2019. At this time last year, we were compelled nearly to put trend into the market on top of our 2018 rates. We didn't know at this time last year that 2018 would have turned into a 15% pre-tax year. So, we put trend into the market on top of what we're already very rich rates and we're paying for it on the membership line coming into 2019. That is not going to be the phenomenon in 2019 or 2020. We now know exactly where we sit with our membership. We know the acuity. The churn of members is very low. So, 80% of these members we haven't in prior years. So, we're feeling really good about the stability of our book of business, our ability to now put a more reasonable price point in the market to begin growing again. Ana Gupte : Thanks, Joe for color very helpful. Joseph Zubretsky : You're welcome. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Fidel [ph] with Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Just the first question, just wanted to get a little more detail on the negative spread that you discussed that you're building in for 2019 in Medicaid, and maybe just can you call out which markets in particular where you're seeing rate cost bright upside down? Is it just a few markets or are you seeing that more widespread? Thomas Tran : Well Scott, we don't really like to talk about rates and the strength of rates in individual markets. But I would tell you that it's marginal across all markets, 20 basis points here, 50 basis points there. You're always having debates about trend components. How is pharmacy trending? Sometimes when benefits are carved-in and carved-out. How much premium is a state taking away on a carved-out benefit and how much premium are they putting on our carved-in benefit. So. I would just say all-in-all these are the normal puts and takes of the rating environment. And right now, at about 100 basis points of negative spread this year, it's very stable and very rational and will always have profit improvement initiatives, always have an inventory of profit improve initiatives of 150 to 200 basis points of premium. That is the way you need to run this business. To make sure that in a year where we're presented with a negative spread, we can offset it and keep our margins whole. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, and then just head just one follow-up. Just interested in and what you can update us at this point, just around some of the recent headlines coming out of Ohio on them discussing potentially rebidding the Medicaid contract and just given some of the even sort of above average scrutiny of the PBM servicing the Medicaid plants in that market. Thomas Tran : Sure. We were fully expecting Ohio to reprocure, to drop an RFP perhaps late in 2019, for an effective date in 2020. So, we're fully prepared for that. The new administration, always when near to change administration, you never know what the new plan would be. The new administration in Ohio does seem to be prepared for reprocuring the Medicaid program. So, we're fully prepared to deal with that and given the scope of our business, our market share, in the way we perform, we're extremely confident of prevailing and perhaps even growing in that reprocurement. With respect to PBM and pharmacy, yeah Ohio has been particularly scrutinizing the pharmacy industry. Look, the pharmacy trends where they are, they are putting pressure on cost and everybody knows that. I would say this, we have enough flexibility in our contract with CBS care mark that if whatever Ohio decides they want for a pharmacy benefit carved in, carved out, separate PBM, carved in PBM, we would be able to deal with it and put a proposal that would satisfy their requirements both in medical and for PBM. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead. David Windley : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Joe you mentioned that the Infosys contract, it sounds like will ramp through the balance of the first half of this year and not generate a lot of savings for 2019, I wondered if you could put a ballpark number on what you expect the total savings to be overtime and is that part of the remaining kind of overall cost savings bogey that you have laid out recently or is that somehow separate from that? thanks. Thomas Tran : David, this is Tom. We're not going to disclose specific cost saving with the Infosys contract, but it will be fair to say that it's quite significant compare to our current base of operating - our current base of expenses. And that it's really a multi-year contract, so you should expect to see that to be lasting over a number of years. And it is embedded in the $550 million of saving that we have put out at the last JPM conference. David Windley : Okay, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Tanal, with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Stephen Tanal : Good morning, guys. Just two questions for me. I think on the first one, just thinking about some of the thought processes around Tax Reform and Medicaid rates last year, I think it all suggested that Tax Reform benefits would find their way back to Medicaid rates. But, just wanted to get your updated thoughts on that, are you seeing any actions from the states in that front is that maybe part of the related to the trend discussion or how are you all thinking about that now? Joseph Zubretsky : No, the discussion about the tax regime really enters into rate discussions. Just had most of discussions are around debates about different cost components how they are trending, and the rate take up or take out for benefit carve in and carve out, but very really if ever is there a discussion specifically about taxes. Stephen Tanal : Great, okay. So broad and more sustainable now and I guess just the other one that I had was wondering if you could give us a little more specificity on sort of the savings that are baked into 2019 versus 2020, so in the slides for the call looks like you're stating there was a portion of the $550 million of remaining profit improvement opportunity, if you can maybe size what you expect to sort of book in 2019 in the context of the guide and maybe give us some clarity on what you expect to drive your sort of annual G&A run rate down by about that amount sort of exiting 2019 into 2020. Joseph Zubretsky : Sure, if you look at the $1.87 of earnings per share, we put in the guidance bridge. Just as pull that a part. It's about a $150 million pre-tax. That number is $250 million of gross profit improvements offset by $90 million to a $100 million of hard G&A cost to produce them. And the first thing I would say is we were very exact by including all of the cost to produce those benefits but very cautious in forecasting the benefits that will actually emerge in the P&L. So that $150 million of net profit improvement is $250 million of gross profit improvement offset by a $100 million of the hard cost to produce them. We still consider that conservative and that will build into the run rate that we'll project forward into 2020. Stephen Tanal : Perfect. Great. Thanks for all the clarity. Joseph Zubretsky : You're welcome. Operator : The next question comes from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Sarah James : Thank you. So great guidance for 2019 obviously a very impressive margin profile. Can you Help us understand or breakout parts of that maybe unsustainable, help us understand what part of that is in different products or various lines? Thank you. Joseph Zubretsky : Sarah, as we look at the margin guidance. So, let's to keep it simple, after-tax margin is probably the easier metric to look at, so we're not adjusting for all the puts and takes that hits some things like that. We are maintaining a 3.8% after-tax margin consolidated in an environment where revenues are declining by 10% and in environment where the 2018 margins included $137 million pre-tax were $1.55 of favorable development. So, the question of sustainability is an interesting one, but to maintain that level of margin in that environment particularly compared to 2018 we think is a really good solid forecast to project forward. 2.8% Medicaid, 5% in Medicare and still double digit in marketplace is a very attractive margin profile and really and, in this environment, we think that's a very good start to the year. Sarah James : Second, just to clarify so if we take those segment margin profiles that you talked about in the 3.8 in 2019. Are you seeing that this is sustainable net margin profile for the company? So, I'm thinking back to either there was the 2.3 to 2.7 laid off for 2020. But as you move through some of the cost savings initiatives, is this where the company looks like it's going to be going forward? Joseph Zubretsky : We think high-twos for Medicaid is certainly sustainable. We think that a mid-single digit for Medicare is certainly sustainable. And as we described previously, we believe that as we grow our marketplace business the margin will drop from low double digit to high-single digit. Conscious effort to move the MCR up from the mid-60s to 70 or even low-70s not trip the minimum MLR and grow the profit pool rather than focusing just on the percentage margin. Sarah James : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. So, related to that exchange comment. Is that transition to that new margin profile expected to happen in 2020 or just like a multi-year move for you? Joseph Zubretsky : It's an analysis of the elasticity, the pricing elasticity of the product. And how much growth you think you can put on the books for the level of margin that you're willing to give up to do it. And it's market-by-market geography by geography. We know where our competitors fit, we certainly know their strategy for the metallic tiers. They know ours as well. but with our new marketplace management team, and now that we have a book of business that is 80% repeating, we think we have a very, very good visibility on our marketplace business to grow it at high-single digit rates and never trip the minimum MRR. So it's all the question of how fast we want to grow. It is a multi-year effort. You never like to grow any book of business too quickly. So, it's probably a multi-year effort. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And then you've mentioned that I guess you still have $350 million of cost savings out of the 550 beyond 2019. How should we think about the ramp of and kind of the rest of those savings for the next few years? Joseph Zubretsky : Well, we're just now getting by the point where we've planned for 2019. We'll probably give the market by view of that at our Investor Day in May which will also give glimpse of the 2020 growth rate as well. So, if we could wait another month or so couple of months until May try to give you a forward look of how the profit improvement will emerge over the next couple of years and also how the top-line will grow in the next couple of years. But it's there, we certainly we put it out there for public disclosure so we certainly understand it, we have models that I don't want to say prove it but strongly suggested that it's real and tangible and actionable and they can offset a wide of rate erosion in the marketplace and also help sustain our margins. Kevin Fischbeck : And I guess you probably I think you just said that you don't want to answer this question and wait as well but you mentioned kind of two ways of Medicaid RFPs over the next few years that you worry talk a little bit just about exchange membership and then expanding Medicare into next year. Do you think that you're going to actually grow better in 2020 than your top-line that you did in 2019 excluding the contract losses if you can just kind of put those aside? Is 2020 going to be a year showing that growth or is 2020 still you got so many things investing and it's really 2021, before the top-line grow? Joseph Zubretsky : I think just to give us the next few months, we're in the middle of our three-year strategic planning process, which is culminating in mid-April shared with our Board in May and showing to marketplace in late May. So, you can just indulge us and wait to that point in time, we'll give you a good view of 2020 at that time. Kevin Fischbeck : All right. Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Zac Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Zachary Sopcak : Thanks. Good morning and congrats on a great 2018. Want to ask about the $1.35 higher developments just I'm clear it sounds like your reserving methodology is similar for 2019 is there anything in that $1.35 we should think about unusual as we think about 2019 might progress? Joseph Zubretsky : I wouldn't say there is anything unusual from a sense that our reserve methodology has been very consistently applied quarters-over-quarters. And so, we saw that development coming out and we have the same approach going through 2019. So, we're not predicting any favorable and unfavorable development, but certainly if you follow that methodology then you can draw your own conclusion. What we also see in the first quarter so far is that flu effect has been somewhat attain a low comparing to prior year so that certainly can be a positive sign for potentially a mind seasonal effect of a seasonal high medical cost that you see in winter. Zachary Sopcak : Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And that leads to my second question on seasonality so you seem in 2018 kind of buck traditional seasonality probably given you have a lot of different things going on what's profit improvement opportunities, is there any way you can help us think about seasonality for 2019 given you're also reharvesting additional opportunities or any other way to think about the kind of progression throughout the year? Joseph Zubretsky : Medicare and Medicaid books are pretty evenly distributed from a seasonality perspective. Marketplace is generally backend loaded as to medical cost but last year in 2018, it wasn't. we think we had more chronic members that doesn't mean they were necessarily bad members, but they were just chronic members that were utilizing services throughout the year. So, I think this year you'll see a pretty even seasonality pattern, marketplace could be a little bit back loaded but Medicare and Medicaid could be pretty evenly distributed. Zachary Sopcak : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Gary Taylor with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Gary Taylor : Hi. Good morning. Two-part question; one, you provided GAAP guidance without in relation of intangibles which I think was roughly $0.30 last year I know a little bit of that goes away with the clockwise deals so if you have an update or estimate for 2019? Thomas Tran : We disclosed that in a table in our earnings release the amortization and intangible for 2018. For 2019 you're right it's going to be lower and we estimate it to be in our neighborhood of about $0.20 EPS. Gary Taylor : Thank you. And the second part of my question, can you help us understand a little bit so the exchange enrollment down for 2019. You talked about that the effect of your pricing essentially. Can you talk about Florida a little bit, and what is the impact on your cost structure in Florida and your big strategy in Florida and maybe could you just talk about enrollment and changes in Florida? But does the impact happen - you are all from portion of the state, from the Medicaid perspective have an impact on the Florida exchange enrollment? Thomas Tran : Yeah. So Florida, I would say the Medicaid contract that we have lost in certain region. The space started transition in the fourth quarter late fourth quarter. So, when you look at membership that we disclosed in the table in the earnings release, you would see that 10-F membership declined quarter-over-quarter. And the big chunk of that is really from the Florida market decline as membership transitioned to duration that we will exit. From a view point of impact on a change, the two really doesn't have that much effect, there is not really related. In fact, we do see membership growth for the hit's membership in the State of Florida. Gary Taylor : Okay. So, which states would have been the largely exchanged declined for 2019? Thomas Tran : The larger membership we have in that, if the exchange is really in the State of Texas. So, we do see decline in State of Texas from 2018 into 2019. So, the fluctuation in many different spaces some gains some loss, but certainly Texas has a major impact on the decline from 2018 into 2019. Gary Taylor : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : Thanks, and good morning, everybody. So, Joe, I don't want to beat the exchange topic to depth here. But just coming back to your investor presentation from last month and again that slide that shows Malina marketplace growth scenarios where you talk about the marketplace raise for Malina growing to either $2.6 billion or $3.6 billion. You touched on the margin component of that slide already. But again, just for the revenue side just want to clarify whether those revenue numbers were intended to be actual targets for Malina. And what the timeframe is if there is one, or again was the revenue portion of that slide more just for illustrative purposes. Thanks. Joseph Zubretsky : It was for illustrative purposes. And to be very clear, we're not giving a specific outlook or forecast until our Investor Day in May. But it was really to make the point that if we were to return the business to its original size which was $4 billion. Knowing what we know about our pricing competitiveness, knowing what we know about administrative cost leverage, can we produce high-single digit margins and grow the business back with original state. So, it was less illustrative. We do believe it's doable over some period of time, and how that manifests itself in our ongoing forecast will be showcased at our Investor Day in May. Steven Valiquette : Okay got it. Okay, thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Newshel with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Michael Newshel : Thanks. I know you touched on some specific dates, but can you just break down the exchange loan results for the year, between the same market declines versus gains you saw in new markets. Thomas Tran : We're not going to go into specifics dates by state here. But Michael and I mentioned before is that Texas which were roughly about 55% to 60% of our membership in 2018. We did see decline there, so that's where really the main driver of the membership decline from 2018 into 2019. As you know we have reentered into some new space, the former states that we exited Utah and Wisconsin. We did see some level of membership there. Nothing significant, but the remaining market there are fluctuations up and down. Some we gain, some we lose. I mentioned in fourth quarter we gained some membership. Some market we fairly stable for example state of California fairly stable. So overall, there is a decline definitely from 360 at the end of 2018 into January right now, we are somewhere around 325 to 330. Michael Newshel : Okay. How about, can you signal the impact of the investments that are in the bridge from 2018 to 2019? I think you said pathways and move is a loss, but MMS may have been a slight contributor is the net impact material at all there? Thomas Tran : I would say that about $0.10. Michael Newshel : I'm sorry, was that, it's about a $0.10 headwind the divestment? Thomas Tran : 2018. Michael Newshel : Okay. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Peter Costa : Hi, guys. Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. Really want to talk to a bigger picture about what's going on with RFPs in Medicaid in general. You saw the North Carolina quality scores that came out and you've seen other recent scores that have come out. Have you seen anything that has given you more positive or less positive views on your Texas bid? And in particular, beyond that, do you think there's something that you guys are missing or that you need to have to acquire to look better for some of these are RFPs that seem to be favoring more population health and things like that? Michael Newshel : So, Peter, we're still very optimistic based on everything we know about our RFP bid on Star Plus in Texas. No news is emerged that makes us any more or less competent. We've always been very, very confident in the outcome. We think our strategy and building capabilities internally and our rent to own strategy is the right balance. We really don't believe you need to acquire the equity of a company in order to import an integrated capability. And you've seen us announced a major partnership with some world class partners and you'll see more of that on esoteric and niche capabilities that we think couldn't possibly be scaled adequately or capably in order to deliver into our operating platforms for delivery into a service model. So, we're building capabilities internally on core capabilities. We're looking for co-sourcing partners and a rent to own strategy for esoteric capabilities and as long as they're fully integrated. We believe our products can win in the marketplace and continue to win RFPs. We have no reason to believe that they can't. Peter Costa : Okay. So, we shouldn't expect any further acquisitions regarding especially capabilities or anything like that? Joseph Zubretsky : So, any front I'd always welcome an opportunity to look for a bolt-on membership opportunity and a current state where we get some good operating leverage. But no, not spending capital on EBITDA multiples for capability place. Peter Costa : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Last question today is a follow-up from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Mr. Lake please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks, good morning. So, thanks for the extra question. Just wanted to ask a numbers question on investment income, it looked like you guys guiding to about $195 million. I think there might be other stuff in there besides investment income, but big step up and that number, so, just wanted to get some clarity on that. Thanks. Thomas Tran : Justin, the $70 million increase in investment and other revenue is due to two things. One is that higher investment income, I would say that roughly about 40% of that change and the rest is really the full year effect of the ASO fee for the pharmacy benefit or carve out in a state of Washington whereby work pay when they saw see the manage that program for the state. So, the last year it was only a half year and 2019 is really a full year. So, hope that clarifies the change there. Justin Lake : Thanks for the color. Thomas Tran : You're welcome. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session and also concludes our conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. At this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to Ryan Kubota, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Ryan Kubota : Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The purpose of this call is to discuss Molina Healthcare's financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2019. The company issued its earnings release reporting first quarter of 2019 results last night after the market closed, and this release is now posted for viewing on our company website. On the call with me today are Joe Zubretsky, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Tran, our Chief Financial Officer. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. If you have multiple questions, we ask that you get back into the queue so that others can have the opportunity to ask their questions. Our comments today will contain forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. All of our forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to numerous risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. A description of such risk factors can be found in our earnings release and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-K Annual Report, our Form 10-Q Quarterly Reports, and our Form 8-K Current Reports. These reports can be accessed under the Investor Relations tab of our company website, or on the SEC's website. All forward-looking statements made during today's call represent our judgment as of April 30, 2019, and we disclaim any obligation to update such statements, except as required by the securities laws. This call is being recorded, and a 30-day replay of the conference call will be available at our company's website, molinahealthcare.com. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joseph Zubretsky : Thank you, Ryan, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Last night, we reported earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of $2.99. Pretax earnings of $260 million and after-tax earnings of $198 million resulting in pretax and after-tax margins of 6.3% and 4.8% respectively on a reported basis. These results demonstrate we can sustain the attractive margin position we built in 2018. While certainly not conclusive, our first quarter results validate our position that durable, financial and operational infrastructure improvement can and should allow us to sustain these margins all while we begin to grow the top line again. Our first quarter results represent a strong start to the year and a significant improvement over the $1.64 earnings per diluted share we reported in the first quarter of 2018. As you will recall, this time last year, we were just beginning to execute on our profit improvement plan, which had yet to manifest itself in earnings. While the year-over-year improvement in the first quarter is significant, for the remainder of our prepared remarks, we will largely compare our quarterly performance to our own expectations. Our strong first quarter operational performance and the trajectory of our profit improvement initiatives have allowed us to raise full-year guidance to a range of $10.50 to $11 of earnings per diluted share on a GAAP basis, an increase of $1.25 from the midpoint of our guidance issued in February. Highlighting our results for the quarter on a consolidated basis, premium revenue of nearly $4 billion was better than expected due to better marketplace membership retention, coupled with slower membership attrition during the quarter. As expected, premium revenue has decreased sequentially due to lower Medicaid membership as we transitioned out of New Mexico as of December 31st and exited out of all but two regions in Florida as previously announced. Our medical care ratio of 85.3% was favorable to our expectations as the result of favorable prior year reserve development but more importantly improvement in our claims payment integrity process, frontline utilization management, quality and risk adjustment effort and the repricing benefit of our newly re-contracted pharmacy agreement. Our first quarter 2019 performance was positively impacted by our continued focused on medical cost management and a stable trend environment. Taken together, these factors produced favorable prior-year development of nearly $55 million or approximately $0.65 per diluted share, which we did not forecast in our initial 2019 guidance. These trends have continued in 2019 and as such our 2019 medical cost baseline and the trend off of that baseline so far have proven to be conservatively stated. We managed to a G&A ratio of 7.3% which was better than our expectations. We continued to effectively manage our expenses in the quarter despite the headwinds associated with lower premium revenue. As a reminder, we typically see higher G&A expenses in the latter part of the year due to costs associated with our profit improvement initiatives, as well as sales and marketing expense for the Medicare and marketplace open enrollment. Combined, the favorable medical care ratio and G&A ratio enabled us to deliver an after-tax margin of 4.8%. Now I will comment on our first quarter trends by line of business. The Medicaid business achieved an 88.5% Medical Care ratio and an after-tax margin of 2.8% in the quarter squarely in the range of the target margins we have forecasted for this business. Let me provide some additional insight into the favorable performance of the Medicaid business. TANF and ABD performed better than expected. While expansions slightly underperformed our expectations in the quarter due to some plans specific dynamics, which we will comment on later. Medical cost trends in general remain well-managed. Specialty and pharmacy cost trends ran lower sequentially, and we retained more quality, incentive in other revenue withholds. Our Medicaid business is performing well, producing top-tier margins and well positioned to grow. Our Medicare business comprising our DSNP and MMP products also started the year strong, managing to a medical care ratio of 84.7%, we produced an after-tax margin of approximately 7.5%, outperforming our expectations. More specifically on Medicare, both product lines, DSNP and MMP produced favorable results. We continue to demonstrate excellence and managing high acuity members by providing access to high quality healthcare at a reasonable cost. This includes our market leading management of LTSS benefits which are embedded in our MMP product. We are beginning to see the results of our quality and risk adjustment efforts as our Medicare risk scores are becoming more commensurate with the acuity of this population and risk adjustment revenue has increased. This excellent start to the year gives us even more confidence in our 2020 bidding strategy, and the competitive pricing and enhanced benefits we need as we expand this business by a 150 new counties in 2020. Finally, our marketplace business continues to perform well. Recall that for the 2019 underwriting year, we took a conservative rating posture to maintain our attractive margin position. We now have a scaled and profitable business that we plan to grow in 2020 and beyond. First quarter marketplace performance had the following highlights. We ended the quarter with approximately 330,000 members, which was better than our original expectations. We are generating and continue to generate more accurate risk scores and as a result we will likely pay less into the risk pool than expected. Our medical care ratio was 62.2% which compares favorably year-over-year and sequentially. Texas continues to be our stronghold, while California and Washington have both improved significantly over both periods. And we again forecast a seasonality to this business and as profitability as front-loaded due to benefit in product design. In some and most notably our current marketplace performance trajectory and margin profile give us flexibility to pursue profitable 2020 growth. Now I will comment on the first quarter through the lens of our locally operated health plans. Our health plan portfolio has started the year strong. As for the quarter 13 of 15 plans are meeting or exceeding their target margins. Our operating model continues to pay dividends as we empower local health plans to drive frontline decision-making with strong support from centralized services and disciplined corporate oversight. A few comments on our health plans performance. California, Illinois, Michigan and Texas, four of our largest plans had very solid quarters. Florida was a significant out performer in the quarter as it effectively managed the transition of it's across regions. In Ohio, our Medicaid MCR increased by 300 basis points from the fourth quarter, primarily due to a shift in the Medicaid expansion risk pool and a newly carved in behavioral health benefit, both of which were not adequately rated. We expect both phenomena to soon be reflected in our rates. Washington experienced higher medical costs from the Medicaid line-of-business compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 as a direct result of the new members we gained in our successful re-procurement and the plan wide carve-in of the behavioral benefit. This cost pressure will abate as the new members and new benefit mature. Turning now to our balance sheet and capital structure. We delivered approximately $290 million of dividends to the parent company in the first quarter. We expect to obtain approximately $500 million of additional parent company dividends for the balance of the year, including the excess statutory surplus from Florida and New Mexico. We have continued to improve the balance sheet retiring additional debt. Approximately $78 million of face value of 2020 convertible notes remain outstanding, as we continue to reduce our exposure to these expensive in the money converts that negatively impact our share count. In summary, we are very pleased with our first quarter performance across all of our operating metrics, product lines and health plans, and with respect to capital management. Now I will address our updated and increased 2019 earnings guidance. We are increasing our earnings per share guidance to a range of $10.50 to $11 with a midpoint of $10.75. This midpoint increase of $1.25 or more than 13% represents a solid $0.80 out performance for the quarter and a $0.45 raise for the remainder of the year. The $0.80 earnings per share first quarter out performance comprise $0.65 of favorable prior year reserve development, which we do not forecast as a matter of practice. And $0.15 of first quarter performance above our original first quarter forecast. The $0.45 raised for the balance of the year is backed by the momentum we have in all of our product lines as we project to exceed all of our previous guidance after-tax margin targets. I will now provide a quick update on the initiatives we are executing in 2019 for 2020 top-line growth. As a side note, we will spend more time on this topic at our upcoming Investor Day on May 30th. We have filed to expand our DSNP footprint in approximately 150 new counties for 2020. We are currently executing our 2020 marketplace pricing strategy and remain committed to measured growth ensuring that overall profit dollars grow even if that means lower overall marketplace margins. We are actively preparing for the Kentucky Medicaid RFP with resources deployed locally/ We have our certificate of authority and are building a network. We continue to expect incremental membership growth in our Illinois and Mississippi health plans in 2020, and we continue to have confidence in successful Texas Star Plus and STAR CHIP Awards in the coming months. Our successful margin recovery efforts have enabled us to focus additional effort on growth opportunities. We continue to evaluate new opportunities through state procurements, acquisitions of small health plans, benefit carve-ins and adjacent product expansion in our existing geographies. Let me briefly highlight what we plan to present for a week from now. We will provide you with a granular and detailed view of our top-line growth strategy, along with details of what we will sell, to whom and where in each of our product lines. We will provide you with our outlook for long-term revenue after tax margins and earnings per share. And you will hear from our executive leadership team about our ability to sustain our attractive margin position, our tactical approach to top-line growth initiatives, our robust capital allocation model, and other topics that support our continual drive to create shareholder value. In conclusion, we are very pleased with our first quarter results and our strong start to the year. Margin sustainability, the second part of our three-part plan is off to a good start. We have already launched the phase three, the top-line revenue growth phase and we are excited for what awaits us for the remainder of 2019 and beyond. I look forward to sharing more about our future growth plans and longer-term strategy at our upcoming Investor Day on May 30th in New York City. With that I will turn the call over to Tom Tran for more detail on the financials. Tom? Thomas Tran : Thank you Joe and good morning. As described in our earnings release, we report first quarter earnings per diluted share of $2.99 and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.04 excluding the amortization of intangible assets. GAAP's earning per share of $1.64 in the first quarter of 2018 includes favorable non runway items of $0.38 per share, yielding pure performance earning per share of $1.26.  First, I will note that the two non-recurring items that occur in a quarter net to zero, resulting in first quarter pure performance earnings equal to reported earnings per diluted share of $2.99. Specifically, we recorded $3 million of restructuring expenses, primarily related to costs associated with our ongoing IT restructuring plan and a $3 million gain as part of the repurchase of the 2020 convertible notes and related embedded co-option terminations. Next, I would like to make some comments on our first quarter earnings performance. First, I'll continue focus on medical management combined with a stable trend environment result in favorable prior year reserve development in a first quarter of approximately $55 million pre-tax. Second, each line of business performs at or above our expectations. Third, administrative costs in the first quarter were lower than expected primarily due to the timing of certain expenditures. We expect administrative costs for the balance of the year to increase with higher cost from investment in infrastructure and increase sales marketing costs associated with open enrollment in Medicare and marketplace. Turning to our balance sheet, cash flow and cash position for the quarter. Our reserve approach is consistent with prior quarters and our reserve position remains strong. As we have stated in a past, at quarter end, we remain consistent without reserving approach and practice that result in favorable prior year reserve development in a first quarter. Days and claim payable was down one day sequentially to 52 days. Operating cash flow was strong in the first quarter and sequentially at approximately $250 million. As a reminder, cash flow from operations is impacted by change in working capital and a timing of large payments and government related balances. We are projecting strong operating cash flow for the full year. Turning to capital actions. As of March 31, 2019, we had unrestricted cash and investments of approximately $440 million at the parent company. We harvest $290 million of dividends in the first quarter and planned to harvest approximately $500 million of additional dividends for the balance of the year, including the excess capital in New Mexico and Florida. In a first quarter, we repurchased $46 million of the convertible notes leaving $206 million of face value outstanding. In April, we repurchase an additional $128 million of the convertible notes leaving $78 million of outstanding face value at approximately $240 million of current market value. That will be retired by this time next year. As of March 31, 2019 ,our health plans have aggregated statutory capital and surplus of approximately $2.3 billion which represents approximately 460% % of risk-based capital which is yet another indication of the strong near-term parent company dividend harvesting opportunity. Last week Moody's upgrade our senior unsecured debt rating to B2 from B3 and improve the company outlook to positive from stable. This upgrade is a testament to our focus on operational excellence, as well as the discipline and rigorous financial management processes, we have instilled across the enterprise. We are pleased that Moody's had recognized the progress we have made in a last year-and-a-half. We have continued to look for opportunities to delever the balance sheet. Our action in a quarter to retire certain convertible bonds reduces average diluted shares outstanding to $66.2 million at the end of the first quarter of 2019 from $66.6 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018. Shifting to 2019 revised guidance of $10.75 per diluted share at the midpoint of the provided range or an increase of $1.25 per diluted share. We outperformed our first quarter expectation by approximately $0.80. Approximately $0.65 was related to favorable prior year reserve development, which we did not forecast as a matter of practice. The remaining $0.15 was performance above our expectations for the quarter across all product lines. The remaining $0.45 is an increase to guidance for the remainder of 2019. Favorable medical cost trends, favorable first quarter results, along with our growing profit improvement initiatives suggest that the momentum and trajectory of the business have improved. Our practice is not to provide quarterly guidance, however, some framing comments are in order due to the shifting mix of our business and a ramping effect about profit improvement initiatives throughout the year. Our guidance suggests approximately $7.75 of earnings per diluted share for the remaining three quarters of 2019. The second quarter is forecast to be slightly lower than one-third of that nine months total. Finally, our 2019 guidance does not assume any additional impact from prior year development positive or negative for the rest of the year. All things being equal, if we have favorable prior year development as we did in the first quarter, our forecasts result will be higher and conversely a prior year development is unfavorable, our forecasts result will be lower. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first questions will be from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. ShehryarAmir: Hi. Shehryar Amir on per Justin. So Washington recently approved a public auction plan for the Washington exchanges where Molina participates. Could you give us your preliminary thoughts on this? How this new system will impact Molina? And how the economics will work? And whether the government plan will be completely outsourced? Thank you. JosephZubretsky: This is Joe Brodsky. Obviously, there are various proposals at the state and federal level for public options single-payer Medicare-for-all type arrangements. Right now, we're considering most of these positions to be political rhetoric and at the discussion phase. I would call them more conceptual statements and philosophies rather than plans and until such time the plans become more substantive with real facts and real analysis to assess what the implementation would be, we're just continuing with the business as usual and as more facts come out we respond accordingly. Operator : The next question will be from Ana Gupte of SBB Leerink. Please go ahead. AnaGupte: Hey, thanks. Good morning, Joe, Tom, Ryan. So I appreciate all the fantastic quarter, appreciate all the comments on margin sustainability. I mean you're just crushing it, if you will, but I mean prior to you taking this on Joe, it was like very low single-digit net margins. Now you're almost 5%. You're guiding to 4.1 to 4.3. What is the sustainability number one on the prior development? And should we include that in our baseline as we go into 2020. Then secondly, your points around payment integrity, you had this announcement on Evercore specialty, your PBM margins and all of that. Is this all sustainable or will you trade some of this off as you go for more growth top-line into the 2020 plan year. JosephZubretsky: Thanks, Ana. And let me first comment on the prior year development. Every month every quarter we become more effective at managing our medical costs, and as you're managing your medical costs trend downward, reserves are likely to restate favorably. This trend has continued into 2019 which means the medical cost base line and the trend off of that baseline that we use to forecast our 2019 results have also proven to be conservatively stated. So the prior-year development is real and it's real testament to the fact that we are becoming better and better at managing our medical costs through increased focus on frontline utilization management, and re-engineered and revamped payment integrity routines. To that second point on payment integrity, the team has done a great job updating and making their modern, the stacks of technology we have to perform our claim at it. And it's creating real value without creating provider abrasion. The third part of your question was on specialty UM with Evercore. We have a new arrangement with Evercore. It's part of our co-sourcing and rent-to-own model of making sure we have access to best-in-class resources. They are going to manage about $600 million to $800 million of medical cost spend across a variety of specialty categories. And we're certain that over time that will create real value for us. The last part of your -- actually the first part of your question, but I'll address it last were the sustainability of the margins. We continue to generate profit improvement through the inventory of initiatives we've shared with you in the past. We are in a reasonable and stable rate environment. And our management team continues to execute with a great deal of discipline and rigor. And I would attribute the margin position that we have achieved and we believe can sustain to those to the confluence of those three factors. Operator : The next question will be from Matthew Borsch of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. MatthewBorsch: Yes. Joe and Tom, if I could just ask in terms of the competitive landscape. Are you viewing any new competitors getting into your markets given not only your success and profitability, but some of other peer companies and given the backdrop that a lot of competitors were driven out by the initial exchange implementation? JosephZubretsky: Thanks, Matt. Are you referring to the marketplace or broad -- MatthewBorsch: I'm sorry, yes, the marketplace is what I meant. JosephZubretsky: Well, the term marketplace can mean many things to many different companies. Our niche is to service the working poor. We operate in the demographic where 25% of our memberships are fully subsidized and 95% have a very ample subsidy. It's a pure leverage off of our Medicaid network and it's pure leverage off of the Medicaid pricing in our network. So we consider our marketplace business to be a mere extension, and a very valuable extension of our Medicaid franchise. Others that might be chasing some of this business might be operating with the mass affluent that a self-employed architect or accountant who might be making $200,000 to $250,000 a year. That's not where we are playing. This is a pure extension of our Medicaid franchise. And is creating real value for us. And as people move in to Medicaid, Medicaid expansion and marketplace and move up and down the spectrum based on their income, we have products that can capture that member and keep them in the Molina family. MatthewBorsch: But maybe I could just ask an extension to that. Do you have any plans currently to go up in the income hierarchy in terms of your marketing approach going into 2020? JosephZubretsky: No, not for the marketplace, but let me put a point on that. We do not plan to go up market into higher affluence in a more affluent demographic, but we do plan to grow the business in 2020. If you recall at this time last year before we had visibility into the profitability that we --that emerged in 2018, we were sort of compelled to put conservative prices into the marketplace, which actually proved to be very rich and it cost us some membership. Next year now that we have good visibility, 330,000 members we know where the margins are. We're going rating region by rating region, analyzing our price point versus the competition. If we need network changes will make them and we're very comfortable that with these margins and our competitive position as exists today, we can put a price into the market that grows membership, eases up on the margin percentage ,but grows the overall profit pool in 2020. Operator : The next question will be from Joshua Raskin of Nephron Research. Please go ahead. JoshuaRaskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. First one just on guidance just a couple of quick clarifications from last quarter. I think you mentioned some stranded overhead in New Mexico and Florida of $0.75 and sounded like Florida was outperforming. So just want to confirm if that $0.75 is still there that comes off next year. And I think you'd mentioned sort of this negative spread between the Medicaid trends in the yield of almost $0.90 and again sounds like things are running better, so curious where we are on those two to start. JosephZubretsky: Sure, Josh. On Florida and New Mexico I would say that the stranded overhead was merely to help investors bridge the progress from 2018 to 2019. If you recall when we gave guidance originally for 2019, we were projecting a 60 basis point increase to our G&A ratio, half of which was due to the stranded overhead for Florida and New Mexico. We're going to sort of stop referring to it as stranded overhead, it's in the baseline. It's in our SG&A and we're going to continue to chip away at it and manage it very effectively. The over performance in Florida was really managing the tail of the runoff claims more effectively than we had originally projected. In terms of the spread issue, I would say, first of all, the rate environment is very reasonable. We're generally able to obtain the trend and acuity factors that we need in rating when benefits are carved in and out generally the right amount of premium is moving in and out of our portfolio. And, yes, where we actually thought that rates were going to be challenged to maintain pace with trend due to our increased ability and efficiency in managing medical costs. I would say for the most part, our medical cost trend appears to be coming in on top of rate. JoshuaRaskin: Okay, so that explains better and then my other --my real question here is just with the pending Centene-WellCare transaction, I'm just curious as you guys think about that in terms of opportunities for Molina. Do you think about divestiture opportunities should those arise? Any specific markets where their consolidation would have a direct impact on the states that you guys are operating. I'm just curious as you think about 2020 what do you guys thinking in terms of the potential opportunities for you? JosephZubretsky: Sure. Well, in terms of sort of long term, one of the factors we look at, if you take on average that a state has on average four major players on their Medicaid panel. And let's say on average there are six major players chasing those four spots. It obviously makes the bidding map more likely for us to succeed as we try to plant new flags in new territories. So the bidding dynamics do change as one very capable competitor is now combined with another.  That's the long-term view. The short-term view, look, everybody is written on the speculation of which assets in that combination might have to be divested. I would say this, if that is true and assets have to be divested, if we are invited in to participate and looking at those assets and we are not in and of ourselves conflicted then we certainly would want to compete to secure some of those assets. JoshuaRaskin: Okay and then just Joe, last one here. Any markets where you see potential market share increases for those two on a combined basis maybe not precipitating a divestiture, but where there's an opportunity for membership to shift as the market sort of rebalances. JosephZubretsky: There are and I think we spoke about this actually earlier this morning. It would be really speculated about me to try to infer what a state might do due to the pending merger. Texas comes to mind, Kentucky comes to mind. There's going to be all kinds of-- Florida comes to mind. Interesting dynamics as this pending transaction unfolds. I would just say that we're confident in our ability to grow our business. We're confident in our ability to win new territories. And if the dynamics of this combination actually enhance our chances, well, then all the better. Operator : The next question will be from Sarah James of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. SarahJames: Thank you. You talked about moving exchange pricing this year to target mid 60s to low 70s MCR based on what you know so far do you think that's where you'll end up in 2019? JosephZubretsky: Well, we're certainly, Sarah, not going to give a forecast, but given where we're performing what I would say is that performing at the level we are performing currently with mid-teens pre-tax and still double-digit after-tax margins, gives us the flexibility to look at our price points versus the competition in various these rating regions, both on a gross basis and a net of subsidy basis, and tweak our pricing without the sacrifice of material margin position. So we can ease up on our margins. We can grow membership given the price point, the competitive price points that we have today. And that we can continue to have, given that we have all this margin to sort of play with. So the bottom line is we are going to grow membership, tend to grow membership next year. The margin lease up. The loss ratio will probably move up and our profit pool is projected to grow. And that's what we're going to attempt to do. And I think this very attractive margin position we've carved for ourselves gives us the flexibility to achieve that. St\u00e9phaneHouri: Got it. That's helpful. And a couple questions on Ohio. First, with the behavioral health carve-in that you said wasn't rated correctly, but you expect to be fixed. If part of that retroactive fix or is it only go forward? Then last quarter you talked about expecting in Ohio RFP to be released later this year. Do you think that could include the LTSS product or are you just expecting it to be a repeat of what is already contracted out? Thank you. JosephZubretsky: Our latest intelligence suggests that the RFP will be a Medicaid only and not include an LTSS benefit going managed that's our latest intelligence. I believe there was actually a legislative proposal that determined that. With respect to BH, the benefit was carved in --the entire benefit was carved in 2018 and then they opened up the benefit to some IMD facilities, which everybody started using and it put pressure into our margins. And the state recognizes that. The state actuaries have recognized that. And we believe it will be included in the rate base.  There's always a mid-year conversation with Ohio. So it could go in mid-year, affected mid-year, best case would be to go in mid-year retroactively to the beginning of the year. We're not certain that's going to happen in the worst cases, it goes into the annual rating cycle that happens at 1/1/20. So Ohio is doing just fine. It had some cost pressure due to those two factors in the quarter, but it's doing just fine and effectively those costs wind up in rates. Operator : The next question will be from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America. Please go ahead. KevinFischbeck: Great, thanks. I wanted to follow up on your comments about 2020 growth. I think you talked about 150 DSNP counties in 2020. I think last quarter though you're talking about 170 new markets. What was the change in that outlook? JosephZubretsky: Just as you pursue the various counties, look at your network, look at density of population, which is critical. We decided to move forward with 150 rather than 170, which is not a material change at all. The DSNP product is very important to us. We manage it very, very well and we believe the product line is a growth catalyst for the company. So we're very bullish on that marketplace. We have the high acuity management skills. We have the distribution network. We've got a great Medicare team and we're very bullish on the product line, but the difference in 150- 170 is not material and it was really density of population, ability to build the network. KevinFischbeck: Okay and then as far as the margin commentary, I think you're doing a lot of this outsourcing. I wanted to say, last quarter you guys have talked a bit about how some of these outsourcing is going to impact 2020 more than it was impacting 2019. I wasn't sure if any of the margin improvement that you're seeing is kind of pulling forward some of that benefit or you still expect a lot of these initiatives to keep adding significant additional cost saves going forward. JosephZubretsky: Now the timing is really, really important. If you look at our first quarter results, the only outsourcing co-sourcing or rent own capabilities that actually had an impact in the first quarter were the repricing of our pharmacy contract clearly. And secondly our payment integrity technology stack and thirdly our improvement in risk adjustment and our relationship with Inovalon. The rent own capabilities that are being executed that have not yet manifested themselves in earnings, our IT outsourcing arrangements with Infosys and the arrangement that we just struck with Evercore for specialty UM. So more to come on that and every month that goes by the value, builds and compounds and that $500 million profit improvement portfolio we shared with you a few months ago is still alive and well and being executed upon. KevinFischbeck: But those arrangements aren't incrementally new versus the last guidance. I just want to make sure that you aren't after signing those things now including those in your outlook for Q3 and Q4, those are still kind of on the coming 2020? JosephZubretsky: Yes. They have not yet provided benefits. They are -- they have been singed. They are being implemented but have not yet manifested themselves in the earning stream. That's correct. Operator : The next question will be from Dave Windley of Jefferies. Please go ahead. DaveStyblo: Hi, good morning. It's Dave Styblo in for Dave Windley. First question I had been is if you guys could give us an update on the guidance, where you talked about net margins being better across all three businesses. Is there a specific point that you could give us for those lines, as well as an update on --of the $550 million? How much of that is now in the 2019 guidance? JosephZubretsky: Sure. If you look at our margin achievement pattern for the first quarter and what's implied in our full-year guidance, I'd give you the tails of tape as follows. Medicaid came in with a solid 2.8% after-tax margin, and it's projected in our guidance to be approximately 3%. Medicare came in the first quarter at a solid 7.5%, clearly an out performer. But we're projecting approximately 6% for the full year and marketplace came in at rather outsized 16% and we're projecting it to be solid double-digit at around 11% for the year all blending to the 4.2% at a midpoint that we conveyed to you. What was the second part of your questions? DaveStyblo: Right the second part there is of the $500 million -- $550 million cost base the out year, how much of that is now expected to be captured in 2019 guidance? JosephZubretsky: Well, we're not going to start parsing that every single quarter. We'll talk about it qualitatively. I would tell you that the risk adjustment, the payment integrity and the pharmacy contract clearly added value in the first quarter. Our specialty UM and IT outsourcing arrangements have not yet, but I think the numbers we gave you when we originally gave you guidance of $200 million and $100 million nett is still a good framework, that's included in our overall results, and will update you on the portfolio at our Investor Day in a few weeks. DaveStyblo: Great and then just the last one, I know, Joe, you talked about moving into phase three of the plan and looking for more growth and you sort of highlighted a few things between the exchange opportunities and the DSNP expansion. I'm curious what other carving opportunities are there adjacencies or other new re-procurements. Can you provide more visibility or color on for us? JosephZubretsky: Sure. And I can give you some color around what you're going to hear in a few weeks time. We look at the growth phase very clearly coming from our existing footprint. How to leverage the core business in our existing footprint, with our existing states as new product lines are introduced into these markets. That in it of itself with our very wide geographic distribution and now 15 territories with not all of the product lines in the market and certainly under penetrated compared to some of our largest competitors. We believe it gives us ample room to grow in our existing territories. We then have new states and new territories and with our rebuilt new business development engine, with our recent success at renewing business that we had with great proposal writing. We are very confident that we can start to win new territories as well. We'll talk about that a little bit, but very bullish on the growth of this business. We're in the right product lines. We're in the right segments and hope we will convey to an Investor Day that now that margin recovery and sustainability is well underway that we can start to grow the top-line again very handsomely. Operator : The next question will be from Stephen Cano of Goldman Sachs.. Please go ahead. StephenCano: Good morning. I guess I just had one more follow-up on the after-tax margin. So for just looking at the change in the guidance I guess Medicare is where you have the biggest sort of uptick. Can you give us a flavor for what's coming in so much better there? Is that obviously a very strong rate update 2019, but is that more about cost trend or things you're doing anything specific to call out in Medicare? ThomasTran: Stephen, Tom here. There are really two factors primarily. One Joe mentioned a few minutes ago that we have done a much better job now. We're scoring with adjustment that also applied to a Medicare line of business and secondly is that we've been very effective in managing the cost line as well, primarily on a medical cost size. So it really impacts both sides of the house. StephenCano: Perfect, maybe just one follow up, Tom, and this is probably more for you. Just the PYD, the $55 million pre-tax call out, $0.65 to EPS and then of course there's a table in the release which is I think our best way to try and track this that shows $189 million of a favorable prior period development. Is the difference between those two numbers sort of the offset, or would view as reserve building in Q1 and is there any way we can sort of see that number in any of the filings or try to track to it or is that -- am I thinking about that right and how should you --how would you tell us to keep tabs on all this? ThomasTran: Sure. And obviously in the table you refer to now release also we'll see that in 10-Q when we file today as well. Essentially, you see the walk over from one quarter to the next and that includes the margin release each quarter and our intention every quarter to be consistent without reserve approach is a rebuild at margin. So if you net out the prior your development from that number the essentially the remaining piece is primarily the reserve margin that we intend to reinstitute. StephenCano: Got it. Okay that's just not disclosed anywhere separately there right? So that that's sort of what really on these calls for it, I take it. ThomasTran: That's correct. StephenCano: Got it, okay. And maybe one last quick one, Joe, more for you on the marketplace. Just the commentary around sort of viewing it as --I think you said a pure extension of Medicaid obviously a very different margin profile right now and so how do you sort of bridge that in your head. Is --what's sort of the right level, if there is such a thing for the marketplace business or is it truly just what the market will support and how do you think about that long term? JosephZubretsky: Well, as we mentioned many times both when we gave original guidance two months ago and just recently, we do believe that the right equilibrium can be struck where we can begin to grow the overall profit pool at a lower margin but at a faster rate. We were forced into this conservative posture because the business needed to be repriced two years ago, if you recall the 60% price increase on average I went into the market. And in last year, if you recall with only three months under our belt before putting new prices into the market, we had yet to see the very robust profit picture emerge in 2018.  Now that we've seen the risk pool settle, we understand who the 330,000 members we have and what their cost profile is. We can then use that as a great launching point to begin to grow the overall profit pool once again. Ease up on the price, ease up on the margin, create the right equilibrium, we have highly subsidized members where the price isn't as sensitive to their buying decision as it would be for a mass affluent individual. And it's a great business for us and except for the fact that it's brokered and run by the DOI in the States and looks more like an insurance product, it really is servicing the working poor who have incomes that don't qualify them for Medicaid. So in that way it is a pure extension of our Medicaid business and does really well for us. So the overall profit pool should grow at a lower margin and we think we have the flexibility to pull that off got. Operator : The next question will be Peter Costa of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. PeterCosta: Hi, Joe and Tom, nice quarter, thanks. Can you talk about where the PYD is in this quarter? What business lines is really coming from? In particular I'm interested in how much relates to the exchange business and how much relates to the states that you're doing less business? JosephZubretsky: Sure. We don't disclose PYD by product segment but it would be fair to say that with Medicaid being the lion share of our business, you see a good chunk of that within that line of business. PeterCosta: And does that relate to the states that you are doing less business in? ThomasTran: Florida and New Mexico is a component of that, so we don't parse that out but Joe comment before we managed to run out very well. So a component of that probably you is developing this part of those two states. PeterCosta: Okay, thanks. And then the G&A expense in the quarter, how much of that improvement is really sort of just delayed G&A expense towards later in the year versus your expectations from before? ThomasTran: Sure. There are a number of different factors here. One is that we continue to manage our expense well from Q4 for Q1, you see expense went down roughly about $30 million in total. However, the ratio gone up a little bit maybe 20 basis or so. And then comparing to our own expectation is actually running a little bit better than our expectation and we manage our cost well. There's some timing of spending on infrastructure that will appear in second to fourth quarter. These primarily relating to investment in capabilities to grow our business. Joe mentioned DSNP marketplace investment in really provider and member enhancement to their experience as well as building up really upgrading a number of our technology facility as well. So that's how you're going to see that step play out over the next couple quarters as well. PeterCosta: So let me put words your mouth relative to your prior expectation is just a little more skewed to the back half of the year than this first quarter. ThomasTran: That's right. Operator : The next question will be from Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Please go ahead. StevenValiquette: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Joe and Tom. I\u2019ll echo the sentiments of everyone else that these results continue to be impressive. The MLR trend in Medicaid in 1Q was pretty solid. I think everyone on this call has heard some other managed care companies talk about some pockets of elevated cost trends in Medicaid in 2018 that may have lingered a little bit into early 2019. It doesn't seem like Molina is really seeing that basing your results or maybe just perhaps you can comment on your view around this concept of pockets of elevated Medicaid costs versus industry dynamics around Medicaid costs overall? Thanks. JosephZubretsky: Right, yes. I think the two cost pressures we observed in the quarter were really more related to incidents and events rather than trends in our view. So you take on 30,000 new members in Washington due to a very successful re-procurement and handle a newly carved in behavioral benefit, you're going to get some cost pressure. We believe this will abate in the upcoming months. In Ohio, we did observe a moving of membership off the Medicaid rolls late in 2018 due to a very focused re-eligibility re-determination efforts. And as many suspect and is generally true, it is healthier people that go back to work meaning that you're left with a slightly higher acuity risk pool and we saw some cross pressure there. And as I said before the state of Ohio actuaries have already recognized that this is clearly a phenomenon that needs to be rated. So we believe these cost pressures are temporal. They will be effectively rated and those two businesses do really well for us and our two of our better run health plans. Operator : The next question will be from Scott Fidel of Stephens. Please go ahead. ScottFidel: Hi. Thanks. So it looks like CMS maybe trying to breathe some new life into the duals pilots with this recent letter that they sent to the state Medicaid directors. So, Joe, just interested in your thoughts on some of the concepts that CMS discussed in that letter and whether you think this could be a catalyst here for some improved growth momentum around those pilots. JosephZubretsky: Well, I think two things, Scott. One is CMS has voiced increasing support for the integrated approach, the MMP product whether it's a demonstration or permanent. And with $2 billion of Medicare revenue, $1.4 billion of which is in the MMP demonstrations. We're very well positioned no matter which way they pivot. So the fact that they voiced support for this fully integrated approach is certainly a strategic coupe for us. In terms of some of the rating factors and the way they're going to manage the program whether they are a profit caps, et cetera remains to be seen how all that plays out. Well, we've done very well with the MMP product line. We're absolutely certain that if it expands we'll play there. If they convert it to more of a permanent type of DSNP program, we're well positioned to capture it. And we're just really good at managing these high acuity populations no matter what the wrapper they choose to put it in. And that's what we're focused on right now. So we're following the regulations closely. We've been able to be adaptable and flexible in dealing with every regulation that's been thrown at us in the past. We have a great team and we know we'll be able to implement whatever changes are put to us and we'll manage it very effectively. ScottFidel: Got it. And then just had a follow-up question. Just going back to that Washington public plan and totally got you in terms that are being tons of different rhetoric and proposals and lot of them don't have meat on the bone, but just had one specific question on that one since in the bill they did talk to sort of the reimbursement levels that would be included in the public plan and talk to a 135% for primary care, first Medicare and then a cap of 160% for hospital and other. Just interested in terms of competitively how that may compare to how reimbursement rates tend to be negotiated in the exchange market. I know that it's around 167% on average for the overall commercial market, but I would assume that given the tighter networks in the exchanges, it's probably more comparable with some of those ranges that were in the Washington Bill, but just interested in your thoughts on that. JosephZubretsky: Scott, I will claim not to have caught up with the specifics of the Washington Bill. But more generally to the point you're making, we find it rather plausible and realizable that when we are putting together a network for the Marketplace off of our Medicaid network, that negotiating up from a Medicaid rate actually proves to be more cost efficient than a commercial player coming in and negotiating down from a commercial rate, which means that our network plays well, because it's the working poor, but it's also priced right. So I think that's the point you were referring to. We continue to be successful in managing and leveraging our Medicaid network into the Marketplace due to the highly subsidized nature of the population and it's priced right as evidenced by the margins we're achieving and the amount of margin we'll be able to put back into pricing to grow the business again. Operator : The next question will be from Charles Rhyee of Cowen. Please go ahead. CharlesRhyee: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on earlier comments, Joe. When you talked about -- I appreciate the comments you said about potential for gains through divestiture is obviously from some of the potential transactions out there, but you also made -- is that what you were talking about in your earlier comments when you were kind of referring to some opportunities for M&A in the future or were you talking more separately about just general opportunities you see to expand traffic areas? JosephZubretsky: Charles, we were actually referring to both. Certainly, the specific M&A transaction you're referring to, let's wait and see how it unfolds and we'd hope to be invited in and take a serious look at those assets. But more generally speaking, we do have a business development team here, one that I've used in the past. They're very good at what they do. And as we look at new geographies or expanding existing geographies, there are many, as you know, small provider-own plans, by the 1C3 scattered across the United States that dabble in Medicaid. Many of these plans are under-managed, sort of orphaned. They're hard to find, but they can be incredibly valuable if you can absorb someone's membership on top of our cost structure that we've proven to be best-in-class. These can be tremendously [Technical Difficulty]. They're not going to make major headlines, because most of the names are nondescript, but we are looking at plans around the country in existing geographies and to light up new geographies. CharlesRhyee: Great. Sorry about that. Just a follow-up though. When we think about these kind of opportunities should we think about them as a potential 2019 event or is this really as we think about 2020? JosephZubretsky: We're looking at opportunities now. And obviously without anything announced in the time to close, I would say that anything we would even action this year is likely not to have benefit for until 2020. As I said, we never do project the benefits from inorganic or pseudo inorganic growth assuming other plans. They're hard to do. It's a bi-party or sometimes a tri-party transaction. They're hard to predict, but we're actively at it and looking for these sometimes value-creating opportunities. We've done it before and the team I have knows how to execute. End of Q& A Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session and will also conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for attending today's presentation. And at this time, you may disconnect your lines.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Trudell. Please go ahead. Julie Trudell : Good morning and thank you for joining Molina Healthcare\u2019s second quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today are Molina\u2019s President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky and our CFO, Tom Tran. The press release announcing our second quarter earnings was distributed yesterday after the market closed and the release is now posted for viewing on our company website. A replay of this call will be available shortly after the conclusion of the call for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in your earnings release. For those listening to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that the remarks made herein as of today, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. In this call, we will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our second quarter 2019 press release that we issued last night. During our call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including statements relating to our growth prospects, our 2019 guidance, our pending Texas RFP and our long-term outlook. Listeners are cautioned that all in the forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K Annual Report for 2018 filed with the SEC as well as risk factors listed in our other reports and filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call up and take your questions. Finally, as you may have noticed from our earnings release issued last night, we have enhanced our disclosures of information eliminating the need for a quarterly supplement. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe? Joe Zubretsky : Thank you, Julie and thank you all for joining us this morning. Last night, we reported earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of $3.06, pre-tax earnings of $257 million and after-tax earnings of $196 million, resulting in pre-tax and after-tax margins of 6.1% and 4.7% respectively on a reported basis. We are very pleased with our second quarter and first half performance in which we are demonstrating that we can sustain our attractive margin profile, while pivoting to top line growth. The business continues to generate significant excess cash flow and our revenue growth initiatives are well underway. We are raising our full year earnings per diluted share guidance by $0.60 at the midpoint of the prior range, with a new range of $11.20 to $11.50 for the full year. Now, some highlights for the first half of the year. Premium revenue was $8 billion and in line with expectations. As our membership flows have stabilized, our rates remain sound and our retention of at-risk premium continues to improve. We managed to a medical care ratio of 85.5% in the first half as we continue to demonstrate our ability to manage medical costs, execute strong rate advocacy efforts and continue to improve our claim payment practices. The year-to-date G&A ratio was 7.6% also in line with expectations. As we efficiently managed our resources to provide excellent service to our members and providers, all while continuing to invest in revenue growth initiatives. We continue to harvest dividends from our operating subsidiaries and have used the cash to pay down debt, lower interest expense and provide ample dry powder at the parent company to reinvest in growth. We have a very strong balance sheet and a simplified and efficient capital structure. Now some comments on performance by line of business. In the Medicaid business, we achieved an 88.3% medical care ratio and an after-tax margin of 3% for the first half of the year squarely in the range of the target margins we have forecasted for this business. Some specific points on Medicaid, TANF and ABD generally performed in line with our expectations and Medicaid expansion outperformed. Medical cost trends remained well managed across all medical cost categories as the result of our continued improvement and utilization management and payment integrity and we continue to improve on our retention of quality and incentive revenue. Our Medicaid business is performing well producing top tier margins and well positioned to grow. Our Medicare business, comprising our D-SNP and MMP products, continued to perform well as we managed to a medical care ratio of 85% for the first half of the year and produced an after-tax margin of approximately 7.4%, outperforming our expectations. More specifically on Medicare, we continue to demonstrate excellence in managing high acuity members by providing access to high-quality healthcare at a reasonable cost. This includes our market leading management of long-term services and supports benefits which are embedded in our MMP product. We continue to see the results of our quality and risk adjustment efforts. As our Medicare risk scores are becoming more commensurate with the acuity of this population and risk adjustment revenue has increased. And our attractive Medicare margin profile gives us plenty of flexibility to reinvest in additional benefits, which should help us maintain our product competitiveness as we position this business to grow in 2020 and beyond. Finally, our marketplace continues to perform well. We managed to a medical care ratio of 64.7% and an after-tax margin of 13.6% for the first half of the year. Specifically, the risk pool has seasoned and our medical cost is stable and being well-managed. We are capturing more accurate and complete risk scores. And as a result, we are paying less into the risk pool. And our membership is lapsing at the expected monthly level of less than 2%. These results and metrics were in line with our expectations and our prior guidance. The margin profile of the marketplace business also gives us ample flexibility to ease up on rates, improve the value-added benefit and pay competitive commissions, so we can grow membership in 2020 albeit at a lower, more sustainable, but still attractive margin. Now, I will comment on the first 6 months of the year through the lens of a locally-operated health plans. Our health plan portfolio has continued to perform well. Our operating model continues to pay dividends as we empower local health plans to drive frontline decision-making with strong support from centralized services and disciplined corporate oversight. California continues to perform well in its very diversified book of business and in one of the more complex network environments in the country. With 590,000 members, our effective medical cost management and low cost networks are producing MCRs in the mid-80s. As such, our California plant is poised to grow, particularly in returning to meaningful marketplace market share. In Ohio, with 297,000 members, we are generating solid margins, with a total book MCR of 88.2% for the first half of the year. The spike in Medicaid medical cost due to the introduction of the behavioral benefit and the higher acuity mix that came from re-determination efforts has been ameliorated by our effective rate advocacy in the state. We believe we are well positioned for the upcoming re-procurement. In Washington, with 811,000 members and a diversified portfolio of products, our margin position is returning to its historical level even with the confluence of significant membership growth due to our successful re-procurement and the introduction of the new integrated behavioral benefit. The higher medical cost trends experienced early this year due to the significant growth have abated as a result of the increase focused on in-patient stays and care management. In Texas, with 360,000 members, we await the announcement of the STAR PLUS STAR CHIP awards at the end of August. The continued excellent performance in our ABD business contributes to our confidence in the pending reprocurement. In summary, we are pleased with our second quarter and first half performance across all of our operating metrics, product lines and health plans and with respect to capital management. Now, I will address our updated and increased 2019 earnings guidance. We have had a strong start to the year and very good momentum as we head into the second half. Our margin sustainability efforts have clearly taken root. This gives us confidence in raising full year earnings per share guidance to a range of $11.20 to $11.50 with the $11.35 at the midpoint and an after-tax margin of 4.3%. This earnings per share guidance implies achieving medical care ratios of approximately 88% for Medicaid, 85% for Medicare, and 69% for marketplace resulting in after-tax margins of approximately 3%, 7% and 11% respectively. With these medical care ratios and after-tax margins which are in the top decile, we are taking a cautious approach to forecasting any further margin improvement for the remainder of the year. Many times the positive implications of favorable reserve developments are overlooked. As we continue to improve the management of our medical costs, we continue to outperform the medical cost trend assumptions embedded in reserving. This means our medical cost baseline and our cost trends for the current year dates of service could be conservatively stated. Our attractive and sustainable margin position that we have laid out in our full year 2019 guidance provides a strong earnings baseline as we pivot to top line growth in 2020 and beyond. I will now provide an update on 2020 and the longer term outlook. As I shared with you at Investor Day, we expect 2020 premium revenue to grow by 7% to 9% reported by growth in all three lines of business. This excludes any impact of the Texas RFP outcome, which has not yet been announced. Our top line growth initiatives for 2020 are well underway. In Medicaid, growth in 2020 will benefit from the annualized impact of the RFP awards, that we implemented and launched this year, along with expected Medicaid expansion growth in some markets. For instance, we have planned growth in Mississippi, Illinois and Washington and the potential for Medicaid expansion in Utah. In Medicare, there are more than 400 counties nationally, where we offer only Medicaid and our Medicare footprint is under-penetrated in approximately 65 existing counties. We have filed D-SNP pricing in 150 new counties for 2020, which includes enter into new states, South Carolina and Ohio. In marketplace, our 2020 marketplace rate bids have all been submitted. All of our submissions have not yet been made public. So, we will not be commenting on rates in specific markets. Our approach is to perform a very detailed market-by-market analysis to evaluate our competitive pricing position. We believe we have competitive products that will be priced well against the competition. We have maintained a very robust broker network and believe that our broker compensation plans will now be more competitive. Inorganic growth prospects are also an important dimension of our long-term growth strategy. And while we will never comment on specific opportunities, let me offer some brief thoughts on our activity in this potential value creating area. We expect to have $1.8 billion of investment capacity over the course of 2019. This comprises $500 million of cash currently at the parent, $900 million of presently available unused debt capacity and $400 million of additional dividends, we expect to harvest over the balance of the year. If available, we would prefer to invest in attractively priced blocks of membership in our core products rather than buying back our own shares as the operating leverage of membership growth is attractive. And we would prefer to grow our capital base rather than to shrink it. With our proven turnaround skills, we would also find value in acquiring health plans to harvest the performance improvement synergies for the benefit of our own shareholders. Our business development team is working the landscape hard to develop these types of opportunities. Nothing about our long-term outlook has changed since Investor Day except for another solid quarter of performance and increased confidence in our future. A recap of our long-term outlook. We are committed to delivering 10% to 12% revenue growth which will be derived from a combination of end-market growth in premium yields, actions we have taken our product growth strategy and from winning new territories. We will produce sustainable margins at a range of 3.8% to 4.2% with a midpoint of 4%, which is where we are today. We are committed to long-term net income growth of 9% to 11% and we are committed to earnings per diluted share growth of 12% to 15% after deploying the excess capital generated. We are and we will be a pure-play government managed care business. We are going to stay close to the core. We believe that the government managed care business has very attractive growth characteristics with compelling free cash flow generation. We aspire to be the lowest cost highest margin producer in this high growth industry. In conclusion, we are very pleased with our second quarter and first half results and continued progress this year. Margin sustainability, the second part of our three part plan is off to a very good start and we have launched the third phase that is to generate double-digit top line revenue growth. We are excited for what awaits us for the remainder of 2019 and beyond. Now I will turn the call over to Tom Tran for more details on the financials. Tom? Tom Tran : Thank you, Joe and good morning. We report second quarter earnings per diluted share of $3.06 on a GAAP basis and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.11 excluding the amortization of intangible assets. Our pure performance earnings for the quarter is $2.91, which exclude the positive impact from the net $0.15 gain on repayment of the convertible notes partially offset by restructuring costs. Let me provide some additional commentary on our performance for the second quarter. Premium revenue for the second quarter of 2019 decreased 10.3% to $4 billion compared to $4.5 billion in the second quarter of 2018, which was in line with our expectations. Premium revenue for the second quarter increased 2.5% sequentially. The consolidated MCR for the second quarter of 2019 was 85.6% compared to 85.3% in the second quarter of 2018. Our continued focus on medical management, combined with a relatively stable trend environment, result in favorable prior period development of approximately $28 million pre-tax or $0.33 per share. The MCR for the 6 months ended June 30, 2019 improved to 85.5% compared to 85.7% for the same period in 2018. Favorable prior year period development for the first 6 months of 2019 was in line with the same period in the prior year. The G&A ratio for the second quarter of 2019 was 7.8% compared to 6.9% in the prior year. For the six months ending June 30, 2019, the G&A ratio was 7.6% compared to 7.2% for the same period in 2018. For both periods, the increase in the G&A ratio was mainly due to the decrease in total revenue year-over-year and was generally in line with our expectations. G&A expense increased in the second quarter from the first quarter of 2019 and was impacted by the timing of expenditures. Interest expense was $22 million compared to $32 million in the second quarter of 2018. The decline was due to continued repayment of debt. Turning to our balance sheet, cash flow and cash position for the quarter, our reserve approach is consistent with prior quarters and our reserve position remains strong. As we have stated in the past, at quarter end, we remain consistent with our reserving practice that result in favorable prior period development in the second quarter. As of June 30th, 2019, our health plans had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately $2.2 billion, which is well in excess of 400% of risk-based capital, which is yet another indication of the strong near term parent company dividend harvesting opportunity. We harvest $345 million of dividends in the second quarter or a total of approximately $635 million year-to-date. We plan to harvest approximately $400 million of additional dividends for the balance of the year. Together with unused debt capacity, we currently have over $1.4 billion of available capital for deployment and expect available capital to be $1.8 billion by year end. We reduced the principal on convertible note by $139 million during the quarter and $185 million, since the beginning of the year. Capital deployment actions have result in lower interest expense, a gain on repayment on the convertible notes and a lower share count, which decreased to 64 million shares from 66.7 million share in the same period of the prior year. As of June 30, 2019, our medical claims payable totaled $1.8 billion compared to $2 billion as of December 31 2018 due to the decline in premium revenue and a reserve on loss contracts have been paid down. Days and claim payable represent 48 days of medical cost expense compared to 49 days in the second quarter of 2018 and 52 days in the first quarter of 2019. The sequential decrease in days and claim payable is primarily due to seasonal factors. Operating cash flows for the first six months ended June 30th, 2019 amounted to $156 million and is lower year-over-year, due to the impact of timing of settlements with government agency and premium receipts from CMS. Shifting to our outlook, we raised full year 2019 earnings guidance to a range of $11.20 to $11.50 per diluted share, with the midpoint of $0.11 and $0.35 per diluted share or an increase of $0.60 per diluted share. This increase is comprised of the following, $0.15 per share net gain from the extinguishment of the convertible debt, partially offset by restructuring costs and $0.45 earnings per share outperformance, which comprise off, $0.33 per share of improved claim cost, reflected in prior year period development, which we do not forecast, and $0.12 per share from general outperformance for the balance of the year. Finally, our 2019 guidance does not assume any additional impact from prior-year period development, positive or negative for the rest of the year. While we do not normally provide quarterly guidance, a quick thought on the trajectory of earnings on the back half of the year. We expect that our third quarter earnings will represent slightly less than half of the earnings for the remainder of the year, due to the ramping of our profit improvement opportunities. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from David Windley of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Julie Trudell : Dave, you ready? Operator : David, your \u2013 David, your line is open. David Windley : Sorry, just can you hear me now? How about that? Operator : Yes, yes we can hear you. David Windley : Can you hear me? Yes, okay. Sorry, multi-part question on rates. Joe, you\u2019ve talked about the Medicaid environment being kind of better than average. Curious, if you still view it that way. Second, on your comments on risk adjustment and at-risk revenue retention, where do you think you stand there in terms of your recapture on at-risk premium? And third, in the exchange market environment, you talk about kind of easing your pricing in that environment to resume enrollment growth. Can you talk about the dynamic with such a high percentage of the enrollment subsidized, to what extent does, do changes in pricing have an impact on consumer decisions, in that highly-subsidized market? Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : Great, Dave. I\u2019ll take those in order. We believe the Medicaid rate environment is very stable, rational and actuarially sound. We have been experiencing a medical cost trend in the very low single-digits in our Medicaid business. And rates have generally kept pace with the rate of medical cost inflation. With respect to risk adjustment and at-risk revenue, across all of our lines of business, Marketplace, Medicare and Medicaid, we continue to improve our performance and retaining at-risk revenue and that is obvious \u2013 emerging in the results in a very obvious way. So we continue to get better at, whether it\u2019s quality withholds in Medicaid, whether it\u2019s risk adjustment in marketplace, whether it\u2019s star ratings in Medicare across the board, we are just getting better and better at retaining at-risk revenue. And as I said, it\u2019s showing up in our medical care ratios. And lastly, yes, with the performance of our marketplace business, when the year is over, we\u2019ll have 275,000 members, $1.5 billion in revenue and a 11% after-tax margins. There is ample flexibility to improve the value-added benefits we inject into the products, to ease up on rates. We\u2019ve seen some of the rate filings in certain states and we believe our pricing for 2020 is well positioned us to grow versus the competition. So our prospects for growing the marketplace business in 2020 are seem to be moving along at good execution path. But we\u2019ll know more when we see some of the competitive rates, particularly in the larger states like Texas and Florida. Hope that answers your question. David Windley : Great, thanks. Yes. Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Peter Costa of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Peter Costa : Thanks. I wanted to ask about the TANF and CHIP business medical loss ratio. It seems like it deteriorated a little bit year-over-year. Others have talked about pressure in Medicaid loss ratios, what do you think the issue there \u2013 is it really just that the mix is no longer improving with tightened eligibility and no longer getting sort of the incremental people found from signing up for healthcare reform, meaning that you need a higher rate from states going forward or what\u2019s happening in there that\u2019s causing the rates not to keep up with trend? Joe Zubretsky : Thanks, Peter. For the most part our TANF and CHIP business is performing as expected. And you\u2019re right, in many states and for us, in particular \u2013 places like Ohio and Michigan, where eligibility redetermination efforts have been ongoing. It is fair to say that there is an acuity mix shift that occurs. Generally speaking, healthier people are the ones returning to work and the unhealthy population will stay on the Medicaid roles. So, you do get in acuity mix shift, not only in traditional TANF and CHIP, but in Medicaid expansion where the incomes are a little higher. So there is a phenomenon there, but I will tell you that for the most part, the states have been very reasonable and recognizing the acuity mix shift and our rate advocacy efforts have allowed us to actually get rate relief on some of these acuity mix shift. So, I would call it a sort of a mild trend that\u2019s putting a little bit of pressure, but not really a phenomenon that has to be dealt with in a dramatic way. Peter Costa : Okay. Tom Tran : And Peter, last year, we didn\u2019t have any Mississippi start up at a time so that also add a little bit to the start of business in Mississippi to our \u2013 if you compare Q1 this year \u2013 Q2 this year versus Q2 last year, so that\u2019s another data point for you. Peter Costa : Yes, great. That brings me to my second question which is, you have very high targeted margins in your businesses, but you don\u2019t have as much growth as some others have. And where you have had growth like Mississippi or Washington and places like that. And you\u2019ve seen pressure on your margins. Would you be willing to trade your high margin targets for more growth going forward? And can you talk about sort of the trade-off between growth and margin at least in the first year or two? Joe Zubretsky : So, I would say on with Washington in particular when you grow 30,000 members, due to an incredibly successful re-procurement and there is a major carve-in of the integrated behavioral benefit there will always be some level of uncertainty as to whether the rate you obtained was reasonable and enough to capture the trend that you\u2019re going to experience. If I consider some of these pressures that we\u2019ve been experiencing, more benefit related then trend related and they will essentially and effectively end up in rates as they did in Ohio with the integrated behavioral benefit and the higher acuity mix shift that happened in the expansion population. So, in answer to your broader question about would we be willing to invest margins and growth? Yes, I mean, we do believe we can sustain these margins and perpetuity and start growing the top line at double digit rates. We believe our cost structure is very, very effective and we aim to be the lowest cost, highest margin producer and high-growth industry. So we will invest some of our marketplace margins and product features and pricing next year to grow, but we really do believe we can maintain a single-digit Medicare margin and a 3% Medicaid margin in perpetuity. Peter Costa : Thanks and congrats on the quarter. Joe Zubretsky : Thank you. Operator : Thank you very much. Next question is from Josh Raskin of Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Josh Raskin : Thanks. Good morning. Just two questions, the first is just, it is using about the three segments into 2020 and maybe even beyond, are there specific sort of margin resets? I know, you\u2019ve talked about the pricing on the exchanges or in the marketplace for you guys. But in Medicaid or Medicare, are there minimum MLR resets? Are there state arrangements on profit? Are you sharing things like that or other sort of like technical requirements, where you would expect the margins to normalize, just based on sort of being above target margins? And then the second question just on the M&A commentary, certainly appreciate you guys looking for books of business and understand that rationale. Is that a commentary around the potential divestitures from Centene, WellCare? Or is that a broader commentary around provide your own plans and other plans in the marketplace? Joe Zubretsky : Well, Josh, on your first question about margin resets in our three segments, the margins we\u2019re achieving today are subject to all the caps and corridors that exist in the various markets. Various markets as you know, G&A caps, there are profit caps, there\u2019s quality withholds, there\u2019s all types of features to sort of regulate the amount of profit, you can earn in the 3% margin in Medicaid is subject to all of those puts and takes. So, I don\u2019t see a margin reset coming in the Medicaid business at all, and Medicare and our MMP product, they have introduced a various levels of minimum MLRs that probably will change over time, maybe a little bit of pressure on the MMP product, but that\u2019s the only phenomenon, I can actually think of, that represents anything close to profit pressure due to profit caps, corridors and the like. On your last comment on M&A, that was a very general comment recognizing the significant financial capacity we\u2019ve created in a short period of time and returning to positive operating leverage. As a reminder, we had negative operating leverage last year when we lost the Florida and New Mexico contracts and we want to start creating positive operating leverage and there is significant operating leverage to create if we can attract books of business. So, as a recognition of positive, returning to positive operating leverage and the significant financial capacity, we have created. We would never comment on any specific situation with respect to M&A. Josh Raskin : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Joe. Joe Zubretsky : Bye, Josh. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks, good morning. Let me just follow up a little bit on the \u2013 Josh asked about margins, just broadly on 2020. Can you, thinking about the run rate of earnings in 2019 into next year. I know for instance, you guys typically exclude the incremental PYD that you kind of called out so far year-to-date as a headwind to next year. Is there any other headwinds that you would want us to kind of consider and anything else you \u2013 we should keep in mind as we kind of look to 2020 in that, versus that 12% to 15% growth rate target that you have out there on EPS? Joe Zubretsky : Justin, no, really. The good news about this year is when we print the final numbers, if everything goes as planned, it will be a very, very clean year, the revenue base, the MCR, the SG&A ratio, the margins we\u2019re producing are all very reflective of the earnings power of the business. So we finally have a clean stable year, where we can step back, look at it and say, this is the baseline of which we will grow. So there really are no significant headwinds or tailwinds as we emerge into 2020. As we said with 7% to 9% premium growth projected for next year, we should return to positive operating leverage and the margins on that business should hold. So, we\u2019re feeling without giving a forecast for 2020 which we\u2019re not \u2013 we\u2019re feeling pretty good about the trajectory we are on for the second half of \u201819 into \u201820. Justin Lake : Got it. And then just following up, and I apologize if I missed this before, you talked about the 7% to 9% premium growth, were you able to give a breakdown of kind of where you see that coming from specifically, especially on the exchanges versus Medicaid. Joe Zubretsky : We haven\u2019t done it specifically, but generally what we\u2019ve said is, we filed in 150 new counties in our D-SNP product. We\u2019re only in 65 today. And we actually expect to grow market share in the 65 we\u2019re in, because we are woefully under penetrated in those 65 counties, so we have good growth prospects for Medicare. And marketplace as you suggested, we will ease up on rates as you probably saw in some of the rate filings, where our margins today are outsized we can reinvest in the product, we\u2019re going to do a better job pricing brands, we\u2019re seeing a lot of people select brands over silver, because of the lower monthly premium. So, we\u2019ll do a better job there, so very confident in our ability to grow the top line in marketplace. With respect to Medicaid, it\u2019s mostly going to come from in-market extensions of run rates we\u2019re creating this year. Mississippi run rating into next year, we\u2019ve had a good year in Illinois and South Carolina, building our revenue base, due to better positioning in the auto-assignment algorithm. Washington, the growth that they\u2019ve experienced this year will extend into next year. So, most of the growth in Medicaid next year will come from things that already exist today. So, it\u2019s merely an extrapolation of the benefits that we\u2019re enjoying this year, due to some end market growth. Justin Lake : Thanks for the color. Joe Zubretsky : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Sarah James of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Sarah James : Thank you. It seems like you\u2019re the second company to flag this redetermination, and I\u2019m wondering, if this is something that\u2019s always been going on to this degree or if states are kind of approaching it with a new vigor and that\u2019s why it\u2019s coming up. And then you talked about being able to resolve any shifts that causes in mix through rate advocacy, I was hoping you could give us an idea of what the turnaround timeline on that is? Is this something that you typically will resolve in the first quarter? Or does it take a couple of quarters of advocacy to get the payments where you need them to be? Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : Sarah, on redetermination, I think there are a couple of factors at work here. One is, I think it\u2019s fair to say that certain states have an increased focus on re-determination, which makes perfect sense. They\u2019re spending tax payers\u2019 money and they want to make sure that people on the role are actually eligible for Medicaid. So, there is an increased focus. It seems to have abated a bit. But secondly, we\u2019re dealing with a very good economy and people are returning to work. And as they return to work, the healthier people will return to work and the sicker people who can\u2019t work, will stay on the roles, which therefore creates the acuity mix shift that you observe. We can do, as a company, we can do a better job, keeping people that are going through the re-determination process. We believe that some of the softness in our membership roles over the past couple of years have been or because we\u2019ve been lax and working with our members to keep them on the roles, should they continue to be eligible and they leak out of our, out of Molina into the system and wind up in other companies, and we\u2019re going to do a better job, keeping them on the Medicaid roles if in fact they are eligible. On the rate adequacy efforts, the states are very aware of that healthier people go back to work and the less healthy people stay on the roles. A recent example in Ohio, where there was a rate advocacy effort to look at the re-determination effort that took place there, to look at the acuity mix that stayed on the Medicaid roles. And the market in general, including Molina has been very successful and making sure that rates have stayed commensurate with the acuity of the population. So, there is usually a lag time, but states have been very reasonable to observe that phenomenon. And had been agreeable to making sure the rates are adequate. Sarah James : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And one clarification, in the release you guys mentioned a decrease in marketplace risk adjustment compared to \u201818. Can you quantify how much that was? Joe Zubretsky : I\u2019m sorry, your question against, Sarah, risk adjusted on. Sarah James : Yes, the marketplace risk adjustment that you guys experienced this quarter that relates to 2018. Can you quantify how much that was? Joe Zubretsky : We haven\u2019t quantified that. We if you recall last year, I understand your question now, last year we disclosed an amount that was very significant. I mean at the time that represented almost 25% of our earnings forecast for the year. So, we disclosed that these, we thought it was relevant. This year, the number was immaterial to the quarter to the six months and certainly to the full year forecast. So, we have not spiked it out and probably will not. Sarah James : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Stephen Tanal of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Stephen Tanal : Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. You guys have covered a lot of ground. So maybe just a couple of numbers questions here. Just on the prior period development, so you guys framed a $20 million to $28 million pre-tax in the quarter. I just want to confirm whether that\u2019s net of offsetting reserve builds and what the comparable number was last year, just to understand sort of the year-on-year swing in MCR, if any? Tom Tran : Yes, Stephen, it\u2019s Tom. $28 million is primarily prior year development there for the quarters. And if you look at the six months this year, as Joe commented in his prepared remarks, it is pretty consistent with prior year in the same ballpark number essentially. And for the year-to-date numbers, it\u2019s approximately in the zone of about $90 million in total, pre-tax. Stephen Tanal : Okay. Got it. And that\u2019s sort of the way you guys are defining that as net of reserve builds, correct? Is it the right way to think about that? Tom Tran : Yes, we are consistent in our approach to reserve and that\u2019s very, very fair comment. Stephen Tanal : Perfect, thanks. And maybe just one more follow-up, just sort of on the Medicaid redetermination story, it sounds like the states are actually playing ball, which is great to hear. But I just wanted to clarify, are you guys actually seeing sort of off-cycle rate increases, where those issues are playing out or are you typically having to wait for the next renewal cycle? Joe Zubretsky : Typically, you are waiting for the next renewal cycle and agreeing to a prospective adjustment, every once in a while, you might be able to argue for some retrospective rate relief, but generally speaking, it will wait for if there is a mid-year true up, it will wait for that process, and if you have to wait for the following year, usually that\u2019s the way it happens. But every once in a while, you can approach a customer for a mid-year correction, if in fact there is a dramatic shift in acuity or benefits. Stephen Tanal : Got it. It\u2019s very helpful. Maybe just last one for me. Just on the MA sort of D-SNP business with particularly strong in MCR. I\u2019m wondering, if you could give us maybe some specific commentary on what\u2019s working particularly well in that business and then I\u2019ll go. Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : It\u2019s really just the fundamentals. We continue to manage high acuity populations really, really well. The membership is very stable and we continue to get a lot better at-risk adjustment and making sure that our, the scores that we\u2019re achieving are commensurate with the acuity of the population and that continues to give us some lift. So, we\u2019re just really operating really well in the fundamentals of the business and with our renewed interest in growth and filing 150 new counties next year and increasing our penetration in the 65 existing counties, we\u2019re really bullish on our prospects in the D-SNP line of business. Stephen Tanal : Awesome. Great to hear. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Matt Borsch of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Matt Borsch : Yes. I know you\u2019ve touched on this. I was just hoping you could talk on the drop sequential drop in days claims payable relative to the favorable reserve development that you saw. And, just to put it in context, I recognize the track record that you\u2019ve developed for conservative and favorable reserve development speaks to the integrity of your reserving process. But I just want to get a little bit more comfort on this stat, the reserves were replenished going forward given the drop-in days claims payable. Joe Zubretsky : Sure, Matt. I\u2019ll kick that question to Tom. Tom Tran : Yes, Matt, you\u2019re right. We are very consistent in terms of our reserving methodology. So, regarding the quarter end June \u201819, you see a drop of four days. And you look back last year, June 2018, if you compare that to March of 2019 is a similar kind of drop of roughly about four days. June is typically low utilization months and usually set your reserve based on that. And most of your reserve balance at the end of the quarter consists of the current-month. So that\u2019s really the phenomenal of seasonality that I mentioned. Matt Borsch : Got it. Okay, that\u2019s great. Thank you, Tom. Tom Tran : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Great. The next question is from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes. Hi, good morning. Just a couple of follow-up questions here. First of all, on Ohio, because you keep coming back to Ohio as an example of a state where rates have been readjusted. So, the second quarter margins for the state reflect, kind of like the steady state margins or should we see margin expansion into 2020 as a result of this rate adjustment. That\u2019s the first question. And then the second question, Centene on their call, talked about the ongoing process of divestiture and the discussions, so just any thoughts on that and any specific regions that you\u2019d be interested in. Joe Zubretsky : With respect to the profitability of Ohio, I would say that the rate adjustment that we\u2019re getting is keeping pace with the new acuity and trend of the population. So, we\u2019re not projecting any significant change in the margin picture that we\u2019re presenting today. That rate was necessary to keep pace with medical cost inflation, so no change in the trajectory of the state of Ohio profitability. The rate increase that we were able to get helps us keep pace with the rate of inflation. And on the last question, we just make it a practice, never to comment on any specific M&A opportunity, but to repeat what I said in our prepared remarks. We had $1.8 billion of capacity and the desire to return to significant, positive operating leverage. We are very interested in books of business and membership in our core products and I\u2019ll leave it at that. Ricky Goldwasser : Thank you. Joe Zubretsky : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : The next question is from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. Great, thanks. Just a couple of things, one is, you mentioned that I guess it sounds like the Medicare business is coming in a little bit better than you guys expected so far. I think you\u2019re a little above your target margin there. Did you guys realize that in time for the 2020 bids or is that potentially going to be a source of upside kind of going into next year as well. Joe Zubretsky : This profit picture was emerging as we were filing our bids for 2020. So that was taken fully into consideration, Kevin. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. So I think you said something on the lines of that, when you have favorable development that people might not quite appreciate how that maybe sets you up for additional upside kind of later in the year, it\u2019s maybe just final more color then it\u2019s kind of what you\u2019re trying to domestic there. Joe Zubretsky : Well, really, what I\u2019m saying is that I think often times favorable and unfavorable development is just seen as sort of some actuarial phenomenon, when it really is performance-related, the actuaries have to use an experience period, where they\u2019re looking at your medical cost trends and including those trends and reserving. And if you continue to outperform those assumptions by payment integrity routines, effective utilization management, your reserves are likely to run off redundantly and your medical cost baseline and trend used for the current year dates of service are likely conservatively stated, stated another way when you\u2019re managing into declining trend, it can\u2019t help, but be very positively from a financial point of view. And that\u2019s really what we\u2019re trying to message there that favorable development and a very attractive margin position that we\u2019ve created for ourselves really is the product of very, very effective cost management across the board. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And then maybe just last question, you guys have a lot of things going on from a cost perspective. You get the pharmacy agreement earlier, you talked about the integrity and risk adjustment, can you talk about what else is still kind of to come here over the next 12 months? Joe Zubretsky : It really is more or less extensions of all the things you mentioned. We\u2019re not done implementing all of our payment integrity routines. We have full run rate of our pharmacy, new pharmacy contract in our earnings, our IT outsourcing is now in the expense run rate. So, I would just say that more or less extensions of many of the initiatives we talked about before and that we showed you continue to show you at Investor Day. But no big other initiatives, other than the ones we\u2019ve already mentioned, but more or less extensions of ones we\u2019ve already begun to implement. Kevin Fischbeck : Alright, great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Charles Rhyee of Cowen. Please go ahead. Charles Rhyee : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Joe, you talked earlier about trying to make sure you\u2019re keeping members on the rules, if they are eligible. For members that are no longer eligible, are you able to focus on them to get them into sort of an eligible exchange into the marketplace? And how is the stuff like been if that\u2019s, if you\u2019re able to? Joe Zubretsky : There are subject the state rules are all different across these lines in terms of whether you can approach members for other products whether they can be one transfers, etc. And we obviously comply with those state rules and do the best we can to keep the Molina product, but it\u2019s hard to answer that generally, all the state rules are different in terms of what you can and can\u2019t do. I will tell you that when it comes to the member and it comes to the network, it\u2019s critically important, and that\u2019s why we love our product suite. Medicaid, Medicaid expansion and Marketplace as members move up and down, the scale of their incomes relative to the Federal Poverty Levels and they love their primary care physician and they like their network and love the Molina brand and how they cared for it. When they have a choice, they will stay with the Molina product. So, whether we can transfer them or not, many of these decisions are made by the provider and the member jointly and if they have a positive Molina experience, they will stay with the Molina product. Charles Rhyee : That\u2019s helpful. And then, and you earlier also talked about re-determinations. I think one of your peers talked about there relative to the states that they\u2019re in, there maybe halfway through or a little bit more opportunities kind of going through this process. Can you talk about relative to your footprint, where the states are in terms of going through the cycle of sort of re-determinations? Joe Zubretsky : I mean, there are always going through it, but we\u2019ve seen, I would say in the last 12 to 18 months, most of the pressure we saw in our book of business occurred in both Michigan and Ohio. And I would say that is largely leveled out. And the fact that the re-determination leakage has leveled and then the Washington, Mississippi and South Carolina and Illinois membership has grown. Net-net we\u2019re back into, we\u2019re going to be back into positive territory on a sequential basis. When it comes to Medicaid member months. So, re-determination leveling, our growth initiatives started to take hold. I think we\u2019ll be back into solid positive territory from a volume perspective real soon. Charles Rhyee : That\u2019s great. Thanks. And lastly from me, I think you mentioned a little bit about Texas, at the very start here, in terms of just timing if I\u2019m not mistaken, right, Texas has kind of delayed decisions before had to I think, we bit again once. Any kind of additional color you can give like as to what\u2019s going on, maybe in Texas, in general why, things are taking so long here? Joe Zubretsky : No, I really can\u2019t. We\u2019re just we\u2019re just subject to the whatever decision-making process that they have decided to take, the last we heard it\u2019s going to be the end of August. We also believe that they\u2019ll likely announce the STAR PLUS and the STAR CHIP awards concurrently. But we\u2019re in wait and see mode. We remain confident, but we know nothing more than you know based on what you\u2019ve read and heard. Charles Rhyee : Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Joe Zubretsky : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : Hi, great, thanks. Good morning, Joe and Tom, thanks for taking the question. So, actually two questions just on the marketplace quickly. One just a follow-up on the marketplace risk adjustment true up in 2Q \u201819 and while you\u2019re not disclosing the number are you able to clarify whether the true-up was contemplated in the guidance for 2019. And then number 2, the marketplace MLR of 64.7% in the quarter, while it was up versus roughly 54% in 2Q, last year. Is still a pretty phenomenal number in the grand scheme of things, especially if it did not include any material benefit from any sort of risk adjustment true up you mentioned it could trend higher from here, which makes sense, but I guess, the question I\u2019m just looking for a little more color on how this 2Q marketplace MLR stacked up versus your own expectations, just for the quarter specifically. Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : I\u2019ll let Tom add some more color to this. But I think two perspectives Steven are important. One is that we true up our accruals in our risk adjustment every quarter. So, I think you can assume that not all of that was actually adjusted in the second quarter. Some of it was adjusted in the first. It wasn\u2019t material to the quarter and I think the phenomenon you are looking year-over-year in terms of loss ratios, obviously, last year was benefited hugely, by that number. On a going forward basis, you\u2019ve got to captured correctly, at 67.4% year-to-date, 69% projected we\u2019re right where we want to be, it\u2019s a very profitable book of business. It will produce over $220 million of pre-tax profits for the year and gives us a very solid baseline off of which to grow. But we are just getting better and better risk adjustment and we keep outperforming the assumptions that the accounts and actuaries use to account for the risk adjustment and that bodes well for the continued profitability of the business. Tom Tran : Yes. I will add a little bit more color to the question you asked about last year, marketplace MCR at 57%. And last year quarter\u2019s benefit tremendously by the marketplace risk adjustment and if you kind of normalize for that, then the MCR would have been around 67% and we are very comparable to what you see this year. Steven Valiquette : Yes, that\u2019s helpful. I quote it this is excellent, that was not that quarterly, so thanks for credit in that to you and thanks for the extra color. Joe Zubretsky : Okay. Steven thanks. Operator : Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, our final question is from Gary Taylor of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Gary Taylor : Hi, good morning. Just a couple of quick ones. I appreciate all the comments today. Just trying to understand and I have certainly heard the comments about the re-determinations and so forth, but as I just look at and I understand this portfolio business that\u2019s part of the answer. But when you look at TANF, in the first quarter, MLR was down 500, this quarter, up 120 and then expansion, the complete opposite first quarter MLR was up about 420 and then down 350. So on both quarters the trend that\u2019s sort of offset each other. So, when we look at just how that\u2019s progressed year-to-date, are we to think that there has been more rate adjustment in the expansion population or is that just much better operational performance in that population? Tom Tran : If you were to look at parsing the different components of the Medicaid business, I would look at the 6 months versus 6 months, this year versus last year. If you look at that, our TANF and CHIP over a year-over-year comparison for the 6 month last year is actually improved by almost 100 and almost 200 bps. So and on Medicaid expansion, it\u2019s fairly stable. And so we have had some rate efficacy in Ohio that came through in the quarter, so really help really bring the overall loss ratio for expansion business back to a more normal zone if you will. So on balance, the portfolio is really doing well. Gary Taylor : Year-to-date I totally get it, just a little more quarterly fluctuations, I guess, maybe have anticipated, so just trying to think about that better. My last one would just be and maybe I missed this earlier we are talking about one state and I missed it, but just Illinois. So it was a good quarter, so I am going to pick on one where it looked like the MLR was up to just try to understand anything specific around Illinois for 2Q? Joe Zubretsky : No, Illinois is doing really well. It will be a $1 billion business shortly and the margin recovery of last 2 years has been significant. In the quarter, if memory serves me correctly, there was a provider settlement that hit the quarter. One-off effect, Illinois is doing great. It\u2019s got mid-single digit margins. It will have $1 billion of revenue soon and the prospects for growth there is very strong. Gary Taylor : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for attending the presentation and you may now disconnect your lines.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Trudell, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Julie Trudell : Good morning and thank you for joining Molina Healthcare\u2019s third quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today are Molina\u2019s President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky and our CFO, Tom Tran. The press release announcing our third quarter earnings was distributed yesterday after the market closed and the release is now posted for viewing on our Investor Relations website. A replay of this call will be available shortly after the conclusion of the call through November 6. The numbers to access this replay are in the earnings release. For those who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that the remarks made herein as of today, Wednesday, October 30, 2019 and we have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. In this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our third quarter press release. During our call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including statements about our growth prospects, our 2019 guidance, and our long-term outlook. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that can cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to view our risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K Annual Report for 2018 filed with the SEC as well as the risk factors listed in our other reports and filings with the SEC. After the completed prepared remarks today, we will open-up the call to take your questions. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe? Joe Zubretsky : Thank you, Julie and thank you all for joining us this morning. Late yesterday afternoon, after we issued our press release for the quarter, we learned the outcome of the Texas STAR+ RFP award. Before we discuss our quarterly results, we will first provide you with the information we have at this time. We were awarded contracts in two regions : our existing Hidalgo region, and one new region, the Northeast region. Given the real time nature of this information, a full analysis of the membership and revenue impact that is likely to occur at late 2020 is currently underway and will be completed shortly. We are naturally very disappointed in this initial outcome and are currently seeking more information from HHSC with respect to the awards. We will then decide on the course of action and exploring all of our options relating to the decision. Now let's turn to discussion to our third quarter results. Last night we reported earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of $2.75. We reported pre-tax earnings of $233 million and after-tax earnings of $175 million, resulting in pre-tax and after-tax margins of 5.5% and 4.1%, respectively. Based on our third quarter and year-to-date performance, we are raising our full-year earnings per diluted share guidance to a new range of $11.30 to $11.55 for the full-year. I will now provide some detail on our performance through the first nine months of the year. Premium revenue was $12.1 billion and in line with expectations as our membership remains relatively stable, our rates remain sound and our retention of at-risk premium continues to improve. Our medical care ratio was 85.7%. Despite some cost pressures in select markets, this MCR level demonstrates our continued ability to manage medical cost effectively, improve our claim payment practices and execute other profit improvement initiatives. The G&A ratio was 7.6% also in line with expectations as we efficiently managed our resources to provide excellent service to our members and providers. We continue to harvest dividends from our operating subsidiaries, resulting in nearly $800 million of excess capital at the parent company after paying down debt. We have a very strong balance sheet and a simplified and efficient capital structure. We have attained a fairly attractive earnings profile. Our medical care ratio for the first nine months of the year remains on track at 85.7% as the portfolio performed slightly better than expected. Total company after-tax margins of 1.5% are supported by 3% in Medicaid, 7% in Medicare and 12% in marketplace. We\u2019ve produced average quarterly earnings per share of over $2.90 with minor seasonal fluctuations. We\u2019ve approximately $800 million of free cash, which when combined with undrawn debt, creates a $1.7 billion investment capacity. And for the full-year, we are on track to report EBITDA of approximately $1.2 billion or a 7% EBITDA margin. I would like to provide some comments with respect to our 2020 outlook. At our Investor Day, we forecasted inorganic premium revenue growth rate of 79% for 2020, which now may change with the news on Texas. However, many of the elements related to that growth rate are still intact. Medicaid growth in 2020 will reflect the annualized impact of the RFP awards that we implemented this year, along with some expected Medicaid expansion. In Medicare, we expect growth in our D-SNP product from the expansion of our existing footprint and entry into two new states, South Carolina and Ohio. In marketplace, our analysis suggests that both our rates and broker compensation structure are highly competitive. Taken together, these factors give us confidence in our ability to grow membership. Inorganic growth prospects, we will continue to be an important dimension of our long-term growth strategy, because of the positive operating leverage resulting from membership growth and the synergies derived from our proven turnaround skills. Two weeks ago, we announced that we signed a definitive agreement to acquire YourCare Health Plan, a not-for-profit plan in Upstate New York. YourCare services 46,000 Medicaid members in seven counties in Western New York, contiguous to our Syracuse-based Upstate plan. This transaction, which we expect to close in early 2020 is indicative of the type of bolt-on tuck-in acquisitions that we discussed at Investor Day. Turning now to our updated full-year 2019 earnings guidance. Our year-to-date performance gives us confidence in raising full-year earnings per share guidance to a range of $11.30 to $11.55. This earnings per share guidance implies an after-tax margin of 4.3% to 4.4%, supported by after-tax margins of approximately 3% for Medicaid, 7% for Medicare and 11% for marketplace. Before turning the call over to Tom, I would like to say another word about the Texas news. If, in fact, this development does create a future revenue shortfall. Bear in mind that this team has demonstrated the ability to overcome many challenges. The team has grown margins to industry-leading levels even in the face of a significant revenue decline in 2019. We are committed to meeting the challenge again and we will continue to pursue the revenue opportunities that lie ahead. Now, I will turn the call over to Tom Tran for more detail on the financials. Tom? A - Tom Tran : Thank you, Joe, and good morning. We report third quarter's earnings per diluted share of $2.75 supported by net income of $175 million and an after-tax margin of 4.1% with premium revenue up $4.1 billion. Let me provide some additional detail on the quarter. My commentary will be focused on a sequential comparison. The consolidated MCR for the third quarter of 2019 was 86.3% compared to 85.6% in the second quarter of 2019, primarily due to the seasonality of the marketplace MCR. Prior period reserve development in the quarter was negligible. The G&A ratio of our third quarter of 2019 improved by 20 basis points to 7.6% compared to 7.8% in the second quarter of 2019. The improvement in the G&A ratio was mainly due to the sequential increase in revenue. Interest expense were flat at $22 million compared to the second quarter of 2019. Let me provide some additional commentary on our performance in the third quarter by line of business. In the Medicaid business, our MCR for the quarter were sequentially flat and approximately 88%, producing an after-tax margin of 3.4%. This result were in line with our expectations. We continue to produce our targeted margins in Medicaid, while experiencing isolated medical cost pressures in certain markets, primarily due to acuity mix shift, benefit carve-ins and some loss claim activity. We fully expect that these cost pressures will continue to be managed and will ultimately end up in our premium raise. Our Medicare business comprising of our D-SNP and MMP products for the quarter continued to perform well and was in line with our expectation. The MCR for the quarter of 85.6% was fairly stable compared to 85.2% in the second quarter of 2019, producing an after-tax margin of 6.4%. More specifically on Medicare, we continue to demonstrate excellence in managing high acuity members by providing access to high-quality healthcare at a recent -- reasonable cost. This includes our market leading management of long-term service and supports benefits, which are embedded in our MMP product. We continue to see the result of our quality and risk adjustment efforts, as our Medicare risk scores are becoming more commensurate with the acuity of this population and risk adjustment revenue has increased. And our attractive Medicare margin profile allow us to reinvest in additional benefits, which should help us maintain our product competitiveness as we position this business to growth in 2020 and beyond. Finally, our marketplace business continues to perform well and is generally in line with our seasonal expectation as we report in MCR for the quarter of 71.2% compared to 67.2% in the second quarter of 2019. As a reminder, the margin profile of the marketplace business allow us to ease up on raise filed for 2020, increase value-added benefits and offer more competitive commissions, so we can grow membership next year at a lower, more sustainable, but still attractive margin. Turning to our balance sheet, cash flow and cash position for the quarter. Our reserve approach is consistent with prior quarters and our reserve position remains strong. Days and claim payable represent 50 days of medical cost expense compared to 48 days in the second quarter of 2019 and 53 days in the third quarter of 2018. The sequential increase in days and claim payable is primarily due to seasonal factors. As of September 30, 2019, our health plans have total statutory capital and surplus of approximately $1.8 billion, which equates to approximately 335% of risk-based capital. We reduced the outstanding balance of the convertible notes by $55 million during the quarter and $240 million since the beginning of the year, and only $12 million of the convertible notes remain outstanding and will be redeemed in early 2020. Capital deployment actions have result in lower interest expense, gain on repayment of the convertible notes and a lower share count on a fully diluted basis in the quarter, which decreased by 6% to 63.6 million share when compared to the same period in 2018. Operating cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 amount to $398 million and is higher year-over-year primarily due to the timing of government payments. Shifting to our outlook. We raised our full year 2019 earnings guidance to a range of $11.30 to $11.55 per share from a range of $11.20 to $11.50. This implies a fourth quarter range of $2.50 to $2.75. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Scott Fidel of Stephens. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. First question, just if you can maybe expand a little bit on the commentary on seeing some cost pressures in certain markets in the Medicaid book. Maybe just sort of discuss how many markets and geographies, products you\u2019re seeing that? And then sort of what type of rate traction you\u2019re seeing around some of those issues right now? Joe Zubretsky : Sure, Scott. I would say the cost pressures that we're experiencing in those markets come across three dimensions. One, we did see in the quarter some aberrant and anomalous large case activity, which will abate. Second, we've seen an acuity mix shift due to some redetermination efforts, particularly in the State of Ohio. And those are primarily the reasons for the cost pressures. We believe that ultimately acuity mix shift ends up in rates. And in fact, the State of Ohio has been very reasonable and rational in rate discussions. And we believe that normal operating protocol such as utilization control, care management and looking at our network contracts harder will arrest some of the large claim activity. So there were pressures in various markets. Some of the behavioral carve-ins actually cause some rate pressure. You are never sure you're getting the right capitated rate when a benefit gets carved in. So we certainly saw some behavioral cost pressure in Washington, that will end up in rates. So acuity mix shift benefit carve-ins in some large claim activity. But all very manageable as evidenced by a very flat sequential Medicaid managed care ratio of 88%. Scott Fidel : Got it. And a follow-up question just -- I guess sort of related maybe not just around the trends on the reserve development side. And I know you mentioned, you sort of had negligible reserve development in the quarter. I know you guys have had some pretty hefty development sort of trending over the last, let's call, 4 to 6 quarters. So, maybe sort of just update us on sort of the reserves and how you feel the adequacy is at this point? Did the reserve development get impacted by some of these issues in Medicaid or are there other factors to consider as well just around reserve development trends? Joe Zubretsky : Take it to Tom in a moment, but I -- the reserve practices that we\u2019ve -- that we undertake have remained consistent. I would say in the third and fourth quarter, your prior year reserve development should abate. Last year I thought was an exception. We had some reserve development in the fourth quarter of the prior year. I think that was an unusual phenomenon. So the fact that reserve development is over a $100 million for the year on a pre-tax basis, and has abated here in the third and fourth quarter is not unusual. Tom, anything to add? Tom Tran : No, nothing more to add to that, Joe. Our reserve practice remain very consistent. We feel that our reserve balance is very strong. You can see DCP have gone up two days. And none of these issue on the cost pressure you see there, M&A into any particular issue for our reserve balance at all. Scott Fidel : Okay. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Peter Costa of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Peter Costa : Good morning. Question about Texas. Your loss ratio in Texas is higher than some of your other loss ratios when I look at the government programs loss ratio. Is -- but it's hard to tell given the mix of higher acuity business, which you might have in Texas, well, that\u2019s more profitable or less profitable than average? I guess another question is, is the contracts which you stand to lose more, more profitable or less profitable than your average profitability? And then the second question just what was that gave you the confidence at the Investor Day that the 7% to 9% organic growth rate would be there if you sort of weren't sure about the Texas result at that point in time? Joe Zubretsky : Let me answer the second question, first. To be clear, at Investor Day, we said that the 7% to 9% revenue forecast for 2020 assumed status quo in Texas. So it didn't assume any increment or decrement due to a gain or loss. We are very clear on that point. So now as I said in our prepared remarks, as we do our forecast for 2020, if this award sticks and it incepts in -- on September 1, we would therefore adjust the 7% to 9% to allow for that 4-month revenue shortfall in Texas. Tom, you want to answer the question about profitability? Tom Tran : Sure. We obviously do not petition out profitability by specific market and even down by line of business of market, but I will provide a following general comment. The acuity of the population in Texas is generally higher because of the significant portion of ABD and MMP population in the state. So almost by nature it's much higher revenue PMPM, if you will. So with that generally we run the tax that you saw we disclosed that at a 91% MCR in the press release. However, the business is profitable. Overall, our Medicaid business as you know hovering around 3% plus or minus on an after-tax. So in some state it may be less, some state may be more than that midpoint. So -- but the business there is profitable abate the fact that it may be slightly less than the midpoint, because of high acuity of the nature of the population. Peter Costa : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Raskin of Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Josh Raskin : Hi. Thanks. Just want to follow-up on a comment that you made, Joe, with the first question around Texas. I think you said that you will explore all your options. Now I want to make sure is that just with regarding protests and Texas specifically, or is that a broader Molina Healthcare commentary around as you kind of rethink about the long-term? Joe Zubretsky : That was meant to refer to exploring our options in Texas. There is a -- there is business days to file a protest. That\u2019s usually routine in these types of matters. But I was referring to exploring all of our options to review the scoring on the Texas awards. And then to the right set we have to pursue an additional award, we would pursue vigorously. Josh Raskin : Okay. Which I guess leads to my second question, which is you talk last quarter around long-term targets of 10% to 12% revenue growth still being consistent with your views long-term, understanding the 2020 won't be in that range and EPS targets of 12% to 15%. And I know you don't have the scoring, so you don't know exactly what happened in Texas specifically, but is there anything that\u2019s occurred sort of with the Texas, where you guys will have to take a step back, rethink long-term targets, rethink Molina's long-term strategy, or anything else in terms of just overall views for the company? Joe Zubretsky : Our manage Medicaid duals high acuity. We do this really well. We're disappointed in Texas award and we will look at the scoring and as I said, we will pursue our rights. But nothing changes in our long-term outlook for the attractiveness of the business we're in, or the target margins that we\u2019ve outlined for you. There is an inherent growth rate in this business that is very attractive as well. It produces significant excess cash flow and although we are disappointed in this award, we will reset our 2020 numbers and we will grow off of those and profitably. Josh Raskin : Okay, perfect. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. Just one follow-up with a couple of questions on Texas. First, in terms of the -- you\u2019ve got a pretty big exchange footprint there, Joe, I would assume the good news is, it looks like your STAR footprint is pretty similar to your STAR+ footprint. So is it fair to say that even if you were to lose the regions that in the announcement in STAR+, you would still have an upscale to run a successful exchange strategy there, so that you wouldn\u2019t need to exit the exchanges in Texas in any material way? Joe Zubretsky : Okay. We have a lot of our exchange membership is in Dallas and Houston. We've proven in New Mexico that you can run a really profitable exchange business without being in Medicaid. And as you suggested, we still have the STAR CHIP contract and we think we have enough network growth and scale to participate in the marketplace business going forward. And the Texas marketplace business has been profitable and an attractive growth opportunity for us. Josh Raskin : Right. And then in terms of the losses, I mean I know you\u2019re going through the numbers. I\u2019ve come up with something estimating close to just under a $1 billion of revenue that this low premium that this looks like. Again, no need to comment on that, because I know you\u2019ve talked about Texas in terms of the potential for deleveraging on the SG&A side, if this were to go against you. And I\u2019ve just wanted to kind of follow-up on that in terms of, if that number is in the right ballpark or you do lose a $1 billion of revenue, you think you could offset that SG&A and still hit your targets, or do you think that would also be a reset above and beyond just the margin contribution that -- that\u2019s a risk here? Joe Zubretsky : Various scenarios on what this might mean for revenue. But I would say the number that you articulated is certainly in the neighborhood of what could happen if we kept everything we have in Hidalgo and the Northeast gets split, let's say, evenly between two players. Those numbers are in the right neighborhood. But stranded overhead is certainly a phenomenon in this business. So just the fixed cost nature of the business, but we don't tolerate stranded overhead here and we\u2019ve proven that in 2019. If you recall, in 2018 with the Florida and New Mexico losses, we said we had stranded overhead that we had to get at. And I think when you look at North of 4% margins across the board in this business, we've proven that we don't allow stranded overhead. We will get up the fixed cost when the revenue disappears and we will restore ourselves to our target margins. Josh Raskin : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. I wanted to ask about the exchanges. You\u2019ve had -- as a couple of competitors talk about their bid strategy and their expectation for margins for next year kind of coming down and at least one of them specifically saying that their view about the minimum MLR really was a main reason why they were doing that, but they\u2019re operating at much lower margins in the near operating. I just wanted to -- just kind of recheck with you and make to see what your thoughts were about -- whether that at all is a barrier to growth either next year or in the next couple of years in certain markets? Just trying to understand why you\u2019re upping it into a higher margin and not seeing the same potential kept to growth? Joe Zubretsky : Well, the first thing I would say, Kevin, is it's obvious that '18 and '19 have been very profitable years for us in the marketplace and '17 was quite the opposite. So when '17 roles off to 3-year average in '20, that will certainly put certain markets up against the minimum MLR. The other thing I would say is it depends on how your portfolio performs. Averages can be misleading. It really depends on how your individual properties are performing. We have some that are performing really well and others less well. And so we will bump into the minimum MLR probably in a few markets. But we certainly consider that when we filed our prices for 2020. We certainly consider that when we were loading in additional value-added benefits to put value into the product then paying rebates, and we took all that into consideration as we filed our rates for 2020. And our preliminary analysis now that everybody's rates are public is that you have very competitive positions number one and number two, in about 75% of our key markets and our flagship silver product and our bronze product which is the products that we want to be competitive. So we are still feeling really good about our growth prospects in marketplace for 2020. As a reminder, we said we are going to grow the business albeit at a lower [technical difficulty] and still attractive margin. Kevin Fischbeck : And you said a couple of times on the call today that your broker compensation is also, I guess, strong. Is that a change this year that you do something differently or are you paying more now in 2020 or for 2020 than you have in the past or is this just a comment that you\u2019ve consistently been doing this? Joe Zubretsky : Okay. We are paying market now. We are paying more, we are paying market. We weren't competitive on our broker commissions in a few markets last year and we\u2019ve corrected that. So although we are paying more, we are not paying above market. We are now paying market. Kevin Fischbeck : Is there anything that you think is kind of draw or share with us about that dynamic like in those markets where you\u2019re paying below? Any view about what that means to go from below market to being in-market? Joe Zubretsky : Well, I think as you know about 50% of the business comes through .gov and the other 50% comes through brokers. And broker want to be paid market commission, so we believe we will have good broker loyalty, we have a strong network. And now that we're paying market commissions, it should enhance the growth rate. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Stephen Tanal of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Stephen Tanal : Good morning, guys. I appreciate all the color, especially this early on the Texas RFP. And I guess, just wanted to follow-up on kind of the comments of stranded overhead. Joe, that was helpful, but I guess is it sort of fair to expect the earnings impact will be closer to the direct loss of what you're getting today as opposed to something larger than like the state makes available sort of financials for all the companies. And I guess the direct impact somewhere in the ballpark like 5% of EPS for looking at all that right using margins in the last reported fiscal year. So is that what you\u2019ve managed to kind of just losing the direct impact, or should we actually think, well, even if you cut some stranded overhead, the impact could be greater for whatever reason? Joe Zubretsky : I think I understand your question, but as I stated previously, certainly the margin, the fully baked margin on the product -- on the revenue that\u2019s lost will disappear. And as I mentioned before, there will be fixed cost that will then become stranded, but we don't allow that to happen. And we\u2019ve demonstrated that in 2019 we gave you at Investor Day initial estimates of maybe $40 million to $50 million of stranded overhead due to the New Mexico and Florida losses. And if you just look at our G&A ratios today, look at our margins today, I mean all becomes fungible at some point. But we\u2019ve managed our G&A ratio was really, really well through this dynamic and we would be disciplined enough to do that yet again in late 2020 when this revenue phenomenon hits. Stephen Tanal : Perfect. Thanks. And then maybe one for Tom. Just in terms of the guidance revision, two questions on it. One, could you kind of confirm sort of the level of peer performance EPS that\u2019s implied there? And the other was more mechanical just the guidance hike on investment and other income. Any reason to think that's not sort of a 100% flow-through to earnings? Tom Tran : In terms of the peer performance guidance, I think what you're referring to is there any sort of restructuring costs, or any kind of gain/loss on convertible, if that's what you\u2019re referring to. And our EPS that we provided is all in. All of those item are in, okay? So in other words, we have roughly about a $0.12 of year-to-date net gain from the redemption of the convertible. So that said, that\u2019s in the $11.32 to $11.55. Stephen Tanal : Okay, great. And then -- sorry, the investment and other income piece? Tom Tran : Investment income, yes. I mean it certainly -- we have provided guidance with high investment and other income. That\u2019s a combined two items there. And that's -- we\u2019ve seen a little bit higher investment income in the third quarter. So that's why we up the guidance for the full-year. Stephen Tanal : And does that flow-through a 100%? That was sort of just I really wanted to understand, or should we be assuming that may be with the other income part of that, the flow-through to earnings is not 100%. Tom Tran : The EPS, 100%, yes. Stephen Tanal : Okay. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from Charles Rhyee of Cowen. Please go ahead. Cal Sternick : Yes. Hi, Good morning. This is a Cal Sternick on for Charles. Just recognizing that you guys are fresh off of the Texas announcement and still working through your strategy, how are you thinking about your appetite for M&A going forward just in the context of the YourCare acquisition and maybe some of the additional capital you will have from pulling out of the Texas subs? And then just more generally on M&A strategy. As we think of M&A activity is being biased or is [technical difficulty] business like Medicaid or Medicare? Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : Sure. First and foremost, the best use of our excess capital is to fund organic growth. We hold about 10% of premium as regulatory capital. And the levered and unlevered returns on equity are superb. Second, we have a very, very capable M&A team. We are going to remain very disciplined. We will look for opportunities in our existing markets and in greenfield markets in our core products, particularly Medicaid, high acuity and duals and probably not traditional Medicare advantage. So we're going to stay very disciplined to our core product line. We really do seek out underperforming businesses because of our proven turnaround skills. We can harvest those performance-based synergies for our earnings stream and that\u2019s a very, very attractive use of our human resource capital. So we are going to remain very disciplined. We still think there is opportunities out there. There's orphaned plans, there is provider owned plans, there is 501c3. And we are scouring the Universe for attractive opportunities to deploy our capital to accrete earnings-per-share. Cal Sternick : Great. And I appreciate the commentary on the marketplace growth rates, recognizing that we are still early in the enrollment period for Medicare, I'm just wondering if you could talk about any visibility for growth there next year? Joe Zubretsky : Sorry, on Medicare? Cal Sternick : Yes. Joe Zubretsky : If the question is on Medicare, as you know our Medicare is primarily centered around the D-SNP product and we have expanded footprint. We have spent -- entered into two new markets. So we expect to have membership growth in 2020. We do have some visibility against our competition now and we feel that the product will grow in 2020. Cal Sternick : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So in Texas I know you don't have the scoring yet, but breaking down the awards by region, if we look at the fact that you lost in Dallas, Harris, El Paso, Bexar, Jefferson, but then you actually won brand-new business in the larger MRSA Northeast region. I guess I am just curious is there any -- really anything high-level that jumps out to you and what may have driven the new regional win, that was different mechanically than the factors that maybe in your mind, may have drove the losses in the other regions. So -- and tied into that, is there any silver lining worth pointing out with that one new that might help you in the other protest process as well? I know it's kind of preliminary and high, well, you don\u2019t underscoring, but just curious any jumps out there? Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : The answer is no, not at this stage. Obviously, the news is 12 hours old. Underscoring as you suggested has not been made available. But those are very legitimate questions and questions we will be asking, what did we learn about the scoring in the regions we lost? And what -- why were we successful in a branded region for us? So, no, we don't have any information at this time. But we will be seeking answers to those questions and then pursuing our rights that we have under our contract. Steven Valiquette : Okay. All right. I maybe follow-up offline [indiscernible] more detail later. Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : Sure. You\u2019re welcome. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew Borsch of BMO Capital. Please go ahead. Matthew Borsch : Yes. I\u2019m just curious about the episodes of MCR pressure in the Medicaid business. Is that something that -- and I think you had made some allusions to rate lag in the last call, but it wasn't particularly a factor. What\u2019s been the timing of this emerging and relative to how the impact is played out, is that something that was sort of accelerating into the back part of the third quarter, or how would you characterize it? Joe Zubretsky : I would characterize it as somewhat accelerating throughout the year. And I want to be very clear, when benefits get carved into a program, you do your best to understand the capitated rate you\u2019re getting for that benefit. And sometimes it's right and sometimes it is not sufficient. So we\u2019ve seen that in Washington with respect to the behavioral carve-in, we\u2019ve seen it in Ohio with respect to the carve-in and the behavioral benefit that took place over a year-ago, and the acuity mix shift that has occurred and their redetermination efforts. So rates always do lag trend, but the good news is that our customers have been very rational and reasonable in understanding these cost pressures, and they have been included in recent rate discussions. And in fact, we had a midyear rate increase in Ohio to offset some of this pressure. So whether it's large claim activity, which is aberrant, whether it's the acuity mix shift, whether it's a carved in benefit, this is just managed-care dynamics and can be dealt with through operating protocols, utilization controls, network management and the like or in rate advocacy efforts. And the fact that we're still producing high 80s MLRS in the Medicaid business, 88% flat sequentially second and third quarter. I think is testimony to the fact that there is a lot going right in the portfolio even though we are seeing pressure in some isolated places. Matthew Borsch : Joe, if I could just -- if we back up and look at the broader landscape of plans in Medicaid, seeing pressure in multiple markets. Is there any, I\u2019ve realized that the eligibility redetermination is certainly a common factor. But it first feels a little bit like the rate development to sort of turned a little bit stingy coming into this year, and now we're going through what's likely to be some bout of corrections and certainly it's extremely helpful, but you\u2019ve reasonable business partners in most cases. But is that a mischaracterization? Joe Zubretsky : It's a legitimate question. But I think it may be slightly mischaracterized. The rate discussions have been reasonable, rational. Rates appear to be actuarially sound. And any time you go through, as I said, the phenomenon of a benefit carve-in or a significant shift in acuity, you get these little rate shocks, which then quickly correct. I think the good news on redetermination is something we ought to really focus on. In this business, there's been a lot of discussion over many years as how does the managed Medicaid business respond in economic cycles? We don\u2019t have to model it anymore, we know. And the fact that the Ohio economy is very strong, the fact that expansion members who actually do work and make some money are making more money now and going back to work, that puts pressure on membership roles. It makes an acuity mix shift happen on your existing population, but then it's collectible on rates, that's actually a very positive phenomenon. The fact that the good economy is creating pressure in one state, but then it's correctable through rates quickly is a very positive phenomenon and we no longer have to conjecture and guess how these businesses perform through economic cycles, we know. Matthew Borsch : Right. Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Sarah James of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Sarah James : Thank you. On Friday, Texas HHSC announced that Molina took over as Head of Medicaid Procurement, which is unusual to do just before an award. And in general, there has been a good amount of churn on how is running this procurement for Texas. So, just wondering if there is any color you can share on how churn in this department could have influenced the procurement environment? And if it means that there's actually going to be a different team evaluating the STAR RFP and scoring? Joe Zubretsky : Sarah, it's -- I hesitate to comment on what\u2019s going on in the inner workings of our customer. Certainly, the churn or the turnover phenomenon you suggested is real. Everybody knows it, we know it. But I can't speculate at this point on what impact that might have had in the scoring. When we get the scoring, we are going to do what we normally do. We are going to evaluate it very thoroughly. We will go through lessons learned and what we could have done better, but then we are going to pursue our rights that we have under our contract to if we think we were not scored accurately or favorably, we will pursue our rights. But I can't speculate on what might have happened inside the department that created the scoring that impacted us. Sarah James : Okay. Given where we are now the top line for 2020, is there any additional flexibility that you have in the timing of investment spend or bringing forward any of the outsourcing opportunities time wise, so you can influence the pacing of SG&A improvements to offset some of the top line headwinds? Joe Zubretsky : As we continue to work down the path of developing a 2020 plan, certainly SG&A management is certainly something that's on our radar screen. We are not done yet. We think there's more efficiency in our operation that can be gained, but most of the large scale outsourcing that is going to take place here has already occurred. We did a very large-scale IT outsourcing last year as you know. We outsourced some of our very specialized and esoteric utilization management capabilities. We outsourced our nurse advice line earlier this year. So most of the large-scale outsourcing has been done, but not all of that is in the current run rate and that -- mostly that should be fully in the run rate in 2020, if that was your question. Sarah James : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Dave Windley of Jefferies. Please go ahead. David Styblo : Hi. Good morning. It's Dave Styblo in for Windley. Joe, the team has done really a commendable job of extracting cost from the business I think to the tune of $350 million to $400 million by the end of this year. And you guys have talked about another $350 million to $400 million of savings opportunities in the future. I\u2019m curious, if any of those savings were earmarked for opportunities in Texas that might not now have an opportunity to be addressed because of the shrinking footprint for the RFP outcome? Joe Zubretsky : Hey, it's a fair comment. I mean, without parsing the $300 million to $400 million of opportunity, I guess it would be just fair to say that its evenly spread across our book of business across our products and across our geographies. So, yes, if part of that was earmarked for whether it's G&A savings, payment integrity savings, care management savings, that whatever would have happened on the revenue that we lost will not happen. So I think that\u2019s a fair comment. But we\u2019re not going to start allocating our profit improvement opportunities to individual states and products. But it's a \u2026 David Styblo : Sure. Joe Zubretsky : ... fair comment. It's a fair comment. David Styblo : Okay. And then -- and stepping back, I know you guys have started to talk about the revenue growth opportunities and have done that for a couple of quarters now with across different businesses. I\u2019m curious, are there any RFPs that are larger in scale that I can add chunks of revenue coming up in the next 12 to 24 months that are in your horizon, that you guys have visibility on that, that you\u2019re willing to disclose that you'd be interested in participating in from a bid perspective? Joe Zubretsky : We have a fair number of, what I will call special situations, which at this time are still confidential, that we are working on. As you know, we submitted a response to the Kentucky RFP, that\u2019s in process and we are told that will be announced sometime in the month of November, so imminently, and the other states we showed you at Investor Day, while RFPs had really dropped, Tennessee, Georgia, West Virginia, even Iowa to some extent, we are looking at. We have ground game ongoing in various greenfield states. We are evaluating opportunities. We\u2019ve run every opportunity through a very disciplined set of screens. The regulatory environment, the ability to build the network, strength of the incumbency and the competition, and we will pick our spots. David Styblo : Okay. And then maybe just a last one. I know you commented about some of the turnover within Texas. I'm curious the way that the two RFPs are evaluated for the STAR+ and the CHIP, TANF. What are some of the key differences that you might see there that might not cause kind of a similar outcome to happen in the next RFP award announcement coming up in December? Joe Zubretsky : Well, time nature of this news, it's a very legitimate question and one we are looking at. But I just don't have an answer specifically at this time for you, but obviously, we will be looking at the similarities and differences in the scoring dynamics for the two programs. And we will take that into consideration as we build our confidence level on winning the second award. David Styblo : Okay. Thanks much.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Trudell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Julie Trudell : Good morning, and thank you for joining Molina Healthcare's fourth quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Tom Tran. The press release announcing our fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings was distributed yesterday after the market closed, and the release is now posted for viewing on our Investor Relations website. A replay of this call will be available shortly after the conclusion of this call through February 17. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those who are listening to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that the remarks are made herein as of today, Tuesday, February 11, 2020, and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. In this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most direct comparable GAAP measures can be found in our fourth quarter 2019 press release. During our call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including statements relating to our growth prospects, our 2020 guidance and our long-term outlook. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that can cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review our risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report for 2019 filed with the SEC as well as the risk factors listed in our other reports and filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call and take your questions. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe? Joseph Zubretsky : Thank you, Julie, and good morning. On the call today, I will provide highlights from the fourth quarter and full year 2019, discuss our growth initiatives, review our capital allocation priorities and provide our full year 2020 earnings guidance with detail on each of our three lines of business. Yesterday, we reported earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of $2.67, with net income of $168 million and an after-tax margin of 3.9%. I am pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results. For the full year, we met or exceeded our expectations. Premium revenue was $16.2 billion and in line with our expectations. The medical care ratio was 85.8%, as our cost containment efforts continued to control medical costs while ensuring the highest quality of care for our members. The G&A ratio was 7.7%, as we leveraged our fixed cost base while beginning to invest in growth. We improved our Medicaid and Medicare margins and earned exceptionally high margins in our Marketplace business. The 2019 total company after-tax margin of 4.4% was supported by 3.2% in Medicaid, 6.7% in Medicare and 10.3% in Marketplace. All in, this performance resulted in net income of $737 million and earnings per diluted share of $11.47. In a year when premium revenue decreased by 8% due to legacy contract losses, we were able to deliver 4.4% after-tax margins and earnings per share growth of 8%, a testament to our early-stage focus on margins. During the year, we improved an already-strong balance sheet and capital structure while the business continued to generate significant excess cash flow. In the fourth quarter, we harvested an additional $300 million of dividends from our operating subsidiaries, bringing the total for the year to $1.4 billion. As of December 2019, unrestricted cash at the parent company was $1 billion. In early December 2019, our Board authorized a share repurchase program of up to $500 million. Through February 7, under a 10b5-1 trading plan, we repurchased 1.9 million shares for $257 million. I will now comment on the progress we made in the second half of 2019 on our pivot to growth strategy. During the past few months, we announced two acquisitions : YourCare in Upstate New York and NextLevel Health in Illinois. These acquisitions of financially underperforming health plans have stable membership and revenue, but provide opportunity for margin improvement, operating leverage and membership growth. As a result of the YourCare acquisition, we will serve approximately 46,000 Medicaid members in seven counties in Western New York with annual revenues of approximately $285 million. The purchase price is approximately $40 million. In the NextLevel transaction, we will serve over 50,000 Medicaid and LTSS members in Cook County, Illinois with annual revenue of approximately $270 million. The purchase price is approximately $50 million. We will fund these acquisitions with available cash and both are expected to close in the first half of the year, enhancing our premium revenue growth rate for 2020. In New Mexico, we have been working on a special situation, which is a discrete program building an unmet need. The Navajo Nation in New Mexico has passed legislation to create the first Native American managed care entity and further, the legislation stipulates that the Navajo Nation partner with Molina to operate the plan. Pursuant to that legislation, the business arm of the Navajo Nation will contract with us to develop a fully-capitated health care offering under the umbrella of New Mexico's traditional Medicaid program. The new entity will be designed to improve access and quality of health care for the largest Native American reservation, as there are approximately 75,000 Navajos in New Mexico who are eligible for Medicaid. The program is expected to be operational by 2021. Turning now to an update on our Medicaid RFPs. In Kentucky, we submitted a high-quality proposal in 2019 in response to the state's Medicaid RFP and were selected as one of the winning bids. In December 2019, the new administration canceled the awards and rebid the contracts. We have already submitted the updated proposal that details our capabilities and local community commitments that were originally successful and therefore, we are hopeful that we will be successful again. In Texas, the STAR+PLUS RFP awards announced in October were disappointing to us. While we believe we have an excellent track record of service in this program and submitted a high-quality proposal, we also believe the scoring process was severely flawed. Therefore, we are pursuing our administrative rights. Our team filed a detailed protest which points out a number of fundamental flaws in the scoring process. We have not been given a time line for a ruling on the protest. We believe that the effective date of the new contract would be no earlier than January 1, 2021, so we expect to operate under our existing contract for the full year 2020. These and our other growth initiatives are anchored by our capital allocation priorities : first, organic growth of our core businesses; second, inorganic growth through accretive acquisitions; and third, programmatically returning excess capital to shareholders via share repurchases.  Now turning to our 2020 guidance. 2020 is the first full year in our pivot to growth strategy. It is a year in which we expect meaningful top line revenue growth while continuing to produce attractive margins. In that context, some highlights of our guidance are as follows : we expect to grow premium revenues by 7.4% organically and 9%, assuming our announced acquisitions closed by June 30. For the total company, we expect to produce strong after-tax margins of 3.7% to 3.8%. We expect to continue to improve our performance in the Medicaid business as we benefit from a stable rate and cost trend environment. In Medicare, we expect to grow revenues and maintain our attractive margin position despite the industry-specific headwind of the reinstatement of the Health Insurer Fee. However, we now expect a decline in the Marketplace profit pool for 2020 as the extraordinary 2019 margin performance presents a challenging jump-off point into 2020, and it is clear to us now that our membership growth expectations were too optimistic relative to our pricing strategy. We have enhanced our earnings profile by a measured deployment of excess capital. And finally, as a result of all of this, for the full year 2020, we expect GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $11.20 to $11.70. Our premium revenue for the full year 2020 is expected to be approximately $17.4 billion, an increase of 7.4% over 2019. This growth is within the 7% to 9% guidance range we gave previously, which assumed a steady state in Texas and no acquisitions. Assuming the YourCare and Next Level acquisitions close by June 30, premium revenue would increase approximately 9% year-over-year, an 11% increase on an annualized basis. 40% of our premium growth is attributed to member volume and 60% is attributed to rate increases and mix of business. We have a strong and balanced business portfolio, which produces a solid baseline for 2020 and supports our future growth. Now I will provide some details underlying our guidance by line of business. In our Medicaid business, we expect 2020 premium revenue to grow approximately 6.4%. This reflects the annualized impact of the RFP awards that we implemented this past year, market share growth in underpenetrated markets and net rate increases. Our expected 2020 year-end membership is an increase of approximately 3% over 2019 and 6% when including the membership of our 2 acquisitions. From an earnings perspective, we expect to produce Medicaid after-tax margins in the range of 3.2% to 3.4%, a slight improvement over 2019. The rate environment is rational and our rate advocacy efforts are working well. We continue to manage medical costs effectively as our efforts in payment integrity, network management and utilization control continue to offset stable, low single-digit medical cost trends, and we continue to improve our retention of at-risk revenue and improve our member risk scores. Our Medicare business is expected to grow premium revenues by approximately 12%, with our DSNP product growing by 20%. Recall, we filed DSNP products in 150 new counties in 2020, including entering 2 new states, Ohio and South Carolina, and gained market share in existing counties. We continue to progress toward our goal of having full penetration of our DSNP product in our Medicaid footprint. Our year-end membership in Medicare all-in is expected to be an 8% increase over 2019. From an earnings perspective in Medicare, we expect an after-tax margin in the range of 5.6% to 5.7%, including the Health Insurer Fee headwind of $22 million after-tax, which dampens margins by approximately 90 basis points. In this line of business, premium yields have kept pace with medical cost trend, we continue to effectively manage the high-acuity LTSS population and we continue to improve on our member risk scores. In our Marketplace business, we served 274,000 members at year-end 2019 and produced exceptionally high margins. In an effort to be more competitive in our 2020 product set, we lowered our prices on average 4%. We began 2020 with approximately 350,000 Marketplace members, a 30% increase from year-end 2019, including our expanded footprint in two states, Mississippi and South Carolina. We expect Marketplace revenue growth of 9.2% in 2020 with after-tax margins in the 4.7% to 4.9% range. Our Marketplace membership and revenue growth outlook are below our initial expectations, as the investments we made in product design and pricing did not produce the level of membership we had forecasted. This was particularly true in 2 markets, Texas and Florida, which comprised most of the shortfall to our expectation. In summary, we had competitive pricing in many, but not all of our markets, and we saw fewer members move for the same price differential than we had seen in years prior. We do, however, expect membership attrition to be lower than in past years, and thus, we expect to end the year with approximately 310,000 members, a 15% increase over year-end 2019. In conclusion, after another solid year of performance in 2019, we look to 2020 and beyond with confidence. We have a deep management team, a strong product portfolio, a healthy capital structure and a value-creating approach to capital deployment. We are and we will be a pure-play government managed care business. We are going to stay close to the core. We believe that the government managed care business has very attractive growth characteristics with compelling free cash flow generation. Now I will turn the call over to Tom Tran for more detail on the financials. Tom? Thomas Tran : Thank you, Joe, and good morning. We report fourth quarter earnings per diluted share of $2.67, net income of $168 million and an after-tax margin of 3.9% with premium revenue of $4.1 billion. Let me provide some additional detail on the quarter. My commentary will be focused on a sequential quarter comparison. The consolidated MCR for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 86% compared to 86.3% in the third quarter, primarily due to improved results in Medicaid. Prior period reserve development in the quarter was negligible.  More specifically, in the Medicaid business, our MCR for the quarter improved 80 basis points sequentially to 87.3%, producing an after-tax margin of 3.6%. We continue to perform well in Medicaid. Our Medicare business continued to perform well in the quarter. The MCR for the quarter of 85.5% was stable compared to 85.6% in the third quarter of 2019, producing an after-tax margin of 5.5%. Finally, our Marketplace business continued to perform well and generally in line with seasonal expectations as we report an MCR for the quarter of 73.5% compared to 71.2% in the third quarter of 2019, producing an after-tax margin of 4.5%. Regarding influenza, costs were higher in the current quarter compared to the same quarter in the prior year, but the overall impact was not significant. The G&A ratio for the fourth quarter of 2019 increased by 40 basis points to 8% compared to 7.6% in the third quarter of 2019, due mainly to spending on sales and marketing during the open enrollment for Medicare and Marketplace. Turning to our balance sheet, cash flow and cash position for the quarter. Our reserve approach is consistent with prior quarters, and our reserve position remains strong. Days in claim payable represents 50 days of medical cost expense compared to 50 days in the third quarter of 2019 and 53 days in the fourth quarter of 2018. As of December 31, 2019, our health plans had total statutory capital and surplus of approximately $1.9 billion, which equates to approximately 350% of risk-based capital.  In December, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $500 million. And during the quarter, we repurchased approximately 400,000 shares for $54 million. Subsequent to the quarter, through February 7, we repurchased an additional 1.5 million shares, bringing the total number of share repurchase to 1.9 million for $257 million. Operating cash flow for 2019 was $427 million, an improvement compared to 2018, primarily due to the timing of premium receipt and government payments. Our initial full year 2020 earnings per share guidance on a GAAP basis is in a range of $11.20 to $11.70. We have not include the YourCare and NextLevel acquisitions as this transaction have not yet closed. Our guidance assumes a steady state in Texas for the full year 2020, as we believe the existing contract will run through this year. Our premium revenue for the full year 2020 is expected to be approximately $17.4 billion, which reflects a 7.4% increase over 2019. If the YourCare and NextLevel acquisition were to close by June 30, premium revenue would increase approximately 9% year-over-year and the earnings impact for 2020 from the 2 acquisition would be negligible. We expect the medical care ratio to be in a range of 86.2% to 86.4%. The increase over 2019 is primarily due to a higher Marketplace MCR in 2020. We expect our G&A ratio to improve to approximately 7.2%. This reflects revenue growth, fixed cost leverage and productivity improvements, offset somewhat by reinvestment in growth initiatives. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 31%, an increase from 24% in 2019, driven by the impact of the Health Insurer Fee. We expect after-tax margins in a range of 3.7% to 3.8%, primarily due to lower Marketplace margins that Joe previously mentioned. While we do not give quarterly guidance, I do want to point out that the first quarter earnings per diluted share will be less than 25% of our full year outlook due to the impact of the leap year and the timing of our capital actions. Lastly, I would like to announce that we will be holding an Investor Day on May 28, 2020 in New York City. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first question today comes from Peter Costa of Wells Fargo. Peter Costa : Really just wanted to explore the Exchange business a little bit in terms of do you believe that margins will deteriorate further going forward? Or are we at the end of it here with this year coming up? And then talk about the pricing situation with competitors. How much further do you expect price competition to impact that business' growth? Joseph Zubretsky : Sure, Pete. We hit our price point on our Silver product, meaning we are number one or number two in about 50% of our geographies. We hit our price point in Bronze, either the number one price position or zero premium in about 75% of our geographies. So we didn't hit our price point in all geographies. And where we did hit the price point, fewer members move for the price differential than we had seen in years prior. So we didn't get the volume that we expected to get for the 4% average price decreases we put into the market. So 2020, the earnings reset. We earned $150 million, which was exceptionally high in 2019. That will be approximately $75 million in 2020. But I would say that 2019 felt more like $125 million a year and 2020 should have been more like $100 million a year. So the -- while the spread looks wide, I think the jump-off point in 2019 was particularly challenging. I think we need to go through the pricing cycle for 2021 to see where the margins land. We still have very high hopes for this business. It leverages our Medicaid footprint, our Medicaid network. Nearly 90% of our members are fully subsidized. So we're servicing the working poor -- serving the working poor. So it fits strategically. But let's go through the 2021 pricing cycle and see how we can grow the profit pool over time. Operator : Next question comes from Matthew Borsch of BMO Capital. Matthew Borsch : Yes. Maybe just a little bit more on the ACA, your Marketplace membership. And I'm curious, in Florida and Texas, is it a dynamic of price competition being more intense than you had expected? And you also alluded to members not moving at the same price point as you saw the move in prior years. Does that reflect the maturity in the market? Or are there other factors you might attribute that to? Joseph Zubretsky : Matt, on the last point, it's the question of elasticity of demand. And I think where we misforecasted was the result of members moving as prices were moving up. As price increases were going into the market, members would move for $10 and $20. And I think as prices have now moderated and even declined, I think you're seeing less movement for the same price differential as the market, as you suggested, seasons and matures. As your members become more chronic and they stay with you longer, these high-acuity members are not going to move their health plan if they're using a lot of services. So I think the maturity and the seasoning of the market has something to do with it. On your first point, yes, in Texas, in certain places in Florida, we did not hit the price point that we tried to due to a competitive force. And as we reprice into 2021, we're going to look at those markets and try to capture the market share that we think we can attain. Operator : The next question comes from Mike Newshel of Evercore ISI. Michael Newshel : Maybe just a follow-up on the exchanges. I mean since the membership does appear less sensitive to price changes, is that going to change how you approach pricing next year in terms of optimizing margin versus favoring enrollment growth? And also just how are you thinking about the long-term targets on margin and revenue growth that you provided at the Investor Day? Joseph Zubretsky : Yes. The balance that you referred to is what you need to titrate in this business. You're looking for how many members you can grow for the price point you put into the marketplace. And the favorable news in all of this is that while fewer members move, that also means that more members are retained. So we're projecting -- well, last year, we had about 1.5% to 2% membership attrition per month. We're projecting this year that to be more like 1%. As I said, as members stay with you longer, they're probably more chronic, heavy users of health care services and less likely to move. So I would say that, yes, as the market seasons, fewer members will move, but that's good for member retention. Michael Newshel : How about the long-term guidance on exchanges? How are you thinking about that? Joseph Zubretsky : I think we have to go through the 2021 pricing cycle. We'll look at all of the factors in this business. We'll look at our networks. We'll look at our broker relationships and our commission structures and then, of course, product design and price point. And we still think we can grow the profit pool, albeit off a lower base. We're not reforecasting the long-term margin picture for the business, although suffice it to say, it probably will take longer to get there than we had originally forecasted. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Tanal of Goldman Sachs. Stephen Tanal : Maybe just a couple of quick ones on the guidance and then one on the marketplace. So just wanted to understand, is prior period developing -- our prior year development now included in the guidance? And if so, is that at a similar level to '19? I think it was about $0.98 in the first half of the year. Joseph Zubretsky : Prior year development is not included in our 2020 guidance. Stephen Tanal : Perfect. And then the Texas STAR+PLUS. Can you give us a sense of what amount of sort of revenue and net earnings would be lost if the appeal, the award doesn't go as planned? Kind of on an annualized basis just so we have a sense of what that delta would look like? Joseph Zubretsky : Well, right now, as the department has published, if they went through the awards, the contract -- new contract would be effective on September 1, 2020. So therefore, it will be four months of revenue loss. And the Medicaid contract, that's approximately $350 million, and we estimate anywhere from $0.20 to $0.25 of earnings per share drag in this year. Now I wouldn't necessarily multiply that by three to get the full year impact because you just can't take the cost out fast enough. In one quarter, you're not going to take the cost out fast enough. So we need some time to readjust our cost structure and our fixed cost base to estimate the full annual effect. But for this year, $0.20 to $0.25 a drag in the latter half of the year through the last half of the year and $350 million of revenue loss in the Medicaid contract. Stephen Tanal : Super helpful. Then just on the Marketplace. Wondering if you could comment on the MLR that's embedded in the guide? Joseph Zubretsky : I'm sorry, can you repeat the question? Stephen Tanal : The Marketplace MLR for '20 that's embedded in the guide? Joseph Zubretsky : Yes. It's approximately 74%, up from 68% in 2019. Operator : The next question comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Justin Lake : I was hoping you could walk through your capital and balance sheet projections for the end of the year. Assuming the deals closed, did you expect the share repo that's in the guidance? Just trying to get an idea on the end of the year capital flexibility. Joseph Zubretsky : Sure, Justin. And just to recap, during 2019, we were retiring the very expensive convertible notes that were in our capital structure -- that were getting more as the stock price moved up -- that were getting more and more expensive. So over a period of 18 months, we freed up $1.7 billion, and the notes right now are substantially gone. Now as you know, those notes have a dilutive effect on your share count. And so retiring those notes actually is a catalyst going into next year on the share count dynamics, as will be our share repurchase program having already repurchased 1.9 million shares. All that being said, we still have $1 billion of cash at year-end in the parent company, which means it's free and excess cash flow. We also have $900 million of undrawn debt capacity for a total of $1.9 billion of dry powder to fund our acquisitions, to repurchase shares and to grow the business the way we intend to. Thomas Tran : The only thing I would add here, as Joe said, is that we expect to continue to attract dividend from our subsidiary as we continue to generate profit in 2020. So that additional dividend structure will also give us additional flexibility there to do other things. Justin Lake : That's helpful. Can you tell us what you expect to spend on these acquisitions? I mean, we could figure out the share repurchase number pretty easily. Joseph Zubretsky : Well, the tip we have under contract will be $90 million. $50 million for one, $40 million for the other. So total of $90 million for the 2 acquisitions. And then we still have $250 million left in our current share repurchase authorization, but we could top that up at some point in the future. Justin Lake : And then just a couple of quick numbers questions. First, can you give us an investment income assumption for 2020? And then second, Joe, just to follow-up on the commentary on taxes. I just want to make sure you were saying that it's 20 -- would be $0.25 dilutive to this year, but it would actually be less -- we shouldn't multiply that by three to get to $0.75 because you'd be able to cut some costs, so it would be lower than that on a full year basis once you get the debt financed? Joseph Zubretsky : I'll answer the second question first. Yes, that's correct. $0.25 of drag, if we were to lose the contracts on September 1. But we're still looking at how quickly we would reduce our cost structure. And so we -- I don't have a full year number, but I'm expecting it would be less than 3x the 2020 effect. Tom, investment income? Thomas Tran : Sure. On the question of investment income, we love to get investment and other income. And if you look at 2019, it's $132 million. Third quarter happened to be higher than normal as we went through some restructuring of our portfolio. Typically, you would see roughly about $30 million a quarter. I would say that for 2020, you should see that number to be lower because yields have dropped significantly over this past year due to the FET fund had decreased a couple of times. So I don't have the number right in front of me. So let me just follow up with you right after the call. I'll give you the exact number. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Fidel of Stephens. Scott Fidel : Question, I just want to ask something maybe a little more thematically. And Joe, interested in just your thoughts on just looking at the Medicaid RFP process more broadly and what transpired in 2019. It was a pretty messy year in terms of how the RFPs played out in a number of states when we think about North Carolina, Kentucky, Texas, Louisiana. Just interested if you think holistically, there's any broader takeaways around what we've seen play out in the Medicaid RFP process. I mean one could certainly look at each of these from a bit of an idiosyncratic sort of one-off dynamics in each state. But clearly, when you aggregate it together, it was just a difficult, much more difficult year for RFPs in general than we've traditionally seen. Joseph Zubretsky : I think that's a fair point. And the specific sites you mentioned certainly have a lot of intrigue around them in terms of how they all unfolded. We don't view it any differently than we always have. We think nonincumbents have a reasonable chance of displacing an incumbent, which means you need to protect your turf and go after the new ones hard. We still think the ground game works. You have to be in a state a year or two before an RFP has dropped in order to hold the provider relationships, the regulatory and political relationships and really get to know the landscape, and we're doing that. So while I think this year, as you mentioned, might have some idiosyncratic noise to it, we still believe that the pipeline of Nevada, Missouri, Iowa, Indiana, Tennessee, Georgia, a little further out. We'll evaluate all of those through the screens we put them through, the friendliness of the regulatory environment, reasonable rate structure, the strength of the incumbency and ability to develop a network. And we'll take our shots and go after the ones we think we can win. So long term, I don't think my view of the growth aspects of new state wins has changed even though, as you suggest, 2019 was a bit noisy. Scott Fidel : Okay. And then just one quick guidance question. Just your thoughts on the good range for operating cash flow in 2020? Thomas Tran : Well, operating cash flow really fluctuate a lot. So that depends on timing of government payments. So we -- not only in good zone. We expect operating cash flow to be positive going forward. But every quarter, you're going to see fluctuations, and that's just the nature of the business we're in. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Raskin of Nephron Research. Joshua Raskin : Quick ones on guidance as well. Just as we think about adjusted EPS. Any difference in amortization expectations for next year? And then the share count reduction, sort of that 5% boost you're seeing. Is that share buybacks? I think it feels like it almost assumes a reauthorization of the buybacks as well. Joseph Zubretsky : Josh, I'll answer the second question first and then hand it over to Tom. In 2019, we were retiring the very expensive convertible notes, which, as you know, end up in your diluted share count. So about 1/3 of our share count reduction is just the spillover effect of all the convert retirement activity in 2019 hitting full run rate in 2020, and the remaining portion is the actual reduction in the share count as a result of the share repurchase program. It does not anticipate any top-up to the existing $500 million authorization. Thomas Tran : Yes. On the intangible amortization. If you look at the table we disclosed in the earnings release, it's approximately $17 million pretax for 2019. That number is going to drop a little bit in 2020. So I expect to be roughly about $0.17 to $0.18 per share for the full year versus this year, but roughly about $0.20. Joshua Raskin : Okay. Perfect. And then you guys talked last quarter around some of your select -- some of the specific Medicaid markets, cost pressures and some high-cost claims. And obviously, no sign of that. No mention in the press release. Maybe any look back as to what the potential drivers were, what you guys were seeing? Or was any of that still lingering in the quarter? Joseph Zubretsky : It really wasn't. In the second and third quarter, we did note some cost pressure here and there. The one that we were most aware of and concerned with was in Ohio due to 3 things : the behavioral carve-in over a year ago; the inclusion of IMD facilities in the behavioral benefit; and then, of course, due to redetermination, the acuity mix shift. As we've often said that rate advocacy is a very important part of this business, and we and the other participants in Ohio work with the state, got a rate increase in mid-2019 and then got a very significant rate increase for 1/1/20 going forward. So that was the one we are most concerned with, and we think that has largely been solved with our rate advocacy efforts and a nice rate increase on 1/1/2020. Operator : The next question comes from Charles Rhyee of Cowen. Charles Rhyee : Just two quick questions. One, going back on the marketplace. If you're seeing fewer members move because of pricing, is there anything beyond pricing that you can do to really differentiate the products to drive growth? Joseph Zubretsky : Yes. There are some benefit design of dental, vision and what we call ancillary benefit features, many of which we implemented in -- for this cycle. And then, of course, they're your broker relationships and is your commission structure competitive and we'll broker loyalty, help move membership. So we're looking at all of those factors in our 2021 pricing cycle. Charles Rhyee : Okay, great. And then -- and just going back to Kentucky. You mentioned that you kind of resubmitted the bid. Were there any kind of major changes when you looked at the revised RFP there? And can you talk -- maybe give us a little bit more thoughts on sort of what changes you revised for your bid as you resubmitted? Joseph Zubretsky : Sure. The only changes to the RFP were two. I'll call them administrative matters, really. The questions on the capabilities did not change at all. But what we did, and I would imagine all of our competitors did, is you went back and looked at where you could absorb better and tried to shore up your RFP response, which we did. And as I said, I'm sure the competitors did as well. Operator : The next question comes from Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Steven Valiquette : So a couple of questions around the Marketplace. I guess, first, for the 2020 memberships that you mentioned, that Texas and Florida in particular were soft relative to your expectations. Is there any chance that maybe just the unfavorable headlines from Molina around your initial outcome in the Texas STAR+PLUS award may have hurt your Marketplace membership growth in Texas? And do you have any thoughts, I mean, on why you think Florida may have been soft? And then I have a follow-up after that. Joseph Zubretsky : No. The dynamics in Texas and the two businesses are quite separate and distinct from each other under different regulatory regimes, et cetera. So no, we do not think that the Marketplace and Medicaid business had anything to do with each other. It was competitive pricing. You do the best you can. It's a blind bid. You try to predict where your competitors are going. And as I said, I think the good news is we did hit in 50% of our Silver geographies and in 75% of our Bronze geographies. So we hit the price point in many places. We'll try to do better next year. And hopefully, the attrition rate will stick, and we'll have sticky membership, and profitable going forward. Steven Valiquette : Okay. And then just quickly again for Marketplace. I mean you mentioned last month in January that 80% of the 350,000 members are renewals or retained, which you mentioned gave you stability and visibility on the MLR. Just to kind of explore this a little for this whole discussion around less new members for '20 leading to lower margins. I mean, is it possible that just a larger percent of your marketplace book, because it's retained members, is maybe hitting up on MLR floors in 2020 than what you expected and that is what is mechanically making the net margins come in a little lower than expected? Or is that not really what you're seeing? Joseph Zubretsky : In 2019, we are at the minimum MLR in one state, New Mexico. We have been for 2 years now. And as you know, the 2017 year -- it's a 3-year rolling calculation. The 2017 was a particularly poor year. And as we just announced, the 2019 was an exceptionally good year. So that will put pressure on the new MLR in a couple of additional states, but it's really not material to the overall story on the margin. It's really the product -- sorry, the volume pricing equation that is the larger part of the story, not the minimum MLR. Operator : The next question comes from Gary Taylor of JPMorgan. Gary Taylor : Most of my questions have been answered. I just want to go back to Medicaid margins for next year a little bit. I think up 10 basis points is your guidance. And you had mentioned some rate increases in Ohio. So I've noted those. I guess my question is, what have you contemplated for 2020 in terms of just the redetermination environment in general, getting better, worse, staying the same? And with this Trump public charge rule now being allowed to take effect at least while it's being litigated, what are your thoughts on whether that has any impact in terms of enrollment and margins? Joseph Zubretsky : Gary, on the last part of your question, the public charge redetermination, the impact on 2020. We certainly took all of that into consideration. And we saw membership stabilize in the last half of the year. The quarter-over-quarter sequential membership in Medicaid has pretty much held steady. And so many of the significant redetermination efforts that were going on, on Michigan and particularly Ohio, have moderated. Certainly, the public charges, we're aware of it. 3 of our states, California, Texas and Illinois in particular have high concentrations of the populations that are subject to it. But Department of Homeland Security only estimates that 140,000 people nationwide are really affected by it, but the chilling effect is something we're aware of and we certainly considered in our guidance. With respect to rate and profit improvement. It was not just Ohio. We actually did well on rates in many of our geographies. As I said, the rate environment is stable. It's very rational. It's actually really sound. And in just about all of our geographies, rate not only kept pace with low single-digit medical cost trend, it exceeded it in some places. So that helps margins in 2020. And also, we continue to pound away at our profit improvement initiatives. Payment integrity, utilization control, better risk scores all contribute to the profitability of both the Medicare and the Medicaid book of business. So we're pretty confident we can maintain this margin position in 2020 and perhaps beyond. Gary Taylor : One other question, if I could, just on prior year development. Your GAAP earnings guidance roughly flat year-over-year is hurdling almost $1 of excess development that you're assuming does not recur. And I know -- I think that $0.98 is higher than it's been historically the last few years. But could you just remind us on maybe what lines of business were the largest contributors to that $0.98 or roughly $1 just so we can think about that a little bit heading into 2020? Thomas Tran : Sure. Most of the favorable development that we have reported throughout 2019 were related to Medicaid business. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. So I just want to go back to these changes for a few minutes. It sounds like you're saying that the delta versus your expectations on the Exchange is really about membership rather than margin. So are you saying that the margin is more or less in line with kind of what you expected when you were pricing the business last year? Joseph Zubretsky : No, Kevin. We expected the margin to be more -- closer to the long-term guidance range that we gave you. So we're certainly coming in lower. But as we said many times, you can't have a conversation about margin or membership without the companion statement. Our goal is to grow the profit pool and growing it off of the $75 million base will be pretty important to our earnings growth story going forward. So every single year we go into the pricing cycle. We'll try to sort through the competitive forces. We'll work with our broker relationships, and our goal is to grow the profit pool here over time. Now whether we can get it back to the 8% after-tax margin range we had originally forecasted, it will take some time to get there. But as we go into the 2021 pricing cycle, we'll know more. Kevin Fischbeck : And is it the minimum MLR? I think you said the minimum MLR was not a big issue. So if it's not minimum MLR being a big issue in 2020 that caused the margins to drop, what is it? Just growth in lower-margin markets than you expected? Thomas Tran : Yes, Kevin, MLR does play a factor in the lower margin in 2020, but it's not really the major factor, if you will. As Joe mentioned before, we come off the 2017 bad year, off of your 3-year rolling calculation. So 2020, we expect to have higher minimum loss, higher, I would say, the rebate and more state than just New Mexico. Joseph Zubretsky : But all of those factors played into the margin compression for the year. Number one, off of the higher revenue base, the operating leverage is significant. Let's not forget that. Your variable cost in sales expense is certainly there, but you're leveraging your fixed cost base. So the fact that we didn't hit revenue really, really hurt us in the operating leverage in this line of business. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. I guess, the fact that you already hit minimum MLR in more states, does that give you then a pricing tailwind into next year? Or are you now rethinking how beneficial that might be given that people there weren't switching for the incremental price differential? Joseph Zubretsky : Well, when we go into the 2021 pricing cycle, we'll have to forecast. Again, here we go with 3 months into the year forecasting if we're going to be up against it in the state and take that into consideration in the pricing. And as you know, it's a 3-year rolling average. So you can't get it all back in 1 year. It takes time. But again, as Tom said, it's not a significant part of the story. We might bump into it in a couple more states than New Mexico. But it's just not a significant part of the story for this year. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And I guess last question. So just basically, just to tie this down. The costs are coming in basically as expected. You continue to expect them to come in as expected. There's no cost issue. We're really talking about a pricing of MLR and membership growth issue, not a cost issue anywhere in here? Joseph Zubretsky : Yes, I think that's exactly it. It's the balance of those three factors that you try to anticipate and price for. And this year, we misforecasted it and we didn't hit it. Operator : The next question comes from Dave Windley of Jefferies. David Windley : Listen and covered, but I have a couple. On the acquisitions, Joe, you mentioned that the relatively low margin, which gives you an opportunity, I think Tom in his prepared remarks said if they close by X date, they would be neutral to earnings this year. I guess I'm wondering how much of your playbook does that assume? Are they just naturally financially neutral and your operational execution would make that better? Or does that assume some operational execution? And how quickly -- you were able to execute the playbook pretty well in the organic business pretty quickly. How quickly do you think you can execute that in these acquisitions? Joseph Zubretsky : We believe we can get these to run rate to our target margins after 1 year of operating them, whatever that year is. 12 months of operating them. And bear in mind, it's not just getting the $550 million of revenue to our target margin. I hate to keep talking about operating leverage, but it's real. These two properties in particular, 1 in upstate New York, is basically just folded into our existing infrastructure, and same with Ohio. We have a very large Illinois health plan. We need no more management. We fold it in, and we get the operating leverage off it. So it actually produces north of your target margins because of the operating leverage you get, and we plan to get to our run rate after 12 months of ownership. David Windley : Got it. Okay. And am I right that approximate delta from where you're acquiring them to your target margins is a good 200 basis points or more? Joseph Zubretsky : Yes. These two properties in particular are basically breakeven. David Windley : Okay, breakeven. And then just for simplicity. To the share count question and the reduction in share count in 2020, can you give us after the retirement of the convert, after the buyback that you did in the fourth quarter, like what was the ending share count for the year as opposed to the average for the fourth quarter? Thomas Tran : Yes. The ending share count is going to be lower than what we provided to you on the guidance table. So because as you buy share, it's going to flow throughout a number of quarters. And the number is probably roughly about a little bit less than 61 million share for the end of 2020. David Windley : Okay. Great. And last question, on the comments about attrition. Joe, I think you had talked about fewer movers. My -- I'm interpreting that as movement during like an open enrollment period and during shopping. Do I also understand that you're translating that to, you think your retention within the year is going to be higher? And is the thought process in those two different kind of period the same? Joseph Zubretsky : Good point. Our retention during open enrollment was north of 80%. So we ended the year with 274,000 members. 80% of those are now members inside our 350,000 beginning of the year membership. We also saw this last year. And you can see it in the medical cost. You can see higher use of pharmacy, chronic conditions using expensive drugs. So the members are clearly more chronic. You see it in the risk scores. You see it in the retention rate and the open enrollment retention rate. And therefore, we are projecting that we'll only lose about 1% a month, where in the past, we've lost 1.5% to 2% a month. David Windley : Okay. And then is that higher chronic mix then consistent with what you expected in pricing and kind of MLR expectation? I presume you baked that into your guidance, but just to make sure. Joseph Zubretsky : Yes, absolutely. And again, higher acuity members, as long as you get paid for them and get the right risk scores, higher acuity members are fine and can produce target profitability. So yes, we took that into consideration as we price the book. But we have to get the risk scores, and we're getting better and better at that every day. Operator : The next question comes from Sarah James of Piper Sandler. Sarah James : For 2020 guidance in Medicaid and Medicare margins. They're both well above peer average and your long-term guidance that you gave at I-Day. But the net margin of the company is still well below the midpoint of long-term guide. So I'm wondering if the 3.8% to 4.2% is still what we should be thinking about for long-term net margin guidance for Molina as a whole? And how sustainable are the heightened Medicare and Medicaid margins that you're experiencing in '20? Joseph Zubretsky : Well, certainly, in Medicaid with a projection for 2020 of 3.2% to 3.4% after-tax, we believe that the Medicaid margins are sustainable. And again, all based on a reasonable, rational and actuarial rate environment. So that's the context for being able to sustain those margins and our ability to manage medical costs. On the Medicare side, bear in mind, our book is different. It's not traditional Medicare Advantage. It's DSNP and MMP. These are high acuity members, heavily burdened with LTSS benefits and we're very good at managing those. So it's a $2.5 billion book of business with starkly different characteristics than many of the larger Medicare players. So I don't think the comparison to traditional MA is the right comparison. But we believe these margins are sustainable in this area. And yes, you're right. It's really the margin rebalance in 2020 on Marketplace that has caused us to operate at the lower end of our long-term guidance range. And as we go through our 2021 pricing cycle for Marketplace, we'll make the determination as to whether that long-term guidance still stands or not. Sarah James : Got it. And maybe if I compare the MA margins to your own book, because you're right about the product mix there. So they're running a good bit above the 5%, 5.5% long-term guide. And then you mentioned they're also absorbing 90 basis points from the HIF. So as we think about that book going forward, when the HIF falls off, can you add that 90 basis points back in? And how do you think about the long-term margin profile of your MA book? Joseph Zubretsky : Well, clearly, when the HIF goes away for next year, it's a complete reversal. So you're right on that point. As you grow the business more aggressively, newer members that come on are going to attract a higher MLR. Typically, we see new members coming in, in the mid-90s, and the book as it seasons produces mid-80s. So if we start growing this book more aggressively, that will put pressure on the MLR, which will in turn put pressure on the margins, but that's all contemplated in pricing and in forecasting. That would be the dynamic that I would expect as we grow this book in the future. Thomas Tran : This is Tom. There's a question from Justin Lake on investment income before. I just want to provide you with the data. 2020, we expect investment in other revenue to be about $35 million less than 2019. Operator : The next question comes from George Hill of Deutsche Bank. George Hill : I think most of my questions have been answered. I'll just tack 1 more on about the Marketplace environment. If you guys kind of went to market with 4% price decreases and weren't able to kind of get the churn that you were looking for, I guess, churn wasn't what you expected, I guess. Do you know what churn in aggregate looked like kind of across the market, inclusive of your book? And I guess, what does -- I'm trying to figure out, like, what do those numbers kind of tell you about the economic sensitivity of that market? And like what type of price decrease do you think is necessary to drive churn in that book and grow market share? And I recognize that there's a lot of moving pieces with that business. Joseph Zubretsky : Yes. There are a lot of moving pieces. And one thing I would say is that, first of all, we did retain an open enrollment, 80% of our members. So we have at least our own data point. Hard to say what the competitors saw. But we believe this is sort of a dynamic as prices have now stabilized or even moderated and decreased the $5, $10 and $20 price differential. Keep bearing in mind these are nearly fully-subsidized members. So the Marketplace, 10 million members wide. We're serving a niche. We're serving these highly subsidized members. 86% of our members have some subsidy. About half of those have a full subsidy. And the dynamics, I think, in that market might be different than the Marketplace at large. The members, high acuity, and they're using services. They're less likely to move. That's a dynamic we've always dealt with. But I think as prices have moderated, members are not leaving for the same price differential they have left for in prior years.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Trudell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Julie Trudell : Good morning and thank you for joining Molina Healthcare's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. With me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Tom Tran. Press releases announcing our first quarter earnings and the definitive agreement to acquire Magellan Complete Care were distributed yesterday after the market closed. Press releases and the slide presentation regarding the MCC announcement are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay of this call will be available shortly after the conclusion of the call for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in our earnings release. For those who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that the remarks made herein are as of today Friday, May 1, 2020, and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. In this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our first quarter 2020 press release. During our call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements relating to our growth prospects, our 2020 guidance, a Magellan Complete Care acquisition and our long-term outlook. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that can cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report for the 2019 year filed with the SEC as well as the risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open up the call and take your questions. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe? Joe Zubretsky : Thank you, Julie, and good morning. This is an unprecedented time. The COVID-19 pandemic has had and will continue to have a profound impact on our country, our state partners, our members and our employees. Our team has worked tirelessly over the past two months to ensure that the needs of all of our constituencies are addressed quickly in this rapidly changing and challenging environment. COVID-19 impact on the U.S. healthcare system and the overall economy will continue to develop during the year, no doubt causing some short-term challenges, but also serving to highlight the important role government-sponsored healthcare plays in this type of crisis. Clearly, the macroeconomic environment will significantly impact our results this year and for the foreseeable future. With that said, as a pure-play government managed care business, we remained well positioned at a time when reliable access to high-quality healthcare is more critical than ever to our members and our state partners. We would like to provide you with updates today on a number of fronts. First, we will cover the financial results for the first quarter. Second, we will discuss the new but hopefully temporary operating environment created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Third, we will convey our guidance in the context of our first quarter results and this new operating environment; and fourth and lastly, we will provide some detail about our exciting acquisition of Magellan Complete Care that we announced last evening and other updates to our pivot to growth initiatives. Let me start with specific first quarter highlights. We reported earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of $2.92, with net income of $178 million and an after-tax margin of 3.9%, which slightly exceeded our expectations for the quarter. Premium revenue was $4.3 billion, an 8.9% increase over the prior year, which is consistent with our pivot to growth. The medical care ratio was 86.3%. We experienced medical cost pressure in the Medicaid line of business early in the quarter, resulting from slightly higher-than-normal seasonal flu, combined with early, but at the time, unidentified COVID-19 costs. These increased costs were offset by lower medical costs in all lines of business very late in the quarter as elective and discretionary healthcare services began to be postponed and deferred. These offsetting factors, combined with negligible prior period reserve development, produced a medical care ratio that squarely met our expectations. We managed to a G&A ratio of 7%, in line with our expectations, even after reflecting incremental expenses associated with the mobilization of our workforce to work at home, and other new operational protocols related to COVID-19. The total company after-tax margin was 3.9%, in line with our expectations, comprising product line margins, of 3.2% in Medicaid, 8.4% in Medicare and 4.1% in Marketplace. While a $2.92 earnings per share result modestly exceeded our expectations, its achievement is noteworthy in the context of the environment in which it was produced, which brings us to our second topic. The dramatically different environment in which we currently operate and some of the changes we have made in response, to recap a few of these measures. As shelter in place directives and all-out shutdowns quickly spread throughout our geographic footprint, we swiftly moved substantially all of our associates to work at home. We accomplished this with no disruption to service, as service metrics have remained excellent. This is a remarkable accomplishment in light of the potential for disruption to utilization management, care management, network access and information technology infrastructure. Substantially, all of our company's workforce, 10,000 associates are currently working from home. Many providers have seen disruption to their patient and revenue flows. Providers are struggling more than ever with utilization management, payment integrity routines and associated protocols in a rapidly evolving environment, which their cash flows have suddenly declined. While this requires adaptability on our end, we maintained strong performance in network management and utilization control. To assist providers in this challenging time, we accelerated claim payments by $150 million in late March and early April, while also extending the term of all non-COVID-19-related prior authorizations through September 1, 2020. We also increased Telehealth visit reimbursement to be at parity with in person visits and have expedited credentialing to ensure we have ample provider capacity. We understand that COVID-19 creates a variety of challenges for our employees, including family members at home who may need support, children who require care. We quickly implemented broad-based programs to help them during this time, including two special stipends of $500 or a total of $1,000, and each of more than 9,000 of our employees. We also implemented pay enhancements for essential employees required to come to the workplace and an additional COVID-19 pay lead policy. We are responding to dozens, if not hundreds, of special requests by our state customers, CMS and other governmental agencies. For example, we eliminated all member costs for COVID-19 testing and related treatments. We relaxed utilization management protocols in specific instances. We expanded Telemedicine access to all members and we made substantial contributions to the supply of personal protection equipment. We also committed support and resources for various nonprofit organizations serving those in need across the country. Support, supplies and monetary donations have been made to a variety of trusted organizations that directly serve vulnerable populations. In summary, we would characterize our first quarter results as more than respectable, in the context of unprecedented disruption to the entire spectrum of traditional managed care operations that occurred over the span of just a few weeks. In this difficult operating environment, it should be noted that our financial position is strong as we had already done the hard work to develop very solid capital and liquidity positions. A few words about these matters. Our share repurchase program is now completed as we purchased a total of 3.4 million shares in the quarter for approximately $450 million at attractive prices. We drew down $380 million and remaining capacity of our term loan facility to bolster our liquidity. We availed ourselves of this inexpensive debt instrument, which would have otherwise expired in the coming quarter. And after the completion of the share repurchase program and the term loan facility draw, we are holding approximately $840 million in excess parent company cash. I'll turn now to our third topic, a discussion of our near-term outlook, starting with a description of the current dynamics of our industry. The business model, government managed care, particularly Medicaid, has been stress tested through extreme economic scenarios, including the financial crisis, the subsequent boom and now the effects of the world's worst pandemic in over 100 years. The model has proven to work in both robust economies and in deep recessions. In strong economic environments with low unemployment, there are relatively fewer Medicaid and subsidized Marketplace members, capitation rates tend to be on the strong side of actuarial soundness as state budgets are well funded. During challenging economic environments with high unemployment, there are relatively more Medicaid and subsidized Marketplace members, capitation rates tend to be on the lighter side of actuarial soundness as state's budgets become tighter. So while government managed care, particularly Medicaid, is certainly impacted by this environment, the business and financial model flexes to accommodate these unusual and sometimes extreme circumstances. In an extreme environment, like the one we are in today, government intervention is often required to provide rescue packages, backstop the healthcare system and the disadvantaged population. The current crisis is no exception, as Congress and The White House have stepped forward with a number of measures. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act includes additional assistance for state Medicaid programs in the form of an increase to the FMAP match. Each state has received a 6.2% increase, which will extend throughout the COVID-19 public health emergency declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. There have also been a number of legislative aid packages enacted, including the $2 trillion stimulus package and the additional $484 billion supplemental COVID-19 spending package referred to as Phase 3.5. These funds in various forms, have been made available to providers, small businesses, individuals and a number of other constituents which should ease the pressure on the healthcare system during this crisis, which indirectly should help the viability of Medicaid programs. In short, we have a stress-tested business model and significant government intervention designed to accelerate the economic recovery. But even in the presence of these very positive factors, which support a favorable outlook for the longer-term trajectory of the business, the near-term quarter-to-quarter outlook remains difficult to predict. This brings us to a discussion of our guidance for the remainder of 2020. Two overarching factors must be considered in providing guidance in this environment. First, we face a remarkably wide range of possible medical cost scenarios that could emerge over the next nine months. We have modeled many utilization scenarios for the balance of the year, all of which are plausible, but each of which produces dramatically different results. Second, we must consider the likelihood of a significant increase in membership as a direct result of widespread unemployment. With rising unemployment levels and the suspension of Medicaid eligibility redetermination in many states, we are now likely to experience a significant increase in combined Medicaid and Marketplace enrollment. But by how much? We do not yet know. These COVID-19 effects on medical cost and membership are widely expected to have a net positive effect on near-term earnings. However, we are not yet prepared to draw this conclusion based on the many variables and uncertainties that remain as managed care moves through the full course of the pandemic. We are, however, prepared to state that we view our original 2020 plan in our previously announced guidance with enhanced confidence. Accordingly, we are reaffirming our full year earnings per diluted share guidance range of $11.20 to $11.70. Let me briefly walk through the thought process that supports our guidance. With respect to medical costs, at this point, we cannot predict with any degree of precision how the COVID-19 situation will impact medical costs in 2020 for a variety of reasons. First, the level of future-direct COVID-19-related costs is not yet estimable, as the incidence rate of diagnosis and hospital admission and the related cost per episode remain unclear. We observed a steep decline in elective medical procedures very late in the first quarter, through the month of April, but we do not know how long this phenomenon will persist and begin to normalize. The prevailing expectation is that discretionary utilization could be very low for the second quarter and perhaps beyond, but then rebound quickly in the second half as COVID-19 abates, and health system capacity frees up. And any potential short-term and nonrecurring benefit from lower utilization is partially limited by rebates we could be obligated to pay under applicable minimum MLR regulations. With respect to our administrative costs, our operating efficiencies are secure, and our operating leverage discipline is intact. There will continue to be G&A pressure, however, related to nonstandard operating protocols and the cost structure required to service any significant additional membership. Investment income will certainly be lower than our original forecast as money market and other maturing fixed income investments grow over into much lower-yielding instruments. We call two, that our portfolio is short dated, so the impact is rather immediate. Before the onset of COVID-19, we fully expected to achieve our membership guidance. With the unfolding unemployment levels and suspension of Medicaid eligibility redetermination, we are now likely to exceed that guidance. But by how much? We do not yet know. We have developed various models and scenarios based on macro and microeconomic factors, which produce widely different results. The eventual outcome will be influenced by several key factors, including unemployment levels, particularly in the lower wage services economy, availability of spousal coverage and COBRA uptake. The impact of these factors is likely to be greater in the economically sensitive Medicaid expansion sector. Relatedly, pre-COVID, we fully expected to achieve our premium revenue forecast for the year of $17.4 billion. Our previous membership forecast was achievable, and our rates were generally known. Now it seems likely we could exceed our revenue forecast, depending on the timing and extent of the additional membership we just discussed. The YourCare acquisition will be an additional source of growth when closed. I also note again that any potential upside to annual earnings if limited by rebates, we would be obligated to pay under applicable minimum MLR regulations. In addition to our compliance with such regulations, even if our MCRs come in lower than our own internal targets, with a mindfulness of our civic responsibilities, in order to address any unexpected imbalances, we could choose to reinvest some of that margin and provider based quality of care initiatives and additional benefits for our members, here in the communities where they live. While the current near-term economic environment is unpredictable, government managed care business has consistently shown very attractive growth characteristics with compelling free cash flow generation. We are in the right business at the right time to serve our members, support our state partners and move with confidence and conviction into the future. However, we also believe that making accurate and perhaps bold statements about our longer-term future makes little sense at this time. Accordingly, we have decided to postpone our May 28 Investor Day and perhaps later in the year. For now, we are strictly heads down doing the hard work we need to be doing. I turn now to the fourth and final area of commentary this morning, an update on the many activities relating to our pivot-to-growth strategy. Even with the extraordinary level of activity related to COVID-19, which is now our highest priority, we have not lost sight of our near-term focus on top line growth. Opportunities to enhance and expand our portfolio in a substantial and synergistic way occur infrequently. Last night, we announced just such an achievement as we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Magellan Complete Care, or MCC, from Magellan Health. This transaction caps nearly a year-long effort, long predating the COVID-19 crisis and delivers compelling benefits that will endure for years to come. A single bolt-on acquisition, we add businesses in three new states and three over lapsed states to our portfolio at a purchase price equal to approximately 30% of the target's revenue. Pro forma, newly expanded Molina Healthcare which surpassed the $20 billion mark in annual revenue. Let me briefly describe the businesses we purchased, their strategic fit with our portfolio and the resulting financial metrics. As of December 31, 2019, MCC served approximately, 155,000 members across six states, Virginia, Arizona, Massachusetts, New York, Florida and Wisconsin. Full year 2019 revenue was greater than $2.7 billion, and we project it to grow to $3 billion within two years. Magellan Complete Care comprises the following businesses : Full-service Medicaid in Virginia, a new state, full-service Medicaid in Arizona, also a new state, dual eligibles and Massachusetts branded senior whole health, again, a new state, managed long-term care and New York Metro area, branded senior whole health, a new geography, and two small businesses, one in Florida and one in Wisconsin. The addition of the MCC properties allows us to apply our previously demonstrated operating excellence to bring these businesses to our target margins, harvest the full benefit of fixed cost leverage by adding more revenue with little additional fixed costs and launch Medicare and Marketplace in new Medicaid geographies. Turning to the financial metrics. The $820 million transaction, net of certain tax benefits, is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021. The purchase is funded entirely with cash on hand. We projected it will deliver returns well in excess of our cost of capital as our demonstrated operating capabilities puts us in a unique position to improve the margins of these businesses. As we move margins to our targets, deploy our enterprisewide platforms have the benefit of fixed cost leverage, we expect the acquisition to be accretive by approximately $0.50 to $0.75, cash earnings per diluted share in the first year of ownership and accreted by at least $1.75 in cash earnings per diluted share in the second year of ownership. These new additions to our portfolio demonstrate how carefully target M&A can accelerate our pivot to growth. With the addition of MCC, we will serve more than 3.6 million members in government-sponsored healthcare programs in 18 states. We will achieve enhanced geographic diversity, greater portfolio of depth, a meaningful addition of durable top line revenue. We will also be able to maintain continuity of care for MCC's members and stability for its state partners. These qualitative considerations have an added importance in the current environment and demonstrate our unwavering commitment to capably assist our government partners and bringing high-quality healthcare to individuals and families during this time of great need and into the future. Let me provide you with some additional highlights as it relates to our pivot-to-growth strategy. First, we terminated our agreement to purchase next level health due to the seller's stated unwillingness to close pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement. Second, in New Mexico, all legislative and political hurdles have been passed in connection with development of the first ever Indian managed care entity. We have been named as the exclusive manager of the managed care entity with the Navajo Nation. We stand poised and ready to serve the 75,000 Navajos eligible for Medicaid. Third, as previously announced, Texas canceled all of the new contracts associated with the STAR+ reprocurement awards, canceled the STAR chip RFP. The state has commented that it is not likely to reprocure this contract in the near term. And thus, we expect that our revenue base on this contract is secure at least through 2021. Fourth, we await the decision by the state of Kentucky on its Medicaid RFP, which we expect to be issued before the end of the second quarter. While Tennessee is the only state to specifically announce that it is postponing its RFP due to COVID-19, we believe there will be a general tendency by other states to also delay procurements until the COVID-19 crisis has abated. And finally, in our continued efforts to shape our business portfolio to optimize value, we have decided to sell our Puerto Rico Medicaid business. In doing so, we will work closely with the regulatory authorities and the provider community to ensure that our members in Puerto Rico are not disrupted and have reliable continuity of care. Now some concluding remarks. I hope it is clear to all that during this time, our members and customers are going to make requests of us to do the extraordinary. Our philosophy is to provide the health first and ask questions later. We trust that we will be adequately rewarded for the work we do and the services we provide. Although in this environment, we expect some nontraditional protocols to be invoked. This philosophy is not incongruent with shareholder friendliness at all. In fact, it is the epitome of a prudent environmental, social and governance philosophy, and the pillar of long-term business sustainability. We will fulfill our moral, civic and patriated duty, and we will emerge from this an even stronger company. Not only are we proving to be flexible and adaptable in this changing environment, but we will make sure our performance during this challenge, enhances our growing reputation among our existing customers and potential new customers alike, as a go-to resource in government-sponsored managed care. Before I turn the call over to Tom, I want to recognize our management team and the entire Molina community. During this unprecedented time, our team, 10,000 strong, has worked tirelessly to ensure that the needs of all of our constituencies continue to be addressed quickly and effectively. The true highlight of the quarter was the performance of our entire workforce and their rapid operational and clinical response across every dimension of the healthcare ecosystem, truly inspirational. They never lost sight of the members and the state partners who are counting on us to deliver whatever the challenge. Now I will turn the call over to Tom Tran for more detail on the financials. Tom? Tom Tran : Thank you, Joe. This morning, I am going to provide some details on our first quarter results, provide additional insight into COVID-19's impact on our medical costs, and then I will provide more color on our 2020 guidance. So let me start with the quarter. Premium revenue for the first quarter of 2020 increased 8.9% to $4.3 billion compared to the first quarter of 2019, primarily due to rate increase in our Medicaid and Medicare lines of business. The consolidated MCR for the first quarter of 2020 increased to 86.3% compared to 85.3% for the first quarter of 2019. While prior year's reserve development in the first quarter of 2020 was negligible, the MCR in the first quarter of 2019 was positively impacted by approximately 140 basis points of favorable reserve development. The increase in the MCR in the first quarter of 2020 also reflects the increase in marketplace MCR. Now for some details on our results by line of business. In the Medicaid business, the MCR in the quarter was 88.9% compared to 88.5% in the first quarter of 2019. Our Medicaid performance for the first quarter of 2020 was solid. As we continue to manage medical costs, harvest the benefits of our payment integrity and utilization management protocols and attained risk score commensurate with the profiles of our members. In addition, the MCR in the prior year quarter was positively impact by the aforementioned favorable reserve development. The impact of COVID-19 on medical costs in the first quarter of 2020 was not significant. We experienced medical cost pressure in the Medicaid line of business early in the quarter, resulting from slightly higher-than-normal seasonal flu combined with early but lastly undetected COVID-19 costs, diagnosed as severe respiratory illness and pneumonia. We also experienced increased pharmacy costs in the quarters as members refuel the chronic medications in advance of the height of the crisis. This increased costs were offset by lower medical care costs in all lines of business very late in the quarter, as elective and discretionary healthcare services began to be postponed and deferred. In the Medicare business, the MCR for the first quarter of 2020 was 81.7% compared to 84.7%, in the first quarter of 2019, due to rate increase and higher quality incentive revenues. Finally, in the Marketplace business, the MCR for the first quarter of 2020 was 72.3% compared to 52.2% for the first quarter of 2019, which was mainly attributable to our lowering price in 2020 in an effort to be more competitive. The G&A ratio for the first quarter of 2020 improved to 7% compared to 7.3% in the first quarter of 2019, primarily related to increased revenues and positive operating leverage. The G&A for the quarter reflects approximately $6 million of incremental expense associated with the mobilization of our employees to work at home, along with other operational protocols associated with COVID-19. Now on to COVID. Let me offer some additional insights, but recognize that this picture is unfolding in real time. Some statistics, as we sit here today. Through April 27, we had a total of 950 members hospitalized with COVID-19, based on early data, the average length of stay is approximately 10 days, and there is no statistically credible cost per episode yet. In terms of geography, the health lands most impacted by COVID-19 are Washington, California and Michigan. While Washington was the first state impacted, Michigan has experienced the highest number of cases. While many of our states are estimated to have peaked, some have not. In proportion to our membership by line of business, Medicare has the highest percentage of incidents, followed by Medicaid and then Marketplace. Lastly, we experienced a steep decline in elective medical procedures beginning very late in March, which has continued through the month of April. Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters, and our reserve position remains strong. Days in claim payable represents 49 days of medical cost expense compared to 50 days in the fourth quarter of 2019. Operating cash flow for the first quarter of 2020 was $136 million, with the change from the first quarter of 2019, primarily due to the timing of government payments and accelerated payments to providers. As of March 31, 2020, our health plans had total statutory capital and surplus of approximately $2 billion, which equates to approximately 347% of risk-based capital. Turning now to our 2020 guidance. We have reaffirmed our full year 2020 earnings guidance range of $11.20 to $11.70 per diluted share. First, let me walk through what is included in our full year guidance. Net investment income will experience headwinds in due to lower yields. We factor this in our guidance, and we expect it to be approximately $0.27 per share of headwind for the full year. Incremental G&A expenses related to COVID-19 for the balance of 2020 have also been considered. Now let me walk through what is excluded from our full year guidance. We recognize that rising unemployment levels are likely to result in an increase in Medicaid and Marketplace enrollment. However, we do not know the magnitude or timing and therefore, membership increase related to COVID-19 are excluded from our full year 2020 guidance. Due to uncertainty of COVID-19's impact on utilization and medical costs, its impact on net medical costs is excluded from full year 2020 guidance. I will also note that our full year 2020 guidance does not include the impact from previously announced acquisitions that have not yet closed. While the timing, duration and severity of COVID-19's impact on our financial metrics and earnings on an intra-quarter basis and throughout the rest of the year is not entirely predictable, we believe this is the most reasonable approach to providing guidance for the full year of 2020. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks, good morning, Joe, can you talk a little bit about the Magellan acquisition in terms of where you see margins along the trajectory of the of the accretion analysis? So where do you expect margins to be at the end of year one and year two to get to that accretion number? Joe Zubretsky : Sure, Justin. Let me I'll make sure I frame the deal first. This is right out of our playbook. And the way we think about this is this is sort of six bolt-on and tuck-in acquisitions all bundled into one. And as you know, what we've said many times, is we look for acquisitions that have stable membership, stable revenue flows and if they're underperforming, we certainly will bring to bear our operational excellence discipline and rigor in order to improve margins. So the way we look at this is you've seen the numbers. They are slightly profitable in the aggregate, approximately a 1% EBITDA margin. As you know, we've averaged about 6% or 6.5% EBITDA margins in the last couple of years. And if you can then pack on positive operating leverage, because we're not going to increase the fixed cost base of running our enterprise when we take these on, you can easily see how we got to the $0.50 to $0.75 of accretion in the first full year of ownership and at least $1.75 of cash earnings per share accretion in the second full year of ownership. So in the first year of ownership, we will most likely operate on their cost structure as integration activities take place. In year two, we will be migrating to the Molina cost structure, both our G&A platforms and the impact of payment integrity, utilization, management and risk or quality will begin to improve the medical cost ratios. And sometime in year three, we should reach the margins that we enjoy today in the moving of portfolio. Does that help? Justin Lake : Yes. That's really helpful, Joe. And then if I could just ask one more on cash. You talked about, I think, $840 million coming out of the quarter. Can you walk us through the moving parts for the rest of the year in terms of dividends from the subs, etc? And where you expect to end the year from a cash perspective as well as a leverage perspective? Joe Zubretsky : Sure, Justin. Well, yes, we ended the quarter with $840 million of free and clear cash at the parent company. If we achieve our earnings guidance for the year, we can project we project to extract approximately $500 million of ordinary dividends from our operating subs. That could be higher if we're able to get extraordinary dividends. Bear in mind, we have a $500 million untapped revolver. And in connection with this transaction, we topped up that revolver with a short-term facility of an additional $400 million. So to recap, $840 million of cash, our projection of extracting at least $500 million of ordinary dividends during the balance of 2020 and then two untapped facilities which aggregate to $900 million of debt capacity. I'll also remind the group that our high-yield debt is trading really well right now. And that we believe we have really good access to the high-yield market if we wanted to make any of this financing permanent. So that's the cash flow story. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Fidel of Stephens. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel : Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone. First question, just wanted to ask on MCC and clearly, significant margin improvement opportunity. I think that is embedded in that deal for you. Interested what you're thinking in terms of what you can do to also accelerate top line growth from the MCC assets as well. And specifically, maybe thinking about the three new states, that you'll be entering. How could this potentially sort of tap into additional business-line opportunities for you and then in some of the other tap-on products that you'll be adding from this? Joe Zubretsky : Sure, Scott. There actually is an embedded growth rate in the acquired portfolio itself. The Arizona full-service Medicaid contract is at its very early stages. If I remember correctly, about 13,000 members at the end of the year with approximately $80 million in revenue. That's projected to achieve a membership of 75,000 to 80,000 over the next year. Because it enjoys a preferred position in the auto assignment algorithm in the state. So there's an inherent growth rate due to the Arizona property. And the point the second point you make is spot on. As you know, our strategy is to take our full product line and penetrate it into our Medicaid footprint. And now that we have a new Medicaid footprint in Arizona and in Virginia, we absolutely plan to launch a DSNP product in our Marketplace product in those geographies. And then, of course, just being in the boroughs in Westchester in New York city, gives you plenty of opportunities to look for bolt-on other bolt-on opportunities in the city and to perhaps grow the business. As you know, right now, we're in upstate New York. And don't have a produce in downstate New York. But this gives us plenty of opportunity to think more broadly about how to participate in Metro New York. Scott Fidel : Got it. And then just my follow-up question. I understand that you're just hesitant right now to build in anything on revs or enrollment from rising unemployment. Just interested if you can maybe just give us a little insight into maybe just what you've seen so far in April. Possibly in the Medicaid and the Marketplace exchange lines, especially given states relaxing redetermination reviews? Joe Zubretsky : Sure. I'm going to break with tradition air a little bit. You tend not to talk about what's going on in the current quarter, but this is an unusual time. And the points you mentioned are really, really important to pretend what could happen to membership. First thing I would point to is before talking about April, for the first time in many, many quarters, maybe even since I got here, we actually had membership growth in Medicaid sequentially March 31 over the end of the year. Good growth in Washington, Michigan, held steady, good growth in Illinois, offset by some losses in Puerto Rico. So our efforts to work with providers to keep more members in the system and to bring on more members are pushed to make sure that in the redetermination and re-eligibility process that we hold on to more members is starting to work. Pushing that forward now to the direct question you asked, it's even looking better in April. Our Medicaid membership is likely to be up over 30,000 members just in the month of April. And the interesting point I will make is we believe we're pretty sure that none of that membership arrived as a result of accelerated in the surge in unemployment. It's too soon to see people that became unemployed in March, end up in managed Medicaid. So we believe that the 30,000 growth in April is truly due to the suspension of eligibility of determination in the states. And without that churn, you're just not going to lose the members. They stay longer, they stick longer. And as you know, many states actually have suspended redetermination, and some have even announced perhaps even for a full year. So that really sort of pretends well for the membership growth before the surge due to unemployment actually arrived, which is likely to in May and beyond. Does that help? Operator : The next question today comes from Kevin Fishbeck of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Fishbeck : Thanks. I was just wondering what you think the MLR might be on these new members coming into the Medicaid and to the exchange programs. I guess last recession, we did see some heads up demand initially on the new medicated lives. And just thinking about whether you expect that to happen. And on the Medicaid side, if these patients are members or people who would have been on COBRA, you expect any adverse MLR there? Joe Zubretsky : Yes, we have various views on it. I mean I think basically, and I think it's generally you say that if somebody needs insurance, they buy it. And if they don't, they won't. So there's just sort of an inherent bias, adverse selection bias in the whole process. We actually have various scenarios, some of which might say that there's higher acuity coming in through membership and some say that it will be on par with what we have. It's hard to say and where the number is coming from. Are they coming from a very rich self-insured plan and a big company? Or are they coming from a small group plan for a small business? So it's really hard to say right now, which is obviously one of the reasons why we're reluctant to predict what this surgeon membership brings. We'll see a surge on membership. We have to build the operational platforms and hire the people to service that membership and then as you suggested, the acuity of that membership is unknown. But I think the prevailing wisdom is, while it might be slightly better and worse than the average, that's not going to be a significant factor in taking on these members. Kevin Fishbeck : All right. Great. And then when I look at your guidance, you're excluding a number of things from your guidance, but I see that pretty much all of them are the things that are most be positive than they are to be negative. Is there anything negative, really, I guess, that is not included in guidance or has the potential to be a significant negative? Joe Zubretsky : If understand your question correctly. The two factors that we updated in our guidance are one that's sort of easy to understand and engage. And that is our portfolio is going to roll over into lower-yielding investments. It's irrefutable and already happening. And I think Tom pitched that as a $27 earnings per share $0.27 earnings per share headwind in our guidance. We also believe putting the accelerated membership aside that we will incur higher SG&A related to COVID operational protocols, financial assistance to our employees, etc, which also we factored into our the reaffirmation of our guidance, but we did not update for anything else. Kevin Fishbeck : Yes, that's what I'm saying. I'm saying you reaffirmed guidance, we're including some negative thing. You're actually getting a lot of the members, executing the deals and these things all seem like they're actually going to be upside to the number. So though it seems like there's going to be some upside to the number. I just want to know if there's anything else that you're excluding that you think might be the opposite way of the counteract or it's really just conservatism? Joe Zubretsky : No. It's basically just saying the production of core earnings just got a little better, but we did not factor in any of those COVID-19 impacts. But yes, with those headwinds, we're saying core earnings gets a little stronger. Kevin Fishbeck : It's great, thanks. Operator : The next question today comes from Gary Taylor of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Gary Taylor : Hi, good morning. I had two quick questions. The first one, I just want to go back to, Joe, your comments about Medicaid MLRs? I know there's also some states with pre-tax caps, but sort of the curves on how low MLR could effectively go and flow through earnings. So certainly, we understand that those exist. I guess the question is, on a state basis, are those all typically just calculate on the state fiscal or calendar year. There's no rolling period like there are in some of the federal minimum MLR requirements. Joe Zubretsky : Yes, Gary, that's my understanding. And there's very few adjustments like in the Marketplace MLR where taxes and all these other factors create a dramatic difference between the regulatory minimum and what you publish in your financials. But yes, seven of our 14 states have some form of MLR floor, ranging from 85% to 86%, except Puerto Rico, which is 92%. Those also exist in the expansion population and exist in the ABD business, but usually at different rates. So yes, there are very few adjustments from what you publish, and the minimum. And by understanding is they work on a one year fiscal year basis, not a rolling basis. Gary Taylor : And my second question is you talked about 950 members hospitalized with COVID-19, no statistically credible cost per case. So I guess two questions. One, are those are the provider revenue cycle claim submissions being materially delayed? And then secondly, I thought most of your contracts in Medicaid would pay on a DRG basis, are you saying you're just not seeing the DRG coding yet? Or is there enough complexity to sort of outlier payments on outlier length of stay cases that dedicating all that still doesn't give you a good sense of the numbers yet? Joe Zubretsky : No, it's actually not that complicated. Again, 1,000 cases, so you can't draw any statistical credibility to that. We have five day stays, and we have one month stays. We have people in the ICU on ventilators and people that go in and go out. Cost range from $10,000 per episode to $100,000 per episode. But we're now capturing all the codes. And I think while Tom was suggesting in his prepared remarks was early in the quarter we are getting tagged with all types of respiratory elements, particularly in Washington and California. This was before COVID was a phenomenon. And we've hindsight and better information now, we have attributed that, and it has been attributed to COVID-19 actually showing up in Washington and California far before anybody actually thought it was. But no, there's no intrigue around how we're getting billed and coded for these things with only 1,000 data points, as I said, it's hard to draw any statistical conclusions. On your other point, we are not seeing any dramatic change in the administrative aspects of our provider dealings. We are seeing a drop in pre-authorizations, and claim submissions just because of the elected procedure deferrals. But there has not been a huge disruption in either the level of payments and the level of submissions that we've observed to date, that could change here over the next couple of months. Gary Taylor : Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Matthew Borsch of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Matthew Borsch : Yes, sir. Thank you. I was hoping you might comment on how you're thinking about the changes in enrollment trajectory over time. I realize that probably a number of scenarios you're looking at for how this recession plays out. But for lack of a better metric, I mean, do you think comparing with sort of duration and gap for 2008, 2009, it's the broad side of the barn? Joe Zubretsky : Sure. Well, Matt, all of you have seen all of the different pundits and think tanks project what this might look like with unemployment scenarios ranging from 10%, 20%, even up to 30% with Medicaid roles expanding anywhere from 10 million to 30 million members. A very wide range of results. I think as we said in our prepared remarks, there are lots of factors to consider here. Number one, COBRA used to be a rather significant factor in how many members would come in. But now with subsidized Marketplace, you could argue that there will be more members attracted to the subsidized Marketplace which might be the 102% of premium that COBRA charges. So there's all types of phenomenon. Even on the unemployment rate, we have to look at subsectors of the economy. We're looking at the lower wage service economy. And I believe that's not going to come back quickly. That sandwich shop, that drycleaner shop, that coffee shop, these small businesses are going to struggle to get back into business. And we think that the lower-wages service economy will remain have higher unemployment rates for a longer period of time than perhaps the higher-wage sector of the economy. So if you take our market share, if you do a projection of unemployment in all of our states, ranging from 10% to 20%, look at our market shares, in Washington, it's 50%. In most states, it ranges from 5% to 25%, 9% on average. You can actually craft a scenario where the membership peaks at a pretty significant number. As unemployment softens, some of that goes back. But I think there's a permanent delta here on that lower-end service economy that's going to struggle to get back into business quickly. Matthew Borsch : Yes, that brings up a very closely related question, which is, again, we're shooting the dark here. But would you predict we might see some structural changes in how healthcare coverage is handled at the small group and particularly the lower end of the small group, maybe lower wage end of the spectrum, given it's been volatile for a while, and now it's even more volatile. Joe Zubretsky : It's a good question. I say during the all the swirl and the activity around this, I hadn't given that much thought. But the way we look at it is we now do have a product suite that works all the way up to 400% of federal poverty level when you think about it. So when we have Medicaid expansion in a variety of states, up to 138 then we have a highly subsidized Marketplace up into the 200, 250 range. We have products that the population can buy all the way up to that level. And so it would seem that we have the product suite, both commercial and government-sponsored that we need to satisfy the population. I hadn't given your specific question, a lot of thought during all this, but I will do so and get back to you on that. Matthew Borsch : Thank you. Joe Zubretsky : You're welcome. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Raskin of Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Josh Raskin : You're asking. Your line is live. Perhaps, your line is muted. Sorry about that. Sorry I was on mute question around the exchanges. And I know it's early, but sort of April application processes and things that are coming in. I'm just trying to get a sense of as individuals move from the commercial markets into whether it's Medicaid or Marketplace. Sort of where do you think the magnitude of impact is going to be? And again, is there any data that you're seeing on Marketplace applications to date, that would be helpful. Joe Zubretsky : Right. We are seeing, I'd say, at this early stage, given that April data I was speaking about, we haven't seen Marketplace growth yet. But we have seen a slowing in the natural attrition rate. As we said at the beginning of the year when we gave our Marketplace forecast, we have reduced our attrition rate outlook to 1%, 1.5% a month. Which would suggest 3,000 to 4,500 members, that is slowing. We believe membership will start growing again here very soon. The point I was making before, I think, is the important one. Is that COBRA charges 102% of the full premium? And we believe, based on all the models we've looked at, that a highly or even reasonably sized subsidy in the Marketplace products, silver product, let's say, beats 102% of commercial all the time. And so we're likely to see more uptake in the Marketplace than maybe in past recessions when the Marketplace actually didn't exist. So now that it does exist, I think it's going to be the net beneficiary of folks who come out of commercial plans. And find that highly subsidized Marketplace product beat staying on COBRA. Josh Raskin : And Joe, just to follow-up on that point. Is it fair to assume that I know you talked about some of the adverse selection bias in processes like this where people buy insurance if they need it. But in this situation, isn't it fair to assume that COBRA, those remaining on COBRA are going to be ones that are more focused on continuity of care and have chronic needs and things like that? Are you assuming that the Marketplace membership may actually have a positive bias? Joe Zubretsky : Well, I think that's an excellent point. Generally speaking, if you're in the middle of some kind of expensive treatment protocol or our chronic member on expensive drugs, you just don't move because you're happy with what you have. But as you know, COBRA has unlimited life, and those members have to go somewhere eventually. Right now, we're not assuming anything other than we're building the infrastructure to make sure we can handle the influx of members. Jason Dees, who runs our Marketplace business, is very mindful of how do we capture really risk scores and risk profile in these members. So we know when we get them, how to treat them, how to get them into care plans, etc. So very early stages. I don't have any more thought on it than what I just gave you. Josh Raskin : And just one quick call on the revenue guidance, is there an assumption of pass-through revenues that are going to be coming through? Or is that in the bucket of COVID impact that we're not anticipating? Joe Zubretsky : I'm not sure I understand are you referring to a Medicaid? And I'm not sure what you're referring to exactly, Josh. Josh Raskin : Yes, Medicaid payments where you're going to see increases to the provider fee schedule they get passed through in terms of Medicaid. Joe Zubretsky : I think it's possible. I will answer the question more broadly. Most of our state customers are very concerned with the viability of various aspects of the medical communities in their states. And whether it's going to be enhancements to the fee schedule request, as you've seen, to pay claims faster, in some cases, even advanced payments to small providers, they are very focused on the health of the provider system. But we have not seen yet, from what I've been exposed to, any major changes to fee schedules. But there are many conversations ongoing about how to keep the providers funded during this entire process. Josh Raskin : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Sarah James of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Sarah James : Thank you. I wanted to circle back to your comments that in a strong economy, Medicaid rates are set at the high end of actuarial soundness and in the recession, will be set at the low side. Can you give us more detail what is that meaningful margins when you think about the peak to trough move? Joe Zubretsky : I think the first thing I would say, Sarah, is we put a lot of faith in the concept of actuarial soundness, there's ebbs and flows. There's constant tension when benefits are carved in, when the benefits are carved out, when new populations are attempted to be capitated. There's a constant ebb and flow. And the only point we are making is if from a business model perspective, you would expect that in very strong economies when tax revenues are flowing, that rates would be on the strong side of actual soundness and the opposite could be true when tax revenues are down, in terms of recession. But the concept of actuarial soundness has proven in this industry. It's proven in the years that I've been here as testament to the margins that we're achieving. There are ebbs and flows. And all I'm suggesting is that in a recession, we could expect rates to be on the softer side of the actuarial soundness concept. But we still have not changed our outlook for our target margins, but a lot needs to be seen here in terms of what trend figures are going to be baked into the 2021 rates. Are we going to use normalized trends off of 2019? So when trend is inflecting the way it is, I think the bigger issue is when trend is inflecting up and down the way it is, how are the actuarial teams and our state customers and the actuarial teams of the managed care industry going to reconcile the various views of medical cost trend when we go to look at 2021 rates. But all that being said, I have a lot of faith and confidence in the actuarial soundness concept because it's actually worked well for managed Medicaid. Sarah James : That's very helpful and comforting given how strong the relationship is with the state actuaries as medical trend does change. So just one more follow-up there. You mentioned that one of the possibilities could be items being carved in and carved out. Can you provide us any color on your discussions with states on how they're viewing the shape of their program, given where their budgets may be? Joe Zubretsky : Sure. The one aspect of managed care and medical cost in managed care that comes to mind in your specific question is related to pharmacy. As you know, that is commonly discussed as to either be carved in or carved out. As you probably saw in the New York state budgetary process that was just finalized they have suggested that at some point in the future, New York State could carve out pharmacy. Obviously, not terribly material for us with a $200 million business there, but carving in and carving out is actually, in my view, more of a question of how much rate how much capitated rate do they put in or take out. We'd rather see it bundled into the full capitation and have more revenue. But if it's carved out, it's if they carve out on an unsubsidized basis, you lose your 2% margin on what's carved out and that's it. So you just you hope through the negotiating process that the proper amount of capitated rate is either carved in or carved out. That's the issue, in my opinion. Operator : The next question comes from George Hill of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : Yeah, good morning, guys and thanks for taking the questions a lot been covered. A lot has been covered. I guess, Joe, kind of a follow-up on the Magellan deals. As you think about the M&A environment, do you expect kind of the current environment that we're going into now to kind of make M&A more difficult or less difficult trying to figure out if people are targeting Medicaid enrollment to kind of defend smaller businesses and smaller plants, making them harder to acquire? Or could people see this as an opportunity to exit? And I have a quick follow-up for Tom. Joe Zubretsky : Interesting question. I think most of the investment banking community would tell you that in the past couple of weeks or months, that many of in-flight processes have stalled. This one's been going on for some time. And so it was able to get done with great cooperation from the guys from Magellan, and the teams worked well together. It's hard to say. I think this business is a tough business. And we look at some of the smaller players, the not for profits, the single state players, it's hard to get the operating leverage, the scale, the clinical resources you need to actually do a good job. It's just a tough business. But when this is all you do, and you have 3.5 million members and $20 billion of revenue, we certainly have the investable base, the skills and resources to be well here. So buying underperforming properties at 30% of revenue, getting the EBITDA margins up to 6%, 6.5%, that is a great use of our resources and our skills. Particularly when they're funded with cash that's generated from core operations, and we don't have to go to the equity markets or even the debt markets to fund them. So here in the foreseeable future. Obviously, we're going to be working on the regulatory process with Magellan, then we'll be integrating it. But we're still going to look for these single area bolt-on, tuck-in opportunities like the YourCare acquisition, which is fabulous for us. We're going to continue to look for them because we actually have the cash flow to action on them if they're actionable. George Hill : That's helpful. And I guess, Tom, my quick follow-up for you is an accounting one, which is I know it's early, but if we start to think about the contracts where you guys have MLR minimums. I imagine at some point you'll have to reserve against revenue or have contra revenue accounts for what could be premium rebates or premium holidays. Have you guys started to do that yet? And is it too early to think about or discuss what the magnitude of that could look like? Tom Tran : Good question there. And we do that consistently every quarter. As you know, in our marketplace, we have to provide reserve for potential rebate based on certain forecasting of the eventual medical care ratio. And we do the same thing for our Medicare line of business. And we will be doing the same thing for Medicaid, should that happen to be the situation. George Hill : Okay. But I guess, no way to kind of quantify what the incremental could look like from normal versus kind of what we're stepping into the next couple of quarters? Tom Tran : No. No. As we said in our prepared remarks, the volatility of this impact on from COVID on the impact on medical costs is unknown. That's why we hesitate to provide more color on that. So we'll have to let this thing play out over the next couple of quarters. And it's typically done based on either a calendar year or contract year depending on how the state prescribed that. Operator : The next question comes from Dave Windley of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dave Windley : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Joe, you always have a great ability to cut right to the chase. My question is around operating Medicaid managed care organization in a COVID environment, thinking about a couple of transactions you now have in-flight that include New York operations at the center of COVID. So just interested in kind of understanding how you might see the future change in one's ability, the risks and opportunities in managing a plan in a cohort effected environment given that you seem willing to step right into the epicenter with both of these acquisitions, YourCare and MCC having significant operations in New York. Joe Zubretsky : Thanks for the question. It's look, it's a challenge. We moved 6,000 people from working in office to working at home. There are, as I said, hundreds of requests we're getting from regulators every day to do certain things. That requires you have to reconfigure your provider contracts. I mean the operating protocols and the amount of operational change that we're going through right now and dealing with all this is significant. But in New York, our business is in upstate New York, which is not the epicenter of COVID, but certainly is being impacted. The MLTSS business in New York is a good business. We managed $2 billion of LTSS benefits nationwide. I think we're the largest or the second largest manager of LTSS benefits. So it fits nicely with the portfolio. It's really it's not a medical business, per se. It's a business where we cater to the activities of daily living to pretty complex members under the Medicaid program. But it's a good business. It's got seven over $700 million in revenue. It's reasonably profitable. We think we can enhance the profitability by managing the hours more effectively. But COVID-19 was certainly a consideration as we actioned it. But we're either COVID-19 will either have abated by the time we own it or be so well understood and well managed, that it will be the new normal. So it was a consideration, but it did not deter us from wanting that property and including it in the purchase. Dave Windley : Great. On exchange, you commented that you haven't really seen a material change in trajectory on membership there. Maybe that changes. Does that influence the what is likely to happen this year, influence the way that you will address your growth strategy in that business for 2021 after the 2020 kind of positioning didn't pan out as you thought it would? Joe Zubretsky : It's a very good point. I will expect in the question, I will reiterate that our strategy hasn't changed. We had committed to growing the pool of profits of the exchange business. And had articulated that we will make the local geographic call as to where to push price for gaining membership and where it ease on or where to push price to gain members push price down to game membership, and we're ease up on it to gain margin and make local decisions based on competitive forces. And obviously, as you suggested, and admittedly, we got the elasticity of demand equation long last year. The bigger issue for us. So the strategy hasn't changed. We're going to take the full profits and attempt to grow it over time at reasonable margins. The rent that's been thrown into the works, obviously, is coded. Right now, as we sit here today, we're developing the pricing model for 2021. They're off of the 2019 baseline, which is pure of COVID. But the question will really be, what type of rates go into the market for 2021, given the COVID environment that we're in right now? So our belief is that in discussions with regulators, allowances will be made for maybe some later rate filings, maybe rate filings that include COVID and others that don't. Allow us to see more so that we can take a reasonable view of medical cost trend, getting into the rate so that we're not guessing, and the industry is not guessing. We don't want to push so much rate into the market that we have excess margins, and we certainly don't want to undercut it to where margins are too low. We want to get it right. So we're working with the regulators right now on the pricing regimen for 2021. Dave Windley : Got it. One last one, if I could. What level of cash do you want to have liquidity, do you want to have to run the business? And are you willing to add more leverage in this environment? Joe Zubretsky : Our leverage position is very strong, and I would encourage people not to look at our debt to total cap, which averages 40% to 45%, I think, it's 46% at the end of the quarter. Because that generally just sounds high to people. Our debt-to-EBITDA coverage is 1 :1. Our leverage is 1 :1. Our fixed interest cost coverage is like three weeks of earnings. We've covered our fixed charges and interest. So we're actually underlevered from a cash flow perspective. Having said that, in this environment, you always want to be more liquid than you otherwise would, but with $840 million of cash, $500 million of dividends expected this year, $900 million of untapped facilities, we believe we still have enough cash and enough liquidity cushion that have another bolt-on acquisition opportunity came up this month, next month or next quarter, we'd be able to action it. But in this environment, you want to be a little more liquid than normal. We usually target $100 million of parent company cash as a floor, and we'd probably think slightly higher than that in this environment Operator : The next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley.. Unidentified Analyst : This is Alex [ph] actually in for Ricky. First question, I just have two. One is just following up on George's question about M&A. So you talked about how Magellan is kind of a year-long for to close so could you give some color just on the typical time line to get your deals ready to announce? And how many kind of companies that you're looking at, at any given time? Joe Zubretsky : Well, without getting into the process because that's we don't really want to do that. But the point what we wanted to make was that this efforts or long predated coped when the process started. And that was the only point we're really making. But willing buyer, willing seller, it's hard. There's a lot of properties out there, and many of them aren't actionable. But getting something that strategically fits from a product and geography perspective, and then one that's actionable is hard work. We have an expert M&A group, led by Mark Keim and a great team of people who are scanning the universe for actionable opportunities that fit with the portfolio and that are actionable. And last year, we found YourCare, we found NextLevel, but we obviously terminated our agreement with the NextLevel for very good reasons. And then this opportunity came into the market, and we worked it really, really hard with great cooperation from the folks from Magellan. There are others in the pipeline. I can't mention what they are and where they are, but there are still properties out there that are actionable, and we still have the liquidity and the resources to action them if, in fact, they come to market and can be actioned. Unidentified Analyst : That's helpful. And then just on the deferred elective care side. We've heard ranges over the last week, about 15% to 40% of total medical costs are associated with elective care. Is there anything that you can give us on how your elective costs compare to your book? Joe Zubretsky : Sure. It's hard to draw any conclusions from two weeks in March, but we certainly could draw conclusions from the full month of April. On the outpatient and professional services side, outpatient and ambulatory surgeries, depending on the geography line of business, pre authorization requests and notifications down 30% to 50%. Diagnostic testing and imaging, another sort of elective category, 40% to 45% PCP referrals to specialists, DNA, all down significantly over comparable periods. We're a seeing it on the inpatient side, particularly with elective surgeries and even in behavioral services. So in the medical cost categories that tend to be elective and discretionary we're seeing pre authorization requests and notifications down significantly over comparable periods. The other point I would make here is how long does this persist? There are various mandates of the suspension of elective procedures. That can't be done under either state authority or governmental authority that will end soon at some point. But there will be a contagion of fear of patient fear of going into facilities for the risk of being infected. So how fast they rebound, how fast the boomerang effect and when they come back, is another factor and why predicting what medical costs look like here over the next three to six months is difficult. I remind everyone, when we're talking about the rebound factor is there's a capacity limitation on how fast things can rebound. There are only so many beds. There are only so many doctors, and there's only so many hours in a day. And when you have three, four, five or even six months of pent-up demand, it cannot race through the pipe that quickly. There's a capacity limitation on how fast it rebounds, which adds another variable into forecasting how quickly this could rebound. So I hope that helps, but that's sort of a view of what March and April looked like from an elective and discretionary procedure outlook. Operator : The next question comes from Charles Rhyee of Cowen. Please go ahead. Charles Rhyee : Yeah, thanks for taking quite not just to make just maybe two quick questions for me here. Joe, you talked about potential delays of decisions. But you still said you expected Kentucky sometime in the second quarter. So are you still expecting Kentucky to make a decision in the second quarter? Or do you think that is upward delay? Joe Zubretsky : We've been told that actually, we were told month of May, but we wanted to just open it up in the second quarter because we just weren't sure. But we've actually originally, they actually posted that they were going to do it in April and then due to COVID-19, they actually then pushed it. And whether it's actually published in writing or they made an announcement, I can't recall. But they did say May, but we sort of opened it up and said sometime in the second quarter. So we haven't heard about a suspension. And until we hear otherwise, we still expect the second quarter announcement. Charles Rhyee : Great. And then, Joe, at the beginning, you kind of also mentioned about some of the things you are doing for your members, including opening access for Telehealth. And we saw the announcement, obviously, several weeks back about using Teledoc. Can you just help us understand a little bit how Telehealth is priced for a Medicaid population when you extend it to your members? Is that should we think about it in the same way as for commercial population that the members are paying some dollar visit fee? Or is that something that you guys include in sort of the overall cost that you're charging to state? Joe Zubretsky : The first thing I would say to that is in our company, our Telehealth solution is more fully implemented in our Marketplace product than it is in our Medicaid product. It is beginning to be rolled out in our Medicaid product. And obviously, this accelerated the rollout because it was the right thing to do and members couldn't get in person visits. As we said in our prepared remarks, we created a parity mechanism between in-person visits and Telehealth visits. But I wouldn't want to say how it's priced, but it's more penetrated as we're searching for in our Marketplace book, than our Medicaid book. And we have a contract, we pay for it, and it's loaded in the benefit, is really all I can say. Charles Rhyee : I understand that. I mean I guess, is there a cost sharing then? Do members pay some amount to access it like they would in a commercial population? In a more typical commercial population? Or is it done differently? I guess... Joe Zubretsky : Well, generally, in Medicaid, the members are not paying anything out of pocket for any service. So in Medicaid, the answer is no. And I believe I'll project this and get back to you. But in Marketplace, it's probably like any other claim payment. If somebody's decided they're deductible, it gets treated that way. If there's a co-pay whatever the benefit plan is, I think it gets treated just like another claim pursuant to the benefit structure of the contract. Charles Rhyee : Okay, thanks, that's it. Really helpful. Joe Zubretsky : Thank you. Operator : As there are no further questions, this does conclude our question-and-answer session. The conference has now also concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Trudell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Molina Healthcare. Please go ahead. Julie Trudell : Good morning and welcome to Molina Healthcare's second quarter 2020 earnings call. Joining me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Tom Tran. A press release announcing our second quarter earnings was distributed yesterday after the market closed and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of the call, a replay of this call will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that the remarks made herein are as of today Friday, July 31, 2020, and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. In this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our second quarter 2020 press release. During our call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including but not limited to statements regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic environment, recent acquisitions, 2020 guidance, and our longer term outlook. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K Annual Report for the 2019 year filed with the SEC, as well as the risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and our Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open up the call to take your questions. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe? Joseph Zubretsky : Thank you, Julie, and good morning. Today, we would like to provide you with updates on a number of topics. First, we will cover the enterprise-wide financial results for the second quarter; second and relatedly, we will discuss the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on various aspects of our business; third, we will convey our guidance in the context of our second quarter results and this new but temporary operating environment; and fourth and lastly, we will provide a premium revenue growth outlook for 2021 which is approximately 20% as we now emerge from pivoting to growth to activating our growth phase. Let me start with specific second quarter highlights. Last night we reported earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of $4.65 with net income of $276 million. These results were supported by an MCR of 82.3%, a G&A ratio of 7.5% and an after tax margin of 6%. Our year-to-date earnings per diluted share is now $7.54 representing 66% of our full-year guidance. The COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on many aspects of our quarterly results. Some of these impacts increased earnings while others served to decrease earnings. While many of these impacts are known and estimable, others require significant judgment to estimate. Today, we will do our best to quantify the COVID impacts on our results and separate them from the underlying core earnings power of the business. In doing so, two things are clear. Our operating metrics were substantially in line with our expectations, both as reported and as adjusted for COVID impacts and both our core earnings and the growth trajectory of our business have not been disrupted by the short-term impacts of COVID. We estimate that taken together all COVID impacts on our financial results for the quarter resulted in an increase in net income in a range of $65 million to $100 million, equating to an increase in earnings per diluted share in a range of $1.10 to $1.65. Now I will provide some highlights related to our second quarter results from an enterprise perspective. Beginning with revenue, our premium revenues of $4.1 billion increased by 8% over the prior year. Relatedly, our membership increased sequentially by 151,000 members or 4% primarily in Medicaid. With respect to medical costs with an 82.3% MCR our performance was also strong, although significantly augmented by COVID impacts. Although in many cases we were required to relax our utilization management and payment integrity regimes as an accommodation to providers. We continue to effectively manage medical costs while ensuring all of our members receive high-quality care. This MCR result was impacted by two directionally different factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We experienced lower than expected medical costs due to COVID related utilization curtailment, a phenomenon that may or may not recur during the balance of the year and a number of our state Medicaid customers enacted retroactive rate refunds. In the quarter the lower medical costs and the retroactive rate refunds combined to reduce our reported medical care ratio by an estimated 300 to 400 basis points, which account for substantially all of the reduction in the ratio both year-over-year and sequentially. All of the COVID impacts on our second quarter results will be describe in more detail in a few moments. Next, we continued to effectively manage our administrative costs through productivity gains and fixed cost leverage, producing a G&A ratio of 7.5%. This is despite spending on specific COVID related items, which temporarily increased our administrative spending. Our net investment income usually not in earnings item with significant variability was again unusually low at $18 million compared to $34 million a year ago due to the current low interest rate environment. Our line of business results were very much in line with our expectations with strong metrics in both Medicaid and Medicare, while our marketplace results were slightly lower than expected due to a higher than expected member acuity mix. Finally in the quarter, we continued to improve our capital structure. We issued $800 million of high-yield bonds used to retire short-term floating rate debt. We also upsized our revolver to $1 billion from its previous level of $500 million. These are more than mere transactions. They are the culmination of a two-year long and highly successful restructuring and optimization of our capital structure. We are now positioned with well priced debt, nicely lathered [ph] maturities, solid credit metrics and ample dry powder to execute on M&A opportunities if and when those opportunities arise. In summary, we continued to perform well across the many fundamentals of managed care, which has been our hallmark and we are continuing to grow revenue as a result of our focus on topline growth. Now, I will provide some commentary about the effects of COVID on our second quarter results. The COVID impacts on our quarterly results include, a decrease in medical costs due to COVID related utilization curtailment, offset by direct care related to COVID patients. Retroactive rate refunds to a number of our state Medicaid customers, an increase in our G&A spending on activities related to COVID and a meaningful increase to our Medicaid membership. As previously mentioned, we estimate that taken together all COVID impacts on our financial results for the quarter, have produced an increase in net income in a range of approximately $65 million to $100 million, equating to an increase in earnings per diluted share in a range of $1.10 to $1.65. I will now provide more color on the most significant factors contributing to this. With respect to the COVID impacts on medical costs, early in the quarter we experienced significantly lower utilization in a variety of cost categories, categories representing approximately two thirds of our total spend with utilization levels increasing slowly as the quarter progressed. By the end of the quarter, utilization in these categories were still approximately 10% lower than we would have normally expected. The medical cost categories most impacted were elective surgeries, services in ambulatory settings, ER visits, behavioral services and wellness and preventive services. We also incurred a direct cost to care for COVID patients with just over 4100 hospitalizations and average inpatient episode cost of $9000 plus the cost of outpatient and other professional services. The cost per COVID episode varies widely depending on the acuity of the patient. We estimate that COVID lowered our second quarter medical costs by $190 million to $240 million. As you know, as a general matter, there are fewer elective procedures performed under the Medicaid program than is the case with commercial health insurance. Since our book of business is heavily weighted to Medicaid, the effect on us of elective procedure curtailment is therefore less pronounced. Six of our state customers enacted temporary retroactive rate refunds during the quarter, with the intent of recouping the portion of our capitated rates not spent on healthcare services due to the pandemic. In the quarter these refunds amounted to $75 million pretax and related to the states of Ohio, Illinois, California, South Carolina, Mississippi, and Washington. Some items of note. The refunds in these states took various forms ranging from simple rate adjustment to a slightly more complex risk sharing [indiscernible] around a target medical loss ratio, as well as supplemental payments to providers. In many of our states however, it was business as usual as we continued to operate on the pre-COVID rate structure. Our position on rate adequacy has been consistent. We do not intend, nor do we want to keep state Medicaid money that was intended to be spent on medical benefits or was not due to utilization curtailment caused by COVID. In many of our Medicaid states, there are already mechanisms in place to protect against a surplus margin as there are minimum MLRs in seven of our states and profit caps in two others. The FMAP increase and potential additional FMAP increases should significantly relieve any potential rate pressure in our states and CMS has authority to approve or disapprove proposed rate actions that are not aligned with the definition of actuarial soundness. Once the COVID pandemic abates, we believe that the traditional process of establishing prospective actuarial sound rates based on a credible medical cost baseline and cost trend of that baseline will continue. With respect to our G&A expenses, COVID related activity increased our second quarter expenses by approximately $25 million. A variety of new operational protocols, technology implementations, and benefits for our employees, all related to the COVID pandemic were established or implemented during the quarter. In addition, we have consciously managed our headcount at above optimal levels to ensure we maintain adequate service levels, but also to be socially responsible to our dedicated staff. Medicaid membership increased sequentially by 152,000 members in the quarter, a 5% increase. Much of this was due to the suspension of redeterminations as we believe that unemployment related enrollment has not yet materially accessed managed Medicaid. It remains unclear how high the membership peak will be, how quickly it will be attained, how quickly it will fall as the economy recovers and where it will ultimately settle. We have invested in many local growth initiatives with providers in branding and awareness campaigns and in social media outreach to ensure we obtain our fair share of increased membership. We believe that post COVID Medicaid membership will stabilize at and increased level as the future natural unemployment rate will likely be higher than previously experienced. In summary, as we work through this unprecedented period, we remain focused on executing on the underlying fundamentals of our business regardless of the short term COVID related impacts on our reported financial results. Now I'll turn to our guidance for the full year. Our full year earnings guidance range remains at $11.20 to $11.70 per diluted share with a midpoint of $11.45. Our earnings per share EBITDA [ph] is $7.54, which means through six months we have earned 66% of our revised guidance. Given the environmental uncertainty that we expect to exist through the end of the year, we are not adjusting the range of our previously provided earnings per share guidance. We intend to adjust our full year outlook as appropriate when our third quarter results are reported. The reasons for this cautious approach have always been stated, but bear repeating. The near-term outlook for medical costs, the cost of COVID and the potential elective procedure rebound, are unknown at this time. There is still potential for additional near-term rate actions or voluntary company concessions to customers, members and providers. We will fulfill our obligation to make any rebate to member, CMS or our state customers related to the statutory requirements that exist today. After doing so, if we conclude that there is still a remaining financial imbalance, we will correct that imbalance. Our membership forecast has a wide range of possible outcomes as there are numerous macroeconomic variables in play and relatedly the acuity of any potential membership increase and the cost of services are also highly variable. And lastly, we believe that any methodology for extrapolating annual earnings estimates by quarter should be suspended in ones thinking. I would now like to turn to the progress we have made in executing our growth strategy, which is having an immediate impact and which allows us to forecast premium revenue growth of approximately 20% for 2021. We have essentially checked the box on at least one initiative across all the revenue growth dimensions outlined in our growth strategy. We have retained all of our existing Medicaid contracts. We have won a new state contract and we have executed meaningful and accretive acquisitions. And with the impact of the recession, organic growth would be much better than expected. Some highlights. Based on announced re-procurement schedules, the revenue associated with our current in-force Medicaid contract should be intact through 2021, plus we have significant certainty related to 2022. The new management team has won or defended all of the re-procurements that were under its control. We assumed the YourCare membership on July 1st which will increase membership by 47,000 members in the third quarter, and should provide approximately $140 million of revenue for the remainder of 2020 and $280 million for the full year 2021. The Magellan Complete Care regulatory review process is proceeding as planned. Recall that the Federal antitrust approval is complete and the state approval processes are progressing. We hope to close the transaction by the end of the year and if we do this acquisition will provide the previously announced $2.8 billion of revenue in 2021. For every month the closing would be delayed beyond the first of the year that annual revenue estimate would decrease proportionately. Our Kentucky RFP win will have contracts start date of January 1, 2021. Before considering any of the potential benefits of the Passport acquisition under a conservative set of membership assignment assumptions, the contract should provide at least $850 of revenue in 2021 with upside potential into 2022 as membership organically builds. Organic same-store membership growth, increased product penetration in our nascent Navajo Nation project would also modestly contribute to the 2021 revenue growth rate. Finally, as previously announced, we're exiting the Medicaid business in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. We have reached an agreement to execute an orderly transition of our members to an on-Island competitor. The unwinding will be completed by November 1, and the impact of the transaction itself and the contract exit are not financially material. Under these assumptions, we project 2021 premium revenue of approximately $21.5 billion. We are very pleased with a 20% increase in premium revenue as we move from pivoting to growth to fully activating our top line growth strategy. Another major development in activating our growth strategy was our recently announced transaction to purchase certain Passport assets. The transaction is expected to close before the end of 2020, providing us with a well known brand in Kentucky, a turnkey operation and the opportunity to gain additional membership. Passport represents potential upside to our 2020 and 2021 revenue guidance. The purchase price for Passport is approximately $20 million plus contingent consideration payable in 2021, based on the level of enrollment retained above a certain threshold. A few words about the Passport transaction and its benefits. We will acquire the Passport brand name, all its operating infrastructure, and we will assume approximately 500 highly trained Kentucky based Passport and Evolent employees. The acquisition allows us to enhance operational readiness in advance of our new contract award in Kentucky, and enables continuity of care for Passport members. The acquisition allows us to avoid startup losses, inevitably associated with building a Greenfield health plan, and the early lack of scale. The acquisition allows us to compete more effectively for additional membership above what we might have ordinarily received from the standard auto assignment process related to our own contract award. And from a financial perspective, we expect to recover the purchase price from positive cash flow in less than one year, as the plan would be immediately profitable and is likely to produce membership well above what we might have achieved organically. It is also important to know that the membership revenue in earnings, related to Passport could all commence and begin to impact our results on or about September 1, if the Commonwealth of Kentucky approves our joint request for an early contract novation. This would be a very positive outcome, although it would impact the year-over-year revenue growth rate calculation. As I conclude my remarks. I take a pause from discussing our operating and financial performance and instead, comment on our compassion or humanity. During this unprecedented time, our company made many significant contributions to charitable, and community causes. We offered financial assistance to distressed providers, and worked with our State customers to understand where they saw human tragedies unfold and offered our financial and operational assistance. We will continue to do so. And in fact, we are developing plans to deepen our social commitment to build stronger communities, one life at a time. I offer another heartfelt thank you to our management team, and our 10,000 associates who are executing well while dealing with their own stresses and issues related to the pandemic and racial strife. Even when facing these challenges, our associates are inspired and motivated by the opportunity to make positive change by delivering high quality healthcare to the disadvantaged. Our associates continue to excel and I stand in admiration of their dedication and their will to sacrifice in the face of all types of adversity. In conclusion, this was a meaningful quarter for the company. Our results met our expectations, despite the turbulence caused by the COVID pandemic. We took major steps forward in our transformation. We sustained our margins, but did right by our members and customers. We fully activated our revenue growth strategy and continued to deploy excess capital in strategic acquisitions. This level of performance provides an insightful glimpse into our very bright future. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom Tran for some additional color on the financials. Tom? Thomas Tran : Thank you, Joe and good morning. First, I will comment on our balance sheet, cash flow, and capital. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and reserve positions remain strong. Days in claim payable represent 52 days of medical cost expense, compared to 49 days in the first quarter of 2020, and 48 days in the second quarter of 2019. The sequential increase was driven by lower medical expense in the current quarter, due to the impact of COVID. Reserved development for the first six months of 2020 was negligible compared to favorable development, which decreased our MCR by 110 basis points in the comparable period in 2019. Operating cash flow for the second quarter of 2020 were $630 million, reflecting the strong operating result, and the timing of government receipts and payments. We attract $185 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter, which brought our parent company cash balance to $1.2 billion, and give us ample flexibility to fund our recent acquisitions and organic growth initiatives. Debt at the end of the quarter is nearly 1.6 times trolling per month EBITDA. Our leverage ratio is 60.7%. However, on a net debt basis, net of parent company cash, the leverage ratio is only 30.7%. Taken together, these metrics reflect a conservative leveraged position. Our $800 million high yield offering was priced at 4 and 3.8%, indicating that the debt markets view our credit quality at a level that should provide a path for a ratings upgrade in the near future. As of June 30, 2020, our health plans at total statutory capital and surplus of approximately $2.1 billion, which equates to approximately 350% of risk based capital. Now turning to our 2020 guidance. Our full year's earnings guidance range is $11.20 to $11.70 per diluted share. We increased our full year 2020 total revenue outlook to approximately $18.8 billion from $18.3 billion, mainly due to a higher Medicaid enrollment through the first half of the year, as well as revenue from YourCare membership, that is effective July 1, 2020. In taking this cautious approach to providing earnings guidance for the balance of the year, we have considered a wide range of potential outcomes from the factors that Joe previously described. Now I offer some additional items of note. The low yield environment and its drag on investment income should persist in the second half. We are likely to incur additional administrative expenses for COVID related operating protocols. We are also going to incur costs associated with the launch of our new Kentucky contract and integration costs associated with the Magellan Complete Care acquisition. And lastly as a reminder, consistent with our historical practice, previously announced acquisition that have not yet closed are excluded from our guidance. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. First question just on how you're thinking about the progression of Medicaid membership through the year. I think you added, you said about 4% of membership in the quarter on the Medicaid side. How do you expect to end the year on Medicaid and specifically can you delineate how much of that membership you expect to carve from this lack of disenrollment? And how are you treating that going into 2021 in terms of how you think that kind of - how long that lasts, given the FMAP and the health [ph] emergency status uncertainty? Joseph Zubretsky : Sure, Justin this is Joe. We grew membership sequentially in Medicaid by 152,000 members at 5%. We believe with really good information that most of that was the result of the suspension of redetermination; that the unemployment surge that is likely to come to manage Medicaid has not yet occurred due to a variety of reasons, spousal coverage, COBRA and backlogs in the various states. Certainly we expect that membership to be on the books for a while. We know it will hit a peak and we also know that as the economy recovers, it will begin to trip [ph]. We do not yet, we have various forecasts of how much membership we are likely to have at the end of the year as a result of all this. But I think we're comfortable in saying that our Medicaid membership will be higher than previously forecasted as a result of COVID. But we have not put a point estimate on that. It's still way too many variables to put a point estimate on how many members we're likely to get. I will say this, through the first three weeks of July the Medicaid membership continued to grow by about 30,000 members organically in the first three weeks of July. Justin Lake : That's helpful. Thanks for that. And then just last question on the exchange performance. You noted little bit higher costs due to higher acuity, can you flesh that out a little bit for us? And then, should we assume that you were able to catch that early enough for 2021 bids? And any color you can give us in terms of how you're thinking about, where you did, for margins in 2021 and that exchange business that would be helpful? Thanks. Joseph Zubretsky : Sure. In our marketplace business, our silver bronze mix didn't change all that much. But we did have a churn in the bronze membership we took on, so we had many new members in our bronze product. The MLR ran higher on those numbers than we had expected. It's either higher medical \u2013 if you are attracting the right risk or it's either mismanagement of your medical cost line, but if you're managing medical costs effectively, which we think we are, then the risk scores just haven't been commensurate. So we'll catch up and we'll get the risk scores in line with the acuity of the membership. But that's the reason for the small shortfall in our marketplace business for the quarter. With respect to the business, yes we projected a medical costs baseline on COVID impacted use 2019 is the medical costs baseline and then trended forward without any COVID impacts. So we believe that the rates we filed for 2021 are solid, fully contemplated all the costs related to medical services for our members, and the scores that we will attain. Justin Lake : Great thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Great, thanks. I wanted to ask about that the rate environment, how should we think about the $75 million number? You characterize it as retroactive? Does that mean that there's not expected to be a go forward impact or is they also a go forward impact on these initiatives in your guidance? Joseph Zubretsky : Well, the retroactive refunds that we record in the quarter really are a reflection of exactly how the rate apparatus should work. Obviously, rates never contemplated this rather dramatic curtailment in utilization. So whether states enact refunds themselves or whether the minimum MLRs in seven of our States get triggered, the money is rightfully going back to the States because it wasn't spent on benefits for their beneficiaries. So we recorded the retroactive component, either back to in some cases back to March in some cases back to the beginning of the year. And certainly we contemplated the forward looking aspects of those rate decreases and refunds, as we provided our very cautious outlook to the balance of the year. So the 75 million was truly the retroactive component that takes us through June 30, but we certainly contemplated the continuation of those refunds that have already been enacted, and obviously the potential for more actions to be enacted by our State customers. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, that's helpful. And then, I guess it was a little bit confusing. It sounded Joe like you were saying that MCC is in your revenue, guidance for 2021. But then Tom mentioned that you don't include deals until they are closed. I just wanted to make sure I understood how the treatment of MCC in that 2021? Joseph Zubretsky : That's a fair point. I think I'm going to use that as the opportunity to make sure we clarify the outlook we're giving for premium revenue in 2021. First thing, I would say is, you know, our revised forecast for 2020 is $17.8 billion of premium revenue, which is a 10% increase over 2019. That's a pretty strong pivot. Now as we really activate the growth strategy, projecting a 20% growth rate off of 2020 is certainly something we're pleased with. And yes, it does contemplate the Magellan Complete Care acquisition closing on January 1. For every month it would be delayed you can proportionately reduce that. But we expect it to close at the earliest by the end of the year, but no later than the end of the first quarter. We also included the organic component of our Kentucky contract, meaning an amount of revenue in Kentucky that we estimate we would get through the normal auto assignment process. We did not include any potential benefits of additional membership that we'll get through the ownership of the Passport brand and the potential innovation of that contract early in the fall. Also, it's important to note that we've decided to exit Puerto Rico, which leaves $400 million of revenue in 2019 will not be in the 2020 rate, and, of course, a modest, very modest and cautious forecast of organic growth. So that's sort of how we compiled our rather conservative outlook for 2021 and we really wanted to just begin framing the story as we really activate our growth strategy, we wanted to give a forward look, a leading indicator, an outlook of where our revenue line is headed. Kevin Fischbeck : That's supposed to clarify the last point. My last question here, we say for next year modest organic growth, what are you assuming as far as unemployment next year versus this year? Joseph Zubretsky : Yes. We have various forecasts on where, as I said, in the previous question, I was asked of where the Medicaid membership will go. And, as I said, we're just we're taking it week-by-week. We - membership grew again in the month of July. We expect it to grow again in August and perhaps through September as that unemployment surge comes through. But it's just so really hard to project. The way I would think about it is, is and what I'm holding my team accountable to, we should do no worse than our market share in those markets. Hopefully, we'll gain market share on this process, but if you take our market share, that would be a good proxy for - if Medicaid enrollment grows by a certain percent we should at least get our market share. Kevin Fischbeck : That\u2019s great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew Borsch of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Matthew Borsch : Yes, hi. I was hoping maybe you could just elaborate a little bit further on your outlook for Medicaid and the rate actions. I understand you're saying that when we get past COVID-19 that you expect we'll continue to have rates set according to actuarial soundness. But, and also recognize referring to a number of states where already existing risk sharing mechanisms have kicked in, where you have exceeded or I should say, come in well under the medical budget target. But what do you have \u2013 if anything to send off at this point, and how are you doing that in terms of states under fiscal pressures? Well, you guys clearly are doing too well with this rate right here, proposals to cut and so forth. Joseph Zubretsky : Sure. Well, Matt, the conversations with our various day customers have been very balanced and very rational. And they do understand the principle that it has the force of federal law of actuarial soundness, which in the CMS approval process they take very seriously as well. Clearly, the actions that have been taken are related to COVID. That's - that has occupied the conversation. We clearly understand that there are other budget pressures in the states that are causing them to look at Medicaid with a very, very sharp pencil. But you can't recruit money in Medicaid rates to balance your budget. That violates the concept of actuarial soundness. The rates have to reflect that the services that we intend to allow members to have and I think the rate environment will persist through all this. As I said, we'll go back to a point where on a prospective basis, we agreed to statistically credible medical cost baseline, a reasonable trend off that baseline. And, the - that has served managed Medicaid well over many, many years. Matthew Borsch : Understood. And, I realized that the timing is in different places for different states. But when would you expect to get into the most intense period of discussions over new rate proposals? Joseph Zubretsky : Well, as you know, our rates contract years span from January 1 to July to September. So we're always in some type of discussion with our customers about rates. And, as we emerge through this COVID period, we have to adjust for the effects of COVID. Are the effects of COVID going to last into the 2021 baseline? Right now, they could, but we just don't know. So I wouldn't want to divulge any particular conversation we're having with states, but the discussion about how long COVID will last, and what that medical cost baseline needs to reflect, is just an ongoing state-by-state discussion. Joseph Zubretsky : Okay, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Stephen Tanal of SVB Leerink. Please go ahead. Stephen Tanal : Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question and all the color today. I guess, one thing I wanted to follow up on was just, Joe the $21.5 billion outlook the greater than and as it relates to Kentucky, I just wanted to get a sense of first, I guess, maybe confirm the math. I think if the state approves that you guys can keep Passport 315,000 members it would probably add another billion dollars of premium revenue on top of this outlook based on, how you guys have assumed it right now. So first I want to understand if I have that right, and maybe if there's anything else you can tell us about what Kentucky said so far with respect to whether they'll allow you to keep those numbers in place. Joseph Zubretsky : Your math is precisely correct. We assumed through an auto assignment process that we\u2019d likely get 140,000 members, which is why we put an estimate of $850 million into our forecast. And we just didn't want to be presumptive. We're buying the Passport operating assets and the brand name. The membership has to be assigned to us through the state approval process. But you're absolutely right. If we obtained all 350,000 members that would represent a little over a $1 billion of upside to the $21.5 billion estimate that we've given you. I will say this, while we're still in the approval process, so I don't want to go into any particular conversations we've had, continuity of care is really, really important to our customers, stability of the network, continuity of the care plans, particularly for the high acuity population is really, really important to our customer. So we believe what one of the potentials for this transaction is to keep either all or many of the 350,000 members that are now in the Passport plan. That was certainly the intention that we had in mind when we bought the Passport assets. So, continuity of care, really, really important to the customer and stability of network, and if we are able to keep many of those members, those objectives will have been met. Stephen Tanal : Great, that's really helpful. And then I guess just as a follow-up on this point, it sounds like Magellan Complete Care at least inside this initial target is good for about $2.8 billion. Obviously it can move around a little depending on the close, but we can use that and back into I think that, that level of organic growth you spoke to and framed as conservative, I think it's about 5%, correct me if I'm wrong, but how do you think about that 5%? I mean, what is the potential for upside there? And how conservative do you think that is? Maybe talk about where it comes from Medicaid, Medicare, et cetera? Joseph Zubretsky : We continue to believe that we'll grow our marketplace product. Our DSNP product is doing really, really well. We clearly have plans to grow market share, as I outlined at are Investor Day over a year ago, putting in the operational protocols to make sure that we have less leakage on redetermination than we've had in the past, and that through additional branding and awareness campaigns at the local level, we attract more membership through the voluntary process. Improving our risk scores and our quality scores I should say, to move up higher in the auto assignment algorithms. So we have plans to grow organically. I would call it small bolt-on acquisitions as good as organic, particularly at the prices we're paying. So, I'd stay at the cautious and conservative estimate, and that's the way I would think about it. Stephen Tanal : Awesome. Maybe if I could just slip in one more, I was just curious to know how much minimum medical loss ratio rebate accruals may dampen the sort of downside of the year on your decline and MCR and maybe same question on premium refund, and I guess prior year development from the roll forward table on a gross basis looks like it was negative in the quarter, so wondering if minimum MLRs were a factor there as well, so maybe any color there would be helpful and then I'll yield thanks. Joseph Zubretsky : Now, after we recorded the premium refunds, the minimum MLRs did not have any impact in the quarter, no material impact on our financial results. Now going forward, again depends where COVID takes the medical cost line. It depends where the retroactive rate refunds kick-in. But we, again through whatever mechanism there is, we actually prefer and intend to make sure that we don't keep state money that was paid to us for servicing members that wasn\u2019t due to the pandemic. So whether it's through the retroactive rate refund, whether it's through the minimum MLR mechanism or whether it's just voluntary, working with our state customer to make directed payments to providers to add value added benefits for members or just to give them the money back, we think that's the responsible way to behave in a global pandemic with our Medicaid customers. Stephan Tanal : Helpful, thank you. Operator : The next question is from Dave Windley of Jefferies. Please go ahead. David Windley : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Joe, a little bit of a followup to the last answer that you just gave, trying to get a sense, you've named I believe, six states that enacted retros, seven have MLR's, two more have profit caps. I guess I'm wondering how much of those, overlap or kind of complement to that question would be, how many states are naked on this issue, how many states do not have a mechanism or have not enacted a mechanism yet to recoup money in this environment? Joseph Zubretsky : I would say that the states of - the states that haven't yet, are Washington - Washington have directed payments, but no, Washington and Texas, no. Florida and Michigan, have not. New York hasn't. So, those are the states, Wisconsin hasn't. Those are the states that haven't yet, and I don't have the list in front of me of where the MLRs are, but the MLRs are 85 or 86 and those could get tripped and probably in a marginal way, but those are the states that haven't enacted anything yet. And as I said, we'll wait and see, when something's enacted, how they're enacted, what retro period they apply to, et cetera. David Windley : Sure. Joseph Zubretsky : But that's the, that's the outlook. David Windley : Got it. I appreciate that. And just, just thinking, I guess, wondering how states fiscal years and their budget balancing activity come into play in their thinking, in your negotiations. If - if they don't have or don't enact a mechanism to recoup that money in the 2020 fiscal year, does that increase the likelihood that they try to take that out in rates in 2021? Understanding your comments about actuarial soundness, not sure how those would - is that - is that explicitly a year by year thing or could that take into account, kind of a two-year forecast in the way they're looking at that actuarial soundness level? Joseph Zubretsky : Well, certainly we have, we follow very, very closely all of the budget and legislative activity with our state customers. Obviously, it gives you a sense of hope, repeat their budgets are with tax revenues or not, so we certainly follow it. Many of our states have already passed budgets, many of them passed budgets a year ago that are two years in duration, where we haven't had any conversations about rates. But many are in the process. Certain of them are in process. So we certainly keep our eye on it, but as I said before, you can't use Medicaid rates to recoup tax revenues. They have to reflect the services that you intend to pay for members. And as I said on the last earnings call, there is no question that as the economy moves up and down and state budgets are either very strong or on the weaker side, then rates would be on the stronger side of actuarial soundness when the economy is really robust, and might be on the weaker side of actuarial soundness when the economy is flat. And again, there is the offsetting impact of more membership or fewer members. So, it modulates and it's all manageable. But as I said, actuarial soundness has to reflect the cost of healthcare services for your members and you can't recoup budget deficits with Medicaid money. David Windley : Right, understood. Last question here, you've alluded to even voluntary give backs in or that that's something that you would contemplate is, are those actions, and I guess I'm wondering how formalized are some of those actions in your plans, and have you taken those into account in the reconfirmed guidance that you're making today. I'm just wondering, if you do decide to make voluntary payments, how might we account for those or learn of those? Joseph Zubretsky : It certainly was contemplated in the very cautious outlook we gave for the second half. I would state it this way. A state might decide that they will take the action to recoup the money that wasn't paid in benefits through these rate refunds. If they don't do that and we trigger a minimum MLR, then we have to pay it back by regulation. If neither of those two things exist or happen and we still think that we inappropriately or inadvertently, unexpectedly benefited by this curtailment of utilization, we would work with our state customer and work on a program of either additional value added benefits for members, directed payments to stressed or distressed providers or just give them the money back. We just don't think it's helpful for the Managed Care industry to sort of have a surplus margin related to curtailed utilization in a pandemic and we'll report that as we report our third and fourth quarters, we will report to the extent we trigger minimum MLRs, we have retroactive rate refunds where we voluntarily granted money back to our customer. David Windley : Very clear. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Charles Rhyee of Cowen. Please go ahead. Charles Rhyee : Yes, thanks for taking the questions. Joe, obviously it seems like a lot of this when you guys gave you our outlook last quarter, you gave yourself a lot of room for a lot of this uncertainty and then we're seeing some of that a little bit play out. And obviously, at the same time, you've been able to maintain your earnings outlook for the full year here. But within that, were you surprised at although with how some of these adjustments came or was this sort of what you are already in discussions with states, at that time that you kind of reported last quarter. So it was sort of within the range of what you're expecting? And then sort of just a followup on the last question here, obviously several other states here that you're saying that you really don't have mechanisms in place, are those discussions, are there discussions ongoing with them currently? So it's a question of whether they make a decision to do something on that or is this - or these are situations where sort of no discussions have started? Joseph Zubretsky : Yes Charles, I mean we knew we are headed into a very uncertain and unclear environment. I mean it's a pandemic and it's healthcare and we saw the utilization suppression. We knew that whatever the numbers are, we knew that we were benefiting or at least our P&L temporarily is benefiting materially by suppressed utilization. So yes, we expected our state customers to contact the industry, to figure out a way to recoup some of those funds, which is entirely almost the embodiment of actuarial soundness. The rates were super adequate for the COVID declared emergency period and therefore the money should be given back. So, this environment was entirely contemplated. Now at the beginning of the quarter, did I know that healthcare costs will be down between $190 million and $240 million? No. But when utilization was down 20% to 40% in healthcare categories representing two thirds of our spend, you knew that there would be some large distortions related to COVID. So yes, we anticipated this environment as the quarter progressed, we certainly monitored it and this is the result we produced. And I'll say it, the reason we gave you those numbers, if we really did want to highlight, and I'll make this comment, that when you take all the distortions, significant distortions related to COVID out of our numbers, it's a very, very strong quarter with good metrics. I mean, if you take out the $1.10 to $1.65 estimate of what COVID, increased our earnings per share by, we produced at a minimum $3 per share for the quarter, maybe as high as $3.55 for the quarter and that 82% MCR that we printed for the quarter had 400 basis points of COVID benefit in it, so banks were on our 86% result that we've been consistently and routinely producing. So we try to be clear. We try to separate and isolate those COVID distortions as clear as we could. And yes, we knew we were going through an unclear environment which is one of the reasons why we again gave cautious guidance for the back half of the year. Tell us where the pandemic is going and we'll give you a clearer picture, but the range of outcomes for the second half of the year is so varied and so wide, holding our guidance and giving you some qualitative factors rather than quantitative factors, we thought was the most responsible approach. Charles Rhyee : I know you are having discussions with states like Texas, Washington, Florida, are those - are those when you kind of mentioned them, are they ones that they're just kind of outstanding, but nothing has really started? Joseph Zubretsky : Texas and Washington have asked all - have actually expressed their interest in increasing Medicaid spending during this period of time. We had some early on, I think it was even in the first quarter, Washington as you know was one of the first state to get hit with the pandemic, and a lot of the behavioral providers in Washington who were on fee-for-service, were really, really getting crushed. And so, the state asked us, asked the industry to make some directed payments to providers which we gladly did. So, we're having discussions, that's just an example, we're having discussions with all our states, but Washington and Texas, yet have expressed more interest in infusing more money into Medicaid than extracting it from Medicaid. Charles Rhyee : That's helpful. And one last just to clarify, you said additional FMAP could offset further rate headwinds or are you assuming anything above the 6% FMAP in the guidance, either for this year or when you think about next year? Joseph Zubretsky : No. As you know, there is all kinds of jousting that's going on between the - in Congress related to this. But no, we did not, whether it's 12%, whether it ends up being 12% or 14%, we did not include any of that outlook as potential upside to what might happen in rates. If it happens, it would be great. I think states will be relieved and I think it will take a lot of pressure off, but no, we did not assume, we did not assume that would happen. Charles Rhyee : Great, thanks a lot. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Raskin of Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Joshua Raskin : Hi, thanks, good morning. I appreciate you taking the question. I apologize for coming back to this voluntary actions or this correcting imbalances, but I just want to understand this in the context of Molina overall. Right? So if you're trying to sort of keep things flat, let's call it on the medical cost side. Right? So, a lot of it gets tripped from a regulatory perspective, but you're going to kind of, it sounds like give back any upside on the medical cost side as a result of COVID, but the enterprise has other headwinds. Right? Higher G&A cost and investment income coming in lower, et cetera. So, I'm just trying to understand, there's a confirmation of guidance, it sounds like none of that upside is on the medical cost side, but you've got other costs. I'm just trying to understand sort of how you think about progressing through the year? Should we just think of, if there is any potential upside, again it gets absorbed and the guidance is the guidance or is there some variability? And is it crazy to think additional costs on the G&A side or lower investment income could actually be a headwind? Joseph Zubretsky : Josh, you certainly captured the essence of the difficulty of providing a point estimate forecast in this environment. And, I want to make sure it's clear what we meant. If a refund is enacted, the state is therefore recouping what they considered to be the excess capitation rate through an enacted temporary rate refund. If it triggers a minimum MLR, then there is already an existing regulatory mechanism. And all we are saying is, if we still felt there was a financial imbalance, we feel that imbalance should be corrected. I'm not defining what an imbalance means, whether it's 100 basis points or 200 to 300, it's going to be state-by-state, situation-by-situation. I'm not going to go into exactly what we mean by that. But I do think, as a philosophy, our Company and I think Managed Care generally is taking the approach that we do not intend to benefit by the suppression or the curtailment of utilization due to a global pandemic. Yes, I mean we contemplated the headwind, Tom spoke to it. We contemplated the investment income headwind going into the back half of the year. We contemplated that we would be spending extra G&A as we gave you our cautious approaches. So, it's a no. I wouldn't say they're headwinds. They were already contemplated in our comfort level in re-establishing the guidance we previously gave. Joshua Raskin : Okay. And I don't think anyone is going to argue with the strategic value of working with your partners in a period where you benefit, so I think that's an obvious one. Just one quick followup on the development or sort of the lack thereof and sort of how that compares to last year, were there any - typically you guys have seen conservative reporting over the last couple of years, the reserving, I'm sorry. And that's favorable development, sort of the lack thereof. This year, were there some countervailing forces? Was there something else in there? I heard Tom say same methodology, et cetera. Joseph Zubretsky : Hey Tom, would you like to take Josh's question about development? Please. Thomas Tran : Yes, thanks Joe. You're right, Josh. Our reserve methodology remained the same. We said that four to six months that the development is negligible on a PPD basis is slightly favorable, but it's not material. That's why we don't want to call it out. Joshua Raskin : Okay. But any - historically you had been seeing more, was there - I guess, is it just getting better at the estimation process or curious why you wouldn't see the same level of development if the methodology is the same. Thomas Tran : Yes, I would say that - I would say that within anything you do related to reserve, there's always judgment factor, there is range, and you can always argue you come pretty close to it. In prior years, we had a lot more development in that we tended to be a lot more cautious. We still are very conservative in our reserve methodology. So I wouldn't say there is anything inherently different. It's just the outcome is a little bit closer to our estimate. Joshua Raskin : Perfect. Operator : The next question comes from George Hill of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : Good morning, guys and thanks for taking the question. You guys have clearly positioned the balance sheet and the kind of the debt covenants to be active in the M&A market and you guys are performing well. I guess what I'm interested in hearing about is the other side of the discussions, do you feel like the current environment is giving kind of the smaller plans more breathing room and more room to run and set themselves up for growth or do you feel like this is accelerating M&A discussions? Joseph Zubretsky : Hi George, it's Joe. I think COVID has not, in our opinion, changed the attitude of how people think about Managed Care or Managed Medicaid. It's a tough business, it's hard, you have to have the infrastructure, you have to have the scale, you have to have deep skills and knowledge, a lot of esoteric knowledge. It's not, it shouldn't be hobby and it shouldn't be an adjunct. You need to be highly skilled in this. So, no, it hasn't caused us to think any differently about it. Although, I would say that a small Medicaid plan somewhere, might be enjoying some additional profitability. It certainly hasn't changed and the discussions we've had with many plans across the country, it certainly hasn't emboldened them to think differently about the long-term nature of this business. I mean - if it takes a pandemic to put you on the right course to profitability, then you're making the wrong call. So no, we still have a really, really bullish outlook on small discrete bolt-on and tuck-in acquisitions. George Hill : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Fidel of Stephens. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel : Hi thanks, good morning. Joe, first question just interested. I know that obviously there is a lot of moving pieces here, but when thinking about the three segments and the guidance that you had previously given for after-tax margins across the segments, maybe even directionally, can you help us think about in the current guidance, how each of those business lines may have evolved, whether tax [ph] is a little bit lower and Medicaid's a little bit higher or just interested in your thoughts around the three segments in terms of after-tax margins in the 2020 guidance? Joseph Zubretsky : Sure. Well, certainly Scott, this thing this wouldn't be the quarter with all of the distortions caused by COVID, this would be the quarter to reset your long-term expectations on margin attainability in any line of business. There's just way too many distorted impacts and you think you have those distorted impacts captured appropriately. And I think we do. But no, I think we still think that Medicaid is a 3% - 4% contributor. We've been routinely producing mid to high single digits in Medicaid \u2013 Medicare. And I would say the one where we still have a desire and a hope and a strategy to drive growth in the Marketplace business at mid-to-high single-digit margins as a growth engine for the business is still in our long-term strategy, but this wouldn't be the quarter to sort of reset your expectations, and I would just answer the question that way. Scott Fidel : Yes, I understood. And then just a followup, I had a followup question, just on MCC, and how you had laid out when you announced the deal the thoughts on accretion and just interested, if you look at MCC and with Magellan's reporting for them, they've had a big first half. They've already exceeded their full year segment profit guidance just in the first half, but obviously there was a lot of benefit in the second quarter from COVID, just like other health plans. So just interested whether you think that initial first year target of the $0.50 to $0.75 of cash EPS accretion, in your view is that still the right way to think about it or do you think that just given general trajectory that Magellan has had in improving MCC recently, that you can end up capturing a bit more of that multi-year accretion in the first year? Joseph Zubretsky : Well, we're always pretty cautious forecasters. So I would say that there is a fair bit of caution built in to the $0.50- $0.75 to begin with on a cash EPS basis. And yes, I mean I obviously can't comment on anything I know through the integration process, but I certainly can respond to your comment on what was reported publicly. And yes, the first half, it looked like the businesses we're doing very, very well and you hit the question, how much of its COVID related and how much of it is sustainable. But certainly, we're pleased with what we saw in the public report and it certainly gives you as much or even more confidence that the accretion numbers we put out there are attainable. Scott Fidel : Okay, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes, hi, good morning. A question on Magellan and Passport. Magellan is in the guidance, Passport is not, what's the rationale for that? Joseph Zubretsky : The rationale is, we did not feel it appropriate. We want to be deferential to our regulator customer in the state of Kentucky. We're buying the Passport brand and the assets, but the membership actually needs to be assigned to us. If we get more than 140,000, we projected we get about 140,000 in an auto-assignment process, which I think is a reasonable estimate. But, we do not want to be presumptuous that we would get all or most of the 350,000 and we're trying to be differential to the regulatory approval process. And the Magellan acquisition still needs regulatory approval. Once it's approved and we take over the legal entities, we will have the membership lock, stock and barrel. That was the reason. Ricky Goldwasser : Okay. And then just on the bolt-on acquisition, I understand you're bullish on the opportunities there. But just going back to one of the earlier comments, so a bolt-on acquisition, I think you referred to as sort of part of organic growth. So should we assume that they are included in the guidance? Joseph Zubretsky : Well, it's an interesting question. I believe in a quasi organic way, if you want to point of term, that anything done with generated cash flow is as good as organic, particularly with the prices we're paying. When you can - when you can recover the purchase price of an acquisition in the first year of positive cash flow at a purchase price of what is likely to be somewhere around 12% of premium, that's as good as organic, even though it's technically an inorganic play in the case of Passport. So to me, if you're buying bolt-on tuck-in acquisitions particularly membership migrations where you're paying per member or for the members retained, even though you're outweighing a modest amount of capital, it's just good as organic. Ricky Goldwasser : Got it and then lastly, when we think about the new Medicaid members that are on-boarding. How do you see stuff like that margin profile concurred to existing population? Joseph Zubretsky : Since many of them are coming either through or staying on through the redetermination process, the way I would describe it is, those members are an average acuity of our existing population, not materially more acute, not materially less acute. Now when the unemployment surge happens, I think you might get a slightly different story, since people that need healthcare generally seek it. So you could have a slight acuity shift there, which is one of the reasons why when we gave our guidance with, A, we don't know how many members were getting and B, we don't know their level of acuity or the cost of service. So it's clearly just another factor of uncertainty for the back half of the year. Ricky Goldwasser : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Sarah James of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Sarah James : Thank you. Can you walk us through how pricing actions would have impacted the Hicks [ph] margins ex-COVID and what long-term margins are, what your goals are for that product? And then the comment, I just wanted to clarify your comment on risk scores being off from what you expected. How much of that is really related to industry trends or challenges because of COVID in getting new members evaluated and scored versus the population that Molina holds having a difference in the health of the population? Thanks. Joseph Zubretsky : Sure. I'm going to answer your last question first and ask you to repeat the first one, I'm not sure I understood it. But, we clearly think this is a case where the new bronze membership we took on, we did not either have or get quickly enough the risk scores that we needed to service that population. And there could be just a lag by when you get all your coding done, when you get all your interventions done, we'll catch it up. We have a very good operation when it comes to risk scoring, so was the churn in that bronze population that caused us to have risk scores that lag. It will catch up and it's not a long-term concern. I think I need for you to repeat the first part of your question, it was about medical - it was about Marketplace rates, but I didn't follow it. Sarah James : Yes, so I just wanted to understand with the Marketplace margins, I mean in some of the change there was the pricing actions and some was related to COVID. So just trying to understand ex-COVID, how do you think margins would have ended up, given your pricing actions? And how do you think about your margin goals for that product, long-term? Joseph Zubretsky : Okay. We haven't changed our margin outlook for the product and we still have a strategy of growing the profit pool. And as I've said many times, on a year-by-year basis, me and my management team will make the call on whether we ease up on margin to grow membership or whether we pull back, ease up on membership to grow margin and we'll make that decision, geography by geography with a thorough analysis of the competitive landscape. With respect to the performance of the business, the COVID pandemic utilization curtailment did not have as significant impact on Marketplace as it did on other businesses. Initially, utilization was down in late March and early April, but it bounced back very, very quickly through May and June. So, it did not have as steep an impact on Marketplace as it did on Medicare and Medicaid. Sarah James : Thank you. Operator : The next question is a followup from Stephen Tanal of SVB Leerink. Please go ahead. Stephen Tanal : Hey guys, thanks for taking this and sorry to come back on. I guess, I just in part wanted to clarify a point I made that I think is now wrong. I hadn't factored in Puerto Rico when I looked at organic growth, and so I just wanted to walk through the math of the bridge to '21 revenue. So if you have $17.8 billion of premium revenue in '20 and $21.5 billion in '21, obviously there is a $3.7 billion increase. Magellan Complete Care good for $2.8 billion. YourCare steps up $100 million and then you've divested Puerto Rico, which is $400 million. So I'd call all of those non-organic and so M&A seems to be contributing about $2.5 billion which implies about $1.2 billion net organic, which I think is organic growth of about 6.6%, which still, is a little bit conservative. But I just wanted to say is that math right and is that kind of how you guys are thinking about it or is there anything else you'd want to steer us there? Joseph Zubretsky : You have the right model in your thinking. That is the model we've used, and again it's an outlook. It's not a pinpoint estimate. We believe, not believe, we couched it as conservative. We wanted to give you and our investors a very clear indication of where the trajectory of our top line is going. We will refine this estimate as we go forward, when we go through the third and fourth quarters. Who knows where our Medicaid membership will be, we could have another 150,000 members by the end of next quarter. We just don't know. So we will refine the organic aspects of this, but the inorganic aspects are pretty clear. And you're right, you have to factor in the $400 million Puerto Rico exit as an offset to some modestly calibrated organic growth. Stephen Tanal : Yes, I missed that. And I guess just lastly, when might we learn about Kentucky and whether they're going to let you keep Passport's enrollment? Joseph Zubretsky : Well there is - I don't want to comment on the regulatory process, but we're working through the regulatory process on the contract novation and on the after the process of getting approval to buy the Passport infrastructure. Open enrollment starts, I think it's mid-October. So we're hoping to have this whole thing included either by the end of the summer or early in September, but I can't predict when that will actually happen. But we're working hard on it and the earlier it can get done, the more stable that membership will be. Those members love the Passport brand. They like being in that plan. The state understands that. So I think we're all aligned in our intention to want to keep those members in the Passport brand, in the Passport care plan and in the Passport network. Stephen Tanal : Great, thank you, again, I appreciate it. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. The conference has now also concluded.

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today\u2019s event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Trudell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Molina Healthcare. Please go ahead. Julie Trudell : Good morning, and welcome to Molina Healthcare\u2019s third quarter 2020 earnings call. Joining me today are Molina\u2019s President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Tom Tran. A press release announcing our third quarter earnings was distributed yesterday after the market closed and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that the remarks made herein are as of today, Thursday, October 29, 2020, and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. In this call, we\u2019ll refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our third quarter 2020 earnings release. During our call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, the current environment, recent acquisitions, 2020 guidance and our longer-term outlook. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that can cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K Annual Report for the 2019 year filed with the SEC as well as risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open up the call and take your questions. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe? Joe Zubretsky : Thank you, Julie, and good morning. Today, we would like to provide you with updates on a number of topics. First, we will cover the enterprise-wide financial results for the third quarter. Second, we will discuss the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on various aspects of our business. Third, we will convey our 2020 guidance in the context of our third quarter results. And fourth, we will provide an update related to the continued execution of our growth strategy. Let me start with the third quarter highlights. Last night, we reported GAAP earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of $3.10 with net income of $185 million. This result was supported by an MCR of 85.9%, a G&A ratio of 7.3%, and an after tax margin of 3.7%. Our year-to-date GAAP earnings per diluted share is now $10.65. On an adjusted basis, which excludes non-recurring non-operating items are earnings per diluted share were $3.36 for the third quarter. Excluded items related primarily to costs associated with our exit for Puerto Rico and startup costs associated with various growth initiatives. In summary, we are pleased with our third quarter performance, both with respect to the continued delivery of solid earnings and the focused execution of our growth strategy. All of this was achieved while dealing with the effects of a global pandemic. Unlike the second quarter, in which the combined COVID-related impacts serve to temporarily increase our earnings, in this third quarter, the combination of all COVID-related impacts net its way negligible to slightly positive impact on earnings. Therefore, our reported results and ex-COVID results are essentially the same. We will once again quantify the various COVID impacts on our results to provide some clarity on how they affected our operating metrics. But it is clear to us that our operating metrics were substantially in line with our expectations both as reported and as adjusted for COVID impacts. Now I will provide some highlights related to our third quarter results from an enterprise perspective. Beginning with revenue, our premium revenue of $4.8 billion increased by 17% over the prior year, and by nearly $400 million and 9% sequentially. Relatedly, our membership increased sequentially by 478,000 members or 13% primarily in Medicaid. Bear in mind, these increases include the membership and revenue of Passport, which we assumed on September 1 when the Commonwealth of Kentucky novated Passport\u2019s Medicaid contract to Molina. With respect to medical margin with an 85.9% MCR, our performance was also strong and only modestly impacted by COVID. We experienced a modest amount of utilization curtailment, which was partially offset by the cost of COVID-related care. The net of which favorably impacted the medical cost line. This was substantially offset by COVID-related rate refunds on the premium revenue line. In the quarter, these items combined had a negligible impact on the total company medical margin and earnings, but serve to decrease the medical care ratio by approximately 60 basis points. This strong medical margin performance anchored by Medicaid reflects a sound non-COVID rate environment, continued excellent management of medical costs and a moderately lower acuity population. All of the COVID-related impacts on our third quarter metrics will be described in more detail in a few moments. Next, we continued to effectively manage our administrative costs through productivity gains and fixed cost leverage reducing a G&A ratio of 7.3% despite spending on specific COVID-related items, including the cost of servicing the additional membership volume. Net investment income usually not in earnings item with significant variability was again unusually low at $14 million compared to $40 million a year ago, due to the current low interest rate environment. Our line of business results were mostly in line with our expectations with strong metrics in both Medicaid and Medicare. However, our marketplace results fell short of our expectations. In Medicaid and Medicare, control over medical cost utilization and unit cost continues to provide the ballast for a sustained consistent performance all while ensuring our members receive high quality care. COVID-related impacts were slightly favorable in the Medicaid and Medicare businesses. Excluding the COVID-related impacts our performance and resulting margins in these lines still exceeded our pre-COVID expectations. In our marketplace business, the COVID-related impacts in the quarter were net unfavorable. We also operationally underperformed in our bronze product with respect to both utilization control and the achievement of risk scores that accurately reflect the acuity level of that population. We remain confident in our ability to titrate the medical margin performance of this metallic tier. As we have done in our Medicare and our flagship Medicaid business. In summary, we continue to perform well across the many domains of managed care and our operating fundamentals remain very strong. Now I will provide some commentary about the item by item effects of COVID on our third quarter. While these items are of note, when individually considered, together they net way negligible to slightly positive impact on enterprise earnings and earnings per share in the quarter. The COVID impacts on our quarterly results include a modest net decrease in medical costs due primarily to COVID-related utilization curtailment. Rate refunds to a number of our state Medicaid customers and response to the COVID-related utilization curtailment, which we experienced in both the second and third quarters, in increase in our G&A spending on activities related to COVID and a meaningful increase to our Medicaid membership. We experienced several significant COVID-related impacts on medical costs in the quarter. First, at the beginning of the quarter, utilization was still moderately curtailed, but rebounded to more normal levels during the quarter. Second, we attracted approximately 300,000 new Medicaid members to Molina since the end of March. And the acuity of that population is clearly lower than the book of business average. And third, direct costs to care for COVID patients totaled $35 million in the quarter. As a resurgence of COVID infections and episodes has occurred in places including Texas and California and disproportionately impacted the marketplace business. In the quarter, the net effect of these three factors reduced normalize medical costs and increased pre-tax earnings by a range of $95 million to $105 million. As you recall, in the second quarter, six of our state customers enacted temporary rate refunds with the stated intent of recouping the portion of our capitated rates not spent on medical costs due to the pandemic. In some of those states, the refund period extended into the third quarter. In addition, during the quarter one additional state Michigan enacted a refund mechanism. In the third quarter, the total impact from COVID-related rate refunds serve to reduce premium revenue and earnings by $88 million on a pre-tax basis. With respect to rate adequacy, we do not intend nor do we want to keep state Medicaid money that was intended to be spent on medical benefits, but was not due to utilization curtailment caused by COVID. In many of our Medicaid states, there are already mechanisms in place to protect against a surplus margin as there are minimum MLRs in seven of our states and profit caps in two others. And once the COVID-19 pandemic abates, we believe that the traditional process of establishing prospective actuarially sound rates based on a credible medical cost baseline and cost trend off that baseline will resume. COVID-related activity increased our third quarter administrative expense by approximately $7 million. We continue to develop a variety of new operational protocols, technology implementations, and benefits for our employees all related to the COVID pandemic and the related increased volume. Medicaid membership increased sequentially by 473,000 in a quarter, a 15% increase. 325,000 of this increase was directly related to the Passport membership and Kentucky, which we assumed on September 1. The addition of the YourCare membership in New York was almost entirely offset by the expected membership decline from the early stages of our Puerto Rico exit. The remaining 148,000 member increase was primarily due to the suspension of redeterminations. As we believe that unemployment related enrollment has not yet materially accessed managed Medicaid. It remains unclear how high the COVID-related membership peak will be, how quickly it will fall as the economy recovers and where it will ultimately settle. However, it does appear that since unemployment nationally is now just under 8% initial industry estimates of unemployment related Medicaid membership increases were overstated. Relatedly, the declaration of the extension of the public health emergency period and the related maintenance of effort extension into next year will likely have a favorable impact. In summary, as we work through this unprecedented period of the COVID pandemic, we remain focused on executing on the underlying fundamentals of our business to continue to produce solid results, regardless of the short-term COVID-related impacts on our reported financial metrics and results. Now I turn to our guidance for the full year. In September 1, we closed on the Passport acquisition and the Commonwealth of Kentucky novated Passport\u2019s Medicaid contract to Molina. For 2020, the four months of revenue from this transaction will add approximately $700 million of revenue with negligible earnings. This increase combined with higher Medicaid enrollment through the third quarter, supports the increase in our 2020 total revenue guidance to $19.6 billion from the previous estimate of $18.8 billion. This total revenue guidance for 2020 includes $18.6 billion in premium revenue. Our core performance each quarter has been strong and stable producing at or about $3 of earnings per share. Although this core business performance is expected to remain strong through the fourth quarter, we are choosing to maintain our existing guidance. We take this cautious approach because of the continued uncertainty related to COVID impact on medical costs and the possibility for additional COVID-related rate refunds. We further note that the proceeds from the previously announced favorable settlement with respect to the federal risk corridor litigation will be reported in our fourth quarter. Also in the fourth quarter, we intend to make a sizable contribution to our recently launched MolinaCares charitable foundation. These two items will likely offset each other. When we report our fourth quarter, we will certainly focus on providing a clear view of the earnings power of the business as a baseline for gauging the quality of our 2021 earnings guidance. Shifting the discussion now to our growth initiatives, we made another major stride in the quarter related to the activation of our growth strategy. In September, we signed a definitive agreement to purchase Affinity Health Plan of New York for approximately $380 million. The profile of Affinity is perfectly aligned with our philosophy of staying close to our core business. It is a managed Medicaid business in New York City, as well as surrounding counties and is a nice compliment to the Senior Whole Health business that we are acquiring with the Magellan Complete Care acquisition. Affinity serves approximately 284,000 Medicaid members. Its membership base is stable and the company has very good share in the markets it serves. Affinity\u2019s operating infrastructure sound, it has solid provider relationships, a high performing team of enrollment coordinators and a platform, which has the ability to successfully defend and expand its market position. Affinity has not performed to the levels of profitability that Molina has achieved. It therefore provides yet another opportunity for us to bring our operating discipline, business processes and technologies to improve margins and harvest fixed cost leverage with our other New York-based businesses. The transaction is expected to close as early as the second quarter. So the acquisition could provide up to $600 million of revenue for 2021. At a purchase price of less than 30% of reporting revenue, we are projecting excellent returns in excess of our cost of capital. The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive by $0.15 to $0.20 adjusted earnings per share in the first 12 months of our ownership. After that initial integration period, we expect to achieve margins consistent with both Molina\u2019s performance track record and the industry norm for the New York metro area. The purchase of Affinity is another milestone in a growth oriented 2020. Our growth initiatives continued to be anchored by our capital allocation priorities. First, organic growth of our core businesses, second, inorganic growth through accretive acquisitions, and third programmatically returning excess capital to shareholders. We previously provided you with a 2021 premium revenue outlook. This outlook included a pro forma estimate of the revenue associated with our announced acquisition of Magellan Complete Care, which is on track to close around the end of the year and an estimate of the revenue expected from auto assigned membership and our new Kentucky Medicaid contract. That outlook, which included only a modest early estimate of organic growth, was 2021 premium revenue of $21.5 billion. This 2021 outlook has improved now that we are currently serving all of Passport\u2019s existing membership in Kentucky, the majority of which we are expecting to keep. Our expectation is not affected by a court ruling last Friday that a sixth player should be added to the Kentucky Medicaid program for 2021. That ruling did not rescind our Medicaid contract award, does not impact the earlier novation of the Passport Medicaid contract to us and does not affect our status as a current incumbent in the program. Our 2021 outlook has also improved the announcement of the Affinity acquisition. We will provide refined revenue guidance with all the supporting details, when we announce our 2021 full year guidance. There was so much activity related to the political arena, legislative actions and judicial review that we feel obligated to provide some brief commentary on these topics. We have no new perspective to add on the upcoming election, except to say, that all of the most likely potential political outcomes are generally positive for managed Medicaid and related government subsidized programs, although, some political scenarios are more favorable than others. On the legislative front, the recently announced expansion of the COVID public health emergency is likely a positive indicator for continued membership gains and to provide more support for an actuarially sound rate environment. Much has been written and discussed regarding the Affordable Care Act case that is scheduled to be argued before the Supreme Court on November 10. We believe that even if the court were to find the individual mandate to be unconstitutional, it should nevertheless find the individual mandate to be separable from the balance of the law, both as a matter of logic and based on the clear intent of the 2017 Congress, which zeroed out the individual mandate tax penalty. It is also clear as a factual matter that the marketplace business can function effectively without any penalty for failure to purchase health insurance. Regardless of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, we believe there is a high likelihood of a legislative fix to the law before any final legal opinion would go into effect. As I conclude my remarks, I offer another heartfelt thank you to our management team and our 10,000 associates for delivering excellent results, while dealing with their own stresses and life challenges. Even when facing these challenges, our associates are inspired and motivated by the opportunity to make positive change by delivering high quality healthcare to the country\u2019s most vulnerable populations. Our associates continue to excel and I stand in admiration of their dedication and desire to serve our membership base, during these most challenging times. In conclusion, this was yet another meaningful quarter for the company. We are pleased with our third quarter performance, especially, in light of the turbulence caused by the COVID pandemic. We took major steps forward in our transformation. We sustained our margins and did right by our members and customers. We continue to execute on our revenue growth strategy and deployed excess capital in strategic acquisitions. This strong performance points to a very bright future. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom Tran for some additional color on the financials. Tom? Tom Tran : Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. I am going to provide highlights of our financial results for the quarter and then discuss our balance sheet, cash flow, 2020 guidance and 2021 outlook. We reported GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.10 and adjusted earnings per share of $3.36, representing 13% and 19% growth respectively over the same period in 2019. The solid results were supported by premium revenue of $4.8 billion, which grew 17% from the third quarter of 2019 and include 22% year-over-year growth in Medicaid membership, inclusive of the Passport and YourCare acquisitions. As it relates to the COVID-19 impact by line of business, COVID reduce the Medicaid MCR by approximately 90 basis points and the Medicare MCR by approximately 130 basis points. However, COVID related impacts increase a marketplace MCR by approximately 310 basis points. Overall, the impact of COVID on third quarter earnings was negligible to slightly positive. The G&A ratio improves and came in at 7.3% compared to 7.6% in a prior year due to the fixed cost leverage we created from the increase in revenue, offset somewhat by increase in COVID specific costs and the integration of Passport. Now, turning to balance sheet and cash flow. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and our reserve position remained strong. Days in claim payable represent 52 days of medical cost expense compared to 52 days in the second quarter of 2020 and 50 days in the third quarter of 2019. Prior year reserve development for the third quarter of 2020 was negligible, as was the case with a comparable period in 2019. Operating cash flow for the nine months of 2020 was $591 million, reflecting the strong operating results and the timing of government receipts and payments. We extract $120 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter, which brought our parent company cash balance to $1.3 billion and give us ample capacity to fund our recent acquisitions and organic growth initiatives. Debt at the end of the quarter is 1.6 times trailing 12-month EBITDA. Our leverage ratio is 48.2%. However, on a net debt basis, net of parent company cash, the leverage ratio is 25.8%. Taken together, these metrics reflect a conservative leverage position. Our unsecured debt rating was recently upgrade by two notch to Ba3 by Moody\u2019s, a recognition of our operating performance, growth prospects and financial strength. As of September 30, 2020, our health plans has statutory capital and surplus of approximately $2.2 billion, which equates to approximately 365% of risk-based capital. Now turning to our 2020 guidance. We increase our full year 2020 total revenue guidance to approximately $19.6 billion from $18.8 billion, mainly due to the completion of the Passport acquisition in Kentucky and the novation of its Medicaid contract to Molina on September 1. As previously noted, we are maintaining our existing earnings guidance. Let me provide more color on the reasons for this cautious approach. First, while we have enclosed all known COVID related rate refunds in our guidance, additional rate refunds be enacted, such refunds would have a more disproportionate impact in the fourth quarter because of their retroactive nature. And second, there remains a level of uncertainty about COVID itself and/or related medical cost increase or decrease that could occur. If you recall, in the second quarter, we report approximately $190 million to $240 million of net COVID related medical cost decrease due to utilization curtailment. And in this third quarter, medical cost curtailment was $95 million to $105 million. We have been averaging $12 million to $13 million a month in COVID direct costs of care. How these many dynamics play out in a fourth quarter is a matter of significant uncertainty. As Joe mentioned previously, our core performance each quarter has been strong and stable producing at or above $3 of earnings per share. And our business performance is expect to remain strong through the fourth quarter. We will remind investor of the seasonality of the marketplace NCR and higher open enrollment expenses in both the Medicare and marketplace businesses in the fourth quarter. When we report our fourth quarter results, we will provide a clear picture of the run rate of the business, excluding the distortions cost by COVID, all with a goal of presenting a clear baseline off of which to gauge our 2021 guidance. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : Yes. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Matthew Borsch : Hi. Thank you. I was just hoping maybe you could elaborate a little bit further on the pressure factors in the marketplace business. And I guess, I\u2019m a little surprised just because I was unaware of that 300 basis point increase in the MCR there maybe you can parse that out. That would be fantastic. Joe Zubretsky : Sure. Obviously in producing an 81% MCR for the quarter, we clearly underperformed. But 300 basis points of that was directly related to COVID. And it\u2019s all geography based. We have, as you know, a significant amount of membership in Texas, there was a COVID spike in Texas, and it\u2019s certainly impacted our marketplace business. But even with an ex-COVID MCR of 78%, we underperformed. We\u2019ve analyzed it thoroughly. It\u2019s related to the bronze product. Silver product is performing fine. And we think we\u2019re well priced and well positioned and product design and price. We underperformed on two very important operating levers and that is utilization control and the ability to attract and record appropriate risk scores commensurate with the acuity of that population. We have those disciplines in place for our other products and our other businesses through various organizational design issues. We have not yet excelled at those two operating disciplines in the marketplace business and we\u2019ll fix that the way we fixed everything else over the last couple of years. Matthew Borsch : And if I could just ask, given maybe where you\u2019re expecting the full year margin to land for the marketplace businesses. Is that above or below what you would view as sort of target sustainable? Joe Zubretsky : It will likely be below. As you know, a couple of years ago, the last time we gave you long-term targets is that our Investor Day, where we suggested that the long-term after tax margin for the marketplace business was 8.5% to 9.5%. We\u2019re certainly backing off that long-term target. This is a mid-single-digit business, but the likely to underperform after the year, but I think that\u2019s where our long-term margin expectation will lie mid-single-digits. Matthew Borsch : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. Maybe just to follow-up on that. So I guess, when we think about the business for 2021, you\u2019re saying \u2013 it sounds like you\u2019re saying that you\u2019re not worried about the pricing for this business in 2021, that even though costs are up, you\u2019ve priced appropriately, it\u2019s really just operational changes that need to be made for next year. And you should get that business back to normal next year. Joe Zubretsky : That is correct. In that bronze product, our bronze mix is slightly higher this year than last. And the bronze membership actually had a higher churn. And as you know, when you attract a new member, you\u2019re always starting with a risk score of one in new members. They haven\u2019t interacted with the healthcare system yet. So you need to work really hard at making sure, you get the right risk scores. So the fact that higher percentage that membership was new and our bronze mix is slightly higher. Product is adequately priced, product design and our zero-based \u2013 our zero premium products are in the right geographies. We\u2019re well positioned for next year. The companion question is, did you consider all this and the pricing that you filed recently? The answer is yes. We filed prices that included a very conservative pre-COVID medical cost baseline and reasonably conservative trends off that baseline. So our view, this is not a pricing issue. This is a performance issue, and we plan to get that back next year. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, great. And then just to confirm some of the numbers that you mentioned on COVID, the $95 million to $105 million number. Was that a gross number? I think you saw $30 million of COVID costs. Is the $95 million to $105 million net about $30 million or should we think about that as a gross benefit [indiscernible] $30 million offset. Joe Zubretsky : No. You\u2019re correct. That\u2019s net. The gross range of costs curtailment due to the pandemic was $130 million to $140 million and direct costs related to COVID were $35 million, producing the net range of $95 million to $105 million. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. But the $95 million to $105 million is on the same basis as the $190 million to $240 million you mentioned last quarter. Joe Zubretsky : That is correct. The estimates we gave in the second quarter were net of their direct inpatient medical costs related to COVID. Kevin Fischbeck : All right. Perfect. Thank you. Joe Zubretsky : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead, Mr. Rhyee, your line is live. All right. Well, moving on the next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. First question on state to be margin corridors and state rebasing. Joe, can you \u2013 I think you said, margin corridors first little over $80 million this quarter, in terms of payback numbers. Do you have an estimate for the full year on both margin corridors and rebasing? And how you\u2019re thinking about that going into next year? Joe Zubretsky : Sure. Well, just to recap the entire year, $75 million when we reported the second quarter due to six enacted retroactive rate refunds all clearly contained and related to COVID curtailment. That same number for the third quarter with $88 million, meaning we\u2019ve incurred $163 million year-to-date. The third quarter number included one additional state, Michigan that introduced a refund mechanism. And many of those corridors and refund mechanisms extended to the fourth quarter. We haven\u2019t disclosed exactly what that number is and obviously depends on a lot of other profitability factors, but various of those mechanisms do extend into the fourth quarter and we\u2019ll report that number against the COVID curtailment, just the way we did in the second and the third quarters. Long-term, we are very comfortable at the time tested mechanism of prospective rate development off a credible cost baseline and a reasonable trend off that baseline will resume. These refund mechanisms are clearly related to the recruitment of money that was paid to us with the full intention of us, paying it out to members and benefits and due to COVID that level of utilization didn\u2019t occur. So again, very contained, very specific, all related to COVID, when all that the pandemic abates, we believe that the system will function as intended and as time tested process of prospective rate development will resume. Justin Lake : Thanks. And then Joe, when you think about these members, who have the growth in membership, that\u2019s come from the lack of churn in this [indiscernible] I don\u2019t think any of us know, when the federal government is take off the federal emergency status and these members will start being reverified. But I\u2019m curious, as you think into 2021, whenever that does happen. Do you have a view on how these members kind of move off Medicaid, how long it takes for the state steady verify? Joe Zubretsky : It\u2019s a really interesting question, because we have begun conversations with many of our state customers about the prospects of moving members, who are no longer eligible for Medicaid, but we\u2019re on it due to the redetermination paws, how they will move them off. Obviously, and not for revenue reasons, we\u2019re not suggesting that they do it in a stage process for revenue generating reasons. But for the lack of tumult and lack of churn and the disruption, it will create for members who are on Medicaid and are suddenly taken off. So we\u2019re certainly arguing and in support of a more staged approach, but our state customers are still deliberating in terms of whether they\u2019re going to turn the switch off immediately or whether they\u2019re going to face this over time, which again, causes yet another variable. And what the redetermined \u2013 member redetermined patient-based revenue will look like for 2021. How fast those members roll off is still yet to be determined. Justin Lake : Great. Thank you, Joe. Joe Zubretsky : You\u2019re welcome, Justin. Operator : Thank you. And next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Dave Styblo : Hi, good morning. It\u2019s Dave Styblo in for Windley. I was hoping you could talk Joe a little bit more about how you think about the both margin profile for Kentucky in year one. Usually, margins on a new contract are well below the target or even negative earnings in that first period. However, does it considerably help you that you\u2019ll have an existing platform via the Passport acquisition that might allow you to earn something closer to your target margins for all of your Kentucky business in the first year? Joe Zubretsky : Sure. Well, when it comes to our acquisitions, we certainly and the extensive due diligence that we perform. We certainly able to give our investors a clear view of the early accretion, as we\u2019ve done on Magellan and as we just did on Affinity. When it came to Passport, it was a different model. We actually were buying into a membership base, a revenue stream, not necessarily an earnings stream. So we view Kentucky as sort of a hybrid between a new installation and the integration of a business. Now, as you know, the Passport earnings margin profile was not where Molina has operated in the past. So it\u2019s going to take some time to get it there. So we\u2019re going to be very cautious with our early estimate of how much \u2013 how many dollars of earnings will flow off the Kentucky Medicaid business in the first year. And when we report our 2021 guidance, we\u2019ll certainly have a reasonable estimate at that time. But right now, we are in full mode of analyzing Passport and integrating it due to the contract novation we have getting ready for open enrollment. All those processes are fully in motion. But it\u2019s too early to actually have a point estimate on the first year. But I will say that the Passport acquisition clearly allowed us to avoid a lot of the very expensive startup costs that are normally associated with a new contract. Dave Styblo : Got it. Thanks. And then just a follow-up on the parent cash. Can you give us some sense of a roll forward over the next year. So obviously, you\u2019ve got a couple of acquisitions that you have to pay for, but how we should think about that cash balance towards the end of next year. So we can gauge a little bit more about your propensity to an appetite for acquisitions of these assets that you\u2019d like to have a bolt-on such as Affinity. Joe Zubretsky : The way to think about the capital model goes something like this. You can look at our forecasted earnings and except for the amount of capital that one would need to reserve and it\u2019s regulated subsidiaries to fund organic growth, which averages between 8% and 10% of premium. That cash flow ought to be able to be extracted in the form of dividends from our operating subsidiaries. Once it\u2019s brought to the parent company, you can put leverage on it and pick a leverage ratio of 50%, you can double your capacity. So earnings less retained capital for organic growth ought to be dividend to the parent doubled the size of it for debt capacity. And that gives your sort of view of how much free cash flow you have available for acquisitions and other activities. Dave Styblo : Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Josh Raskin of Nephron Research. Josh Raskin : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. First question is just around utilization patterns. And if you feel like towards the end of the quarter, you were back to whatever normal is supposed to look like our baseline, and maybe a progression to the quarter as well as an early view on October. Joe Zubretsky : Sure, Josh. At the beginning of the quarter, we still had the curtailment effect in place and that sort of evaporated as the quarter moved on. Now, I will tell you that toward the end of the quarter, when the infection rate in many of our geographies and across the nation spikes, we saw a reaction to that. We\u2019re learning a lot about consumer behavior and about how the healthcare economy works and how reactive it is. It\u2019s very reactive to the COVID infection rate, both in the number of hospitalizations we have directly related to COVID and how quickly elective and discretionary procedures begin to wane when the COVID infection rate is reported. So the healthcare economy is very responsive to that infection rate. And towards the end of the quarter, we saw it spike back a little bit. Not commenting on October at this point, but as I said, it\u2019s very, very responsive. And the fact that we\u2019re now seeing a resurgence of COVID, I believe, will impact the fourth quarter. You\u2019ll see more COVID related costs, and I believe you\u2019ll see the shadow effect of continued curtailment. Josh Raskin : Perfect. And then just second question, as you think about 2021, you guys gave some visibility into a revenue number last quarter. It sounds like, you\u2019re updating it to be just simply larger. Is there any major difference expected between the top line and bottom line? I just want to make sure I\u2019m not missing something. It sounds like Passport kind of maybe a little bit lower than typical earnings. But just want to make sure there\u2019s no \u2013 there\u2019s nothing brought, I\u2019m missing that large acquired books aren\u2019t going to be similar margins, when you think about the synergies, et cetera. Joe Zubretsky : Well, ultimately, the premise of your question is correct. We plan to get these to our target margins, producing 6%, 6.5% EBITDA margins depending on the geography, we plan to get them there. We gave the accretion numbers for Magellan. We just gave them, at least the first 12 months for Affinity. And I would say, you\u2019re right, on Kentucky, given that it\u2019s a hybrid between an installation and the integration of a non-for-profit plan. I would not giving you a forecast, but I would say that in the first year, that is likely not to perform to our target margin. Josh Raskin : All right. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Sarah James of Piper Sandler. Sarah James : Hi, thank you. I appreciate the commentary on the payback situation in multiple States in Medicaid. And I\u2019m wondering if that also indicates that Medicaid margins are operating near peak. Then if you layer on the lower long-term tax margin guidance, I\u2019m wondering if the right number for the total co is still the 3.8% to 4.2%, that you gave it last I-Day. Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : Let me comment on our margin performance, vis-\u00e0-vis the long-term targets and you\u2019re absolutely right. The last time we updated this, which is now some time ago. We gave you a long-term target of 3.8% to 4.2% and we just produced a quarterly margin of 3.7%, which had somebody you have recognized falls just slightly out of that range. I will remind you that 3.8% to 4.2% included a marketplace target of 8.5% to 9.5%, which were clearly going to come off of that\u2019s going to land in mid-single-digits, not picking a point estimate now. So the fact that we\u2019re actually able to produce 3.7% after tax, when the marketplace this quarter was breakeven. I think we\u2019re still in the strike zone of our long-term targets, even though, we can pullback our projection of what the marketplace business will produce. And the fact that we\u2019re not the chatter two years ago, and it was legitimate was that our financial profile was over-relying \u2013 over reliance on marketplace revenues and profits. That\u2019s certainly not the case anymore, but if we can produce, our long-term part of margins having pulled back our marketplace estimates, I think that\u2019s certainly bodes well for the future. Sarah James : And then on the bronze hicks, but last quarter you guys talked about COVID creating some challenges or delays in getting the adjusted risk scores. I\u2019m just wondering if you learned anything from this year\u2019s process that makes you more optimistic about the new members that come on next year and the pace at which you might get them scored. Joe Zubretsky : Yes, I mean the entire industry is facing the same challenges. As you know in order to get the right codes and the right interventions, people need to go to the doctor. And when they stopped going to the doctor and the hospital, you don\u2019t have the data to support their risks. Some of these require face-to-face interventions. We have a fantastic arm of our business with nurse practitioners and visit patients in their home. They were unable to do that for a long period of time. So we\u2019re sort of facing the same headwind that the rest of the industry is facing with respect to the attainment of risk scores. But as the economy opens up as people get back into the field, again we think this will come back quickly. We know how to get them. We know how to chase the charts, get the codes. And when the world returns to normal movements in consumer activity, we believe this thing snaps back into place. As you know the marketplace business reacts quickly to risk adjustment to immediate Medicare like one year delayed and Medicaid two years delayed. So there\u2019s a lag effect. But we believe as the world comes back to normal, we\u2019ll be able to get our metrics back to where they need to be as well the rest of the industry. Sarah James : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Scott Fidel : Hi, thanks. Good morning. First question, just interested in Joe, I know you talked about how you\u2019re comfortable with the pricing for 2021 and with your exchange products as it relates to the bronze. Just interested in how you\u2019re looking at the overall market pricing environment for the marketplace for next year and how competitive you see that and how that positions you for growth in that market next year given some of the pricing that you\u2019re taking on your own book of business Joe Zubretsky : Sure. There are some new entrants that have entered some of our states, but you know who the big competitors are. We operate at a much different level than many of our competitors that we are going after the highly subsidized members who perhaps just earn a little more money than that would qualify them for Medicaid and we\u2019re leveraging our Medicaid network. So we\u2019re in a slice of the market that\u2019s heavily dependent on the federal subsidy. We think we can grow the pool of profits, trust management to pick the right geographies, push price and ease up on membership or to ease on price to push membership. We\u2019ll make those judgments geography by geography, depending on the strength of the competition, the strength of our network. And we believe as we always have that we can grow the pool of profits. Obviously we\u2019ll be growing it off of a smaller base, even our performance this year, but we\u2019re still pretty confident we can do that. Scott Fidel : Got it. And then just on my follow-up question, why don\u2019t you just ask maybe a little conceptually about how you\u2019re thinking about the New York market and confidence in the rate in regulatory environment when we think of that longer-term, clearly you\u2019ve been deploying a meaningful amount of capital into New York. And from a bottoms up perspective, these are all deals that very much are attractive and fit the Molina profile. At the same time, obviously New York does have some larger long-term budget gaps relative to a lot of other states that are rejected. So just obviously I know that you think about the top down as well so interested in how you\u2019re evaluating just the broader market dynamics. Joe Zubretsky : Well, fair point. And obviously, you\u2019re always balancing those dynamics against where the population is. And if you want to be in the Medicaid business, you can\u2019t ignore places like California and New York where the Medicaid population live. So clearly a New York Metro is a place we want it to be. We have a nice blend of business there now. We have a traditional Medicaid business with the purchase of affinity, and we have a managed long-term care business with the purchase of senior whole health in New York. And you\u2019re right. New York is clearly has budget pressures and lots of other factors that are indigenous to New York. But in buying these properties and projecting the earning stream off of which they\u2019re valued, we certainly took all of that into consideration. So when you\u2019re an incumbent, those things happen, you might have some issues, but when you\u2019re contemplating all those puts and takes, when you\u2019re valuing a property in order to buy it, we\u2019re pretty comfortable that we pay for them correctly. We considered all the puts and takes that could happen in both New York Metro and the State of New York. And we\u2019re very comfortable that these are going to create long-term value with the accretion numbers we\u2019ve given. Scott Fidel : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George Hill : Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I guess, Joe, circling back to the Texas exchange and Medicaid issues. Are you able to call out what types of utilization that you guys saw that drove the MLR up? And I guess what I\u2019m looking for are kind of any consistencies or correlation that, that might \u2013 I guess that might kind of rear its head in the future or kind of maybe even more color on what makes you think that this is kind of a contained issue that\u2019s readily fixable. Joe Zubretsky : Sorry, George, I couldn\u2019t hear the first part of your question. Which business were you referring to? George Hill : The broad business, the exchange business. Joe Zubretsky : And we try to be very clear and transparent if we have an operating issue that didn\u2019t meet our expectations, but I think we need to put a box around this. Our entire marketplace business is 8% of our total revenue and to bronze business is about a quarter of the total marketplace business. It did underperform, but this is boxed, it\u2019s contained, it\u2019s identified, it\u2019s clearly related to operational performance. And we fixed so many operating protocols, introduced so many different performance improvement initiatives over the past couple of years. We\u2019re going to fix this. Again, when you look at where it is and how much of the company\u2019s profile, it actually consumes, it is a very contained, easy to fix issue. So I don\u2019t want to have this painted with a broad brush, because it\u2019s very specific and very contained. George Hill : Okay. And then maybe just a quick follow-up to the question that Justin asked earlier. I don\u2019t know if you guys quantify this, but have you talked about what percent of the membership in Medicaid that you think is at risk of falling off when redeterminations resume? Joe Zubretsky : No, we haven\u2019t. We continue to see the redetermination pause. Last quarter, we broke protocol by giving an inner quarter update. I\u2019ll do the same now. We saw more membership increase in October. I think the number of increase is slightly over 30,000 in the month of October so far. Now that will be offset by our Puerto Rico exit. But in terms of new members coming on through redetermination, it continues into the quarter. But no, as we said in our prepared remarks, how high does the people be, how far \u2013 how quickly it will fall off as the economy approves. And to the point someone made earlier, how will the states actually unwind this in a staged approach or in a sudden approach is still yet to be determined. So no, we have not given any impact of this on our revenue forecast either for the balance for 2021. It certainly increased our revenue outlook for the rest of the year. George Hill : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Stephen Tanal with SVB Leerink. Stephen Tanal : Good morning, guys. Thanks for so much detail today. I guess I\u2019ll just do quick ones that, I don\u2019t know if I missed this, but I don\u2019t think you commented on the risk corridor settlement funding. I think you expected to get about $128 million. Is that still accurate and any plans for that money? Joe Zubretsky : Yes, that is accurate. We received it, $128 million pre-tax. It will be reported in the fourth quarter. And we are likely to have an offsetting amount in the quarter where we will be making a sizable contribution to our new 501(c)(3) charitable trust called the MolinaCares cord foundation. So likely a wash in the quarter when we report the fourth quarter, but yes, $128 million was the pre-tax number. And much of that will be deposited or contributed, I should say to our 501(c)(3) trust. Stephen Tanal : Great, helpful. Thanks, Joe. And then maybe one last one for me, the Ohio rebid just wanted to get your major sort of confidence there and the likelihood of success. Is there an ability to take share? Any commentary there would be helpful. Joe Zubretsky : Well, we have \u2013 we run a fine business in Ohio with 12%, 15% market share. We\u2019re well-positioned across the entire state. And obviously we have our A team on this to key state for us. And we\u2019re very confident that we\u2019ll submit a high quality proposal. That\u2019ll be scored well. But it\u2019s a re-procurement and we\u2019ll submit it on November 20 when it\u2019s due. And when the announcement comes out, we\u2019ll certainly report that, but we have our ATM on this. We run a great business there. And we have every reason to believe we\u2019ll be successful. And not only retaining, but perhaps even expanding. Stephen Tanal : Got it. There\u2019s an opportunity. Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Gary Taylor : Hi, good morning. Thanks for all the detail and the transparency. Most of my questions were answered. So I\u2019ll just ask a couple of little farther down the list. Just going back to Kentucky Passport, what are the applications though of adding the six player? Will there just be auto assignments and we just take a sixth off your expected membership or is it unclear how the allocations will be made at this point? Joe Zubretsky : It\u2019s unclear. And we don\u2019t want to get ahead of our customer on this one, because they have the jurisdiction over how to allocate in a portion membership. But yes, that\u2019s the way we\u2019re thinking about it. We are an incumbent. We\u2019re servicing 320,000 members today as we sit here today through the Passport brand, out of the Molina Healthcare, Kentucky legal entity. And when you introduce a six player, if in fact that\u2019s what\u2019s done, we believe the state will have to go through some process of reapportioning members. How that\u2019s done through auto assignment through or judgment. We just don\u2019t know, and we don\u2019t want to speculate, but that is the practical implication of that ruling that was made last Friday introduction of the six player, which will have to be a portion membership. Gary Taylor : Okay. My one other is just thinking about when you looked at the COVID impact on your exchange business and you geographically called out Texas, if we look at the positive net benefit of COVID and care deferrals on your Medicaid MLR, would you similarly call out California as a geography that disproportionately benefit? Or is there anything else to say about the geography on the Medicaid MLR? Joe Zubretsky : The reason that it\u2019s less pronounced on the Medicaid MLRs, it\u2019s a more diversified book of business in 15 states. So no, I mean there\u2019s California was certainly a pressure point in all of our businesses with COVID as was Texas. But it\u2019s just less pronounced in Medicaid just because of the geographic diversification that we have. Gary Taylor : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is another time from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Charles Rhyee : Hi, can you guys hear me? Hello. Joe Zubretsky : Yes, perfectly. Charles Rhyee : Okay. Yes, sorry about that earlier. Similarly I think I got through most of my questions here. I just wanted to follow-up maybe Joe, when you were talking about the 2021 outlook here, obviously some of your peers have been speaking a little bit more cautiously. I think you\u2019ve obviously given some very solid targets and a positive outlook here. Any other additional comments you could add maybe in terms of what other areas and maybe conservatism that you\u2019re thinking about building in as you\u2019re approaching guidance maybe relative to prior years given sort of \u2013 given the heightened higher uncertainties that we\u2019re in here any other puts or takes that we should take into account, obviously take into account all the other comments you made earlier. Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : No, I think the actually the word you use to ask the question are actually reflective of the situation. There\u2019s clearly more uncertainty and risks to consider. As you move from this very intentive COVID pandemic into what may be a less intentive COVID pandemic environment. But all the puts and takes on managing a managed Medicaid business are certainly in play. It\u2019s \u2013what is the medical cost baseline look like for next year? How it will be influenced by COVID either increased or decreased by direct COVID or COVID curtailment. And then how that cost baseline is reflected in rates. We have good visibility into our rates at this early stage. We are for 2021 revenue base, we know about \u2013 we know the rates and about 40% of the revenue base at this point. When we give guidance in February, we\u2019ll understand the rates and about 70% of our revenues. So we\u2019ll have good visibility into that. And the conversations we\u2019re having with our state customers are very balanced. They\u2019re actuarially sound. They\u2019re based on reasonable cost baselines. But to me, the big issues that you always consider going into a year when you\u2019re trying to forecast earnings is medical cost projection, and how rates will be reflective of that medical cost baseline. And those certainly are the two issues that have to be considered as you look forward to next year. Not to mention the accretion that we\u2019re going to produce from the recent acquisitions that we\u2019ve integrated. Charles Rhyee : Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. And as there are no further questions, that does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session, as well as a conference call. Thank you so much for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Julie Trudell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Molina Healthcare. Please go ahead. Julie Trudell : Good morning, and welcome to Molina Healthcare's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; our current CFO, Tom Tran, who is retiring later this month; and our current Head of Transformation and Corporate Development and CFO-elect, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our fourth quarter earnings was distributed after the market close yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30-days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that the remarks made herein or as of today, Thursday, February 11, 2021, and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. In this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our fourth quarter 2020 press release. During our call, we will be making Forward-Looking Statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, the current environment, recent acquisitions, 2021 guidance and our longer-term outlook. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that can cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report for the 2019 year filed with the SEC, as well as the risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and our Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open up the call and take your questions. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe. Joseph Zubretsky : Thank you, Julie, and good morning. Today, we will provide updates on several topics. First, we will cover enterprise-wide financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2020; second, we will provide initial earnings and earnings per share guidance for 2021; and lastly, we will conclude with some thoughts on our compelling strategic position and our future growth prospects. Let me start with fourth quarter highlights. Last night, we reported GAAP earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of $0.56 with net income of $34 million and total revenue of $5.2 billion a revenue increase of 22% over the prior year. On a normalized basis, defined as adjusted earnings per share and excluding the net effect of COVID, our earnings per diluted share were $2.29 for the fourth quarter. This is consistent with our performance in the first three quarters of 2020, each of which produced approximately $3 per share, after adjusting for the effect of COVID. Two items significantly impacted the earnings in the fourth quarter. The first and most prominent of these items was the net effect of COVID which decreased net income in the quarter by $3.80 per share. The most significant contributor to this impact was the continuation of rate refunds already in flight and the introduction in the quarter of COVID-related retroactive rate actions in California, Michigan and Ohio. These refunds taken together more than offset the net effect of modest utilization curtailment and a high level of COVID direct cost of care. The second significant item having an impact in the quarter came from adjustments that produced a combined net benefit of $1.07 in earnings per share. The most significant of these was a net benefit from the proceeds of federal litigation which was partially offset by a charitable contribution to our foundation. In summary, we are pleased with our normalized fourth quarter performance with respect to both the continued delivery of solid earnings and the focused execution of our growth strategy. All of this was achieved whilst dealing with the effects of the global pandemic. Now turning to the full-year, we reported full-year 2020 GAAP earnings per diluted share of $11.23, with net income of $673 million and a 3.5% after-tax margin. We generated premium revenue of $18.3 billion, an increase of 13% over 2019 reflecting increased membership. We ended the year with four million managed care members, a 700,000 member increase year-over-year, primarily due to growth in Medicaid. Our Medicaid enrollment finished the year strong at 3.6 million members, representing growth of over 640,000 members or 22% over the prior year. This increase reflects strong organic growth of 450,000 members or 15% as the suspension of redeterminations was the major catalyst for our Medicaid membership growth in 2020. Growth of 370,000 members related to the acquisitions of YourCare, which closed on July 1st and Passport, which closed on September 1st. This organic and inorganic growth was offset by the 180,000 member decline related to our planned exit from Puerto Rico. I will now provide additional color on our full-year normalized financial performance which better expresses the underlying strength of our business by isolating the transitory effects of COVID and adjustments. On a normalized basis, our earnings per diluted share were $12.97 for the full-year. Our normalized performance comfortably exceeded our full-year guidance of $11.20 to $11.70 per share, which was established in the absence of COVID and is therefore the most relevant comparison. With respect to medical margins, for the full-year, our MCR on a normalized basis was 85.9% compared to 85.8% in the prior year. In Medicaid and Medicare, our performance met expectations, while in marketplace, our performance is below our expectations. Our normalized G&A ratio for the year was 7.3% compared to 7.7% in 2019 reflecting disciplined cost management and the benefits of scale produced by our substantial growth. We produced a normalized after-tax margin of 3.9% despite our marketplace business underperforming. We are very pleased that while dealing with the medical cost distortions and operational complexity caused by the pandemic, we produced a normalized margin, consistent with our long-term target. Now I will comment on the item-by-item effects of COVID on our full-year 2020 results. The net effect of COVID increased pre-tax income by approximately $180 million or $2.30 per share. This result is the sum of several identifiable positive and negative factors as follows : For the full-year, the net benefit from COVID-related utilization curtailment, offset by direct care related to COVID patients was approximately $420 million on a pre-tax basis. I should note that while utilization was moderately curtailed in both the fourth quarter and the full-year, in the fourth quarter direct COVID medical costs were higher than in any other quarter of the year. For the year, COVID related risk-sharing corridors reduced premium revenue and earnings by approximately $555 million on a pre-tax basis. $400 million of this amount was reported in the fourth quarter as the three new COVID-related risk-sharing corridors went active and corridors already existing at the end of the third quarter remained in effect. For the year, COVID-related activities increased our G&A spend by approximately $35 million on a pre-tax basis. Without question, the effects of COVID created significant distortions to our 2020 operating metrics, but the underlying operating fundamentals and financial metrics remain strong. Turning to our 2021 guidance beginning with premium revenue, we are very pleased with the rapid activation of our growth strategy. In 2021, we project premium revenue of at least $23 billion, a 25% increase over 2020. This growth is well balanced between a new contract win, organic growth both on acquisition benefit expansions in our existing geographies and greater penetration of our Medicare and Marketplace products into our Medicaid footprint. More specifically, our premium revenue guidance includes a full-year of the acquired Magellan Complete Care businesses, which we closed on December 31st. A full-year of Kentucky revenue, which commenced on September 1, 2020, a full-year of revenue from the YourCare membership in upstate New York, which we assumed on July 1, 2020. Marketplace revenue growth of 25% to 30% as we begin this year with more than 500,000 members. The full-year carve-in of the pharmacy benefit in the state of Washington, which is somewhat offset by a partial year of pharmacy carve-outs in New York and California, and the revenue decrease associated with our planned exit from Puerto Rico. The impact of the Affinity acquisition is not included in our premium revenue guidance. We expect the transaction to close as early as the second quarter, so the acquisition could provide $600 million or more in additional premium revenue in 2021. Our guidance includes membership growth relating to the current public off emergency extension set end in mid-April 2021, with a steady decline over the remainder of the year as redetermination is activated. The Biden administration has recently indicated that it is likely the public health emergency will remain in place for the entirety of the year. If so, states could continue to receive the additional 6.2% FMAP match throughout 2021, which would likewise extend the redetermination suspension requirement for the state. Although we have been adding more than 100,000 Medicaid members per quarter during the redetermination suspension in 2020, it is unclear whether this pattern would continue should PHE be extended further. Therefore, we have not included in our guidance an estimate of revenue associated with additional volumes from potential PAG extensions. However, any extension of the PAG accompanied by redetermination suspension could certainly represent upside to our 2021 revenue outlook. We estimate that for every month, the redetermination suspension is extended past April. It could provide additional revenue of approximately $150 million per month. Turning now to earnings guidance, given our recent and expected continued M&A activity, adjusted earnings per share have become a more relevant measure of our earnings going forward and would be the focus of our comments today. Our initial full-year 2021 adjusted earnings guidance is in the range of $12.50 to $13 per share or approximately 20% growth from 2020 adjusted earnings of $10.57 per share. The upper end of our 2021 guidance range is essentially equal to our 2020 normalized earnings per share of $12.97. Our 2021 earnings profile reflects durable and sustainable operating improvements and earnings growth which are being temporarily muted by a [ephemeral] (Ph) industry-wide challenges. Specifically, our 2021 earnings guidance reflects the following positive long-term value drivers : Continued strong performance in Medicaid and Medicare, reflecting an actuarially sound base rate environment. Margin recovery and growth in our Marketplace business which we target to achieve mid-single-digit pre-tax margins for 2021 as a result of our intense focus on operational improvements and continued competitive prices and product designs; and accretion from the Magellan Complete Care businesses into our Kentucky and Passport installation. Our earnings guidance also considers the following industry-wide environmental challenges, including another net negative impact from COVID, although at a reduced level, due to the continuation of many of the risk-sharing corridors that existed in 2020 and the direct cost of COVID-related patient care, offset by the moderate utilization curtailment. And lower-than-expected Medicare risk scores, which are an industry-wide challenge that would pressure results. Our risk scores do not fully reflect the acuity of our membership as in 2020 seniors reduced their access to health care services and therefore, risks or cash is more challenging. Referencing these catalysts and challenges, we now quantify the progression from our 2020 normalized earnings of $12.97 per share to the midpoint of our 2021 adjusted earnings guidance of $12.75 per share. We expect strong core performance to contribute approximately $1.25 in adjusted earnings per share growth, emerging mostly from Marketplace as Medicaid and Medicare margins are near optimal. And accretion from our acquisitions, along with share repurchases, will positively impact adjusted earnings by approximately $1 per share. Offsetting these positive factors are two industry-wide environmental challenges that temporarily pressure earnings, specifically, we expect the net effect of COVID consisting of utilization curtailment and direct cost of care, offset by risk-sharing corridors to continue to negatively impact earnings, but in 2021 by approximately $1.50 per share. And the temporary Medicare risk score shortfall phenomenon would pressure results by approximately $1 per share. All of these items, when combined with the initial performance of recent acquisitions operating below target margins, impact our 2021 MCR and by approximately 200 basis points when compared to 2020 normalized. This corresponds to a 90 basis point impact on the net income margin. Our 2021 guidance represents solid underlying earnings growth, but it is a constrained picture of the embedded earnings power of the company. The financial profile that we can develop when COVID and industry-related headwinds abate. And when our acquisitions achieve their full run rate potential will include : first, the net effect of COVID in the Medicare risk score disruption has created approximately $2.50 of adjusted earnings per share overhang. We would expect this overhang to disappear as COVID abates. Second, once we obtain our targeted margins on Magellan Complete Care and Kentucky and once Affinity is closed and synergized, we would expect to achieve additional adjusted earnings per share of at least $1.50. In short, our pro forma run rate after the natural relaxation of these temporary constraints, would produce an after-tax margin of approximately 4%, which is in line with our recent performance and produce adjusted earnings per share comfortably in the mid-teens. I will now provide a few concluding comments that frame the compelling strategic position we have created. The execution of our margin sustainability and revenue growth strategy has allowed us to create a very attractive financial profile. Despite all of the near-term distortions caused by COVID, the achievement of our 2021 guidance implies generating EBITDA of $1.2 billion with adjusted EBITDA margins in excess of 5%, producing a return on equity of nearly 40% and which is a function of our attractive margin position and disciplined deployment of growth capital; projecting contribution margin upside as we soon expect to achieve our target margins in our acquired businesses. Generating excess cash flow, which, when combined with leverage, gives us the continued ability to acquire businesses in our quarter; producing a two-year compound annual growth rate of 20%; and to summarize, that the durable earnings catalysts being sustained and as the temporary earnings challenges dissipate, our operating profile would produce mid-teens earnings per share. Despite the challenges and near-term distortions caused by the global pandemic, Our confidence in the growth, earnings power and resilience of our business remains high. The inherent growth characteristics of these businesses are exceptionally strong, and we will execute in harvest growth through winning new states, growing market share in our existing states, increasing penetration in high-acuity populations and actioning accretive acquisitions in our core business. We will continue to sustain best-in-class operating metrics and margins drive the top line growth and remain relentlessly focused on our value-creating mission. I will note that despite the vicissitudes of the economy and despite the pandemic, our management team and our associates have demonstrated tenacity, a determination and an ability to deliver. We are in the right businesses with the right people at the right time. Our future is very bright. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom Tran for some additional color on the financials. Tom. Thomas Tran : Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019m going to discuss our balance sheet, cash flow and 2021 outlook. Operating cash flow for the full-year 2020 was $1.9 billion, reflecting the strong operating result rose membership and the timing of government receipts and payments. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters, and our reserve position remains strong. Days in claim payable at the end of the quarter represents 50-days of medical cost expense compared to 52-days in the third quarter of 2020 and 50-days in the fourth quarter of 2019. Prior year's reserve development in the fourth quarter of 2020 was modestly favorable and was negligible in the comparable period in 2019. We extract $280 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter and $635 million year-to-date. The parent company cash balance at December 31, 2020, were $644 million, a decrease from the prior quarter cash balance of approximately $1.3 billion, due primarily to the cash outlay for the Magellan Complete Care acquisition. As of December 31, 2020, our health plans had total statutory capital and surplus of approximately $2 billion, which equates to approximately 330% of risk-based capital. Through December 31, 2020, we repurchased an aggregate of approximately 760,000 shares for $159 million. At an average price of approximately $208 per share. We continue to reduce our cost of capital. In November of 2020, we closed on a private offering of $650 million senior notes due November 2030 and used a portion of the proceeds to repay the $330 million senior notes. Debt at the end of the quarter is 2.1 time trailing 12-month EBITDA. Our leverage ratio is 53%. However, On a net debt basis, not a parent company cash, the leverage ratio is 45%. Taken together, these metrics reflect a reasonably conservative leverage position. Now turning to guidance, we introduced our initial full-year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $12.50 to $13. We expect premium revenue to exceed $23 billion a greater than 25% increase over 2020, and total revenue is expected to exceed $24 billion. We expect the medical care ratio to be approximately 88%. The MCR increase over 2020 is primarily due to the continuing net effect of COVID, temporary Medicare risk score disruption and higher MCR from recent acquisitions. We expect our adjusted G&A ratio to improve to approximately 7%. This reflects continued disciplined cost management, revenue growth, and fixed cost leverage. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 25.6%. And adjusted after-tax margin is expected to be approximately 3%, which is impacted by approximately 90 basis points related to the items I just mentioned, including the continuing net effect of COVID, Medicare risk scores and initial performance of recent acquisition operating below target margins. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. please go ahead. Matthew Borsch : Yes good morning. I was hoping you could just talk a little bit about the marketplace special enrollment period. And how you expect that to impact you when you take into consideration what you have characterized this underperformance in 2020? Joseph Zubretsky : Sure, Matt. Our forecast for membership in the marketplace starting the year with 500,000 ending the year with just under four and a thousand and didn't contemplate the special enrollment period. We are certainly aware of it. We certainly have forecasted what it could provide. And for those 90-days, it couldn't provide anywhere from 20,000 to 30,000 additional members. We are forecasting that potentially it could provide an extra $100 million to $150 million of revenue for the year. Now in the context of our margin recovery process, it is unaffected by that. We are very comfortable with the pricing we put into the marketplace, we are very comfortable with our product designs and our benefit designs, our product positioning, and we are very comfortable in achieving our mid-single-digit pre-tax margins for the year, irrespective of any additional revenue attained to the special enrollment period. Matthew Borsch : And maybe if I, just related to that, how much do you think the competitive environment in the marketplace impacts your efforts to get to the mid-single-digit level? Joseph Zubretsky : Well, it is very competitive. There is lots of new entrants, but we are very confident. And one of the reasons we are confident is the two areas of operational let down, if you will in 2020, utilization review and attainment risk scores. We have introduced operational excellence of those two operating fundamentals and our other two businesses. We are really good at it in Medicaid and really good at it in Medicare. And we were just behind and importing those skills that exist in our company to the marketplace platform. That has been corrected. And so we are very comfortable that by executing across those two fundamentals, we will get back to mid-single-digit margins. Matthew Borsch : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ricky Goldwasser : Hi, good morning. A couple of questions here. Just thinking about the onetime items in 2021, just to clarify, as we think about 2022, what can we exclude from the sort of temporary onetime headwind? As we think about sort of kind of like the starting point for next year? Because it just a COVID it caused and a number of moving parts in it. Joseph Zubretsky : Sure. During our prepared remarks, we gave a sort of a qualitative bridge - quantitative bridge committed bridge and understanding the catalysts and pressures inside our 2021 guidance all with the goal of helping our investors understand what might be looked at as a jumping off point into 2022. So here are the puts and takes. First of all, the net effect of COVID of $1.50 per share or $110 million of pre-tax will dissipate overtime as utilization comes back to normal, as the risk quarters disappear that $1.50 overhead will evaporate as the pandemic is solved. In addition, the Medicare risk score phenomenon, last year was an interesting year. Seniors didn't access health care. And so interacting with them, getting the right codes to attain the right risk force us was a challenge, not just for us, but for many of our competitors. Next year, we will either - meaning this year, we will either attain the risk scores, because they will be getting services, or if we aren\u2019t satisfied that we can, we can include that in our bids. And last year, obviously, the bids were done far before the impact of COVID has ever known. So we are very comfortable that combined at $2.50 overhang sort of disappears as COVID gets behind us. As we said, in addition, our acquisitions are being integrated really, really well, and we are very comfortable with the $1 of accretion that we are putting in this year's guidance, but we are also comfortable in saying, that when they hit their full target margin and when Affinity is closed and hit its target margin, there is an additional $1.50 of earnings per share there. So all in, there is a good $4 of earnings per share embedded power sitting inside our 2021 guidance. Ricky Goldwasser : And just to follow when we think about the acquisitions, I mean, clearly, you have done multiple acquisitions in 2020. How should we think about sort of management bandwidth to continue to do acquisitions in 2021 or should we think about you kind of taking sort of a pause this year, making sure that they are all integrated getting to the target margin and then coming back to the market? Joseph Zubretsky : We have created the bandwidth. We have an expert M&A team that finds the properties and knows how to action them and close them. We have built a world-class integration team. The Passport integration is going really well and the early read on the Magellan integration is going really, really well. That is why we are so comfortable in affirming the accretion targets that we have given you. We have actually very fortunately, laid out quite nicely on a timeline. By the time Magellan is fully integrated, we would just be closing on Affinity, perhaps by the second quarter. And so if we action one, two or who knows how many more this year and they close either late in the year, early next year, the timeline couldn't be more amenable to being very effective at integrating them and harvesting the accretion that we promised our investors. Ricky Goldwasser : Thank you. Joseph Zubretsky : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Robert Jones : Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess maybe just two on the bridge and I appreciate you guys breaking out a lot of these components, it looks like the core growth off of that 2020 baseline of $12.97 would be somewhere in the 9.5% range. I'm not sure how much of the HIF benefit would be flowing through. But obviously, that is below the long-term target of 12 to 15. Just wanted to see if you could maybe walk through some of the moving pieces here and probably more importantly, how you are thinking about the timeline to get back into that into that long-term range of 12 to 15. Joseph Zubretsky : I want to make sure I understand your question. You are talking about the puts and takes within our 2021 guidance or beyond. Robert Jones : Yes. Sorry, just in 2021, it seems like if you look at the core growth that you have laid out in these slides of $1.25 on top of the kind of $12.97, obviously, that would be below the long-term targets. Just curious if you could talk through kind of getting back towards that range. And obviously, it sounds like there are some tailwinds that are not necessarily baked in yet, which I'm sure would be helpful. But I just wanted to get your thoughts on the growth you have laid out here at the core versus getting back to the long-term range. Joseph Zubretsky : Sure. Well, bear in mind that the core performance here is irrespective of the net effect of COVID, which is tracked in a different place as the way we have articulated this. So the $1.25 is mostly the marketplace since that was the business that underperformed last year. It was just about breakeven in 2020, and we are targeting mid-single-digit pre-tax. And if you look at the potential for $1.9 billion, $2 billion of revenue, you can start to formulate a picture of how that is a significant contributor to the $1.25 core performance tailwind into this year. There are some puts and takes there, but with Medicare and Medicaid margins where they are, we are going to grow the top line and obtain the margin position there is. But there is not a lot of margin upside in Medicare and Medicaid. So we are very comfortable with the position that we presented here from a core business perspective. Medicare and Medicaid are pretty much optimized with respect to margins. The marketplace as a first step to getting back to where we said we would be. A mid-single-digit pre-tax margin would be our target for 2021. Robert Jones : Now, that is super helpful. I guess just one follow-up on the bridge, the dollar you have here for acquisitions and repos, and if I remember, I think you guys had called out $0.50 to $0.75 expected from Magellan. It sounded like YourCare and maybe the Puerto Rico exit would roughly net out. So $0.40 for repo and I think fast forward would be the other swing factor. I guess, first, does that math make sense as far as trying to bridge to that dollar and then how should we think about the split between repo and Passport to make up that $0.40 balance? Joseph Zubretsky : Yes, you are generally in the right area. If I were to break apart the dollar, I would say that $0.75 is Magellan, which is the top end of the range that we committed to for the first full-year of ownership, $0.10 on Kentucky. It would be very close to breakeven in the first full-year of ownership, and we will drive it to peak margins after that and about $0.15 on buyback. That is how you get to the dollar. Robert Jones : Super helpful. thanks Joe. Joseph Zubretsky : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead. Charles Rhyee : Yes, hi thanks for taking the question. Joe, I just wanted to just follow-up to just to clarify one other thing. I apologize if I missed that. When we talk about the net effect of COVID in the $1.50, is that pulling out all the effective COVID you have been for acquisitions? I guess the question is in your assumptions for accretion here in 2021 for something like Kentucky, are you factoring in the impact of COVID or Passport within the acquisition bucket or is it all in the COVID bucket? Joseph Zubretsky : We have attempted to capture all COVID impacts in the COVID line item. And just to sort of reframe how we track that, our estimate of COVID impact, is the amount of medical cost suppression we believe we have observed offset by the direct cost of caring for COVID patients. And then, of course, both offset by the impact of any liabilities generated due to the retroactive rate refunds or corridors. That is how we capture it. And if it related to an acquisition is captured in the COVID line. Charles Rhyee : Okay, thank you. And just a quick follow-up in Kentucky and Passport, do we have a sense yet on timing for when they are going to do sort of the on enrollment, so you will know what your sort of membership numbers will look like? Joseph Zubretsky : In Kentucky, the open enrollment period was extended to March 15th. So there is still members moving around. We began the year with 320,000 members. The latest accounting has us about in that same zone. But on March 15th, the period will shutdown, and we will know how many members that we are beginning our new contract with. Charles Rhyee : Okay. Great. Thank you. Joseph Zubretsky : Operator : Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Gary Taylor : Hey good morning Joe. I just wanted to make sure I understand what you are saying about your reverification assumptions. So when we look at, for example, the bridge between 2020 and 2021, that $1.25 of core growth, you are saying most of that is from exchanges. But if you are anticipating at this moment that you are still going to have reverifications in mid-year start to take place and some of your Medicaid enrollment rolling off, I'm presuming there is like a net negative number embedded in there. Is that the right way to think about it and I just want to make sure you are suggesting if that doesn't happen this year, whatever the embedded negative number is that comes back and can you size that for us? Joseph Zubretsky : Sure. It is interesting because it is all about your assumption of how fast membership roles will attrite once the states turn redetermination back on. But I would tell you, in our numbers, the way the membership flows, both in 2020 and 2021, there is actually a member month increase in 2021, just based on the timing of both acquisitions and redetermination. So no, I would say that the redetermination process is with the 100% upside to our revenue and earnings picture in the year. We just felt it wasn't prudent nor did we have any credible way of estimating how many more members we would get if the redetermination pause was extended, and then how fast would they actually roll off depending on how states plan to implement the reintroduction of the determination. So I would just say that the redetermination issue or phenomenon is upside to both our revenue and earnings guidance for the year. Gary Taylor : So you have still got enrollment growth playing out now through the first half, some assumptions about some leakage in the second half, but that weighted average is still positive year-over-year. Joseph Zubretsky : Yes. The way we look at it on a Medicaid basis, we are beginning the year with 3.6 million members. On January 1st, 200,000 members come over due to MCC. And in the first quarter, based on our historical average of about 30,000 a month during redetermination suspension. We pull in another 100,000 members. It would hit its peak at 3.9, but then 600,000 would roll off in the balance of the year. Now that is a pretty quick roll off, and it might happen slower, which is another perhaps element of conservatism in our forecast. And yes, if you then process that against 2020 and the timing of how membership grew and the timing of our acquisitions, there is actually a 9% number month growth in 2021 on Medicaid. Gary Taylor : Very helpful. Thank you. Joseph Zubretsky : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks, good morning. A couple of questions here. First, Joe, a lot of people at JPMorgan got the impression that that the COVID headwind was going to be materially less than the $2. So I'm curious if there is something that happened between then and now to push that number up closer to $2. And then you did a great job of kind of laying out for us the 2020 components within the COVID headwind. Can you do the same for 2021 and specifically on utilization? Can you tell us where you expect COVID cost to be versus normal utilization? Thanks. Joseph Zubretsky : Sure, sure, so let's provide the context for 2020. Our estimate of medical cost suppression for the entire year was about $620 million. That was offset by approximately $200 million of the direct cost of COVID care for COVID patients, netting to a $420 million surplus, we hesitate to call it a benefit, a surplus due to the impact on medical costs from the COVID pandemic. And this is not an estimate, it is an actual number, recorded $565 million of rate refunds, risk-sharing quarter of liabilities in the year and that combined with additional G&A of $35 million resulted in a net $180 million cost of COVID in our company for the year, which is $2.30 a share. Juxtaposed against that, to answer now your direct question, we are forecasting a more moderate, more modest level of suppression. And the reason is both the supply and demand side of the health care economy were shutdown last year for a while. Patients were afraid to go in for services. And if they wanted them, there were many executive orders and direct mandates not to provide elective and discretionary procedures. The supply side is open for business this year, but we still think there would be a demand side softening and will result in utilization suppression of somewhere around $200 million for the year, which is one-third of the amount of suppression we experienced in 2020. We will incur direct costs of COVID care. And the net of all that is somewhere between $140 million and $150 million. Most of this, we forecast will happen in the first half of the year. Hopefully, the vaccinations in the vaccine and social distancing will cause all this to really dissipate in the later half of the year. Now against that, we are also forecasting approximately $250 million of impact from retroactive or not retroactive, but risk-sharing quarters, I should say, which nets to about $110 million, which is your $1.50 a share. So the gross numbers are a lot less dramatic, but it is still netting to $1.50 a share. One of the reasons we are very comfortable of this estimate is really we focus on the net impact. Because if utilization is higher or lower than expected, there would be some flex up and down with the risk-sharing corridors. There is actually sort of a natural hedge between the suppression and the corridors themselves. So we look at the net number, we are very comfortable with that net number. And as the pandemic goes away, we think this goes back to normal times, and there would be no impact from COVID on a going-forward basis, obviously. So I hope that helps that tail with tape. I know that was pretty detailed, but that is what's included in our $1.50 estimate for the cost of COVID for 2021. Justin Lake : Joe that is really helpful and so what you are seeing here effectively is you have got $110 million risk corridor whole where they are just setting your margins lower than your typical target, and that is really the problem. The other stuff is going to flex up and down, but you are below target here by $110 million. like all of your states at this point have risk corridors, is there any uncertainty around more of them coming on? Joseph Zubretsky : Let me address the first part. The answer to the first part, the response is, yes, that is true. If you are already in a risk corridor and your medical costs go up or down, there is no net impact on the company. But that is the way to look at it, that because risk sharing corridors didn't address COVID suppression specifically, it just addressed through MLR, then if you are outperforming your MLR targets, you are getting back some money to the state. So the intention was to have a direct correlation between COVID suppression in a corridor, but the corridor is against medical costs generally. So the fact that we are very profitable in some states, the fact that we outperform many of the market participants in some states, the rate refund number is probably a little higher than people might have expected. But the answer to your second part of your question is correct. It will flex up and down in a state where we are already in a corridor and we are a state where there is not, we would either enjoy the benefits of additional surplus or the effects of additional higher medical costs. The only state that made - the biggest state that does not have a corridor in 2021 is California. Texas and Washington already have done and all of our other states continue them on into 2021. Justin Lake : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel : Hi, thanks. Good morning. First question, Joe, I just wanted to just talk a little conceptually about the long-term margin target. It looks like you gave us a crosswalk back to that 4% level that you had been guiding for us, the long-term view for the last couple of years. And just interested, though, and maybe taking the other side that a bit just in terms of comfort with that sort of longer term, just when we think about the exchange margin profile, you have rebate that since your Investor Day a couple of years ago, you guys are doing more inorganic growth, acquiring lower-margin businesses. So there is sort of a consistent mix impact that will likely come from that. And then also just at some of these risk corridor programs, the states end up liking them a bit light and end up keeping them. So I just wanted to just get your thoughts on sort of framing some of those maybe longer-term headwinds against that 4% long-term target. Joseph Zubretsky : Sure, Scott. As we sit here in the second year of this global pandemic, we are not going to update our long-term margin guidance. We are just sort of going to go as you go, as you plow through this, start to form your views of what the landscape is looking like as you plow through it. I think that is the more prudent approach. But having said that, when you actually look at the pro forma impacts of many of these phenomenon that we consider quite temporary, you can pro forma this thing back to the high 3s or close to 4%. To the second part of your question, I actually hope that we always have a decrement sitting inside our margin for acquisitions that do not perform in their first year. That is a good decrement to have because if we can buy properties that are underperforming and with sweat equity, get them to perform, that is just another form of accretion. So the 40 basis points, this 40 basis points in our margin in 2021 in our guidance, that is literally related to the underperformance in the first year of our acquired properties both on the G&A line and on the MCR line. In the last part of your question was related to the risk corridors. Look, when they were introduced in 2020, they were clearly related to pandemic. They were presented that way, they were retroactive because they had to be because they were introduced mostly after the pandemic started. As they were reintroduced for 2021, they were presented as pandemic-related. The feeling was that there could be strange effects from the pandemic additional COVID costs, the cost of the vaccine, additional suppression, and that is why they were introduced on a symmetrical basis. You are protected on the downside and the state is protected on the upside. In CMS' approval guidelines, they have clearly stipulated that when they receive these for approval, they are viewing these as being attributed to the utilization impacts related to the pandemic. So it has been pretty clear to us that they were presented as relating to pandemic. CMS is approving them on the basis of relating to the pandemic. And we believe when the pandemic dissipates that these will disappear as well and will be back to the traditional rate-setting environment where rates are set prospectively using a credible medical cost baseline and a trend off that baseline. Scott Fidel : Got it. And then just for my follow-up question. I know a lot of this content has just come out in the last day or two, and you guys are probably absorbing it. But just interested, Joe, in sort of your framing on some of the proposals that came out of ways and means on expanding the HIC subsidies and from E&C on some of the Medicaid expansion proposals and how you would frame the opportunity from that? And then I guess also caveated with that because they use reconciliation, the funding for it is only temporary for two-years. So I guess there would be questions on sustainability right at the funding, for example, the Republicans took back it to the House or the Senate in 2022. Joseph Zubretsky : Well, thanks for that question. We are only three weeks into the new government and look what has been done. We all knew that the new government would be proponents of the social safety net of making sure the disadvantage have access to high-quality health care and plenty of subsidies so they can afford it. And look what has happened just in the first three weeks in terms of the executive order, at least the intention to extend the PHE to the end of the year. the executive order to introduce the special enrollment period on the marketplace. The executive order that the euphemism in the executive order was encouraging states to look at prior administration policies, which was really taking a shot at the public chargeable and Medicaid work requirements. So just what's come out of the White House in the past three weeks is incredibly bullish on government-sponsored health care, particularly for the disadvantaged. To your other point, things can get done through the reconciliation process and they are going to. The three committees in the house that generally write to health care issues are ways and means energy, e-commerce and oversight. And look at the language that they are introducing, increasing subsidies in the marketplace up to 150% of FPL. Making the product accessible to people over 400%, capping the cost at 8.5% of their income, and so on and so on and so on. Just in three weeks of a new government, both in the legislative bills that are coming out of the House and from Executive order in the White House just couldn't be better for government-sponsored Managed Care, and we are pleased to see that progress already being made. Scott Fidel : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead. David Windley : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Joe good morning. I wanted to follow on Gary's line of questioning on the redetermination. Last time around that when it was turned back on, there was kind of this realization that the risk profile or the margin on those folks redetermined off was pretty attractive, like maybe even included a lot of zero utilizers. I'm wondering if you think that is likely to happen this time around when that finally gets turned back on. And have you made that assumption in your guidance or in your estimates? Joseph Zubretsky : The answer to your last part of your question, Dave, is no, we haven't. But it still remains to be seen what it does to the acuity of the population. Now because we haven't introduced many more members in our forecast, so our guidance only includes 100,000 member growth in the first quarter of the year and then the attrition starts in the last three quarters of the year. But we certainly have not forecasted a continued softening of the acuity profile of our membership base. And in fact, if that in fact happens, and it happens in a quarter, say, it will go back against corridors anyway. So net-net, The impact of the extension of the redetermination suspension is a net positive, on any dimension, it is a net positive to our guidance. We did not include any members past the first quarter, we rolled them off pretty quickly. As I said in my prepared remarks, if you take 500,000 members, which is sort of what we got in redetermination for every month at $300 PMPM there is $150 million of additional revenue. What is the margin profile of that revenue, you can speculate that it is very, very good as the acuity population improves as you get more members. But we have not included any of that impact in our guidance for the year, either the membership flow or a acuity improvement that is sort of a positive jolt to our earnings and earnings per share. David Windley : Okay. And follow-up then, separate topic. As you think about to your comments earlier on having built the bandwidth and the integration team to continue to look at M&A, as you look at targets, does a thought around the balance of how you would like to build your book of business influence what you are looking at, i.e. increasing MA and - well, really MA, I guess, from an acquisition standpoint, in your mix or is it more opportunistic and what looks the best? How do you think about the balance of your book as it relates to inorganic growth? Joseph Zubretsky : We would love to balance it out with more Medicare. They are hard to find. But we would love to balance out with more Medicare. We are growing it nicely organically, but we would love to find properties that have Medicare Advantage or D-SNP populations. I would say along the lines you have asked the question, we more look to the state. Is it a bolt-on within a state where we don't have so much market share that we couldn't get it done? Lighting up new states is really important. High acuity, really important, we are really good at high acuity. And there is a lot of players out there that have a lot of high-acuity lives and have little ability to manage them. So the upside on $1,500 of premium per month is huge, huge margin potential. So I would actually say that the geography is important, we love high acuity. And if they are underperforming but not broken, all the better because then we will take our operating team, open up the Molina playbook and drive accretion through margin expansion. David Windley : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. Just wanted to make sure that I understand, you talked a lot about redeterminations this year. But I guess in theory, it is a headwind in 2022 guidance. It is not something that you guys spiked out as something that would be contrary to that $4 of earnings power. I wasn't sure if that was included in your kind of net COVID number when you thought about 2022 or that is something that we should separately identify if it is separate, are there any other kind of factors we should take into account? Joseph Zubretsky : No. I mean, since we did not put the - any impact, if there is a positive impact from redetermination in 2021, since it is not in our guidance, we did not - then, therefore, create a headwind in 2022. So just to be very clear, I appreciate the question, any impact from the extension beyond April of any additional membership or a slower attrition of membership is not in our revenue guidance. And any profit enjoyed by additional member months in 2021 is not in our guidance. So as I said, we are really comfortable to it, there is only upside to 2021 on the redetermination suspension. Kevin Fischbeck : Well I'm talking about what is in 2021 in your guidance, because you have it going through April and then slowly coming off as the year goes on. So to your point about member months, you will end at your Medicaid enrollment number, but your member months in 2021 will be higher than your 2022 member months just because redeterminations in for the first full quarter and partially rolling off as the year goes on. Joseph Zubretsky : Sure, I understand your question. I'm sorry, I apologize I misunderstood your question. No, and again, we weren't giving a specific 2022 outlook. We are more trying to craft the bridge that we gave you as if we are guiding to $13 a share for 2021, sitting inside that is an earnings power that is higher than $13 due to some temporary phenomenon. But we weren't necessarily trying to extend into 2022 with an earnings or revenue bridge. Sorry, I misunderstood your initial question. But now that will come at a later date. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, so that is something else we should factor in to think about earnings power then? Joseph Zubretsky : Sure, unless the suspension goes on and members stay on through the end of 2021, depending on other acquisitions that we might do, then there is the Affinity piece that is coming in. So we are not doing a 2022 guidance bridge per se. But I understand your question, and it is a legitimate one. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay and then maybe just a second question, then the exchanges, it is obviously unusual to see a company grow very quickly and expand margins the way that you guys did. Obviously, it sounds like risk coding is part of it. But how should we think about that business? is 2021 guidance normalized margin? And how do you think about long-term the top line growth outlook for exchanges? Joseph Zubretsky : We are going to be guarded in giving a forecast of where the margins will land. The competitive landscape changes every day. We are very comfortable in getting this to mid-single-digit pre-tax this year. Now our hope, again, given the competitive landscape, that would lead to mid-single-digit after-tax in the future. That is where we think the business could perform. But let's work through the 2021. There is a lot of revenue to bring on, a lot of members to service. Some of them are new. We will have to get their risk scores. So one step at a time, I asked my team, let's get to the mid-single-digit pre-tax margin this year. And then as we prepare our bids for 2022, let's sort through how much margin we think we can get and how much membership we think we can get. But starting the year with 500,000 and a 25% to 30% revenue growth year-over-year was a nice start to get back in the game in this business. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Alright, thanks. Joseph Zubretsky : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Joshua Raskin : Thanks. Good morning. A question on the Medicare risk or headwind of the dollar per share, I sort of calculate that to about 3% of your total Medicare revenues which seems a little bit higher than I think what some others are suggesting. So I guess my question would be how much of your overall Medicare premium dollar actually comes from risk adjusters? And then are there any actions you are taking sort of shorter term to try and improve that risk scoring this year as you sort of get ready for next year and to the bids in the middle of the year? Joseph Zubretsky : Yes, Josh, truth be told in that dollar is a little bit from the physician fee schedule. So we just didn't think it was that big enough to call out. So there is a little bit of physician fee schedule in there. But you are in the right zone, 2.5% to 3%, our risk score revenue is multiples of that, two to three times that at least from what I recall. And the industry had a choice last year. We are in the middle of the pandemic, it just started in March and April. We are now starting to develop your bid. And for the most part, while we always tend to be conservative in our bids, we didn't put any specific load for, okay, we are going to fall short on risk scores. Obviously, with hindsight, that cost us three points on the revenue line. But next year, meaning this year, we will either have an estimate of what we think we can attain, and then based on what we target for benefit design and our margins, we would then allow for that in the bid we submit. So either way, whether we get the risk for or whether we price to it, we think this is a one-year phenomenon. That is the way we look at it. Joshua Raskin : Okay, got it. But it could be as much as a third to even half of your total risk score revenues disappearing this year. That is sort of the math, right? Joseph Zubretsky : I think it is about a third. I will check that, but I think it is about a third. Joshua Raskin : And then just a quick follow-up on your margins, where did you end 2020 full-year margins in Medicaid and Medicare? Joseph Zubretsky : Where did we end? Well, again, depending on whether you look at a normalized basis or not, but, On adjusted earnings for 2020, we are at 3.3% net income margin, normalized 3.9%. And I would tell you that the individual margins for the lines of business were generally in line with our long-term targets. So 3.3% adjusted, 3.9% normalized, and the lines of business, acceptable marketplace, obviously, which is close to breakeven, we are pretty much in line. Joshua Raskin : Alright. Operator : Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : Well thank you for that. Joe, as it relates to the Medicare risk scoring, I guess, can you talk about the timing or your expectations as it relates to the ability to conduct the beneficiary valuations and maybe talk about what you have seen in the back half of 2020 and kind of the expectations as we roll through 2021 just as your ability to get in front of these people? Joseph Zubretsky : Sure, well, utilization did remain suppressed through the balance of 2020. It wasn't as suppressed late in the year. But look, our team is on this. We have a crackerjack Medicare team. They are all over this, and their instructions are very simple, have a credible estimate of how many interactions you can actually achieve, what is your reasonable estimate of proper risk scores attained. And to the extent it falls short of your long-term expectation, make sure you consider it in your bid. So either way, and obviously, with the goal of making sure your product remains competitive with benefit designs from competitors. So the team is all over it. And the good news is this year, we will have full visibility. Last year, it was [indiscernible] submitting your bids right as the pandemic was in full throttle. And we made the conscious decision not to introduce that into our bid. This year, we would think otherwise. George Hill : Okay. Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joe Zubretsky for any closing remarks. Joseph Zubretsky : Thank you, operator. When we started this transformational journey over three-years ago, the work ahead moved pretty large. We knew that if we form the right team, that we could succeed, so we sought to recruit Managed Care industry veterans, battle-hardened veterans, if you will, who would know exactly what to do. Tom Tran personifies that. We developed a durable financial infrastructure that has been instrumental in our early success and which will have lasting impact. The team we built is a high-performing one, and we are very confident in their continued success. Tom's tireless energy, steady hand and good nature will certainly be missed by us all. Tom, on behalf of all of our constituents, and from me personally, thank you for your immense contribution to our success, and we wish you the best of luck and good health in your retirement. Operator, with that, we will end our call today. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Julie Trudell. Please go ahead. Julie Trudell : Good morning and welcome to Molina Healthcare's first quarter 2021 earnings call. Joining me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our first quarter earnings was distributed after the market close yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30-days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those who listen to the rebroadcast of the presentation, we remind you that the remarks made herein or as of today, Thursday, April 29, 2021, and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. In this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our fourth quarter 2021 press release. During our call, we will be making certain Forward-Looking Statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding to the COVID-19 pandemic, the current environment, recent acquisitions, 2021 guidance and our longer-term outlook. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that can cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report for the 2020 year filed with the SEC, as well as the risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and our Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open up the call and take your questions. Lastly, we want to invite you to attend our virtual 2021 investor day meeting scheduled for Friday, September 17, where we will share more about our future growth plan and longer term strategy. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe? Joseph Zubretsky : Thank you, Julie and good morning. Today, we will provide you with updates on several topics. We will cover our financial results for the first quarter 2021. We will update our 2021 guidance in the context of our first quarter results and we will then provide an update on our growth initiatives and outlook for the future. Let me start with first quarter highlights. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of $4.44 with adjusted net income of $260 million and premium revenue of $6.3 billion. Our results for the quarter were strong across many dimensions. The 86.8% MCR demonstrates solid cost management fundamentals particularly in light of some of the challenges presented by the pandemic. We managed to a 7% adjusted G&A ratio as we continue to reinvest the benefits created by our strong enterprise wide fixed cost leverage in our growth initiatives. We produced an adjusted after tax margin of 4% squarely in line with our long term targets in exceeding our first quarter expectations. Our $4.44 adjusted earnings per share in the quarter were a 47% increase over the first quarter of 2020 and we accomplished all of this as we are generating 47% year-over-year premium revenue growth and successfully integrating businesses representing approximately $5 billion in annual revenue. In summary, we are very pleased with our first quarter performance as we executed well, delivered solid operating earnings, and continued to deliver on our growth strategy. Let me provide some commentary highlighting our first quarter performance. Premium revenue was $6.3 billion, a 47% increase over the first quarter of 2020 reflecting increased membership, in line with our expectations in both Medicaid and Medicare and exceeding our expectations in marketplace. We ended the quarter with 4.6 million managed care members, an increase of 573,000 over the fourth quarter 2020. Our Medicaid enrollment at the end of the quarter was 3.9 million members, an increase of 260,000 over the fourth quarter of 2020. This sequential increase was the result of strong organic growth of 63,000 members, as the suspension of redetermination in a slowly recovering economy continued to positively impact Medicaid membership. Although this growth catalyst seems to have moderated and growth of 197,000 members from the acquisition of Magellan Complete Care which closed on December 31. Our Medicare membership was 126,000 at the end of the quarter representing growth of 11,000 over the fourth quarter of 2020 which was primarily related to our acquisitions. Our marketplace membership grew by 302,000 in the quarter to 620,000, exceeding our initial forecast of at least 500,000 members. This growth was driven by several factors; strong product design and competitive pricing, effectuation rates substantially higher than historical averages, lower than expected natural attrition rates, and the extended open and special enrollment periods. Turning now to our medical margin results for the quarter. Our first quarter 2021 MCR was 86.8%, reflecting modest COVID related utilization curtailment, severe winter weather, and the absence of a traditional flu season offset by the direct costs of COVID related care. While the net effect of COVID for the total company was negligible in the quarter in line with our expectations, the impact varied by line of business. Our Medicare and marketplace businesses experienced a disproportionately negative impact from the net effect of COVID exerting pressure on their respective MCRs. This was offset by a modest favorable net COVID impact in Medicaid. Some additional comments on performance by line of business. In the Medicaid business, we achieved an 87.5% medical care ratio for the first quarter performing in line with our expectations. In addition to the external factors mentioned previously, which were unusually favorable in the quarter, the medical care ratio was also supported by our performance and utilization management and payment integrity. A portion of our Medicaid outperformance was recaptured by the risk sharing corridors and impact which was well within our expectations. The corridors are designed such that they will act as a buffer to absorb some of the over and underperformance related to medical margin no matter how that performance is derived. Our Medicare business produced a medical care ratio of 90.3% for the first quarter. The medical care ratio was negatively impacted by higher than expected direct costs of COVID related care and the temporary industry wide challenge of risk score capture, which results in risk scores that do not fully reflect the acuity of the membership. The Medicare business performed as expected when normalized for these two discrete impacts. Finally, our marketplace business experienced a medical care ratio of 77.3% for the first quarter. The medical care ratio was negatively impacted by higher than expected direct costs of COVID related care as the COVID infection rate resurged in many of our marketplace geographies. We did however, achieve our pre-tax earnings target due to the increased membership volume. We continue to effectively manage our resources. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 7%, identical to the 7% reported in the first quarter of 2020. Our performance reflects disciplined cost management and the benefits of fixed costs leverage produced by our substantial growth offset somewhat by the higher than targeted DNA ratios of our acquired businesses which will improve as our integrations progress. We are pleased with our first quarter results as we continue to demonstrate the ability to produce excellent margins while substantially growing top line revenue and managing through the ongoing effects of the pandemic. Turning through our 2021 guidance, beginning with premium revenue. For 2021, we now project premium revenue to be more than $24 billion a 31% increase over the full year 2020 and a $1 billion increase from our previous guidance. Specifically, our premium revenue guidance now includes Medicaid enrollment benefiting from the expected extension of the public health emergency period, and the associated pause on membership redeterminations, which we are now projecting through the end of the third quarter. Recall, we had said that for each month public health emergency is extended beyond the month of May it could increase our full year revenue outlook by $150 million and updated marketplace revenue reflecting the strong enrollment and retention performance mentioned previously. We expect to end 2021 with slightly more than 500,000 marketplace members in marketplace premium revenue growth is now expected to be over 50%. We have excluded from our premium revenue guidance any impact of the affinity and signal acquisitions. We do expect these transactions to close this year representing upside to our premium revenue in 2021. In summary, we are very pleased with our growth trajectory. Our growth is well balanced between a new contract win, organic growth, bolt on acquisitions, benefit expansions in our existing geographies, and greater penetration of our marketplace in Medicare products in our Medicaid footprint. Turning now to earnings guidance. We are raising our full year 2021 adjusted earnings guidance to be no less than $13 per share, an increase from our prior guidance of $12.50 to $13 per share. Specifically, the increase towards 2021 earnings guidance reflects the favorable impacts of the increase in our revenue guidance and the associated margin, the first quarter earnings outperformance, and the combined effect of other individually minor impacts such as the sequestration delay in Medicare. We have however, hedged our guidance due to a variety of exogenous factors. First and foremost, we are still in a pandemic which introduces a level of uncertainty with respect to any healthcare utilization forecast. We have continued to be cautious in forecasting utilization trends in the remaining nine months of the year as the COVID pandemic subsides. How quickly and to what extent utilization rebound will depend upon the strength of the economy, consumer behavior, provider capacity and the level of COVID infection rates. With respect to forecasting, our marketplace utilization trends we recognize there is an inherent level of uncertainty with regard to new member acuity levels which we will monitor closely and the risk sharing corners create an added element of variability. While any individual stake corridor can be a buffer to that state over or underperformance predicting in which states over or underperformance may occur can create an element of forecasting variability. Turning now to an update on our growth initiatives. We are very pleased to have been rewarded our major Medicaid contracts in the state of Ohio. We were awarded contracts in all three regions in the state maintaining our statewide presence. This re-procurement win is a testimony to our excellent service, innovative programs, strong relationships, and our reputation as a business partner that can be counted on. While Ohio did introduce at least one additional player to the statewide program, continuity of care is of the utmost importance to a Medicaid program. As such, we have every reason to believe our current business profile should not materially change. The agreement to acquire Cigna STAR+PLUS membership is yet another example of an accretive, strategic bolt on acquisition. The business serves approximately 50,000 ADB and MMP members across three regions in Texas. Full year 2020 revenue is approximately $1 billion. With a modest purchase price of $60 million, we project the acquisition will deliver returns well in excess of our cost of capital, benefit from local and enterprise operating leverage and will be immediately accretive. The expanded presence in Texas should position us well and the re-procurement should the state proceed with that process. Finally, some comments about the longer term outlook for our business. The current rate environment is stable and rational. We continue to believe that the Medicaid risk sharing corridors that were previously introduced are related to the declared public health emergency and will be eliminated as the COVID pandemic subsides. We continue to be bullish about the performance of our acquired businesses. The operational integrations are proceeding as or better than planned, and we have high confidence in achieving our original accretion estimates and possibly even exceeding them. In the context of the pandemic subsiding and our acquisitions maturing, the embedded earnings power of the business, as it exists today is at least $4 higher than our adjusted earnings per share guidance. The emergence of embedded earnings combined with our future growth creates a very attractive earnings growth outlook. Our first quarter performance demonstrates that our growth plan is working well. We have built sound operational infrastructure, which allows us to operationally execute and maintain these attractive margins. We have reinvigorated our platforms to drive organic membership growth. We have built winning RFP and M&A capabilities that have catalyzed our growth and accessing new opportunities and we continue to focus on capital allocation and free cash flow generation to create shareholder value. The political, legislative, and regulatory trends are positive for the businesses we are in and our management team is well established, disciplined, and laser focused on our mission to serve members and shareholders. I look forward to sharing more about our future growth plans and longer term strategy at our investor day in September. As I conclude my remarks, I want to express my gratitude to our management team and our nearly 13,000 Molina colleagues. Their skill, dedication and steadfast service formed the foundation for everything we have achieved and everything we will achieve in the years to come. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Keim for some additional color on the financials. Mark Keim : Thank you Joe. And good morning, everyone. This morning, I will discuss some additional details on our first quarter performance, and then turn to our growth strategy balance sheet and some thoughts on our 2021 guidance. Beginning with some detailed commentary about our first quarter results there was virtually no incidence of the normal flu in the first quarter. Historically, a normal flu season would have resulted in $25 million to $40 million in medical costs in the first quarter. Severe winter weather resulted in unusually low utilization in many areas of the country in the month of February. While it's difficult to separate weather effects from other effects, there's no question it had an impact on the month. To the extent the types of services not utilized during the time are elective and discretionary, that utilization will likely begin to rebound. Much of the impact is timing. Well, the net effect of COVID wasn't aligned with our expectations and negligible to the quarter in total, the impacts were varied across our lines of business. We experienced higher direct cost of COVID related care in January, which then tapered off as the quarter progressed. We saw some pockets of non-COVID related utilization increases, but overall utilization was in line with expectations. In Medicaid, we generally experienced a modest utilization curtailment on inpatient and outpatient services. A significant portion of the resulting medical margin outperformance was recaptured by the COVID risk sharing corridors in several states. In contrast, our Medicare and marketplace businesses experienced disproportionately negative impacts due to an increase in direct cost of COVID related care in the quarter. The year-over-year MCR comparisons in these lines of businesses are less meaningful, as the current quarter includes these impacts from COVID and the first quarter of 2020 does not. In Medicare, the net effect of COVID increased the MCR by approximately 400 basis points in the quarter. In addition, the Medicare MCR was negatively impacted by the temporary challenge of risk scores that do not fully reflect the acuity of the membership. This is an industry wide issue that we mentioned when we gave our initial guidance. We're expecting COVID to dissipate through the year and anticipate four year Medicare MCRs in the high 80s. Marketplace experienced the high level of COVID cases early in the quarter which moderated throughout the quarter. Several of our markets were disproportionately impacted by COVID as a result of higher local infection rates. The COVID impacted marketplace increased the MCR by approximately 500 basis points in the quarter. With that said we expect the net effect of COVID to subside and continue to expect full year pre-tax margins in the mid single digit. I will now provide some commentary on our growth strategy beginning with M&A. Last week's announcement of our intent to acquire a Cigna Texas Medicaid and MMP business marks our fifth acquisition since our pivot to growth, ultimately reflecting the addition of 7 billion in annualized revenue. The Cigna transaction is expected to increase our Texas membership by 50,000, provide approximately a billion in annualized revenues, and drive accretion of at least $0.40 per diluted share in the first full year of ownership. This transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2021 and it's not included in our full year 2021 guidance. We now expect the Affinity transaction to close in the third quarter. Affinity is expected to increase our New York membership by approximately 300,000 provide approximately 1.5 billion in annualized revenue with the creation of $0.15 to $0.20 per diluted share in the first full year of ownership. The impact of the Affinity acquisition is also not included in our full year 2021 guidance. Acquisitions will continue to be a meaningful part of our growth strategy. While we are a scaled government sponsored managed care company, we are still at a size that our pipeline of smaller consolidation targets can have a meaningful impact on our growth rate. We see significant earnings growth from these acquired revenues. We have demonstrated our ability to fix underperforming businesses, have the discipline to harvest fixed cost leverage, and have every expectation of managing our acquisitions to margins that are reflective of our current portfolio performance. Our pipeline of M&A opportunities is robust. We continue to pursue bolt on acquisitions, single state plans, and provide our own plans. We will not pursue capability plates. We are at pure play premium risk bearing government sponsored managed care business, and we see significant growth opportunities within this space. Our strong cash flow makes the acquisition growth possible. At our current margins, we generate significant excess cash and additional debt capacity. Between cash on hand, near term cash flow, and additional debt capacity we currently have acquisition capacity of over 1.3 billion. At the multiples we have paid in recent transactions this gives us the current ability to drive well in excess of 3 billion in annualized revenue growth. And more importantly, at our current level of performance, this acquisition capacity is repeated and produced every single year. Turning now to our balance sheet. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters, and our reserve position remained strong. Days and claims payable at the end of the quarter represented 48 days of medical cost expense compared to 50 days in the fourth quarter, and 49 days in the first quarter of 2020. Prior year reserve development in the first quarter of 2021 was modestly favorable, but any P&L impact was absorbed by the COVID related risk corridors. Debt at the end of the quarter is 1.9 times trailing 12 month EBITDA. Our leverage ratio is 52%. However, on a net debt basis, net of parent company cash these ratios fall to 1.6 times and 47% respectively. Taken together, these metrics reflect a reasonably conservative leverage position. In the quarter, we repurchased an aggregate of approximately 577,000 shares for $122 million at an average price of approximately $211 per share. Our full year guidance continues to be based on 58.5 million shares. At the end of the quarter our parent company cash balance was 436 million. A few additional comments related to our earnings guidance. In raising our full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance to be no less than $13 per share, the following assumptions are relevant. A higher proportion of medical margin performance will be absorbed by the risk sharing corridors over the remainder of the year. The net effect of COVID remains a net cost of approximately $1.50 per share for the full year and lastly we expect 55% to 60% of full year EPS to be produced in the first half of the year. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator. We are now ready to take questions. Operator : We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Hi. Right. Thanks. Good morning. I guess I wanted to go to the source of the comments about $4 of upsides still to the guidance, I guess it sounded like the guidance raise was due in some part at least to re-determinations and the revenue and earnings from there, which obviously not something we would forecast going into next year. Does your $4 number now include the Cigna deal in there? Are there any kind of other puts and takes you're affirming the $50 COVID impact that component hasn't changed? Joseph Zubretsky : Let me summarize what is in our guidance Kevin, this is Joe. When we guided to no less than $13 this year, we are including an additional margin on $600 million of Medicaid revenue due to the extension of the re-determination clause. We're also including a margin on the additional $400 million of marketplace revenue due to the increased membership. We are then hedging our forecast due to the uncertainty related to utilization in the last nine months of the year. So very clearly increasing our guidance to no less than $13 a share. What we have said when we gave our original guidance and continued to say is that the net cost of COVID inside that forecast is $1.50 a share. And if you recall the way we measure the COVID impact is any impact of curtailment or suppression of utilization offset by the direct costs of COVID related care absorbed then by the risk sharing corridors. We continue to believe that will cost our earnings $1.50 a share. So if you look at the impact of COVID as being an overhang of $1.50, the disruption to Medicare rescoring costing about another dollar per share, and then extend our acquisitions to their full state of maturity we say the embedded earnings power of the business currently is $4 higher than our current year guidance. Kevin Fischbeck : Yes, I guess that's what you said last quarter, too. But you've taken out the core number this year on in part on things that don't seem sustainable. So I guess I was just wondering if there's any other kind of moving pieces to it as well. Joseph Zubretsky : And to be clear of that $4, that's not a 2022 guidance number outlook. That is, as we sit here today, there are certain overhangs on the earnings, projection of the business that are causing our earnings to be lower this year than they otherwise would be when our acquisitions mature, and when COVID disappears. Obviously there will be a lot more puts and takes into next year. And when we give our outlook in September our investor day will give you a better look of what 2022 looks like. Obviously, the re-determination clause increasing revenue this year where does it peak, how far does it fall, how quickly does it a trip is going to be a major item in a year-over-year comparison. But with 47% revenue of premium revenue growth this year, we're not at all that concerned with the upticks of 2022 versus 2021 at this point. Kevin Fischbeck : Yes. If I may just last question, you mentioned that the SCP membership right now the acuity is hard to forecast. Do you have any early data points around metal types or demographics on that enrollment that might give you some comfort that that's not going to be a significantly higher acuity population. Joseph Zubretsky : So anytime you take on new membership by its very nature, inherently, you don't yet understand the acuity of that population. I mean, you start with an assumption that if somebody buys insurance, they generally need it. But our bronze-silver mix is about what we forecasted for the year. We have improved dramatically in attaining risk scores. We've improved that operation from last year, we recall it was a performance glitch last year, we've improved on it. All I can say at this point is we know we've improved and attunity risk scores compared to ourselves. Obviously, we don't have the industry data yet to compare how we're doing to our competitors, which will ultimately decide what risk scores we've attained. But we are doing better compared to ourselves, we'll be able to give a much clearer forecast on utilization trends, generally marketplace, Medicaid and Medicare, when we report our second quarter, but at this time, it's very prudent just to remain cautious, given the effects of the pandemic as it is still in full throes here in the first quarter is divides into the second and third. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Robert Jones at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, this is Kevin on for Bob this morning. I just want to clarify that you've made some comments just about hedging as it relates to COVID. I was curious if there's anything that you're actually seeing today that would make you more cautious or if this is just reflecting some conservatism given the environments just generally uncertain. Joseph Zubretsky : So I mean, Robert, we tried to be clear on this. We're not implying or merely suggesting we're being conservative. We're declaring we're being conservative. As we work through the quarter-over-quarter effects of the pandemic starting all the way back in the second quarter of last year the mini and micro inflections up and down that occur are very geographically dispersed very much tied to local infection rates, very much tied now to the improvement in the acuity to population to the vaccination rate and opening up of economies. And it is the variation in modeling utilization for the balance of the other variation in the various models is so wide, that we believe it's prudent just to be very cautious on how fast utilization will rebound, when does it rebound to pre-COVID Levels, does it rebound fully to pre-COVID levels, where and when and how is very much a variant at this point and it just is very prudent to remain cautious on utilization for the balance of the year. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. That's helpful. And then just one quick follow up. I know you've touched on still thinking about the COVID headwind being a buck 50. I know last quarter, you also talked about the MRA headwind being $1. Is the dollar still very kind of headwind to think about, or as your assumptions change on that at all? Joseph Zubretsky : No, that's still a good number. The disruption and risk scoring cost about 300 basis points in our Medicare MCR for the quarter. If you can do the math on that, that's still pretty much the dollar for the year. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe just two quick questions. One, we've heard some about the marketplace environment that maybe there's some shifting and competitive landscape, rush to more narrow network programs that maybe, there's also been an uptick in churn among the members. You're growing that better than you expected. Are you seeing any of that or how would you put any of that in perspective? Joseph Zubretsky : Yes. The competitive landscape hasn't changed all that much. Yes some of the new entrants came into some of our markets, and started to build market share in those markets. But we're a very niche business. We do not serve affluent suburban. We serve the working poor. We've always said we built our marketplace networks off of our Medicaid networks, we priced them off our Medicaid networks and we're seeking out fully and highly subsidized members that are on government assistance. This is clearly an extension of our Medicaid strategy servicing the working for you. We like the position we're in not only are we improving our performance and growing, but it's not right size in the portfolio. Early on as we started this journey three years ago, there was no question that the marketplace earnings were outsized in relation to the portfolio. Now with marketplace revenues, representing about 10% of the total margins, mid single digit. So the earnings about 10% of the total as well. It's positioned nicely in the portfolio, strategically leverages our Medicaid infrastructure and is now a very good complement, financially and operationally good complement to our Medicaid business. A.J. Rice: That's great. And then my follow up would be, on the risk corridor comments, I think original guidance had that being about a $250 million impact this year. It sounds like maybe it's a little more given how things have trended. But I wondered if you've updated that number and have you, it sounds like you're thinking at some point, these risk corridors got to roll off. Can you just tell us if you see any states that have actually begun to take action to eliminate these or what are you hearing as you talk to the states about any kind of timing around eliminating these risk corridors? Joseph Zubretsky : Sure A.J. When we gave initial guidance, we never actually parsed to the components curtailment, direct cost of COVID care or the corridors. We said that the components are highly variable but the fact that the corridors do exist they do act as a buffer that we were very comfortable in the projection that COVID in total net would be a drag on earnings of $1.50 per share and we continue to say that. We never actually gave a specific quarter or a number. And you really shouldn't put the quarter numbers going to flex up and down with curtailment in the direct costs of COVID related to care, that's how they work. So to me, it's really the net number that's really important. Obviously, if the component parts get materially different, maybe we report on that, but right now, saying it's going to cost us $1.50 a share is the best metric to hang on. With respect to your second question, yes there's positive momentum that not only suggests but is concluding that the risk sharing corridors were related to the public health emergency. They were fully intended to recapture the portion of the capitated rate that was never paid out on benefits due to the pandemic and there is growing momentum with many of our state customers, the actuarial community, the public policy funded etc, that these will disappear as the COVID pandemic subsides. In fact, New York did not introduce a risk sharing corridor for its 22 fiscal year, which started on April 1 and California publicly declared that it is not introducing a corridor for its 22 fiscal year, which starts on January 1 of 2022, and there's lots of good momentum legislatively, administratively in many other states that are suggesting that these were related to the public health emergency and will begin to fall away as the pandemic subsides. Obviously, as that happens, as they become enacted or not enacted, we see draft rates will report as we report our quarters. A.J. Rice: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel : Hi, thanks, good morning, everyone. One of the, first just to ask about the taxes deal with Cigna and seems like a very attractive price that you're paying on a price per revenue basis and obviously you are expecting it to be nicely accretive as well. So just want to get some more insight into essentially how you're able to acquire that asset for that type of pricing and maybe some insight into the existing margin profile? Is it underperforming now and you think that you'll be able to improve that improve on that or is the margin profile already running at a pretty solid level? Joseph Zubretsky : Hi Scott. On the price like willing buyer willing seller, and that's the price we agreed to and without an allocation of capital 6% of revenue is clearly attractive. Now it's all about the Texas re-procurement and how this positions us in that re-procurement. So bolting on a billion dollars of revenue to our Texas Medicaid business, which is $2 billion strong right now increasing it by 50% adding two new regions where we're not present overlap and third is very-very attractive to our statewide presence. The business is profitable, marginally profitable but again, we bring Texas scale, we bring a lot more infrastructure, and we're going to leverage the daylights out of our fixed cost structure in the state of Texas we will be able to improve the margins due to our existing presence. So attractively priced, will recover the purchase price with the two first years of cash flow making it a free option upon re-procurement. Scott Fidel : Got it. And the second question, just wanted to sort of net out I guess the framing on the exchange business and obviously had to COVID costs in the first quarter that you're not expecting to recur throughout the year you're keeping your outlook conservative but at the same time you are keeping your mid single digit margin target in place for the hex business. So just interested in maybe the competition within that mid single digit margin view change a bit where you're maybe assuming a bit higher on the MLR and you're getting more G&A leverage off the growth or just trying to sort of sync up sort of thinking about that the conservative since you change the margin target? Thanks. Joseph Zubretsky : You're actually captured it perfectly. Our MCR will likely be in the mid to high 70s, where previously was in mid to low 70s. But we're getting to G&A leverage. Our G&A ratio is improving by 200 to 300 basis points, which, again, clearly puts us in the mid single digit pre-tax category. Now, there's a range around what pre-tax, single digit pre-tax means. But we have every reason to believe that given what we experienced in the first quarter, if the pandemic does subside, we get appropriate risk scores on the new membership that will achieve mid single digit margins even on the increased size of the business. Anytime you grow a business it puts pressure on margins but we're still committed to in forecasting that will be at mid single digits pre-tax even on the increased revenue. Scott Fidel : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. Joseph Zubretsky : Morning. Justin Lake : First question a lot of talk about the federal emergency and the benefits of this year as you go through the year. Just wanted to get an idea of within that $4 of kind of upside you talked about in earnings power how much are you pulling out for the assumption if the Federal emergency goes away? So if that shuts off completely for 2022 and all those members leave, is there a number that you could share with us? I know that's not going to happen that way but just kind of understanding what you're pulling out of that earnings power of the 4 bucks? Joseph Zubretsky : The first answer to the very specific question you asked is no. That was an embedded earnings were wasn't a 2022 forecasts. It wasn't a bridge to 2022. It was, when these three or four factors disappear the earnings power of our business, the embedded earnings power is $4 higher. It was not a projection. It was certainly not a forecast of the peak and membership and the attrition rate. So here's what's in our guidance. We extended the public health emergency and the re-determination period out four months. We originally said that for every month it gets extended, it would produce about $150 million of revenue to our annual total. So that's the 600 million. If it gets extended to the end of the year, it's probably another $300 million, $400 million. Now, where is it peak and how far does it fall and where does it fall is very much unclear. I maintain that all of the membership that we grew since the pandemic started organically at its peak, it'll be 750,000 members 600,000 to the end of last year. 650,000 at the end of last year, another 60,000 in the first quarter, maybe another 40,000 in the second. So at its peak, we've added 750,000 Medicaid members organically and whether that's through the re-determination pause, struggling economies, it doesn't matter. That was the organic growth. How fast that trips and where does it bottom? Unclear. I maintain that a larger proportion of those members will fit because the low wage service economy has been ravaged. We all see the economy coming back. But if you look at the numbers, the low wage service economy, the sandwich shops, the restaurants, the drycleaner shops, aren't coming back real fast and I still think there will be a significant amount of that membership that will be on Medicaid for an extended period of time. So no, that wasn't a 22 forecast. But your supposition is correct. When we do give 2022 guidance later this year into next year we'll have to bring you from the peak of Medicaid membership this year to the trough next year. And that'll be a year-over-year comparison item. Justin Lake : So moving 2022. Joe just to be clear, like in the $4 are you assuming that that membership goes away or would it be current run rate plus $4 minus whatever happens with the Federal Emergency membership? That's 750,000. Joseph Zubretsky : What we're saying is no, we're not saying that what we're saying is this year with the membership we have, we're earning $13 a share. And inside of that number is a $1.50 overhang to the COVID. It has nothing to do with the membership it's just the direct costs of COVID related care, utilization suppression in the corridors. So the only thing that's in the 150 are those three items, those three items not included in that COVID impact is any impact from increased membership. Justin Lake : Okay. So we would have to subtract that just to be clear from the $4. Joseph Zubretsky : If that was the calculus that you were doing. Yes. But again, we were not giving 2022 forecast. We were giving a pro forma view of the embedded earnings power of the business as it exists today. It was not a forward forecast. Justin Lake : Got it. Alright, thanks for the color Joe. Speaker: You are welcome Justin. Operator : Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ricky Goldwasser : Yes, Hi, good morning. Just wanted to go back your comment around the exchange strange in one of the things that you talk about was a strong product design. We thought it in Ohio, you embedded primary care business city blocks in the RFP. Just wanted to get some more color on your primary care strategy and how we think embedding it in other states? Joseph Zubretsky : Our network strategy and our marketplace is very traditional. We build the networks off of our Medicaid networks. In many cases they're slightly wider. Bear in mind that wider networks are always very attractive from a membership perspective but they carry a cost. But our marketplace network strategy is very traditional when it comes to hospitals, when it comes to specialty, services or primary care services. We are introducing in our Ohio RFP win a few new twists and turns with vendors partners that are going to help us deliver more community based care wrapping around primary care physicians to make them more effective. But I would say on balance our marketplace, network strategy is very traditional. We did introduce a couple of very innovative programs in our Ohio RFP. There's a company by the name of City block which has a very-very innovative approach to delivering care in the communities, in the home setting, reaching out into neighborhoods to find people that need care. This is a big problem in Medicaid. When people come into the hospital we'll get them the care we need. But finding them before the bad stuff happens is really a challenge. And I think this company, City block, which is a great partner is going to do a great job for us in the state of Ohio. Ricky Goldwasser : And should we think about this as sort of a pilot, and if this is successful, it's something that you can expand into other states? Joseph Zubretsky : I would answer the question more generally that we are passionate about serving our state customers and I talk to and my team talks to the leaders of the Medicaid agencies, the governor's people in high administrative positions in government, always trying to understand what their most burning problems are, and whether it's social determinants of health, whether it's the opioid use, epidemic, racial disparities in healthcare. We are creating and providing innovative solutions to solve those problems, not only through our delivery of our Medicaid product but also in our $150 million commitment and what we call the Molina Cares Accord to put money back into the communities we serve. This is really important part of the relationship with the state customer, not only innovative programs that help drive down cost in the Medicaid program, but being committed to the communities that we serve. So yes it is a very common theme no matter where we go in our existing states or when we pitch a new state. Ricky Goldwasser : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead. Steve Valiquette : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So just for the public health emergency, you change your expectation for this to run through the end of 3Q, 21. Some of your MCR peers have a say in this around three year and seems HHS themselves have given some signals reported in the press that it also could run through year end. I am just curious if there's any political lead or some that suggest to you that maybe it's less likely to run through year end. Just any additional color on your thought pattern extension through 3Q versus something beyond that. Thanks. Joseph Zubretsky : Thanks for the question Steve. No, don't read any political insights into that. We just chose to extend it four months out to the end of September at $150 million per that $600 million of additional revenue. But no, we have no other insights. If it gets pushed out to the end of the year it's likely at a minimum $300 billion more in our 2021 premium revenue forecast. So no. No other insights except perhaps a measure of conservatism. Steve Valiquette : Okay, alright. That's perfect. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Joshua Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Joshua Raskin : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Joe, just want to clarify, I think you said no new corridor in New York. I think that was just for 2022. But I assume you've got the 2021 with the retro. And then are any states actually contemplating new corridors that are still kind of a little bit behind in the game that are trying to look back and figure that out and I guess the last part of the question would be why would a state eliminate it? What would the rationale be for a state to operate in the future if there's other issues, etc? What would be the rationale for saying hey, we don't need the corridors in place? Joseph Zubretsky : The answer to the first question you asked very specifically was yes, fully captured the retro corridor from April 22 back, but they did not introduce one for April 1, I am sorry April 21 but they did not introduce one for the 21/22 fiscal year. So that is correct. The white papers have been written on this. In the midst of a pandemic when you believe that a lot of the capitated rate is not going to get paid in services you come up with a construct as arbitrary as it is to recapture a portion of that rate. There are lots of ways to do that. We believe and many others believe that the risks sharing corridors even being symmetrical are not the appropriate way to do that. And here's the basic reason why. It actually penalizes an efficient operator, and promotes and rewards an inefficient operator. These things are symmetrical. If you had a 90% MLR target and you're beating it, you pay it, whether you beat it because a COVID or beat it just because you're better, you pay in. And if someone's operating at 92, they get a check. So it promotes in efficiency by not allowing efficient operators to hold on to the portion of the capitated rate, that they're truly driving through performance, knowing that whatever costs actually emerge, end up in rates eventually. If we keep driving down the cost of the program by being efficient, that ends up in the rate base on a lag basis. And that's why we should go back to and most people believe that the traditional rate setting process, setting a rate prospectively based on the observed trends in the business is the right way to go. Clearly, during the pandemic, they needed to do something quick, they got actuarial advice that supported this. But the momentum for these things is waning and the discussions that we're having with various of our state customers is suggesting that these things are going to disappear as the pandemic subsides. Joshua Raskin : That makes a ton of sense. So do you have alternatives? I mean, I understand the rate setting process is, the tradition rates processes is your preferred way. But clearly, in a pandemic, it's very difficult to parse out to your point what was COVID related versus what was company efficiencies or inefficiencies is there, have you provided data to the states that you feel comfortable that they actually know what the COVID impact was or is that kind of why they're using the blunt object of risk corridors? Joseph Zubretsky : Good question. It has been provided and of course, they have their own actuarial they use some of the largest firms in the country make household names that are recognizable to you. So they have their own actuarial resources. But yes, that's exactly the point and as trends come back to normal without these mini and micro inflections that happen across the country we believe and I believe the actuarial committee believes that will just revert back to the traditional rate setting process on a prospectively set basis. Eventually costs end up in race when costs are inflecting high they lag and managed care suffers and when trends are trending low and rates lag you went and you just work the ebbs and flows and the mini cycles of the business. That serve this business well for decades and decades and we believe that most Medicaid directors and most actuarial firms get that and are of the mind that as the pandemic subsides and disappears these constructs will disappear as well. Joshua Raskin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Borsch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Matthew Borsch : Maybe I could just pick up on Joshua's question there. And the timing of the risk corridors rolling off? Is that actually going to be potentially a net negative to you at least relative to what you might have experienced that those risk corridors remained in place. What I'm really pointing to is the potential for above trend utilization in maybe the back half of this year or going into 2022 where the risk corridors would have served as something that was actually helpful to you. And so I guess what I'm wondering are they being pulled away exactly the wrong time? Joseph Zubretsky : Great question. Here's the way we think about them. First of all about sort of getting surprised by them or having an inordinate effect or an unanticipated effect they can no longer be retroactive. So the ones that are in place are in place. In order to be an active they have to be prospective in nature and they will coincide with the rate cycles. Most of our rates are one January one rates. We have a couple of default, Michigan, Texas. We have some July ones, Mississippi and South Carolina. So they will follow the rate cycle. So the quarters that we're now recording are the ones that have been inactive. You can't record a quarter that hasn't been inactive. Now if any one of these states that comes up for renewal inside the year enacts one, it could be an additional item for the year. But our feeling is that most of the states that come up this year it's either late in the year or they're smaller and it shouldn't have a big impact. The real wildcard and forecasting these is where you're under and over performance happens. There is very-very clearly that if you're in the money on a corridor, $1 of over performance goes against the corridor, very simple. But where's the dollar over underperformance going to occur? If it occurs in California that has no corridor we get to keep it. If that happens in Michigan, where we have a corridor we don't. And so when we said that the existence of these corridors adds an element of variability it's projecting where you're going to over and under performance that adds the element of variability. But right now we know where they are. They cannot be enacted retrospectively. They could be introduced for the 2022 fiscal year in a couple of states. We don't think that'll happen but it's possible. So we don't think there's a huge element of variability with respect to the introduction of the corridors but there is an element of forecast variability to where your under or over performance actually occurs. Matthew Borsch : That makes sense. Thank you, and then just follow up on it slightly different point. With the Medicare risk adjusters and the impact there it seems like it's having a larger basis point impact on your MCR in Medicare, if I compare that to some of you, or some of the other companies that, of course, have much larger books in Medicare. Is that some what the law of large numbers or law of small numbers that would account for the higher volatility? Joseph Zubretsky : Yes. We're very concentrated. A lot of this happens in our MMP book. Michigan, which had a very-very high infection rate, and we have a very robust Medicare business got hits specifically. So yes it's the law of large numbers. We're not nationwide. We're in a handful of places with material membership. I cited one but that's what it is. It's the randomness of where the infection is and where our membership is. Matthew Borsch : Got it. Thank you. Joseph Zubretsky : If I may operator, before the next question is asked because no questions were really asked on one of these lines. I did want to make a comment that doesn't respond to a question. But last night there was some very positive news that broke and I wanted to take this opportunity in a compliant format to mention it. Last night the Kentucky State Court issued an order which supported Molina's position as a Medicaid participant. They there was, as you know, some legal challenges to our award itself denied. There were legal challenges to our purchase of passport denied. There were legal challenges to the Novation of the passport contract to our business on September, 1 denied. What was upheld was the six plan model that the court stipulated many-many months ago. So as it stands today the ruling is that the Medicaid program continues on as is. We are operating in Kentucky under the passport brand. We have 326,000 members at the end of the quarter. We are performing really, really well and we're in good standing with the state. And the court has ruled as such. Now having said that the one stipulation that court didn't say was there was enough, I'm saying irregularity, but at least some aspects of the proposal process that perhaps weren't to their liking. And they asked for a re-procurement but didn't stipulate a date or time to that. So our point of view is, whenever that happens we'll be bidding on the contract but we'll be bidding as a strong incumbent. We've already won the contract twice. We will win it the third time and we're in great standing in the state. So positive news out of the Kentucky State Court last night. And just in case nobody asked the question that got to that issue I want to use this format to give you our position on that. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you all for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Trudell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Julie Trudell : Good morning and welcome to Molina Healthcare's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our second quarter earnings was distributed after the market closed yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in our earnings release. For those who are listening to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that remarks made herein are as of today, Thursday, July 29, 2021 and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. In this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our second quarter 2021 press release. During our call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, statements regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, the current environment, recent acquisitions, 2021 guidance, our embedded earnings power, and our longer term outlook. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that can cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report for the 2020 year filed with the SEC as well as the risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and our Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open up the call to take your questions. Lastly, we want to invite you to attend our Virtual 2021 Investor Day meeting scheduled for Friday, September 17th, where we will share more about our future growth plans and longer term strategy. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe? Joe Zubretsky : Thank you, Julie and good morning. Today, we will provide you with updates on several topics. We will present our financial results for the second quarter 2021, we will update our 2021 guidance, and we will summarize the status of our growth initiatives and outlook for the future. Let me start with the second quarter highlights. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of $3.40 with adjusted net income of $199 million and premium revenue of $6.6 billion. The 88.4% medical care ratio demonstrates solid performance while managing through pandemic-related medical cost challenges that increased the ratio by 110 basis points. The net effect of COVID decreased net income per diluted share by approximately $1. We managed to a 6.9% adjusted G&A ratio reflecting continued discipline in cost management which allowed us to harvest the benefits of scale produced by our substantial growth. We produced an adjusted after-tax margin of 2.9% meeting our second quarter expectations. Our six-month year-to-date performance highlighted by an 87.6% MCR, a 7% adjusted G&A ratio, and a 3.4% after-tax margin were all squarely in line with our year-to-date expectations. This allowed us to produce as projected 60% of our full year earnings guidance in the first half of the year. And we accomplished all of this as we generated approximately 50% year-over-year premium revenue growth and successfully integrated businesses, representing approximately $5 billion in annual revenue. In summary, we are pleased with our second quarter performance. We executed well, delivered solid operating earnings, and continue to drive our growth strategy. Let me provide some commentary highlighting our second quarter performance. First, I note that year-over-year comparisons are less meaningful than they would be in a typical year. The second quarter of last year was the first full quarter of the COVID pandemic and was distorted by the significant positive net effect of COVID that characterized that early phase of the crisis. In contrast, the current quarter was negatively impacted by the net effect of COVID. As a result, sequential comparisons are the more meaningful reflection of underlying business performance and will be the focus of our comments this morning. In the second quarter, we produced premium revenue of $6.6 billion, a 4% increase over the first quarter of 2021, reflecting increased membership across our portfolio. We ended the quarter with approximately 4.7 million members, an increase of 91,000 members over the first quarter of 2021. Our Medicaid enrollment at the end of the quarter was approximately 3.9 million members, an increase of 69,000 over the first quarter of 2021. This increase was due primarily to the continuing suspension of Medicaid redeterminations, although this growth catalyst seems to have moderated. Our Medicare membership was 130,000 at the end of the quarter, an increase of 4,000 and in line with our growth plan. Our Marketplace membership were 638,000 at the end of the quarter, representing growth of 18,000 over the first quarter of 2021 due to lower-than-expected attrition rates and membership additions during the extended open enrollment period. Turning now to our medical margin performance in the second quarter by line of business. Our Medicaid business achieved a medical care ratio of 89%. While we are dealing with the impacts of the pandemic on utilization and medical cost as well as the continuing temporary impact of the risk corridors, we continue to execute on the underlying fundamentals. Our well-diversified portfolio of state contracts across all dimensions of the Medicaid product suite is performing well. We continue to deliver high-quality care at a reasonable cost particularly to high acuity populations. The underlying rate environment is stable. Our hallmark medical management capabilities continue to deliver appropriate clinical outcomes for our members while achieving strong financial results. Our Medicare results were excellent having posted a medical care ratio of 87.6%. We continue to produce excellent MCRs and margins in this portfolio of high-acuity lives in both our D-SNP product and the MMP programs. Although our results were moderately depressed due to COVID utilization and despite the temporary risk score softness for the current year, the underlying results were squarely in line with our expectations. Our Marketplace results have been significantly impacted by direct cost of COVID-related care, as we posted a medical care ratio of 84.8% in the quarter. Many of the new members we attracted were in regions disproportionately affected by COVID including California, Michigan, Texas and Washington. With nearly 500 basis points of pressure on the MCR in each of the first two quarters, we can and should achieve mid-single-digit pretax margins as the pandemic subsides. In short, our second quarter and first half results across the entire portfolio continue to demonstrate our ability to produce excellent margins while growing top line revenue and successfully managing through the ongoing clinical and financial impacts of the pandemic. Turning to our 2021 guidance, beginning with premium revenue. For 2021, we now project premium revenue to be more than $25 billion, a 37% increase over the full year 2020 and a $1 billion increase from our previous guidance. Specifically, our premium revenue guidance now includes Medicaid enrollment benefiting from the expected extension of the public health emergency period and the associated pause on membership redeterminations, which we are now projecting through the end of the fourth quarter. Recall that for each month the public health emergency has extended beyond the month of September, it increases our full year revenue outlook by $150 million. Our updated guidance also contemplates the impact from retaining pharmacy-related premium revenue in California, New York and Kentucky due to postponement of and changes to their respective pharmacy carve-out initiatives and updated Marketplace revenue reflecting the strong enrollment and retention performance mentioned previously. We expect to end 2021 with approximately 590,000 marketplace members. We have excluded from our premium revenue guidance any impact of the Affinity and Cigna acquisitions. We expect the Affinity acquisition to close in the fourth quarter, representing upside to our premium revenue guidance in 2021 and we expect the Cigna acquisition to close in January 2022. Turning now to earnings guidance. We are raising our full year 2021 earnings guidance and now expect to end the year with adjusted earnings of no less than $13.25 per share, an increase from our prior guidance of no less than $13 per share. We remain on track for full year after-tax margins of at least 3%. Specifically, the increase to our 2021 earnings guidance reflects our underlying outperformance, the increase in our revenue guidance and the associated margin, offset by a $1 increase in the net cost of COVID, which we now expect to be $2.50 per share for the full year. We have been cautious in projecting our back half earnings due to a variety of exogenous factors. The Delta variant adds variability to any utilization forecast. While highly contagious, the Delta variant disproportionately affects the unvaccinated. Older and more vulnerable population cohorts have significantly higher vaccination rates. As a result, the Delta variant cases result in proportionately fewer hospital admissions and lower per admission costs, moderating the potential impact. In addition, it remains unknown how quickly and to what extent utilization will return to normal levels. This will depend upon the strength of the economy, consumer behavior provider capacity and the emergence of any new COVID variants. There is an inherent level of uncertainty with regard to new marketplace member acuity levels and their susceptibility to COVID infection and the COVID-related risk-sharing corridors create an added element of variability. Turning now to an update on our growth initiatives. We continue to see many actionable opportunities in our acquisition pipeline, which remains an important aspect of our growth strategy. Our M&A team is fully deployed and is working an active list of health plan targets in our core businesses. Our acquisition strategy remains focused on buying stable membership and revenue streams, particularly focused on underperforming properties. Our M&A integration team is also fully deployed and successfully migrating our acquired properties to Molina operating infrastructure and cost structure, to ensure we deliver the earnings accretion we expected. To-date, we are on track to meet or exceed our earnings accretion commitments. We continue to pursue to new Medicaid procurement opportunities. We have contract winning capabilities, an aggressive in-state ground game and a winning proposal writing platform. We are confident that we will continue to win new contracts that will contribute to our growth trajectory in 2022 and 2023. Finally, some comments about the longer-term outlook for our business. The current rate environment is stable and rational. We now have confirmed data points to support the continued belief that the Medicaid risk sharing corridors related to the declared public health emergency will be eliminated, as the COVID pandemic subsides. Pandemic-related corridors have already been eliminated for the 2022 state fiscal years in California, New York, South Carolina and Michigan, with momentum towards similar outcomes in other states. The current Medicare risk score shortfall phenomenon is temporary, as our 2022 bids did fully account for the current assessment of next year's risk scores. We continue to be bullish about the performance of our acquired businesses. The operational integrations are proceeding as or better than planned and we have high confidence in achieving our original accretion estimates and possibly, even exceeding them. In the context of the pandemic subsiding and our acquisitions maturing, the incremental embedded earnings power of the business, as it exists today, is meaningful. With the increased outlook for the net negative effect of COVID, our incremental embedded earnings power is now more at $5 above our 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance. In short, our pro forma run rate, after the natural relaxation of these temporary constraints, would produce adjusted earnings per share comfortably in the mid-teens and an after-tax margin of approximately 4%. I look forward to sharing more about our future growth plans and longer-term strategy at our Investor Day on September 17. At our Investor Day, we will provide you with an initial 2022 revenue outlook. We will also provide you with an updated view of our long-term targets, for revenue growth for our three lines of business, operating metrics for our three lines of business and enterprise margin, net income and earnings per share expectations. And, as importantly, as has been our hallmark style, we will provide you with our detailed playbook for achieving those results. We will continue not just to declare our goals, but to show you the transparency and specificity, how we will achieve them. Suffice it to say, we are an inherently high-growth businesses and have demonstrated an ability to grow the top line and maintain an attractive margin profile, even during a global pandemic. The political, legislative and regulatory environments are all positive catalysts and the social demographic profile of the U.S. population remains in significant need of the social safety net we manage. As I conclude my remarks, I want to express my gratitude to our management team and our nearly 13,000 Molina colleagues. Their skill dedication and steadfast service, continue to form the foundation, for everything we have achieved and everything we will achieve in the years to come. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Keim, for some additional color on the financials. Mark? Mark Keim : Thank you, Joe. This morning, I will discuss some additional details of our second quarter performance, and then turn to our growth strategy, the balance sheet and some thoughts on our 2021 guidance. Beginning with some detailed commentary about our second quarter results. The net effect of COVID, negatively impacted second quarter results by $77 million or approximately $1 a share. This increased the second quarter MCR by 110 basis points to 88.4%. The impact was higher than our expectations and negatively affected all three lines of business. We experienced high COVID-related inpatient costs early in the quarter, which tapered off as the quarter progressed. We also saw increases in professional and outpatient costs, which we attribute to what, may be the return to normal pre-COVID utilization patterns. In Medicaid, the net effect of COVID was a cost of approximately $25 million and accounted for a 40 basis point increase that is included within our reported 89% MCR. The first quarter Medicaid MCR had a 150-basis-point benefit due to COVID, which substantially explains the sequential increase in MCR. We continue to expect the full year Medicaid MCR to be in the high 80s. In Medicare, the net effect of COVID was a cost of approximately $17 million, increasing the MCR by 200 basis points to 87.6% in the quarter. The first quarter Medicare MCR was increased by 400 basis points due to COVID. Sequentially, the MCR improved, driven by this lower net effect of COVID and improved underlying performance compared to the first quarter. We anticipate a full year Medicare MCR in the high 80s. In Marketplace, the net effect of COVID was a cost of approximately $35 million, increasing the MCR by 480 basis points. The first quarter Marketplace MCR included a similar impact from the net effect of COVID, which increased the first quarter MCR by approximately 500 basis points. The resulting sequential increase in MCR versus the first quarter reflects the normal seasonality associated with members reaching their policy deductible limits. Due to the higher-than-expected impact from the net effect of COVID in the first half of the year, we now expect Marketplace pretax margins to moderate to low single digits. We expect that when the COVID pandemic subsides, our Marketplace pretax margin will be squarely on target, with our mid-single-digit pretax margin expectations. Turning now to our balance sheet. We received $145 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter, which brought our parent company cash balance to $564 million at the end of the quarter. We have ample capacity to fund the announced acquisitions. At our current margins, we generate significant excess cash and additional debt capacity. After funding our announced pending acquisitions, we will have year-end acquisition capacity of over $1.4 billion. At the multiples we have paid in recent transactions, this gives us the ability to drive $3 billion to $4 billion in annualized revenue growth. More importantly, at our current level of performance, this level of acquisition capacity is generated each year. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and our reserve position remains strong. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter represented 48 days of medical cost expense, unchanged from the first quarter. Prior year reserve development in the second quarter of 2021 was modestly favorable, but any P&L impact was mostly absorbed by the COVID-related risk corridors. Debt at the end of the quarter is 2.2 times trailing 12-month EBITDA. Our debt-to-cap ratio was 50%. However, on a net debt basis, net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.7 times and 43% respectively. These metrics reflect a conservative leverage position. A few additional comments, related to our earnings guidance. We raised full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance to be no less than $13.25 per share, which reflects the following. Our underlying outperformance, an increase in our revenue guidance and the associated margin, the net effect of COVID expectations which has increased by $1 per share and is now expected to be approximately $2.50 per share for the full year, and continued caution in forecasting utilization trends in the remaining six months of the year due to the COVID pandemic. In a typical year, the seasonality of utilization and timing of open enrollment periods resulted in third quarter earnings being higher, than fourth quarter earnings. However this year, we expect second half earnings to be distributed more evenly between the quarters, due to the net effect of COVID and particularly the impact of risk sharing corridors. As Joe discussed, we believe the incremental embedded earnings power of the company is in excess of $5. This is composed of several items. The increased net effect of COVID, which is now expected to create a $2.50 per share decrease, that should dissipate as the pandemic subsides. Medicare risk score disruption that created approximately $1 a share overhang; and as we obtain our target margins on Magellan Complete Care and Kentucky, and once Affinity and Cigna acquisitions are closed and synergized, we expect to achieve additional adjusted earnings per share of at least $2. This embedded earnings power does not represent 2022 guidance, but rather an accounting of the dynamic impacts that are temporarily depressing our earnings profile. There are many other items that will affect our actual earnings guidance for 2022 including several possible scenarios for the impact of Medicaid membership redeterminations. In short, our 2021 earnings jump-off point into 2022 is very strong. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead Kevin. Kevin Fischbeck : All right, great. Thanks. I wanted to maybe just dig into that last comment about the earnings power. And I guess your point about potential offset from redeterminations. Is there any framework that you guys have that you think would be helpful to think about how much redeterminations is adding to this base number, and how to think about the timing of when that might roll off? Joe Zubretsky : Kevin this is Joe. Over the net last number of months, we have formed a view of what's going to happen with the suspension of the redetermination pause. And the way we now characterize it, we believe that this will be a very organized and orderly approach to move any members that are no longer eligible for Medicaid into the uninsured population or other forms of insurance. Aside three things. One, there is a reasonable possibility that the federal government actually extends the public health emergency. Second, many states are actually applying for types of waivers to manage their populations in different ways. Illinois has suggested to CMS that they want to continue the public health emergency for another year. New Jersey wants to redetermine its members on their anniversary day. So we believe that this is going to be a very, very orderly transition. Nobody wants to have Medicaid members stranded without coverage. Bearing in mind, we have over 70 million members nationally that need to go through a redetermination process and the states just do not have the capacity to do this in the mandated six-month period of time, which suggests to us that the government and CMS may actually relax that standard and allow for more time to transition these members. So we're looking at this as a protracted, orderly event over 2022 perhaps even into 2023 to make sure that all Medicaid members who are no longer eligible have the opportunity to age into the D-SNP product to income up into a highly subsidized marketplace product or as they obtain work end up in the employer sponsored insurance marketplace. We will provide a variety of scenarios of what that might look like for 2022 at our Investor Day on September 17th. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. That's really helpful. I guess maybe just to wrap that up then. How do you think about the margin on that business? I guess in general you would think that anyone redetermined is probably a better risk pool and therefore a little bit higher margin, should we be thinking about it that way, or are there offsets to be considering there? Joe Zubretsky : There are offsets. There is no question that if you look at medical economic data or actuarial data that generally speaking duration of membership causes acuity to decline, the level of acuity to decline. There's no question about that. The longer they're on the roles, the less acute they are. Two factors as you referenced offsets. One, many states took that into consideration in setting rates. So it's already in the rates that we have a lower acuity population. And second, bear in mind that while the volume won't get picked up by the risk corridors, any excess margin on those members is surely picked up by the risk corridors and 30% of our revenue is already in the 100% tier. So, yes, I would look at -- there is a margin on those members, but the margin is likely no more than a low-single-digit target margin. But we view that as accreting off the books over a very long period of time in a very orderly fashion as I suggested. But I -- the way we look at it is the margin on those members is no greater or less than the average margin of the portfolio. Kevin Fischbeck : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Matt Borsch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead Matt. Matt Borsch : Yes, good morning. Thank you. I was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit more about the utilization and medical cost components during the second quarter. Specifically, I'm trying to understand, how the direct cost of COVID, have evolved in Marketplace and Medicaid relative to the non-COVID, if you're able to talk about non-COVID relative to sort of normal baseline? I'm just a little confused on, how much pressure you're getting directly from COVID in particular. Joe Zubretsky : Sure, Matt. Let me start with what we call just traditional normal utilization of healthcare services. We believe and the data supports it, that the healthcare system is coming back to operating at full capacity, not greater than full capacity and not lower, but at full capacity, which means utilization, all those types of procedures the elective and discretionary procedures wellness visits, preventive care, primary care visits for checkups are all coming back to pre-pandemic levels. In fact, in our forecast, we actually trend off of 2019 medical cost data to make sure, that we appropriately capture pre-pandemic utilization. In our forecast for the entire year, we trended off that full utilization baseline. So we are assuming that the system has reverted back to pre-pandemic levels of utilization, for all those types of services that were either deferred or eliminated during the pandemic. Now with respect to COVID, the situation while similar is actually somewhat different today, than earlier in the pandemic. We are seeing the Delta variant and the Delta variant is affecting the unvaccinated. The unvaccinated tend to be younger and healthier, than folks that were vaccinated. So while we're seeing prevalence of Delta variant COVID infection rates, fewer of those incidents are requiring hospital stays. So much of the care is being provided in an outpatient ambulatory setting. And the cases that do require an admission, the length of stay is shorter. There is a lower incidence of ICU utilization which is expensive and lower utilization of ventilator which suggests lower acuity. So while we're seeing a prevalence of Delta variant COVID-related cases, the severity of those cases is a lot lower than the severity of the cases earlier in the pandemic. During the quarter, we experienced about $95 million of COVID-related direct costs of inpatient care during the quarter, but it really tapered off. It was about $50 million in the first month of the quarter about $30 million in the second and about $15 million or so in the last month of the quarter. We expect that to research. The Delta variant infection rate is popping particularly in states that have low vaccination rates. And in our full year forecast, we have forecasted forward, a continuation of COVID-related cost of care, at a certain level. Hopefully, that's helpful to your analysis. Matt Borsch : Yeah. It's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from A.J. Rice from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead, A.J. A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi everybody. Maybe just to drill down a little bit on the public exchanges and what you're seeing in the marketplace environment. Is -- it sounds like the costs are running a little bit ahead or somewhat ahead. And it sounds like, a lot of that is COVID related. But can you talk about why that is you think? And also is the demographics of the new enrollees you've seen over the course of this year, different than those that are traditionally been attracted to a Molina public exchange product? Joe Zubretsky : Sure, A.J. The first thing I would say is, the infection rate is very geographically correlated, it's probably the best word to use and so, while we wrote a lot of new membership in Texas, Washington, California, Mississippi where the infection rates are high. So we wrote new business, at the beginning of the pandemic, not knowing and not realizing that pandemic is going to last this long and persist this long. So granted, we wrote new membership purposely wrote to grow, at the early stages of the pandemic and the pandemic has persisted longer than anybody imagined. Second, any product that has an extended enrollment period or a special enrollment period has the aspect of inviting adverse selection. If you can buy insurance anytime you want, you can buy it when you need it. Now we don't think the adverse selection bias in this population was that high, but it's there. And if you're writing with a selection bias into markets that are COVID prone you're going to get COVID cases. And when you strip it all back, a 500 basis points of pressure in each of the first two quarters is the reason we are running in low-single-digit margins and not mid-single digit. And we absolutely believe as the pandemic subsides we'll produce an 80%-ish MCR for the entire year and be squarely in line with those low-single-digit margins and able to lift that into mid-single-digits into 2022. A.J. Rice: Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : The next question comes from Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead, Steven. Steven Valiquette : Hey, thanks. Good morning everybody. So, I guess just in relation to the Medicaid redeterminations being pushed out. I guess on the one hand you mentioned the incremental $150 million of revenue for every month of extension which I think you also stated several quarters ago. Then you mentioned again today that the impact has moderated somewhat. I think you talked more about a $300 million to $400 million incremental revenue opportunity in the remainder of 2021 last quarter, if it's delayed further. So I guess I wanted to just confirm that within the $1 billion revenue guidance increase for this year how much of it is tied to the redetermination just to triangulate all the numbers? Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : Sure, I just said in my remarks partially due to redeterminations the Marketplace and the pharmacy carve-outs. I'll turn to Mark to walk you through the bridge. Mark Keim : Yes. So on the incremental $1 billion that we're talking about $450 million is the simple math on three additional months of the redetermination 3x $150 million. We've also done better on marketplace as you've seen in our numbers both on OEP and SEP. We've picked up additional members as that market grows. That's probably another $150 million on full year. Then as we mentioned some of the pharmacy carve-outs there were three states : California New York and Kentucky all of which extended any view on carve-outs which gave us about another $400 million. So you put those numbers together that's your $1 billion in upside. Operator : Steven does it answer all your questions? Do you have any further questions? Steven Valiquette : That's good for me. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, Justin. Justin Lake : Thanks, good morning. Appreciate the comments on the RFP pipeline Joe during your prepared remarks. Just hoping you might be able to give us a little more color there in terms of what are some of the key RFPs we might be focused on over the next 12 to 18 months? And then anything on how you think California shapes up? I know that's probably a couple of years out from any kind of decision, but obviously an important state. Joe Zubretsky : Sure Justin. Well as I said, we continue to be very bullish on our prospects in these open procurements in new states. And there are a couple of states that we believe Ohio and Michigan which will be putting behavioral and LTSS into managed care sometime in the near future. And those are states where we already have entrenched relationships and feel very good about it. But on the new, new '22 Nevada, Rhode Island, Georgia, Iowa, Tennessee is out there. Now we may or may not bid on all of those. They have to be sequenced appropriately with reprocurement bids and other things we're working on. But those are four to five -- Georgia if I didn't mention it those are the four or five that come to mind over the next three or four years. And based on our track record we feel we have contract winning capabilities a great proposal writing team. And we've really, really amped up our in-state round game building those relationships years and years in advance of the procurement in order to really understand the state program and to have those relationships that are so important to a state contract. Your last part of your question sorry, was California. Look they've announced a year-end dropping of the RFP. We've been working on it in 2022. So we're working on that timeline. But these things have been delayed before. It's the first reprocurement in California I think in over a decade. I'm pretty sure about that. It's a complicated state. Every state as you know has a different managed care model. But we do really, really well in L.A., in Sacramento, in San Diego, the Inland Empire and we have every reason to believe that not only do we have every opportunity to defend our current positions but to actually grow in a few other counties where we currently don't play. Justin Lake : Thanks for the color. Joe Zubretsky : You\u2019re welcome, Justin. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead, Dave. Dave Windley : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. In your Quantification of the $5 of earnings power I think the last couple of dollars were from fully synergizing acquisitions. I wanted to make sure, I was clear on whether that was just counting those that you've completed, or if you were also including those that you talked about completing at the end of this year and early next year? So that's my first question. Joe Zubretsky : Dave there's a little bit of both and I'll kick it to Mark for the actual bridge. Mark Keim : Yes. So recall the numbers total around $5.50, $2.50 of that was the net effect of COVID. We talked about the Medicare risk scores. You're pointing to the remaining $2 of M&A upside. Dave that splits evenly between $1 of incremental run rate on MCC in Kentucky. Those are the ones that are already in current year performance. So in their second year, they'll mature to their full run rate that gives you $1. Then, the ones we've announced but not closed, will be in next year's performance that will give you the remaining dollar. Dave Windley : Got it. And then, Joe you talked about, and I think you really touched on this maybe last time, but talked about the risk corridors going away and that you feel pretty comfortable that that's going to happen. In thinking about, the states kind of heads they win, tails you lose on this that they put the risk corridors in to get money back when you were underspending. But, in the event that the utilization bounces back and your overspending on medical costs they've taken them away, is that -- how do you protect against that risk? Joe Zubretsky : It's a really good question, because as you know, these risk corridors by rule have to be symmetrical. So anything you potentially give up on the upside, you get on the downside. Look, the targets have been set at a point where as a company our operators, Mark Keim, our Financial Officer, myself don't even think about winning -- getting money back on the downside. It's possible, but we think the -- not we think, we know there's lots of non for profit players that may get checks from the state governments, because they're operating above. We are not operating anywhere near that target, which is why our corridors are substantial. We have some of the highest margins in the industry in many of our states, and therefore whether $1 of outperformance is related to COVID or just skill. You get it back in the corridor, if you're in 100% tier. So, we don't think about being protected on the downside, because we have -- we're not skating that close to the edge at all. And if we were, and that's just a different set of problems that we're not operating in an excellent way, we're nowhere near that territory. So, we're not at all relying on or put value in the upside protection of the corridors. Dave Windley : Got it. Thanks. And then a quick last one. You talked about the quantification of your buying power for new plans and fairly substantial amount and the ability to regenerate that as your cash flow. Where does your infrastructure stand? Are you making steady investments in infrastructure to be able to onboard that much revenue, or do you face a step function at some point in the next couple of years? Joe Zubretsky : I'll give you a quick answer and then kick it to Mark, but we have a fully ramped up integration team. And our analysis is we have lots of runway many billions of dollars of revenue to add in our current infrastructure with our current cloud-supported applications, our data centers which are now moving to the cloud. The entire infrastructure physical infrastructure, application infrastructure, all the on-the-shelf applications we use, all have the scalability to take on billions of dollars of additional revenue without hitting a step function. It's a question I've been asked before and one I look at very seriously. There's not a big bang technology redo here because of our acquisition strategy. Our platforms can handle the additional scale. Dave Windley : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead, Scott. Scott Fidel : Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask a question just on going back to the Marketplace, and just thinking about philosophically how you've approached the pricing strategy for 2022, targeting -- wanted to get to that, mid-single-digit margins that you feel that you have underneath the COVID impacts. But, just interested as we think about how you sort of input it sort of continued COVID impact into next year, potential acuity dynamics relating to the members that came in this year, particularly related to some of the extended Biden SEPs. And then, I guess just game theory to around the competitive environment with some of these newer players in particular, having been more aggressive on some of the pricing strategies. Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : Sure. This is a business, the Marketplace business, putting a frame around it. First of all, it's a strategic adjacency to Medicaid. It follows our Medicaid footprint. It leverages our Medicaid network, both in terms of network adequacy and pricing. So it's very much attached to the Medicaid business. The marketplace business will follow the Medicaid footprint. So, strategically it fits. At just over 10% of revenue, it's sort of in line with an adjunct, an adjacency that fits nicely into the portfolio. So we like the position it has. To your point about 2022, you manage this business for margin first and membership later. Because it's a blind bid business, where you're being against competitors not knowing exactly how they're going to bid, you have to be careful. And so, when we established our 2022 bidding strategy, I'll stay away from geographic detail, because I'd be giving away proprietary information, we pretty much used the higher cost baseline that we've been experiencing here early in the year. Now, that means somebody else took a flyer on it and decided that as the pandemic subsides all this cost goes away and they beat us on price fine. We'll give up the member and we'll make sure we have mid-single-digit margins. So in this business, because of the blind bid strategy, because of the inherent movement of members, who will move for price we are pricing for margin over membership, but we believe we will continue to have a very robust and profitable business into next year, but again following our Medicaid footprint. Scott Fidel : Got it. Thanks. And then just one follow-up question. Just given some of these unique dynamics particularly relating to the corridors when looking at the balance of PPS that you're expecting over the rest of the year, any insights you're willing to provide us just in terms of how the split may look between 3Q and 4Q? Mark Keim : Sure. In a typical year, you'd see a little better margin in the third quarter and a little taper off into fourth. In my prepared remarks, what I said is that, we expect to see more of a level dynamic between Q3 and Q4. Partly, it's \u2013 the utilization patterns just aren't like what we've seen in a normal year, right? What we've got continuing COVID potentially the Delta variant going into Q3 here. But the other thing is just the leveling effect of these corridors will level out the performance from one quarter to the next. So not quite the normal seasonality you'd expect to see. You might model something a little more level between the quarters. Scott Fidel : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead, Josh. Josh Raskin : Thanks. Good morning. I want to get back to the sort of scalability question. You look at the quarter and you added $280 million of revenues and G&A was only up $11 million. And I know, typically, we hear about new revenues coming in at less profitable levels and I know a large majority of that's on the MLR line and not necessarily the G&A. But just trying to figure out you guys are now at an industry-leading level. And so how sustainable is that G&A? And do you think there's investments needed in certain areas? And maybe more specifically just where are the \u2013 is it cost savings that are coming, or is it really just leverage on new revenues? Joe Zubretsky : Josh, we continue to be disciplined on the cost line. And when we talk about fixed cost leverage, our hope is not a strategy. You don't hope that it happens you actually manage through it. You bring on the Cigna book of business an additional $1 billion of revenue. We can run it with half the people that we're running it before, because of our presence in Texas. And at the corporate headquarters, you don't need to add more accountant's lawyers and HR people in order to manage the business. So we have a zog and nog strategy in terms of corporate overhead. And when we're bringing on bolt-on and tuck-ins in our existing geographies, we make sure that, we appropriately resource the business to make sure that every member and provider is getting the service they need for that we use local scale and only take on the variable cost to run the business. And Mark and his finance team and the operators are really disciplined about doing that, which is why we've said many, many times and we'll say it again on the 17th that whatever MLR pressure exists in this business, and its managed care, so it always exists, we believe can be overcome, if we're successful in our growth strategy with fixed cost leverage. And we're already starting to drive our SG&A ratio down below 7% on a consolidated basis. It's a lot lower than that in Medicaid. And obviously, Medicare brings it up. Medicare has a mid-teens G&A ratio. So the mix effect will affect that. But we have every intention of driving this ratio, given our growth trajectory down to the 6s. Josh Raskin : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, Stephen. Stephen Baxter : Yeah. Hi. Thanks. Just similar to how you broke down the incremental premiums that are included in guidance. It seems like, there's an implied $1.25 of incremental earnings power, when you think about raising the guidance and flagging the extra dollar from COVID. So I was wondering, if you could similar to how you talked about the extra $850 of Medicaid revenues and extra $150 million of exchange premiums inside of that. Any sense of what the extra $125 million breaks down to in terms of the drivers there? That would be helpful. Thanks. Mark Keim : Sure. I'll take that in a couple of chunks. Obviously, the headwind there was the dollar of incremental net COVID. So offsetting that's $1.25 of upside, right? It's probably broken into two components. I think about $0.80 of that $1.25 just relates to that $1 billion incremental revenue, we talked about. Maybe an additional $0.45, it's just on our underlying performance a little bit in the front half of the year and what we see for the second half of the year. And that's things like our payment integrity programs our UM our CM, and some of that SG&A discipline that Joe was just talking about. So the $0.80 on the $1 billion to $0.45 just our underlying performance that gets you to about $1.25. Joe Zubretsky : And the point you made is really an important one. Even though the guide is optically only $0.25 higher on, if you want to normalize for COVID, we're adding $1.25 really true earnings performance and margin on revenue, which is a really good trajectory as a jumping off point into 2022. Stephen Baxter : Thanks. And then just one follow-up on the question Kevin asked before about redeterminations. When you talk about the overall redetermination population, you're not really thinking that's going to carry a different margin than the broader Medicaid book. Are you talking about a gross margin or an operating margin? And I guess how do you think about dealing with SG&A deleveraging potential for that population? Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : We did -- I mean we did have to take on additional resources to service the increased population. So it's not as though we leveraged the complete infrastructure and therefore it's only contribution margin it's going to leave we will have some SG&A that we'll be able to depart the company. We took on contract resources. We worked overtime. We added resources in our call centers and our clinical services and those will be able to be relieved when that membership -- when that membership attrits. And again the point I want to make is we're at 680,000 members up organically since the beginning of the pandemic. That number is likely to be 750,000 by the end of the year. It's not going to the zero. The structural level of unemployment particularly in the lower rate service economy that economy was far more stressed than the average economy. The stimulus checks and the unemployment benefits are still out there. And that number is just not going to zero. Now where it lands we don't know, but we believe and it's been proven over 35 years that any time there's been an event usually some type of economic event or a recession where Medicaid enrollment has swelled that -- post event, the membership, the enrollment nationally has stayed at an increased level for years after the crisis has abated. So we're pretty comfortable in saying that 750,000 are likely to be up will not go to zero. Where it lands we don't know but the unemployment rates in many of our states particularly in the low wage service economy are still quite high. Mark Keim : And the only other thing to sprinkle on top of that is we'll talk more about this at Investor Day, but as that redetermination the revenues from that obviously form a headwind. You talked a little bit about G&A leverage component. But don't forget that will be offset with our growth initiatives our new M&A right? We've got two deals that will affect next year, new procurements and our other organic growth initiatives. So it's still a growing revenue pie and still a very attractive G&A proposition. Stephen Baxter : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Krocheski. Please go ahead. Joe Krocheski : Good morning and welcome to Molina Healthcare's third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our third quarter earnings was distributed after the market closed yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those who are listening to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that remarks made are as of today, Thursday, October 28, 2021 and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. In this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our third quarter 2021 press release. During our call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, statements regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, the current environment, recent acquisitions, 2021 guidance, 2022 premium revenue outlook, our embedded earnings power, and our longer term outlook and expected EPS growth. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that can cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report for the 2020 year filed with the SEC as well as the risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and our Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open up the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe? Joe Zubretsky : Thank you, Joe and good morning. Today, we will provide you with updates on several topics : Our financial results for the third quarter of 2021; our 2021 guidance in the context of our third quarter results; our initial outlook for 2022 premium revenue and embedded earnings power; and lastly our growth initiatives and reaffirmation of our outlook for the future. Let me start with the third quarter highlights. Last night we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of $2.83 with adjusted net income of $164 million and premium revenue of $6.8 billion. The 88.9% consolidated medical care ratio demonstrates solid performance while managing through pandemic-related challenges. The net effect of COVID increased our consolidated medical care ratio by 110 basis points and decreased net income per diluted share by approximately $1. We managed to a 7.3% adjusted G&A ratio reflecting continued discipline in cost management while making the appropriate investments in our business to fuel growth. We produced an after-tax margin of 2.3% meeting our third quarter expectations. Our year-to-date performance metrics highlighted by an 88% MCR, a 7.1% adjusted G&A ratio and a 3.1% adjusted after-tax margin were all squarely in line with our nine-month expectations, despite the significant COVID-related impacts we experienced, totaling $2 per share year-to-date. And we accomplished all of this as year-to-date, we generated approximately 50% year-over-year premium revenue growth, successfully integrated businesses, representing approximately $5 billion in annual revenue and continue to execute on our growth initiatives. In summary, we are very pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance. We executed well, delivered solid operating earnings and continued to drive our growth strategy. Let me provide some additional commentary, related to our third quarter performance. As we stated in the second quarter, year-over-year comparisons are less meaningful than they would be in a typical year, due to pandemic-related effects. Therefore, we will again focus our comments this morning on sequential comparisons. In the third quarter, we produced premium revenue of $6.8 billion a 3.3% increase over the second quarter of 2021, reflecting increased membership across our entire portfolio. We ended the quarter with approximately 4.8 million members, an increase of 142,000 members over the second quarter of 2021. We have now grown to serve approximately 800,000 additional members since the end of 2020 a 20% increase. Our Medicaid enrollment at the end of the quarter was approximately four million members, an increase of 53,000 over the second quarter of 2021. This increase was due primarily to the continuing suspension of Medicaid redeterminations, which has resulted in an increase of over 700,000 Medicaid members since the beginning of the pandemic. Our Medicare membership was 138,000 at the end of the quarter, an increase of 8,000 members driven primarily by organic growth as we follow our Medicaid footprint with an enhanced distribution strategy. Our Marketplace membership was 719,000 at the end of the quarter representing growth of 81,000 members over the second quarter of 2021, due to continued lower-than-expected attrition rates and membership additions during the special enrollment period which ended in mid-August. Turning now to our medical margin performance in the third quarter by line of business. Medicaid our flagship business, representing 77% of premium continues to drive premium revenue growth and stable earnings, as we execute on the underlying fundamentals. For the quarter, our Medicaid business achieved a medical care ratio of 89.6%, consistent with our expectations as the net effect of COVID was notable but manageable. Year-to-date our well-diversified portfolio of state contracts continues to perform well across all dimensions. Medical cost trend is stable and well controlled while we continue to deliver high-quality care particularly to high-acuity populations. The underlying rate environment is stable. Risk-sharing corridors continue to capture some of our outperformance, but many have been and continue to be eliminated. We are winning new state contracts and we are consistently finding attractive acquisition opportunities. Moving on to Medicare. Our Medicare results exceeded our expectations. For the quarter, our medical care ratio was 82.8%. Lower net effect of COVID including utilization curtailment and risk corridor true-ups combined with improved risk adjustment revenue served to drive a 490 basis point sequential improvement in the MCR. Our year-to-date Medicare MCR of 86.8% better reflects the underlying performance of this business and demonstrates our ability to clinically and financially manage the high-acuity lives in both our DSNP and MMP programs. Our Marketplace medical care ratio in the quarter was 91.3%. This reflects increased costs related to the net effect of COVID, the impact of the special enrollment period and the natural seasonality of the business. Recall that many of the new members we attracted were in regions disproportionately affected by COVID particularly in Texas. Moreover, we experienced higher non-COVID utilization by members enrolled to the special enrollment period, due to the relaxed eligibility guidelines. Our year-to-date Marketplace MCR was 84.8% and includes over 500 basis points of pressure from the net effect of COVID as well as 280 basis points of impact from the special enrollment period. We remain confident that we can achieve mid-single-digit pre-tax margins in 2022. We will accomplish this through actions already taken and changes to the environment that have already occurred. Specifically we priced to a higher medical cost trend. We redesigned our product offerings focusing on the silver tier in response to the increased premium subsidies and we note the conclusion of the 2021 special enrollment period and the more restrictive 2022 special enrollment eligibility rules. In summary, our third quarter and year-to-date enterprise results continued to demonstrate our ability to produce excellent margins while growing top-line revenue and successfully managing through the ongoing clinical and financial impacts of the pandemic. Turning to our 2021 guidance beginning with premium revenue. At our recent investor conference, we increased our 2021 premium revenue guidance to be more than $26 billion. With our third quarter results and the closing of Affinity, we are now projecting 2021 premium revenue of no less than $26.5 billion, which represents a 45% increase over the full year 2020. We are maintaining our full year 2021 earnings guidance of no less than $13.25 per share. This represents a $0.50 increase compared to the midpoint of our initial 2021 guidance despite absorbing an additional $1.50 per share from the net effect of COVID, revealing an improvement of $2 per share in underlying performance. Excluding the impact of the net effect of COVID, our 2021 guidance results in a 3.4% after-tax margin. This performance is consistent with our initial 2021 guidance and squarely in line with our long-term target margin expectations. We do, however, remain cautious in projecting our fourth quarter earnings due to a variety of exogenous factors, primarily related to the net effects of COVID across all of our businesses. Turning now to our 2022 revenue outlook. At our September investor conference, we provided the components of our initial 2022 premium revenue outlook that delivers premium revenue growth of more than $3 billion over 2021 guidance. Specifically $2.3 billion from already announced acquisitions including Affinity, which we just recently closed and the Cigna Texas Medicaid business, which we expect to close in January of 2022. Organic growth of $1 billion, representing approximately 4% growth across our current footprint. Approximately $400 million for our Nevada Medicaid launch, partially offset by a projected $500 million impact from redeterminations, which we expect to occur throughout 2022. Since then, we announced the AgeWell acquisition. Any incremental revenue from AgeWell in 2022 would likely be offset by pharmacy carve-outs in California and Ohio. A reminder, this 2022 outlook is prior to Marketplace membership changes and any additional strategic initiatives and acquisitions. Bear in mind that our Marketplace approach in 2022 emphasizes margin over membership growth. At this early stage, we expect 2022 Marketplace membership to be flat to down when compared to 2021. No matter where the Marketplace membership and revenue eventually lands, we expect the business to generate mid single digit pre-tax margins in 2022. Turning now to our longer term growth outlook. At our September investor conference, we laid out our strategy for sustaining profitable growth, a strategy that delivers 13% to 15% annual premium revenue growth off of our 2022 baseline. We expect approximately two-thirds of that growth to be organic, driven by a combination of underlying industry growth in a set of specific strategic initiatives that we described in detail. The remaining one-third will be derived from inorganic growth. The achievement, of which is supported by our current track record of M&A execution. Our profitable growth outlook as of sustaining our 4% to 5% pre-tax margins, harvesting the potential for operating leverage and accretively deploying excess capital to deliver a very attractive EPS growth rate of 15% to 18% on average overtime. The components of this growth engine are well established and working. Our year-to-date performance is testimony to the strength of that growth engine. Specifically, the Nevada Medicaid Contract Award speaks to our ability to win new state contracts to drive organic growth, and we continue to participate in additional RFPs we find attractive. And our M&A team continues to deliver. In addition to the Cigna Texas Medicaid business we announced earlier this year, this month we announced the acquisition of AgeWell managed long-term care business in New York for a purchase price of less than 20% of revenue. This acquisition complements our expanding New York footprint, serving high-acuity populations in the state. AgeWell serves approximately 13,000 members, with full year 2020 premium revenue of approximately $700 million. We expect AgeWell to deliver accretion of $0.15 to $0.20 per diluted share in the first full year of ownership. The M&A target pipeline is vibrant, and gives us confidence in continued execution. To recap our strategy, we remain committed to staying close to the core. We are a pure-play government managed care business. We believe the government managed care business has very attractive growth characteristics, demographically and politically. We aspire to provide high-quality care to our members, while driving to the lowest cost of delivery to produce attractive margins in this high-growth industry. We believe we have the right strategy and the right team to execute our sustaining profitable growth agenda. We remain extremely confident, that we can achieve our long-term targets of 13% to 15% premium revenue growth and 15% to 18% earnings per share growth. As I conclude my remarks, I want to express my gratitude to our management team and our nearly 13,000 Molina colleagues. Their skill, dedication, and steadfast service continue to form the foundation for everything we have achieved and everything we will achieve in the years to come. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Keim, for some additional color on the financials. Mark? Mark Keim : Thanks, Joe, and good morning everyone. This morning I will discuss some additional details of our third quarter performance, and then turn to the balance sheet and some thoughts on our 2021 guidance. Beginning with our third quarter results. The net effect of COVID negatively impacted third quarter results by $77 million or approximately 110 basis points of our reported 88.9% MCR. During the quarter, we experienced higher COVID-related inpatient costs that began to taper off late in September. While the total company net effect of COVID at about $1 per share was very similar to the prior quarter, the components and impacts vary greatly within our segments. Total company MCR is up 50 basis points on several segment-specific items. In Medicaid, the net effect of COVID was a cost of $49 million or approximately 80 basis points of our reported 89.6% MCR. Sequentially, the 60 basis point increase in our Medicaid MCR over second quarter was driven largely by this higher net effect of COVID in the quarter. Our year-to-date MCR is 88.8%. We continue to expect the full year Medicaid MCR to be in the high 80s. In Medicare, the net effect of COVID had a favorable impact of approximately $16 million or 180 basis points of our reported 82.8% MCR. Sequentially, the 490 basis point improvement in our Medicare MCR was driven by two items. Approximately 390 basis point improvement in net effect of COVID, which includes curtailment and corridor related true-ups; and approximately 100 basis points related to improved risk adjustment revenue. Our year-to-date Medicare MCR is 86.8%. We continue to expect the full year Medicare MCR in the high 80s. In Marketplace the net effect of COVID was a cost of approximately $44 million or 570 basis points of our 91.3% MCR in the quarter. Sequentially, our Marketplace MCR increased approximately 640 basis points reflecting several items. Approximately 90 basis points of higher net effect of COVID, roughly 250 basis points from normal third quarter seasonality associated with members reaching their policy deductible limits, and approximately 300 basis points from higher non-COVID utilization by members enrolled through the special enrollment period and higher expected risk adjustment expense. Our year-to-date Marketplace MCR of 84.8% includes over 500 basis points of the net effect of COVID, as well as 280 basis points from the impact of the special enrollment period. Due to the higher-than-expected impact we now expect Marketplace pretax margins for the full year 2021 to moderate to roughly breakeven. We expect our 2022 marketplace pretax margin will be squarely in line with our mid-single-digit pretax margin target. Turning now to our balance sheet. Our capital foundation remains strong. We harvested $127 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter which brought our parent company cash balance to $703 million at the end of the quarter. We have ample capacity to fund the announced acquisitions and additional strategic initiatives. At our current margins, we generate significant excess cash and additional debt capacity. At our investor conference in September, we sized that recurring parent cash capacity at $1.4 billion annually. Importantly as we grow that cash capacity also grows. Turning to reserves. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and we remain confident in our reserve position. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter represented 49 days of medical cost expense, an increase of one day sequentially. Prior period reserve development in the third quarter was modestly favorable, but any P&L impact was mostly absorbed by the COVID-related risk corridors. Debt at the end of the quarter is 2.3x trailing 12-month EBITDA. Our debt-to-cap ratio was 48%. However, on a net debt basis net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.6x and 40% respectively. These metrics reflect a conservative leverage position. A few additional comments related to our guidance. We increased our full year 2021 premium revenue guidance to no less than $26.5 billion reflecting the closing of Affinity and growth in all segments. Earnings per share guidance remains at no less than $13.25 per share which reflects the following : the net effect of COVID which we recently increased to approximately $3 per share for the full year, offset by our underlying outperformance and continued caution in forecasting utilization trends in the remaining months of the year due to the COVID pandemic. As previously conveyed, we continue to believe the incremental embedded earnings power of the company is in excess of $6 per share. This is composed of several items : the net effect of COVID of approximately $3 per share that should dissipate as the pandemic subsides; Medicare risk score disruption of approximately $1 per share; and as we obtain our target margins on the closed deals including Magellan Complete Care Passport and Affinity and the pending acquisitions of Cigna's Texas Medicaid business and AgeWell, we expect to achieve additional adjusted earnings per share well in excess of $2. As a reminder, this embedded earnings power does not represent 2022 guidance, but rather an accounting of the dynamic impacts that are temporarily suppressing our earnings profile. There are many other items that will affect our actual earnings guidance for 2022, including several possible scenarios for the impact of Marketplace membership, as well as the ongoing impact of the pandemic and ongoing strategic initiatives. In short, our 2021 earnings jumping off point into 2022 remains very strong. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator we are now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Borsch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Matt Borsch : Yes. I was just hoping we could revisit the topic of the redeterminations and how you see that playing out next year? I know you talked at the beginning of the call about 700,000 members that you estimate have an added as a result of redeterminations. So I'm curious, as said, how many of those you think will roll off if not perhaps potentially more and overall timeframe? Joe Zubretsky : Matt, we are forecasting that when the public health emergency ends and all the redetermination activity is fulfilled that we will end up with half the members we gained during the pandemic. And we say that, because the low-wage service economy has been rapid. The stimulus money is still out there. And time has shown that over past recessions, when Medicaid rolls have swelled, they stay increased when the crisis abates. So we're pretty confident that, membership in Medicaid post-pandemic will exceed Medicaid membership pre-pandemic. Now, over what period is a matter of judgment as you know the PHE is now planned to extend into mid-January, which means the first members with notice periods and membership notification periods the first members are eligible to roll off the books on April 1. So we have forecasted that we will be down $500 million in revenue in 2022, an additional $800 million in revenue in 2023. So the $2.9 billion of revenue gained will result in $1.6 billion of permanent revenue gain, $500 million in 2022, an additional $800 million in 2023, $2.9 billion moving to $1.6 billion. Matt Borsch : Fantastic. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Josh Raskin : Thanks. Good morning. My question is just on that embedded earnings power that you guys speak to. I'm trying to figure out the cadence of realizing sort of those embedded earnings and COVID feels a little bit like a step function potentially next year. So I'm just curious if there's big sort of step function impacts, or if this is more a series of many, many incremental benefits, and maybe just rough ballparks of sort of how we think about 2022, 2023, 2024? Joe Zubretsky : Sure, Josh. A few of them are a function of time as our acquisitions mature. And then, the wild card obviously is how much COVID will persist into 2022. And so I'll turn it to Mark to give you an accounting of how we see the $6 emerging overtime. Mark? Mark Keim : Hey, Josh. It's Mark. Just a reminder on the $6, its $3 of COVID $1 of Medicare risk scores and as Joe mentioned $2 of the M&A. So let me add a little color to each one of them. On the Medicare risk scores we should see that $1 next year. Our team can get out there has gotten out there in a meaningful way to produce that $1 next year. So we feel good about that one. On the M&A there's $2. We think about that $2 in two categories. The deals that are already in our P&L probably have another $1 of upside to get to the target margins. That's Magellan Kentucky stuff like that. The other dollar is deals that we've announced or in the case of Affinity just closed but they're not in our P&L yet. About half of that dollar, we should get in the first year -- next year and the other half thereafter. So that's some expectation on the M&A. So then, you're back to the net effect of COVID. And that's the wildcard a bunch of drivers there. Sitting here at the end of October, I don't know that we're ready to give a view on how COVID progresses through 2022. But there's, a couple of things you can think about there. Part of the $3 is in our Marketplace business. And we've had some headwinds this year. We've clearly priced for those headwinds next year. So, we should see some reversal on that within the $3. The rest is going to be a function of what does the pandemic actually do? Do we have another variant? What is the non-COVID utilization and of course the corridors. Everything we know about the corridor so far is quite positive. We have several states -- four states that have terminated the corridors for next year and many that haven't given a formal view yet, but it looks very encouraging. So, a number of drivers around that $3 will we see some of it? I'm pretty sure. But I think it's just a little early to hazard a guess on how much. Josh Raskin : Perfectly fair. And just one quick follow-up on the risk adjusters. I know you said you're feeling good. I think in your prepared remarks Mark you actually mentioned that you're seeing some benefit already from risk adjuster improvement. And I was curious how does that happen intra-year? Mark Keim : In Medicare? Josh Raskin : Yes. Mark Keim : In particular a couple of things. So, CMS actually extended the window for risk adjustment submission this year which gave everyone the ability to get more work done and more adjustment in. So, that's certainly a good guy. The other thing in Illinois. Illinois expanded their MMP coverage to the full state. They were just a few regions before. So we went in and picked up a number of new members who are coming in really positive on a risk adjustment basis. So two nice drivers for us there. Josh Raskin : Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Stephen Baxter : Hi thanks. I wanted to ask about the exchanges in your comments on refocusing on the silver plans. It does look to us like you might be pulling back somewhat on the bronze offering in some states. If that's right I would love to understand the thinking there and why you think pulling back versus repricing is the right approach? And just as you think about the comments around maybe flat to down enrollment for next year how much of your exchange book today is coming from products that you will offer next year? Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : Sure. Yes our repositioning of the product portfolio is really a function of the enhanced subsidies. We can move and our brokers can move members from bronze to silver at zero premium and high subsidies with no additional cost to the member and they get a plan with a higher actuarial value. So, it's better for the member. From our perspective, silver is more flexible and easier to manage. It's easier to develop risk scores and there's more pricing flexibility in silver. So, we're going to emphasize more silver next year than we did this year. Our bronze/silver mix is about 55-45 this year and will be more skewed to silver next year. So that's sort of our mix currently. Clearly, the special enrollment period was another headwind this year. And with the change in the rules that now people eligible -- people that will be eligible are only below 150% of federal poverty means that the membership flows some special enrollment in the industry should be a lot lower. In our case, we estimate about half of what they were this year. We added 200,000 members in special enrollment this year. And with the cutoff at 150% of FPL that's likely to be at least cut half. So, we're forecasting that our membership will be flat to down off the 719,000 this year which means revenue will probably be flat to down. But no matter where revenue lands, it's going to be earnings accretive in 2022. We are very confident in hitting our mid-single-digit pretax margin target next year even on a membership base that's likely to be lower than this year. Stephen Baxter : Got it. And just as a follow-up to last one. I guess I assume that when you make comments about mid-single-digits that doesn't require the impact of COVID to go to zero. It doesn't require you to necessarily get back that entire 500 basis points. I'd love just to kind of hear about your thought process on how much of that you could continue to tolerate and still achieve the margins? Thank you. Mark Keim : On that clearly we're carrying 500 of COVID this year. I'm not going to get into our specific pricing assumptions but we clearly anticipate more of that headwind next year as well as just a little bit of what Joe mentioned about on the SEP, but we're pricing in a manner to hit that mid-single-digit pretax. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Hall from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Michael Hall : Hey, thank you guys. So, just a quick question on the 2022 embedded earnings. More of a clarification. It sounds like you mentioned greater than $6 EPS, which it feels like a little bit of an increase in prior activity, which may be coming from pending acquisition margins now well in excess of $2. Is that true? And are you guys seeing better margin performance on acquisitions? Joe Zubretsky : I think, I'll turn it over to Mark, but yes as we add the acquisitions they're going to be accretive. We're buying them very efficiently. Many of these properties are underperforming. Our integration teams are hitting if not exceeding our accretion targets. So as we add these acquisitions they're going to be accretive. We wouldn't do them if they aren't. But yes, the AgeWell acquisition now that affinity is in the fold has served to sort of increase our forward look on embedded earnings. We still say it's $6 plus. And again how much of that emerges next year and into 2023. We'll wait until we give specific guidance on 2022 in February. Michael Hall : Got it. And just one more question if I can. On exchanges it sounds like back in your Investor Day you picked up 50,000 lives in line in August. It looks like you gained another 30,000 on top. Could you talk about what you're kind of seeing with special on loan period now having ended? And then just typical exchange attrition with the premium tax credit and maybe some membership recapture from redeterminations do you anticipate at some point returning back to normal attrition level? Joe Zubretsky : Well, the special enrollment period ended in August. We believe that we'll see attrition between now and the end of the year. It will likely be lower than it was pre-pandemic, but we have 719,000 members now. We'll lose some and probably end the year maybe slightly below 700,000. Mark Keim : And remember normal attrition for us is about 2% a month. As Joe mentioned this should be a little bit less than that going through the rest of the year, but I think that's a fair outlook. Operator : The next question comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks. A couple of questions. First, can you talk a little bit about the difference in COVID spread for the exchanges versus Medicaid. Obviously you've given a lot on the exchanges, but we think these membership populations is somewhat fungible I guess outside of the duals. But is -- I'm curious why you think that the exchange population is such have to be COVID cause versus the Medicaid population really not being there? And then my second question is just on California Medicaid with the potential we're going to see an RFP here soon. I was hoping you can give us a little bit of an update. I know on your business there in terms of -- I know -- I think you have some business that's direct and then some that's partnered. And how you think this RFP is going to shake out in terms of what the state is looking for? Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : Sure. Justin on the marketplace and the COVID impacts there are really two factors. One is geography. Our marketplace business just happens to be in places that were hit hard particularly by the Delta variant Florida, Texas, California, Washington. So it follows the geography and follows our Marketplace footprint. The second, we believe is our marketplace population skews younger. Unvaccinated people that are being infected, but the cost of care on an episode basis is actually a bit lower. But the infection rate is high and the younger population that tends to be unvaccinated. So those are the two factors that we cite that seems to disproportionately affect our Marketplace business. On the California RFP, we believe we're very, very optimistic about our ability not only to hold on the business we have but to grow it. As you know we're very strong in L.A. We're very strong at Sacramento and San Diego. We have a nice business in the Inland Empire. We have a great reputation with the state. We perform well. We do all the hard work we need to do with respect to community involvement and charitable giving. We're in really good shape for the California RFP which supposedly at least the latest announcement will come in early 2022 for a contract date for 1/1/24. So we're in good shape in California. We're very optimistic about our prospects not only to maintain what we have but to grow. Operator : The next question comes from Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So with the list of action items you're taking to get the Marketplace MLR and the pre-tax margins back on track for 2022 versus 2021, among those pricing probably is the biggest lever. But for the other ones you mentioned, such as, just redesigning the plan offerings and the more restrictive eligibility rules is there any color just on the range of how much those might move the needle on margins? Like could those move margins in the hundreds of basis points, or is it mainly really about the pricing to move your margins by let's call it 500 basis points or so in 2022 versus 2021 in the Marketplace business? Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : A little bit of both. I mean, we priced to a medical cost trend in Marketplace that was somewhat reflective of the increased baseline that we experienced this year impacted by COVID. Second, so we priced to an increased medical cost trend. Second, the special enrollment members were experiencing a loss ratio in the mid-90s. And if that membership \u2013 some of that membership will renew, some of it will go away. And then of course, next year, the special enrollment period will be targeted at folks with 150% of federal property level incomes are down. So we believe that, the special enrollment period membership will be half or less than half of what it was this year. So all of those factors combined put us in really good shape and producing our mid-single-digit pre-tax margin target for next year, but as I said, likely on membership that is flat to down over 2021. Mark Keim : And the only thing, I'd add there Steven is, with a big focus on margin rather than membership, we'll have a much higher component in our book of renewals. And the way risk adjustment works is we get much better scores on those renewals, once we've lived with the member for a year or two. So we derive better risk adjustment revenue, and certainly more confidence in the outlook of that revenue. Steven Valiquette : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Two quick questions. One sort of talk around it on the Marketplace, but a lot of people came on board this year. You said and others have said it, during the extended SEP and it sounds like there may have been some adverse selection there. Do you think these people will re-up next year? Are you assuming the aggregate enrollment on the exchanges is actually down because some of these people won't renew proactively? And then my other question was I know you said, you're up 300 basis points sequentially in non-COVID utilization in marketplace. Can you comment on where you are in the non-COVID utilization relative to 2019 or pre-pandemic or baseline whatever you want to do? And Medicaid, Medicare and I guess even that basis in Marketplace, if you don't mind? Joe Zubretsky : Sure. I'll try to parse through the various questions. On the first one, we did assume in our pricing that some of the SEP membership would renew, and therefore increased the cost trend that we included in pricing to accommodate that. Now, how many actually do renew and how many just joined because of an episodic health care condition and will leave, we'll have to wait and see. But we did price as though some of those renewal members \u2013 some of those SEP members would renew, and we think we've captured that in the medical cost trend we've included in our pricing. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Hi. Great. Thanks. I just wanted to go back to $3 COVID impact. I just \u2013 I've heard a lot of companies initially sized the COVID Impact number, and then slowly walk back kind of how we should expect it to come back or when we should expect it to come back or almost, if we should expect it to come back. And I just wanted to hear how you guys are thinking. It sounds like the Medicare risk assessment number is relatively clear, but I just want to make sure there's no issues about reinvesting some of that or something like that, so that the net number might be lower. And then, if we should expect you guys to continue to kind of that number for us as we head into next year, and give us an update on where we are versus that $3 number, or does that just get hard to do and you're not going to be breaking that out for us? Joe Zubretsky : It's \u2013 I'll answer the first part of that Kevin, and then I'll turn it to Mark. It's really difficult, because even though our COVID results quarter-to-quarter costing us $77 million and $1 per share seem like it was stable. The stories are quite different. In the second quarter the COVID direct cost of care were less than $100 million and it's twice that in the third quarter. And what ends up happening is when the COVID infection rates are really, really high and it's really intense, you get this counterbalancing impact of utilization curtailment. People fear of contagion of going in for services, hospitals and treating these COVID patients and can't accept discretionary and elective procedures and the like. So the third quarter, actually was one of our highest quarters, if not the highest quarter for the COVID, the direct cost of COVID-related care, but significantly offset with utilization curtailment. And then the corridors the risk-sharing quarters just kind of title through on a very stable basis. It's going to follow the infection rate, which makes it very hard to forecast. As we sit here today, we hope that Delta variant is over. We hope there are no additional variant, but we just don't know that yet. And so as we get closer to February, when we announce our fourth quarter results, we'll probably have a better handle. We will have a better handle on what we think COVID will do in 2022 and we'll announce it then. But the quarter-to-quarter results seem stable on a net basis, but the components are quite volatile, and it just follows the infection rate. Mark Keim : And just to build on that Kevin, then what you have within what we call the net effect of COVID is the curtailment and the direct cost of COVID that Joe talked about. As a company, those two have worked in tandem so far, but you'll have to take a view on that next year on how this COVID evolved. And do we continue to see curtailment as the offset to that. We all need to take a view on that going into the new year. And then lastly on corridors, that is a component of our total net effect of COVID as well. As I mentioned earlier, we're optimistic that many states have already announced they won't have corridors in the new year, but how much of a continued drag will we have in some of the other states, remains to be seen but we're optimistic on that one. So that was $3 of the embedded earnings around the net effect of COVID. $1 you mentioned, on Medicare risk adjustment. As I mentioned, we continue to be very, very positive on the development of that $1. Remember, the pieces that we gave, aren't guidance. They're embedded earnings, which along with other headwinds or tailwinds can emerge. Medicare is looking pretty good. We'll see that dollar emerge, but don't forget we'll have things like sequestration next year and a few other factors that could add additional headwinds and tailwinds, but we feel good about that dollar. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Interested if you can give us some of your initial observations on how the 2022 Medicare AEP is progressing so far? And just interested in particular with a bunch of those new non-DSNP products that you rolled out for 2022, how those seem to be resonating in the market? Joe Zubretsky : We think we're in good shape for growth next year. We're not giving a growth expectation on Medicare at this stage. But you're absolutely right, we launched some traditional Medicare Advantage products in some of our DSNP footprint to capture folks who had incomes that didn't allow them to be eligible for DSNP but were low income, using the same network, the same facilities and access to the same type of brokers who operate in those various areas. So, we're really optimistic about our growth prospects as we launched our MAPD products to low-income individuals and our expanded DSNP footprint and additional penetration in our existing footprint. We still do not have the market share that we think we can ultimately obtain in our DSNP footprint. So we're really bullish on the prospects during AEP this year, bearing in mind that we do get to enroll certain people throughout the year as well. Scott Fidel : Got it. And then just as a follow-up, just interested if we can go back to the Marketplace, and just how you're thinking about the overall market environment for 2022, now that we have all the landscape data out, et cetera. I mean we can certainly see that your pricing is firm certainly relative to the market, as you've been talking about looking to regain margin. Clearly, from the market overall, a lot more issuers right in the market. Benchmark premiums are lower again next year. So, just interested in how you're thinking about the competitive environment and sort of the level of rationality for the marketplace next year? Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : Sure, Scott. Our strategy is somewhat different than many of our competitors' strategies. What we're targeting are the working poor. We leverage our Medicaid network. We leverage our Medicaid network pricing, and our target market is fully or highly subsidized members. We are not targeting the mass affluent. That's number one. Number two, we did price this year to make sure that we hit our target margins of mid single-digit pre-tax. The way we look at this business is the revenue is going to float up and down with a fixed target margin at mid single digits. We will price for mid single-digit margins, and we'll let the revenue float up and down. The marketplace is a residual market. It flexes up and down with Medicaid eligibility. It's 15 million members nationally strong. We're in great shape in the markets that we choose to play in and our target market is somewhat different than the target markets for many of these new competitors. So, wherever revenue and membership plans for next year, it will be earnings accretive in 2022. Operator : The next question comes from David Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead. David Windley : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Joe, I wanted to just kind of marry a couple of 4% together. Your -- in your Investor Day, you talked about in your long-term growth expectations for Medicaid kind of 4% growth on the like-for-like base presuming -- I don't think you talked in detail, but presuming some of that enrollment some of that's a little bit of rate. When we look at your assumptions around retention of the redetermination, you're kind of assuming the 375 on your base at the beginning of the pandemic. Also works out to be about 4% per year growth if the pandemic weren't to have happened. I guess, I'm wondering if the elevated retention of these pandemic lives, the redetermination lives is not a little bit of a pull forward on the future or a double dip. And just wondering if you could elaborate on your thoughts around the ability to continue to grow the base 4% even if you retain this higher level of redetermined lives. Mark Keim : Hey, it's Mark. I'll take that one. So, you're right. On Medicaid, we talked about the base growing at 4%, which is as you mentioned probably half and half between rate and membership growth. That's the market continuing to grow. Now what we stacked on top of that was the headwinds of redetermination. Joe talked through earlier how that was $0.5 billion in 2022 and another 800 million in 2023. So your question gets back to, does that dampen the 2% membership growth? I think it's where you're going. And we don't think it does, because at the end of the day the pool of Medicaid eligible population continues to grow. So yes, you have redetermination, which is addressing people over the last two years, which maybe have lost eligibility. But if the overall pool is growing and we believe it is, we showed a chart at Investor Day that shows every time the country goes through a crisis of one kind or another, these Medicaid roles increase, but they don't go back to where they were. They're sticky at maybe half the growth quite frequently. So we think that overall pool is growing. So we'll have a little bit of a headwind of people from the past losing eligibility, but the pool of new folks coming in and newly eligible continues to grow. So, we feel pretty confident in that outlook. Joe Zubretsky : David I always say that whether redetermination is a headwind or a tailwind depends on where you're measuring it from. We like to think of it as a value creator, because we measure it from pre-pandemic. The Medicaid roles will be higher post pandemic that may work pre even though year-over-year there might be some choppiness. David Windley : Got it. Thanks. And just one more question on non-COVID utilization. Are you seeing signs of changing acuity as non-COVID utilization comes back? It's not a topic that's gotten discussed very much. Joe Zubretsky : No. We -- in many of our markets and in many of our products, it appears to be business as usual, particularly as the Delta variant started to dissipate in late September into October. In August, the Delta variant was really intense and August utilization was very high and we saw some curtailment there. But again, it flexes up and down -- almost routinely flexes up and down with the intensity of COVID infection rate. So in many of our states and many of our products, the curtailment is no longer, but it flexes up and down with the COVID infection rate. David Windley : Got it. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Gary Taylor from Cowen. Please go ahead. Gary Taylor : Hi, good morning. Just a couple of quick questions. As you were talking about 2022, you laid out some nice potential tailwinds. Wondering if there's anything notable on the headwind side to talk about now? I know you suggested COVID's obviously an unknown. You talked about a couple pharmacy carve-outs that I wouldn't imagine are material to earnings. Otherwise, you would have mentioned it, but any notable potential headwinds we should be thinking about as we're updating models? Joe Zubretsky : No, I think -- yeah, I would say we've made some judgments around redetermination. Certainly, how much COVID persists into next year that you've identified and then there's just the puts and takes of managed care. Are you capturing -- are you managing medical cost to your trend. But I can't think of an event-driven -- a headwind that is kind of event driven or situationally driven. Just managing managed care, but we have a proven ability to always manage our medical costs to the trend that is embedded in our products and the pricing of our products. So we're pretty comfortable that 2022 could shape up to be a very attractive year for us. Gary Taylor : Thanks. And then my other question would just be how do we think about the roll-off of the COVID risk corridors impacting seasonality of margins and earnings in 2022? Should we think the earnings become a little more back-end loaded than perhaps they had been pre-COVID? Joe Zubretsky : Well, four states have eliminated them. Many of the states that are on January one rating cycles have not yet declared whether they will continue them or not. The only one that actually is formally continued into next year is in Mississippi. So it's hard to say. As they're announced either to be eliminated or to persist and whether they persist for a full-year or half year is just largely unknown at this time. So I think your point, is a correct one. It -- whatever happens we'll likely expect our quarter-to-quarter results next year. Whether it's back-ended or front-end loaded, I don't know yet, but the only corridor that actually has been announced that persists into 2022 because their state fiscal year straddles the calendar year is Mississippi. Gary Taylor : Okay. Thanks, Joe. Operator : And our last question comes from Mike Newshel from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Mike Newshel : Thanks. So you talked about the adverse selection especially in rolling period this year. Are you worried at all that you might see some similar adverse selection maybe to a lesser degree from the monthly special moment periods for low incomes? And I guess, in the same vein for the Medicaid lives subject to redetermination that you mentioned, would you expect differences in the acuity and margin profile of the half you expect to keep versus the half it goes? Joe Zubretsky : No. On the Medicaid, I'll answer the Medicaid question, first. On the Medicaid side we're pretty comfortable that wherever membership goes, how much reduced membership there is because of redetermination, the margins that we're experiencing on the population should be thought of as our portfolio averages. There's actually very little evidence that the acuity of the population shifted all that much. And if it did, some of the states enacted retroactive acuity adjustments that are already embedded in our earnings and then of course, there's the corridors where any favorable experience is given back through the corridor and not through your rates. So we're pretty comfortable saying when you think about membership increases and decreases in Medicaid, due to redetermination we think of it in terms of portfolio averages. On the Marketplace side, we really increased the trend we embedded in the pricing of our product, which I think is demonstrated through some of the filings, you've seen where we really tried to capture not only the higher baseline due to COVID but the higher acuity on what we are experiencing very early in the special enrollment process. And that coupled with the fact that we should have fewer members coming into our membership roles in special enrollment next year. Again gives us great confidence that that mid-single-digit pre-tax margin is attainable. Operator? Operator : There are no more questions in the queue. This concludes our question-and-answer session.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Krocheski, SVP, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Joe Krocheski : Good morning and welcome to Molina Healthcare\u2019s fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. Joining me today are Molina\u2019s President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our fourth quarter earnings was distributed after the market closed yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those who are listening to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that remarks made are as of today, Thursday, February 10, 2022 and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. In this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our fourth quarter 2021 press release. During our call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, statements regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, the current environment, recent acquisitions, 2022 guidance, our embedded earnings power, and our longer term outlook. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K Annual Report filed with the SEC as well as the risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and our Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open up the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe? Joe Zubretsky : Thank you, Joe and good morning. Today, we will provide updates on several topics; our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2021, our initial 2022 revenue and earnings guidance, and our growth initiatives and reaffirmation of our sustaining profitable growth strategy. Let me start with the fourth quarter highlights. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of $2.88 with adjusted net income of $170 million and premium revenue of $7.2 billion, an increase of 48% over the prior year. The 88.8% consolidated medical care ratio demonstrates solid performance while managing through pandemic-related challenges. The net effect of COVID increased our consolidated medical care ratio by 150 basis points, decreasing net income per diluted share by approximately $1.50, which is $0.50 more than previously expected.  We managed to 7.4% adjusted G&A ratio, reflecting continued discipline and cost management while making the appropriate investments in our business to fuel growth. We produced an adjusted after tax margin of 2.3%. Excluding the net effect of COVID, our adjusted after tax margin was 3.5%, squarely in line with our long-term target.  We are very pleased with our fourth quarter performance with respect to both the delivery of solid earnings and the focused execution of our profitable growth strategy. The quarter marks the end of yet another very successful year, a year in which we continue to produce a high level of financial performance while navigating the effects of a global pandemic. We executed well and sustained solid operating margins, while driving significant revenue growth. Now, turning to full year highlight, we reported full year 2021 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $13.54, a 6% increase over initial full year guidance. We absorbed $3.50 of cost related to the net effect of COVID, which was $2 higher than initial guidance, implying $2.80 of improved underlying performance. Excluding the net effect of COVID, our after tax margin was 3.6%, consistent with our long-term target. We generated premium revenue of $26.9 billion, an increase of 47% over our full year 2020 premium revenue and $3.9 billion above our initial 2021 guidance. This strong premium revenue growth was well-balanced between organic growth and bolt on acquisition and is a testament to our successful transition to sustain profitable growth. From a membership perspective, we ended the year with 5.2 million members, a 1.2 million member increase year-over-year. Notably, this 29% growth across all three segments was enhanced by the suspension of Medicaid redetermination and the special enrollment period in marketplace.  Turning now to our full year performance highlights by line of business. Medicaid, our flagship business, representing 76% of total company premium, produced strong premium revenue growth and stable earnings, as we continue to execute on the underlying fundamentals. For the full year, our Medicaid business achieved a medical care ratio of 88.7% consistent with our long-term MCR target, as moderate net effective COVID was offset by strong medical cost management. For the year, our diversified portfolio state contracts performed well across all dimensions. Underlying medical costs trend was stable and well controlled, particularly within our growing population of high acuity members, while we continued to deliver high quality care. The right environment was stable and risk sharing corridors recaptured some of our outperformance but many already have been and will continue to be eliminated. For the year, our Medicare medical care ratio was 87.2%, a very strong result, squarely in line with our long-term target range and demonstrating our ability to clinically and financially manage the high acuity members in both our D-SNP and MMP program. This line of business plays an important role in the portfolio, as each year over 30,000 of our Medicaid members turn age 65. Our marketplace medical care ratio for the full year was 86.9%, well above our long-term target. This reflects the significant cost related the net effect of COVID in our largest geographies, and the high cost impact of the adverse selection related the special enrollment period. Approximately 300,000 members were attracted to our product during this special enrollment period, accounting for 25% of full year marketplace member month. All told, our marketplace performance has been a disappointment. Later, Mark will summarize the steps we have taken in the environmental factors, which will allow us to restore margin to our mid-single digit target in 2022. You will hear that included in our revenue guidance is a planned reduction in marketplace membership and a related 38% decrease in 2022 marketplace revenue. However, we expect this repositioning of our product to be significantly accretive to 2022 earnings and establish a strong foundation for this business going forward.  2021 was also a very successful year across multiple dimensions of our profitable growth strategy. Specifically, we successfully re-procured our Ohio Medicaid contract, and were awarded a new state contract in Nevada, validating our ability to retain existing state contracts, as well as win new business in new states.  Our M&A engine continued to execute at a high level. During the year, we announced two new acquisition, Cigna\u2019s Texas Medicaid business and AgeWell in New York, for combined premium revenue of approximately $1.7 billion. In October, we closed the New York-based Affinity acquisition, adding over 300,000 members and approximately $1.6 billion of annual premium revenue. And we successfully integrated three previously closed acquisitions representing approximately $5 billion in annual revenue, which continued to provide earnings accretion.  In summary, our full year 2021 enterprise results continue to demonstrate our ability to produce excellent margin, while growing premium revenue and successfully managing through the ongoing clinical and financial impacts of the pandemic.  Turning to our 2022 guidance, beginning with premium revenue; we are very pleased with the continued success of our profitable growth strategy. In 2022, we project premium revenue of approximately $28.5 billion, a 6% year-over-year increase on a reported basis and 14% growth before the effect of regulatory headwinds and the planned decline in marketplace revenue. This is consistent with the initial outlook provided on our third quarter 2021 earnings call. This growth is well-balanced between the new contract win, organic growth in our current footprint and the full annual run rate of our recent acquisition. Incremental to our revenue guidance will be the AgeWell acquisition when closed and any further extension of the public health emergency and the resulting suspension in Medicaid Redeterminations beyond April.  Moving to earnings guidance, our initial full year 2022 adjusted earnings guidance per share is no less than $17 or 26% growth year-over-year. We project a 3.4% adjusted after tax margin, consistent with our long-term target. Our 2022 earnings profile reflects durable and sustainable operating improvement and earnings growth. Included in our 2022 guidance is the realization of $3.50 per share of our 2021 embedded earnings power and additional organic earnings growth, partially offset by the effects of regulatory headwinds. With COVID still providing $2 of earnings per share pressure in 2022 and a few of our acquisition integration not yet fully matured, we still have embedded earnings power remaining to support future earnings growth.  In summary, our 2022 guidance features premium revenue growth of 14% before regulatory headwinds in the marketplace reset and strong earnings per share growth of 26% with key operating and margin metrics squarely in line with the long-term targets we shared at our September 2021 investor conference. I will now provide a few concluding comments that frame our profitable growth strategy. We remain committed to staying close to the core. We intend to remain a pure play government managed care business, which has very attractive growth characteristics, demographically, and politically. We aspire to provide high quality care to our members, while driving to the lowest cost of delivery to produce attractive margin. We believe we have the right strategy and the right team to execute it. Our strong finish to 2021 and our 2022 guidance position us well and give us great confidence, we can achieve our long-term target of 13% to 15% premium revenue growth and 15% to 18% earnings per share growth on average over time.  As I conclude my remarks, I want to express my gratitude to our management team and our nearly 14,000 Molina colleagues. Their skill, dedication, and steadfast service continued to form the foundation for everything we have achieved, and everything we will achieve in the years to come.  With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials and 2022 guidance. Mark? Mark Keim : Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. This morning I will discuss some additional details of our fourth quarter and full year performance. I will then turn to the balance sheet and some thoughts on our 2022 guidance. Beginning with our fourth quarter results by segment. In Medicaid, we reported an 88.3% MCR, a strong result that included continuation of costs from the net effect of COVID, offset by strong medical cost management. In Medicare, our reported MCR was 88.3%. During the quarter, the emergence of the Omicron variant had a greater impact on our Medicare population than on our other segments. Focused medical cost management and better than expected risk adjustment offset the net effect of COVID in the quarter.  In marketplace, reported MCR was 92.1%. While COVID infection rates in our marketplace population declined from the peak of the Delta variant in August, the net effect of COVID continued to pressure results in the fourth quarter. The Special Enrollment Period membership, which grew to almost 40% of our marketplace book in the quarter, also contributed to the elevated marketplace MCR.  Turning to full year results, our full year consolidated MCR was 88.3%. This result is modestly above our long-term target, as strong performance in our Medicaid and Medicare businesses was offset by the performance of our marketplace business. Specifically, our full year Medicaid MCR was 88.7%, in line with our 88% to 89% long-term target. Our full year Medicare MCR was 87.2%, in line with our 87% to 88% long-term target. In both Medicaid and Medicare, strong medical cost management, offset the net effect of COVID. Our full year marketplace MCR of 86.9% is well above our 78% to 80% long-term target, and includes approximately 430 basis points of the net effect of COVID as well as approximately 360 basis points from the impact of the Special Enrollment Period.  Turning now to our balance sheet, our capital foundation remains strong. We harvested $218 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter, which brought our year end 2021 parent company cash balance the 348 million. Debt at the end of the quarter is 2.1 times trailing 12 months EBITDA. Our debt-to-total cap ratio is 47.8%. However, on a net debt basis, net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.8 times and 43.9% respectively. These metrics reflect the conservative leverage position, and ample cash capacity for additional growth and investment.  During the quarter, we redeemed our senior notes due 2022 using the proceeds of our November debt offering of notes due 2032. This refinancing will lower our total interest expense by 50 basis points, and extend our debt maturity towers to 2028 to 2032. More importantly, the transaction marks the final step in our capital restructuring strategy. We have eliminated the costly convertible bonds and addressed all near term maturities at coupon rates well below similarly rated issuers.  Turning to reserves, our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and we continue to be confident in our reserve position. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter represented 51 days of medical costs expense, an increase of two days sequentially.  Now turning to guidance, beginning with membership. We ended 2021 with approximately 4.3 million Medicaid members. As discussed, our 2022 guidance reflects the resumption of redeterminations, which we expect will more than offset Medicaid growth drivers and result in 2022 year end membership of approximately 4.1 million members. In Medicare, we ended 2021 with 142,000 members. We expect year end 2022 total Medicare membership of approximately 150,000 members. This reflects strong AEP growth in our MAPD and D-SNP products and the addition of members from our Cigna Texas Medicaid acquisition. In marketplace, we ended 2021 with 728,000 members. Based on open enrollment, we expect to begin 2022 with approximately 320,000 members, reflecting our strategy to achieve target margins in this business for 2022. Accounting for a limited SEP and normal levels of attrition through the year, we expect to end 2022 with approximately 250,000 members.  Turning now to premium revenue guidance. We expect premium revenue of approximately $28.5 billion or 6% growth. Excluding regulatory headwinds and our marketplace reset, this represents 14% growth over 2021. Specifically, our premium revenue guidance includes the following growth drivers; a full year of the acquired Affinity business, which closed October 25, and the Cigna Texas Medicaid business, which closed on January 1 for a combined $2.2 billion, approximately $1.1 billion of organic Medicaid and Medicare growth in our current footprint, and approximately $400 million for the Nevada Medicaid contract, which began on January 1. Partially offsetting these growth drivers are several headwinds to 2022 revenue growth; 1.2 billion of lower marketplace premium revenue, reflecting our strategy to restore target margins in this business, approximately 400 million related to the resumption of redeterminations, and 500 million from the carve out of pharmacy benefits in our California and Ohio Medicaid contracts.  Consistent with past practice, AgeWell is excluded from our 2022 guidance. We continue to expect this acquisition to close in the third quarter of this year, and will provide $200 million or more of additional premium revenue in 2022 when closed. Turning now to earnings guidance. We introduced our initial full year 2022 adjusted earnings guidance of no less than $17 per share, reflecting 26% growth over 2021. Our EPS guidance reflects the realization of approximately $3.50 per share of 2021 embedded earnings consisting of approximately $1.50 per share of lower net effective COVID, roughly $0.50 per share for improvement in Medicare risk adjustment, approximately $1 per share, as we attain target margins in Magellan Complete Care and Passport and approximately $0.50 per share for the recently closed Affinity and Cigna Texas Medicaid acquisition.  Our 2022 guidance also includes approximately $0.80 per share of marketplace margin improvement not captured in the lower net effect of COVID. This is offset by the net impact of organic earnings growth and the resumption of redeterminations and the previously discussed pharmacy benefit carve outs. The restoration of marketplace margins to mid-single digits in 2022 will be accomplished through actions already taken. Specifically, we price to a higher medical cost trend, anticipating a more moderate COVID and SEP impact. We redesigned our product offerings, focusing on the silver tier in response to the increase member premium subsidies. Based on recently concluded open enrollment period, we expect to have a higher percentage of renewing members. We also expect a lower mix of special enrollment membership in 2022, based on the revised eligibility rules and our revised product design and distribution strategies. We expect many of these changes will also improve our risk adjustment results.  Moving on to select P&L guidance metrics. We expect our medical care ratio to be approximately 88%. The MCR improvement over 2021 is primarily due to lower net effect of COVID, our actions to improve marketplace performance in 2022, continued progress in medical cost management in our legacy and acquired businesses, and improvement in Medicare risk scores. We expect our adjusted G&A ratio to improve to 6.8%. This reflects discipline cost management, fixed costs leveraged from our revenue growth and mix, offset by continued investment in growth and capabilities. The effective tax rate is expected to be 25.4%. Adjusted after tax margin is expected to be 3.4%, consistent with our long-term targeted range. Weighted average share count is expected to remain flat at 58.4 million shares and we expect that just over 50% of our full year earnings will be produced in the first half of the year. As mentioned, our 2022 guidance includes the realization of $3.50 a share of 2021 embedded earnings, leaving approximately $2.50 a share of embedded earnings power in 2022, comprising the net effect of COVID of approximately $2 per share, which should continue to dissipate and approximately $1 per share, as we attain our target margins on closed deals, including Affinity, Cigna\u2019s Texas Medicaid business and our pending acquisition of AgeWell, partially offset by roughly $0.50 per share a projected Medicaid redetermination impact in 2023. As a reminder, this embedded earnings power does not represent 2023 guidance, but rather an accounting of drivers that are temporarily suppressing our earnings profile, and our current projection of the impact of Medicaid redeterminations post 2022.  This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America, please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. Great. Thanks. I just wanted to ask about the exchange because that was a surprise for me in this guidance. Can you talk a little bit about how do you think about this business sustainably, just looking back and, I guess, over the last eight years, six of those years, you either grew that business by over 50% or you dropped that business by over 50% in a given year, so very volatile from year to year, it\u2019s hard to see kind of what the strategy is long term. How comfortable are you that this is actually a base that you can grow off of in that low to mid -- sorry, mid to high single digits picture forecasting long term. Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : Sure, Kevin. It is Joe. The strategic positioning of the business really hasn\u2019t changed. This is an adjunct to Medicaid. We serve the working poor, we leverage our Medicaid network, we leverage our Medicaid network pricing and our Medicaid footprint. So the strategy hasn\u2019t changed, 90% of our members are fully or partially subsidized. That is the market segment we are approaching. What you\u2019re observing this year is really a capital allocation decision. We never intended to have 728,000 members; that was a function of the Special Enrollment Period, which not only grew membership beyond what anybody expected, but added a significant element of adverse selection. Really what you\u2019re seeing this year is the repositioning of the product, as Mark suggested in his comments, from a pricing perspective, from a structural perspective, from a metallic tear perspective, and from a distribution perspective, to continue to target the working poor and to more emphasize the silver tier that is much easier to price to and to financially manage. So, this is a business where we\u2019re more focused on margin than we are on membership and we will let membership float up and down with our ability to obtain mid-single digit margin. Mark, anything to add? Mark Keim : I think that\u2019s right, Joe. If you look back to 2020, we were about 318,000 members at the end of the year. 2021 probably would have looked a lot more like 2020, if it wasn\u2019t for the SEP that Joe talked about, which almost none of us in this space knew pretty much at this time last year. Backing out that SEP, 2021 would have looked a lot like 2020. Here we are in \u201822 with an outlook that\u2019s a lot like 2020 and 2021 before the SEP, so I think this level in our portfolio is about the right level, but as Joe mentioned, we will be entirely pricing for margin not for volume. Kevin Fischbeck : You\u2019re not talking about increased competition or irrational pricing here. This is more of a company-specific decision. I just want to make sure I understand is this a market issue or is it just Molina\u2019s strategy. Joe Zubretsky : Our strategy is to focus on our Medicaid footprint and to capture individuals who at times income out of Medicaid and have a marketplace product to buy from us at zero premium. That\u2019s always been the strategy. And again, if you look back just a year ago, we\u2019re at 300,000 members and then of course the Special Enrollment Period, added 20,000 to 40,000 members a month while coming on to the to the marketplace roles at a higher acuity. So this is a capital allocation decision. It\u2019s a function of the SEP, it\u2019s a function of the pandemic, and we are comfortable with this business at roughly 7% to 8% of revenue, leveraging our Medicaid footprint, and we think our capital allocation is appropriate as we\u2019ve now repositioned the risk profile of this business. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Matt Borsch of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Arianna Brady : Good morning. This is Arianna Brady on for Matt Borsch. I was wondering if you could give more detail on the expected timing of the Medicaid redetermination and how much certainty and visibility you have around the process? Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : Sure. With the public health emergency now having been extended to April, given the notification periods that are required, the first members will not be re-determining, reestablishing eligibility until July 1. We estimate that given that we grew organically, approximately 750,000 members, since the beginning of a pandemic, that equates to approximately $2.9 billion of revenue. We believe that $2.9 billion of revenue will decrease by 1.3 billion to a $1.6 billion residual target and that will happen partially over 2022 and then partially over 2023. Mark, you want to go through the numbers. Mark Keim : Yeah, just to build on that. So that\u2019s a 1.3 billion decline over time but that\u2019s going to happen over a couple of years. So in my prepared remarks, I mentioned 400 million impacting our 2022 outlook, and the additional 900 million in \u201823. So our target was expectation that we would keep half of these members gain since the start of the pandemic. They\u2019ll come off over time per the public health emergency, and the revenue impacts across the two years are as I mentioned. Arianna Brady : Great. Thank you. Operator : Next question is from Nathan Rich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Nathan Rich : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the questions. I wanted to follow up on the member attrition in marketplace. I guess I\u2019m just trying to think about the 475,000 member decline for 2022 and how that\u2019s balanced between member attrition, potentially due to SEP and maybe the adverse selection that you mentioned, I think, the 300,000 that you saw sign up during that period and any competitive factors that you may have seen in the in the market. And Mark, maybe could help us think about how much marketplace margins were impacted by that adverse selection dynamic in 2021, as we think about where kind of marketplace margins ended the year and the improvement that\u2019s contemplated to get to mid-single digit margins for 2022. Joe Zubretsky : Well, first on the membership and revenue question, what\u2019s interesting and should be noted, that although membership is down by over 60%, revenue is down by less than 40% because we shifted the book to the silver tier, the silver tier has a much richer product design and therefore revenue flow. So the PMPM revenue on silver is much higher. So the operating leverage is very positive. With respect to the margin, we are very confident on a return to mid-single digit. This produced -- this business -- due to the SEP and a pandemic, this business produced a low-single digit margin loss on $3 billion of revenue in 2021. We expect now to return that to a mid-single digit margin gain on $2 billion of revenue in 2022. So, sort of a seven to eight point increase in margins, a lot of it due to the elimination of the COVID pandemic, and much of it also due to the adverse selection that the SEP produced. Mark, the numbers? Mark Keim : Yeah, absolutely. So if you look at our membership, as you point out, we\u2019re down some 60% end of \u201821 versus \u201822 but as Joe mentioned, our revenues in marketplace are down 38%. Why the disconnect? Within our new membership is a very different mix of bronze versus silver. Last year, 2021, we had about 41% of our portfolio in bronze, that\u2019ll be down to 15% in 2022. As I\u2019m sure you know the PMPM, the revenue PMPMs are quite different between bronze and silver, they\u2019re about 300 in bronze, and about 550 in silver on average across the portfolio. So that kind of offsets a lot of the volume decline, just on higher PMPMs on those members. Now on the margins, Joe mentioned last year it\u2019s 86.9 MCR but we\u2019re tracking this year to a 79, which is smack in the middle of our long-term guidance for marketplace MLR. A couple of things that bridges from last year two this year, obviously, we took significant pricing, as we looked into the New Year. Your specific question around what did SEP and COVID cost us? I think we mentioned at a high level in our prepared remarks, we carried across marketplace 430 basis points of COVID last year and 360 basis points from the SEP. So you put those two together that\u2019s 8% of headwind that I\u2019m not expecting in the New Year. COVID, we all have a more optimistic outlook for COVID in the New Year and SEP, the market will be behaved differently this year, the regulations are different, pure people can sign up and our distribution strategy puts us in a different place, I just don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have that exposure. So you get the 8% pricing coming into the New Year. You remove that headwind of COVID and SEP throw a trend assumption on there for what a normalized trend assumption could be and you have a very clear path to that high 70%, 79% MLR I\u2019m talking about. Nathan Rich : Thanks. Appreciate the detail. Operator : The next question is from Stephen Baxter of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Stephen Baxter : Hi. Thanks for the updated view on earnings power. I guess just, first, appreciated actions were required on the exchange business. I guess, how should we think about the foregone membership there is impacting the earnings power dynamics you\u2019ve talked about through 2021? It seems like, in aggregate you\u2019re kind of at the same ballpark as you were before, just trying to make sure I can follow that. And then second, just sort of appreciate if you could provide a little more detail on what\u2019s still in the $2 of COVID pressure at this point. It sounds like maybe you\u2019re getting back $0.50 of the dollar per scores, maybe that\u2019s half -- or excuse me a quarter of it. But we think about the balance, it sounds like you\u2019re saying that all three businesses, I think, will be roughly a target margins. Just trying to understand where you feel like the opportunity still is. Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : Sure, Stephen. You mentioned the embedded earnings power, which is not a theoretical construct, we didn\u2019t construct it in the abstract, it\u2019s real. And as we previously disclosed, sitting on top of our $13.50 actual results for 2021, about $6.50 was embedded earnings power. Clearly, with the significant impact of the pandemic, was something reasonable to account for. And because we\u2019ve been so acquisitive, we thought it was also helpful to account for the growing accretion of our closed acquisition. So sitting on top of our $13.50 results in \u201821 was an additional $6.50 in embedded earnings. We have harvested $3.50 of that embedded earnings inside our $17 -- at least $17 plan for 2022. Also, as you suggested, sitting on top of the $17 is an additional $2.50 of continued embedded earnings power, due to the net effect of COVID, due to the Affinity and Cigna Texas acquisitions, which are new to the portfolio and AgeWell will add a little bit as well. So it\u2019s a real construct, the Embedded earnings have been harvested inside the 2022 plan, and some still exists to add to future earnings growth here over time.  And the net effect is COVID, we account for three things. We account for the direct cost of COVID-related care, we attempt to estimate the effect of utilization curtailment due to the pandemic, and then we account for the effects of the corridor. As we previously suggested, the corridors were significant in 2021. We had nine of them that were financially significant that has been reduced to three for 2022. So they linger on into \u201822 in the state of Washington, Ohio, and Mississippi. We have every confidence when the PAHD [phonetic] ends, they too will be eliminated. But that\u2019s really what\u2019s in the $2 net effective COVID for 2022 are the lingering effects of three corridor. Stephen Baxter : Thanks for color. Operator : The next question is from Michael Hall of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Michael Hall : Hey, thank you guys. Appreciate the color on the exchanges, I understand you\u2019re pretty confident on double digit margin to appears but just wanted to clarify, so a large percent of these lives that were lost, basically, were very low to no margin, maybe even negative margin, so earnings impact was basically negligible. And looking forward, are you now at a place where the portfolio is fully right-sized, you\u2019re ready to charge ahead at 5% to 8% long-term growth a year? Joe Zubretsky : Yes. Just, again, some additional color, the answer is yes, that special enrollment membership ran at a very high loss ratio. In fact, the volume, it represented about 40% of the member month volume in the fourth quarter alone and 25% for the year; ran at 105% MCR in the fourth quarter and just about 100% for the full year. So that was a significant contribution to our issues this year. As Mark suggested, blend it over the entire year, it was 260 basis points of MCR pressure, so we expect that to completely reverse into next year. The business is positioned where it should have been, pre-SEP. As I said, we follow our Medicaid footprint, we sell to highly subsidized members. Now that we\u2019ve repositioned the mix to more silver than bronze, we have every confident that this is a solid baseline, mid-single digit margins, and probably mid to low single digit growth here over the foreseeable future. Operator : The next question is from Josh Raskin of Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Josh Raskin : Thanks. Good morning. I\u2019ve got a bigger picture question around where Molina is in their sort of corporate life cycle. And obviously the turnaround, Joe, since you\u2019ve got there about four years ago, it\u2019s been much more successful than I think anyone expected and feels mainly driven by this big margin improvement and some opportunistic M&A. But it seems as though we\u2019re getting to a point where there are some top line headwinds, and it\u2019s sort of ebbing and flowing. And as you look over the next few years, I\u2019m curious about the plan to extract more value from that membership, not just the embedded earnings that you talked about, but real value over the long term. And are we at a point where scale and maybe other non-insurance-based capabilities become more important? Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : It certainly is part of our strategic planning process to look at all opportunities for allocation of capital. And yes, we\u2019re well aware of the capability builds that happen in other companies, we\u2019re well aware of vertical integration with providers. We believe, for the foreseeable future, there is so much growth, both in the demographics, actual membership growth, particularly in the high acuity segment, that we don\u2019t have to look far beyond our ability to take capitated risks, particularly with high acuity members, manage it really well, be a rate taker in Medicaid, grow Medicare, and use this ballast of marketplace, as this residual mechanism, that we don\u2019t need to do much beyond that, to sustain the growth around. We never would have suggested a 13% to 15% revenue growth and 15% to 18% EPS growth by 2025, if we didn\u2019t see enough runway to continue growing the business and in the swim lanes we\u2019re in. So certainly in our strategic planning process, we always look at capability build, we are not going to allocate capital to vertically integrate with providers. For us, we do not think that\u2019s a good deployment of capital. But there\u2019s so much runway with the number of lives that will go managed and particularly the high acuity lives that we don\u2019t need to do much beyond that. Josh Raskin : Very helpful. Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions here on the exchanges. First, Joe, going back to the third quarter, you had talked about exchange membership being flat to down. So you certainly indicated that there could be some pressure here, but the fact that flat was in the ballpark, potentially, right the 60% decline is certainly more than I think any of us expected. So I was hoping you could tell us a little bit more about what happened between the third quarter and today that so significantly changed the outlook for the exchanges, like did you cut commissions or something? Is there something structural that you did or is this just pie or turn? What can you tell? Joe Zubretsky : Well, certainly all the strategies that we were executing for 2022 were in place during the third quarter, they had to be, as we\u2019re going into open enrollment. Yes, membership is down but we withdrew in just about all of our markets the bronze product. Now, how many of those members were going to then take up a Molina-based silver product was a matter of estimation. Would I have hoped to end up with more membership if it was silver? Sure but 320,000 out of the gate is just fine. So as you take a complete product set off the shelf, except in three states where the circumstances are quite different, so basically pull it off the shelf, it was hard to know how much of that membership would have stayed in a Molina product with silver. But the good news is the members that we do have, most of them are renewal members, and 85% of them are silver. So irrespective of where we started and where we ended up, we\u2019re ending up in a really, really good place that portends well for the production of the mid-single digit margin. Justin Lake : Great. And then I\u2019d love to get your opinion on a couple of things. You talked about the impact of the Special Enrollment Period, both in margins and membership. I\u2019d love to hear your view on like, how sticky do you think that membership is, in terms of 2022, right, if we don\u2019t have those Special Enrollment Period, like what do you think happens with those members? Also, there\u2019s a lot of talk about the fact that with Medicaid redetermination, we could see a lot of those members move from Medicaid over to the exchanges. So, what do you think happens with those two things specifically? And then maybe you can give us your kind of view of what you think the marketplace is going to do in terms of enrollment overall, given all those different swing factors in 2022 versus 2021? Do you think it grows or shrinks? Joe Zubretsky : Sure. Well, certainly. When insurance is available to you, anytime you need it, you buy it, and it should be no surprise that the effects of the adverse selection were significant. So the question then becomes, what happens to that cohort, a lot of the uptake during the special enrollment period was bronze. So to the extent that that product was one that was affordable, and no Molina bronze product was available, they either renewed with us into silver or didn\u2019t renew us at all. The other fact that\u2019s really important is if the acuity of the member didn\u2019t change, they\u2019re still high acuity, but now we still have them. The fact that we\u2019ve now had them for over a year means that we\u2019ll be able to capture risk scoring more appropriately and the fact that they\u2019re in silver means the risk score will count for more revenue. So the fact that some of these members renewed into the renewal book into 2022 is fine, the number is not very high, but now we have visibility into their acuity, we will be able to capture the risk score and at least earn a silver product.  Long term, my comments are going to really extend to our strategy, which is this is a high subsidy strategy to follow our Medicaid footprint. My view of this has always been and I\u2019m looking -- I was always looking for the right word, it\u2019s a residual market for Medicaid. As members get part time jobs and have an income level just above Medicaid, they\u2019re probably eligible for highly subsidized marketplace product. Our strategy has always been to target that market. Now, our execution has been less than perfect on that but that\u2019s always been the strategy. So this is going to grow with the working poor, with the Medicaid population as people flex up and down. So we think there, as we said, an Investor Day low-single digit growth rate, mid to -- I think it\u2019s 5% to 8%, I think is the right number. And we\u2019re confident that that\u2019s the way the business will grow with a yield that\u2019s probably half of that and membership growth that\u2019s another half of that. But it\u2019s a product that should flex up and down with Medicaid as the Medicaid rolls move up and down. Mark Keim : And Justin, it is Mark. The only thing I\u2019d add to that is I think you asked about redetermination as well. As you know we have the projections for some revenue coming off and some members through redetermination, what we don\u2019t have is those members picked up in our marketplace product at the margins we expect to drive here that is all upside to our projections. But we have a meaningful effort out there to pick up the redetermination members in our marketplace and Medicare in some case products through cross sell, which has meaningful upside to the numbers we\u2019ve talked about today. Justin Lake : Right. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from AJ Rice of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. AJ Rice : Hi, everybody. Let me just ask you about the Medicaid business. So can you comment on what the RFP pipeline looks like, where the opportunities are, where the defending requirements might be? And specifically, maybe comment on California that\u2019s been in the press lately with discussion about this idea with Kaiser Permanente. Do you think that\u2019s going to be a normal RFP process, from your perspective or are there nuances of difference? And I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve commented on your expectations for the \u201822 average composite rating crease across your state that you\u2019re seeing in Medicaid. And I wonder if I\u2019ve missed that or if you would give that. Joe Zubretsky : AJ, first, thanks for asking about Medicaid. It\u2019s obviously 80% of the revenue base and we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the result that the Medicaid team produced in 2021 and the plan for \u201822. I mean, it\u2019s now a total of nearly $24 billion of revenue, $23 billion of premium revenue, and it\u2019s going to operate north of a 3% after tax margin. We continue to win new business. And yes, we do have to retain and defend our existing contracts, as you suggested. The California RFP was distributed just yesterday. We believe the Texas RFP will be distributed late in the first quarter and Mississippi is in the middle of a proposal writing effort, as we sit here today. Most of the other procurements are longer dated, but those are the three, we have a high confidence in all three of them. We run a really well run business in California, we have a great team. As you know, it\u2019s a pretty complex state with respect to how the region\u2019s work. And yes, I think us and the rest of the managed care industry were disappointed that Kaiser was awarded a no bid contract but it\u2019s not as though it\u2019s some transformational event that\u2019s going to reshape the entire medical landscape, it\u2019s incremental. In fact, most of the impact will be in tooth plan regions where the local health plans have major share. So, high confidence in California, high confidence in Texas. In fact, we say that the fact that the regulatory process for the Cigna acquisition went so well, that it is testimony to the high regard the state holds us in with respect to the STAR+PLUS population.  With respect to new states, as you know, there\u2019s $108 billion pipeline over four to five years. We certainly won\u2019t chase every opportunity in every state. We are very selective as to where we think we can win evaluating a series of criteria. But our proposal writing team, our business development team, are extremely active, and to date have demonstrated a great deal of success with a Kentucky win and Nevada win and defending the Ohio contract. So the business is performing extremely well and at 80% of revenue, it needs to enhance and the outlook for growth, both organically and inorganically, is pretty robust. AJ Rice : Okay. Any thoughts on the rate increase for \u201822 on average? Joe Zubretsky : I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve given a specific percentage but the rate increase was low-single digit across in Medicaid across the book. We are comfortable with its actuarial soundness. It has generally kept pace with our view of normalized medical costs trend, which also was low-single digit. So the rate environment is stable. It\u2019s rational, the principle of actuarial soundness and the return to a prospective setting of rates based on a sound medical baseline and the removal of these corridors seems to be happening as quickly as we originally estimated. AJ Rice : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : The next question is from Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : Great. Thanks. Good morning, I guess two more interrelated questions on marketplace. You know, first, just with the drop off in membership by 65% from 728 to 250. As we think about the quarterly cadence around that, do you have any sense where that\u2019ll shake out at the end of the first quarter in particular? And then is it possible that the 250 year end number, maybe, it\u2019s just conservative around the progression around all this? And then the second question, maybe just ask it now to this kind of interrelated, with the 65% decline in membership, revenue is expected to decline 38%. As we think about the delta between those two numbers, how much of that is just driven by that shift from bronze to silver versus just premium increases, just trying to get a proxy for what drives the delta between that two, a little more color on that? Joe Zubretsky : Most of it is the shift from bronze to silver, which is a very significant differential in the PMPM revenues that those products generate. But we did go for it and attain a highest single digit rate increase in that business. In terms of where we start, and where we end, I think we said we started with 323 [phonetic] and 30,000 members, after the whole Annual Enrollment period. We are projecting pre-pandemic levels of attrition, which averaged 1.5% to 2% a month. Now, if that doesn\u2019t happen, we\u2019ll end up with more than 250,000 members by year end. We\u2019re also expecting not to pick up many members during Special Enrollment. As you know, the Special Enrollment Period still exists but the eligibility requirements have been significantly reduced to where only people at less than 150% of Federal Poverty Level income are eligible. So, if we \u2013 we won\u2019t pick up SEP members, we\u2019re confident in that and if attrition is at 1.5% to 2% a year, the 250,000 number by year end is about where we will end. Steven Valiquette : Okay, all right. Got it. Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Scott Fidel of Stephens. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel.: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Just interested if you can give us your initial thoughts on the 2023 MA [phonetic] advance notice? And then just walk us through your capital priorities and how you think about capital appointment at GR in terms of M&A opportunity, buybacks, etc. Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : Sure. Obviously, like the rest of the industry, we were pleased with the advanced notice, second year in a row that it looked very attractive on its surface. We\u2019ve grown our Medicare business, even though half of it is demonstrations, which likely won\u2019t grow, the other half is his marketing business and the DSNP product that will grow. And in the fact we are growing from 142,000 to 152,000 members is significant. So we\u2019re really happy with the growth characteristics of the business. We think two years straight of rate increases, give us a lot of room to put the right benefits in the product to rate it appropriately, and to win new business and have margins in the mid-single digit after tax territory where we\u2019re positioned today. So we\u2019re really bullish on our Medicare business and we have a great team that will grow that business here over the foreseeable future, as we said in our Investor Day. Capital deployment, mark? Mark Keim : So on the capital side, I feel really good about our dry powder. We\u2019re starting off the year with a good cash balance at the parent. Our projected cash flow for the year is strong. And you can see the leverage metrics gives me a lot of room to raise more if I needed. On the M&A side, I\u2019m encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing for the year. Number of things in the hopper right now; of course, they all move at their own speed, we never make commitments about when they might happen but good line of sight on a number of targets, which I\u2019m hoping to deploy the capital against. What Joe and I have always been adamant about, though, is share repurchases, when and where appropriate. There\u2019s some small amount that is just not part of our normal hygiene that we would probably do during the course of the year. Not a big commitment by any means but just on an annual basis, there is some small amount we like to do. Part of that\u2019s, though, a function of what the M&A pipeline turns out on, we\u2019ll have to see how that plays out on the year. Operator : The next question is from George Hill of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I know a lot has been covered here, so I just was going to ask one about the PBM carve-ins. And I guess could you talk about, is the impact that meaningful at all? I didn\u2019t hear you guys called out in the prepared commentary and didn\u2019t have anything on in my notes. So maybe just kind of maybe walk through the mechanics, how does it impact the income statement? Is there any meaningful impact of the financials from the PBM carve-ins? Joe Zubretsky : I think, you are, George, referring to the PBM carve outs, yes in California. George Hill : Carve out for you guys, carve in to the state. Joe Zubretsky : Okay. Okay. Thank you. Just wanted to make sure we\u2019re talking about the same thing. Sure, we have a $500 million revenue decrement, in our forecast for the year due to the carve outs, which is a full year of California and a half a year of Ohio. And obviously, there\u2019s margin implication to that. These revenues that are taken out into a fee for service environment generally carry with them the average Medicaid margin. So think of it as the loss of the average Medicaid margins on $500 million of revenue. George Hill : Helpful. Thank you. Operator : And the last question comes from Gary Taylor of Cowen. Please go ahead. Gary Taylor : Hi, good morning. Most of my questions sort of touched on one way or the other, but just refining a little bit. Do you have any -- on the non-SEC exchange population, do you have any retention figures on that piece versus what it historically look like or it is too early? Joe Zubretsky : Gary, want to make sure we answer your question. When you say retention, you\u2019re talking about throughout the year our lapse rate or you\u2019re talking about how many members renew from the prior year? Gary Taylor : The latter. Mark Keim : Yeah, we do have pretty good insight at this point, a much better proportion of our starting membership this year is renewal, meaningfully better than say even last year. Part of that is with the smaller book, a number of our members rolled over with us. So we kept a much higher percentage of renewal members this year and that\u2019s a really good thing because we know those members better, we have the history on them and that converts right into risk adjustment, and starting the year with a much better risk adjustment position and obviously being able to code those members right out of the gate. So we feel good about that higher level of renewals, and it does translate into risk adjustments. Gary Taylor : Right. And then my second one was on the Medicare risk adjustment headwinds related to the pandemic, I thought at one point, you cited that $1, it sounds like you\u2019re saying you\u2019re going to recoup $0.50 of that in 2022. Does it still mean there\u2019s another $0.50 for that and that\u2019s maybe kind of embedded in your remaining COVID recapture or has the dollar changed or am I just [Multiple Speakers]. Mark Keim : No. It\u2019s Mark. Your memory is quite good. We, we used to talk about $1 of Medicare risk score in our embedded earnings. That is we just weren\u2019t able to get out there and do the in-home assessments and the risk scoring during the pandemic the way we had historically, so we were carrying $1. Now the good news is late in the third quarter, especially in the fourth quarter, we were actually able to realize part of that. CMS extended the window for submissions from 2020, which meant we were able to get a little bit more of that into the back half of \u201821. As a result, that dollar fell to $0.50 at the end of the year and will realize that $0.50 in our guidance. So the dollar we used to talk about $0.50 you got in third and fourth quarters, the other $0.50 you\u2019re getting in guidance at it. Gary Taylor : Got it. Okay, thank you. Operator : This concludes our question and answer session and today\u2019s conference. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] And I'd now like to turn the conference over to Joe Krocheski, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Joe Krocheski : Good morning, and welcome to Molina Healthcare's first quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing the first quarter earnings was distributed after the market closed yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be made available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that the remarks made are as of today, Thursday, April 28, 2022, and will not be updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. In this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our first quarter 2021 press release. During our call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding current 2022 guidance, our growth strategy and expected growth, our RFPs positions, the COVID-19 pandemic, our acquisitions, our future margins and embedded earnings power and our long-term outlook. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the Risk Factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report for the 2020 year filed with the SEC as well as the Risk Factors listed in our Form 10-Q and our Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe? Joe Zubretsky : Thank you, Joe. And good morning. Today, we will provide you with updates on several topics : our financial results for the first quarter 2022; our full year 2022 guidance in the context of our first quarter results and our growth initiatives and the reaffirmation of our strategy for sustaining profitable growth.  Let me start with the first quarter highlights. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of $4.90 with adjusted net income of $288 million. First quarter premium revenue grew 19% year-over-year to $7.5 billion, driven by strong membership gains in Medicaid and Medicare. Our 87.1% consolidated MCR in the first quarter is squarely in line with our long-term target range and demonstrates strong operating performance even as we continue to navigate pandemic-related challenges. In the quarter, the net effective COVID increased our consolidated MCR by approximately 50 basis points, decreasing net per diluted share by approximately $0.57. Within the net effect of COVID inpatient COVID costs in the quarter were the highest since the beginning of the pandemic, surging in the month of January and then steadily subsiding throughout the quarter. These costs were mostly off by COVID related utilization, curtailment and effective medical cost management. Despite the continued pandemic-related impact, we produced an adjusted after-tax margin of 3.7%, a very strong result that is at the high end of our long-term target range and consistent with normal seasonal patterns. Turning now to highlights by line of business. In Medicaid, we ended the quarter with approximately 4.6 million members an increase of approximately 700,000 or 18% year-over-year. This strong performance drove 24% Medicaid premium revenue growth year over year. Increased membership was the balanced result of our recent acquisitions and organic gains supported by the redetermination pause. In the first quarter, we continued to generate excellent margins in our Medicaid business with a medical care ratio at 88.1%, which is in line with our long-term target. The enduring highlights of our flagship Medicaid business are as follows. Our diversified portfolio of 18 state contracts provides for excellent distribution of risk related to rate setting and contract reprocurements, actuarially sound rates prevail, and the rate setting process establishes a credible medical cost baseline with forward trend and benefit changes. Poor medical cost trends remain stable and well controlled. The few remaining COVID risk-sharing corridors continue to capture some of our outperformance, but we expect these to be eliminated over time. And we continue to execute our growth strategy. Our in-state market shares are large enough to be relevant to our state customers, yet small enough to support significant growth opportunity. In Medicare, we ended the quarter with 148,000 members or 17% growth year-over-year, with related premium revenue growth of 18%. Our performance was driven primarily by organic gains and our D-SNP and MAPD products as we continue to increase our market share and our existing footprint and expand geographically to match our Medicaid footprint. Our reported Medicare MCR was very strong on the quarter at 86.5%, which is below the low end of our long-term target range, even after absorbing 190 basis points of COVID-related pressure. In marketplace we ended the quarter with 371,000 members. This result is higher than previously projected, driven by higher-than-expected effectuation rates during the later stages of open enrollment. The declines in membership and premium from prior year are consistent with our previously communicated strategy to reposition the book of business and its risk profile. Our marketplace business is now more appropriately sized in the overall portfolio. Our first quarter marketplace MCR was 78.6%. This result is in line with our long-term target, even after absorbing 270 basis points of COVID-related pressure and reflects the successful implementation of our strategy to restore this business to target margins. As Mark will discuss in a moment, the favorable mix of renewal membership and the silver-tier products, gives us great confidence that we will achieve our 2022 margin goal. In summary 2022 is off to a very strong start. Medicaid, our flagship business, representing 80% of revenue, continues to produce strong, predictable operating results, and cash flow. Our high acuity Medicare niche serving low-income members continues to grow organically and exceeded our long-term target margins. In marketplace a complimentary product in our government subsidized strategy is now well-positioned for success at 7% of total company premium revenue. Turning now to our 2022 guidance, beginning with premium revenue. We now project premium revenue to be approximately $29.25 billion or approximately $750 million above our previous guidance. Our revenue growth rates are consistent with our long-term targets. Specifically, our updated premium revenue guidance now includes approximately $400 million of additional Medicaid revenue resulting from the extension of the public health emergency from April to July and the associated suspension of membership redeterminations. Approximately $100 million of marketplace revenue resulting from stronger open enrollment as we now expect to end 2022 with approximately 270,000 members. And approximately $250 million related to state-based passthrough revenue payments. As in the past, we have excluded from our premium revenue guidance, any impact of the AgeWell acquisition, which we expect to close in the third quarter of this year. Turning now to earnings guidance : We are increasing our full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share guidance to know less than $17.10. Specifically our increased 2022 earnings guidance reflects the favorable impacts of strong first quarter performance, underlying strength in the business in the rest of the year, the margin associated with the increase in our premium revenue, the combination of which is largely offset by a $0.50 per share increase in projected net effect of COVID. We have remained cautious in forecasting utilization trends in the remaining nine months of the year. Due to the uncertainties of COVID, and related utilization curtailment as well as core medical cost trend we believe at the end of the second quarter our membership will have seasoned enough to allow us to fine tune our forecast of COVID related medical cost and core medical cost trend. We are confident in our 2022 outlook that features revenue growth rates consistent with our long-term targets, and after tax margin at the midpoint of our long-term guidance range and strong earnings per share growth of 26%. Turning now to an update on our strategy for sustaining profitable growth. Building on our momentum from last year, we are off to a strong start in 2022. Based on our past track record, we are confident in successfully retaining the Medicaid contract that are currently in a procurement process. Our RFP responses have been submitted in Mississippi and California and are pending evaluation and subsequent award announcement. The Texas STAR+PLUS RFP has been issued by the state and our response is currently being developed. We have a high degree of confidence in retaining these contracts as a result of our operational and clinical excellence, standing and reputation, innovation and the demonstrated ability to write winning proposals. At the beginning of the year we successfully launched our Medicaid plan in Nevada, adding a new state to our footprint and 125,000 members. With multiple RFP opportunities over the coming years, we remain confident in our ability to win additional new state contracts. We have one new state proposal pending in Rhode Island and many other new state business development opportunities well in process. Our M&A platform continues to execute at a high level. On January 1st, we closed on the acquisition of Cigna's Texas Medicaid business, deepening our service offerings in the state and adding 44,000 high acuity members. Our acquired businesses are achieving or exceeding their earnings accretion targets. The pipeline of acquisition opportunities remains robust. We are confident in our ability to drive continued value from this important dimension of our growth strategy. The company's performance continues to validate our long-term strategy and its value creation and potential. We can and will grow the top line at 13% to 15% per year on average over time by a combination of market share gains, new contract wins, footprint expansion and of course bolt-on M&A. We can achieve this growth and maintain pre-tax margins in the range of 4Tto 5%. Rates are stable and our effectiveness at medical cost management while ensuring optimum quality has been consistently demonstrated. A number of external factors are combining to support government sponsored healthcare. In particular demographics, economic disruptions and political priorities are working together to generate meaningful tailwinds for the industry. And finally, our strong cash flow generation gives us ample capacity to invest in new capabilities and acquisitions. Our strategy is sound validated with each quarter's performance and will continue to be valued creating. As I conclude my remarks, I want to express my continued gratitude to our management team and to our nearly 14,000 Molina colleagues, their skill, dedication and steadfast service form the foundation for everything we have achieved and everything we will achieve in the years to come. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Keim for some additional color on the financials. Mark? Mark Keim : Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. This morning, I will discuss some additional details of our first quarter performance. I will then turn to the balance sheet and some thoughts on our 2022 guidance. Beginning with some detailed commentary of out our first quarter results, the total company net effective COVID reduced net income by $0.57 per share and added 50 basis points to the consolidated MCR. This result was largely consistent with our expectations. However, the impact varied by lines of business with minimal impact on Medicaid and larger impacts on marketplace and Medicare. In Medicaid our reported MCR was 88.1%, a strong result that was in-line with our long-term target. For the quarter the net effective COVID was a modest 10 basis point increase to our reported MCR as the high volume of inpatient stays and COVID related corridors we're largely offset by curtailment of utilization. In Medicare, our reported MCR was 86.5% better than our long-term target. During the quarter, the net effect of COVID increased our reported MCR by 190 basis points. This pressure was more than offset by favorable risk adjustment and product mix. In marketplace our reported MCR was 78.6%, this result was in line with our long-term target despite absorbing 270 basis points of net effect of COVID. Our reported MCR was also influenced by our strategy of focusing on silver products, which experienced less MCR seasonality than bronze products due to lower deductibles. Silver members, as a percent of our book increased from approximately 50% in the first quarter of 2021 to 75% in the first quarter of 2022. Additionally renewal members now comprised two-thirds of our membership, up from one-third last year. These factors combined with a more limited SEP in 2022 give us continued confidence in restoring margins to our mid-single digit target in 2022. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 7.1%, reflecting increased temporary of labor costs due to industry-wide hiring challenges and some one-time items. We expect our full year 2022 G&A ratio to be consistent with our long-term target. Turning now to our balance sheet : Our capital foundation remained strong. We harvested $115 million of some bestiary dividends in the quarter and our quarter-end parent company cash balance was $250 million. Debt at the end of the quarter was 2.1 times trailing 12-month EBITDA. Our debt-to-cap ratio is 46.3%. However, on a net debt basis, net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.8 times and 43.5% respectively. These metrics reflect a conservative leverage position and ample cash capacity for additional growth and investment. Turning to reserves : Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and we continue to be confident in our reserve position. Days and claims payable at the end of the quarter was flat sequentially at 51 days of medical cost expense. Finally, a few comments on guidance. We have increased our 2022 adjusted earnings guidance to no less than $17.10 per share. We continue to project slightly more than half of the year's earnings in the first two quarters. In addition, we have increased our view of embedded earnings by $0.25 to $2.75 per share. The increase is driven by the higher net effect of COVID we are now expecting this year, partly offset by moderately higher impact from redetermination that we expect next year stemming from the extension of the public health emergency. As a reminder, this embedded earnings power does not represent 2023 guidance, but rather an accounting of drivers that are temporarily suppressing our earnings profile, and our current projection of the impact of Medicaid redeterminations post 2022. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Ben Rossi : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question here. Ben Rossi filling in for Matt. I just wanted to ask about the exchange. So as a follow-up to the expected revenue number attrition for marketplace, which decreased about 30% for premiums and about half membership enrollment from year-end last year, can you help us think about how trends and marketplace margins were impacted by the diverse selection dynamic this past quarter compared to where margins sit at the end of the year? Because you previously mentioned last call about a possible 7 to 8 point increase during the quarter. I'm just curious on how that progress is coming along. And where do you think the rate of about 1.5% to 2% monthly attrition is still representative for the group? Joe Zubretsky : Hi Ben, this is Joe. The marketplace business is now perfectly positioned to achieve our mid-single digit pre-tax margin target for the year. I will tell you it's very difficult to make comparisons year-over-year given the substantial mix shift that we orchestrated from 2021 to 2022. So some data points are 78.6% MCR in the quarter was burdened by 270 basis points of COVID \u2013 so on our ex-COVID basis is closer to 76 that will light grow for seasonality during the year modestly. And we believe we'll achieve in the middle of our long-term target range at 79% for the full year. We're confident in that, as Marc said in the prepared remarks because of the mix of renewal membership versus new membership, which is now two-third renewal, one-third new. The mix of silver versus bronze, which is now 75/15 and last year it was 55/45 and the fact that the SEP period last year took all comers. There were no income cutoffs and this year we believe the eligible population for SEP has been basically reduced by half due to the limitation on income to 150% of FPL. So year-over-year comparisons are very, very difficult given the dramatic orchestrated shift in the book. The business is now very, very well positioned to achieve our mid annual digit pretax margin for the full year. Ben Rossi : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. I just wanted to clarify the comment about how MLR has performed versus your long-term target in Q1. Is that basically a comment that you'd expect the years MLR to come in as expected because some businesses, I guess, particularly the exchanges have that seasonality where you'd expect Q1 to always be the lowest in the quarter, and therefore almost always be below your target MLR for the year? Or are you saying it's below your target MLR for Q1? Just trying to understand if you're telling us that this will persist to the rest of the year or just whether Q1 was a good quarter? Joe Zubretsky : Sure. Kevin, it's Joe, and then I'll kick it to Mark. Yes, there is some modest seasonality to the business. In fact, I would say that the seasonality and marketplace is much more dampen than it has in the past due to the higher silver mix that we have one data two. The answer to your question is both, we're hitting our long-term targets both on the quarter and we expect to hit them for the full year, although there's 70 to 90 basis points of seasonality from the front end of the year to the back end of the year. Mark? Mark Keim : Yes, that's exactly right, Joe. The answer is both within the quarter all three lines of business were in \u2013 within the long-term guidance. In fact, Medicare was better and they're all tracking to be squarely in the middle of long-term guidance on a full year basis and of course that's reflected in our full year guidance Operator? Operator : The next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : Great, thanks. Good morning, everybody. So yes, just regarding the COVID impact on MLR across all your books of business in the first quarter, it was obviously pretty low on Medicaid, but then much higher on Medicare and marketplace. I guess I'm curious which one of the three COVID impact trends really surprised you the most in the first quarter? And also as we think about that the extra $0.50 of EPS headwind in the guidance for 2022 from COVID, is there any bias for that to be skewed towards any of the specific books of business? Or is that just too hard to predict right now? Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : Hi, Steven, it's Joe, and then I'll kick it to Mark for some additional color. The net effect of COVID was slightly higher than our expectations in the quarter. I remind everyone that we calculate or estimate the net effect of COVID as being the direct inpatient cost of COVID related care offset by an estimate of what we believe to be utilization curtailment due to the pandemic. And furthermore the effect of our outperformance in the states that continued to carry the COVID related corridors forward. That's how we calculate the impact. For the most part in the recent past we've seen the direct cost of COVID related care, which were very significant in the quarter. It surged in January and was significantly reduced in both February and March, pretty much offset by curtailment, not totally but pretty much. And then of course our outperformance, which we continue to enjoy in the states that have carried for the corridors, continues to be captured by the corridors. So it was a little higher than expected and the reason we increased our estimate for the full year is you're never completely comfortable that curtailment will always be a direct offset to COVID related care. And to the extent it doesn't, we wanted to be conservative with our outlook for the year. Mark Keim : Yes. And just to build on Joe's comments, clearly in Q1 we saw higher net effective COVID as a percentage or in the MCR in Medicare and marketplace. As Joe mentioned the increase of $0.50 across the rest of the year really about some certainties and some conservativism about the outlook for the cost of COVID in-patient in the related curtailment. Where that might manifest? We've typically seen a little more in Medicare and marketplace, but it can move around among the lines of business but I think that's a pretty good overview of our outlook. Steven Valiquette : Okay. That's great. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on your comments around the $2.75 of kind of pent-up earnings. And as I look at your \u2013 as I look at your run rates from an EPS perspective, it looks like your margins are towards the or pinned to the higher end of your old target rates across the book. One is that right or do you feel like you've still got some room to the high end? And if so, if you are at the higher end, do you feel like you have upside to those margin targets? Do you feel like there's further room in terms of earnings power or should we look at that $2.75 as being more cushion again something that could happen, like state rates, get a little tougher or what have you? Joe Zubretsky : Sure. Justin, its Joe, and then I'll turn to Mark for some color. But we are operating in the first quarter given the seasonality of the business, at the high end of our margin range we produced an after tax margin of 3.7% on a pretax margin of 4.9%. For the year, as I just suggested with the MCR seasonality commentary that that will moderate to where we estimate in our full year guidance of pretax margin of approximately 4.4% and 3.3% after tax in the middle of the range. So yes, if you then take embedded earnings purely without any other puts and takes for future forecasting and guidance; it would bring you higher in the range, which is entirely possible. But as you suggest our embedded earnings guidance is not a forecast. Our embedded earnings estimate is not a forecast and is not guidance. And yes, it could move us the top end of the range or act as a buffer against other things that we need to forecast in the future. Mark Keim : That's right, Justin. So as Joe mentioned, guidance is smack in the middle of the range, 3.3% is in the middle of the range of 3% to 3.7%, so next year that's $2.75 is certainly upside. The flip side as we grow our business, we stack on M&A, we add new procurements. Those tend to come in a little lower in margin in the early years, and you've always got the impact of organic. So what we always say is it's certainly not guidance. It's just an accounting of some of the things that are depressing earnings this year. There'll be other things to add in next year, but it's certainly a good tailwind into 2023. Justin Lake : All right. Thanks for the color. Operator : The next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Nathan Rich : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. I was wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit more on what drove the higher COVID headwind estimate that's now incorporated in guidance. And it seems like it may you related to just a more conservative forecasting on non-COVID utilization trends. I was just wondering if you could kind of go into more detail on what you've seen in March, as COVID cases have died down and how we should think about kind of the 2Q and the go-forward there? Thank you. Joe Zubretsky : Sure, Nathan. The first thing I would say is when I say it subsided during the quarter, it did so dramatically. Our COVID direct cost of care in January were the highest since the beginning of the pandemic. In February those costs were cut to one-third of the January actual and in March cut yet another one-third in March off of February, a dramatic decline. But the BAQ was out there and while the infection rate is high, the severity and the treatment protocols are actually quite light. However, we never know whether it's going to resurge and we wanted to be as you suggested cautious with our outlook for COVID, particularly because in the recent past utilization curtailment has nearly offset the entire direct cost of cover related care. We never have full assurance that that will continue. Our second point, on what we call core medical cost trend, just the routine of cranking up our medical economics engine and truly understanding all the different dimensions of medical costs. We saw nothing in the quarter that surprised us or was unusual. All the things that you've read about and are being reported on where orthopedic procedures coming back with joint replacements, the ambulatory and outpatient settings are back in business, and we're seeing an uptick, but nothing unusual. We see spikes in pharmacy costs here and there; as some of our state single preferred drug lists sometimes promote the use of branded drugs. So nothing unusual and nothing surprising. It's the normal many inflection points here and there, but we wanted to remain cautious. We are hopefully on the tail end of the pandemic and we usually are cautious in our medical cost forecasting and want to see Q2 results before we put a better fine tune estimate on it. Nathan Rich : Thanks very much. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Hall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Michael Hall : Hey, thank you guys. Just want to dive a little deeper on redeterminations. So with the resumption of redetermination being pushed out further and further into the year just in terms of timing in cadence of recapturing those lives into your exchange book, as those lives drop off, would you anticipate more of a, I guess like an immediate turnaround on recapturing them or is it more reasonable to assume the [indiscernible] might take couple or a few months to sign up? And on the net impact on those labs, on one hand I know you price for sizeable margin improvement on those new lives, so they should becoming more profitable, but as these lives come onto your book later in the year, it becomes more difficult to properly risk score them. So just want to get your thoughts on that? Joe Zubretsky : Well Michael, we always characterize the redetermination phenomenon as when it's going to happen is really just a mathematical exercise of when the membership trips and revenue follows, which fiscal years is it going to hit. And right now it's \u2013 we're going to enjoy that membership and revenue for a longer period of time in 2022, and more of it will fall off in 2023. I think we think the real key point is how much of it persists beyond the redetermination period. And our forecast is that we grew 750,000 even slightly higher than that of organic growth in Medicaid since the beginning of the pandemic, we forecast to retain half of it. We believe the revenue growth associated with that was $2.9 billion, and we'll continue to have $1.6 billion of that when the re-determined processes complete. We also respect because CMS is now given clear guidance and is concerned with people being orphaned without healthcare, that they've made it a lot easier for us to work with our state customers to warm transfer members off of Medicaid if they're no longer eligible into marketplace and or Medicare, and these are products we continually enjoy. So that's sort of the strategy we have operational protocols in place to handle all this. We are concerned with the individual state's ability to handle a tremendous amount of value, 80 million people going through redetermination and re-eligibility inside of one-year is a huge undertaking. But we are really confident in the forecast that we've given on how much membership we will retain and potentially warm transfer into marketplace. Mark anything on the year-over-year comparison? Mark Keim : Joe, I think you hit the key points there. The only thing Michael that you also asked about is just the timing of them coming over from redetermination to marketplace, that'll vary. In certain places we have really good operations to proactively reach out to people, help them with their redetermination and to the extent they lose Medicaid eligibility, immediately get them signed up in marketplace. In other cases, members may fall off and after a month or two come back on. So I think state-by-state as the rules slightly vary exactly how those transitions work will vary as well, but I think you've hit the big points. Operator : The next question comes from A. J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. A. J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Just maybe to continue on discussion about the marketplace is obviously the enhanced subsidies under the ACA are potential to go away at the end of the year if Congress doesn't act. Do you have a sense of how much of your marketplace membership today might be impacted by that? How is that if the possibility that might go away, how is that impacting your thinking about exchanges, recapture, re-verification, and so forth next year? Is there any contingency either in your bid approach or otherwise that you can put in place, and you're thinking about? Joe Zubretsky : AJ it's Joe. Just at a very, very high level we believe that the impact to Molina's marketplace business will more or less reflect what happens nationally. So, if there's 14 plus million members in marketplace today across the industry, estimates have the enhanced subsidies causing an attrition of slightly more than, but just about three million members back down to 11. I also would remind you that there is this family glitch fix that will move the other way. Estimates say that there's five million families in the United States that might at least be eligible. Our view is probably only 20% of that will actually come back into the product. So, fourteen minus three, plus one, maybe it's a $12 million membership portfolio nationally. And we believe our \u2013 we have no reason to believe that our membership will react any differently than that. Look, it's an important product in the portfolio because we consider it to be an adjunct of Medicaid, not only operationally, but strategically. And I think when these members redetermined this year, it's going to be the proof point that if we can warm transfer them into a marketplace product and enjoy their membership for another year or two, then it's position in the portfolio is validated. We like it at 7% of revenue at $2 billion. Maybe that flex is up and down here with these two, industry phenomenon you described. But our goal is to maintain this business at mid-single digit margins. And we will let the revenue flex up and down with the goal of hitting mid-single digit pretax margins. A. J. Rice: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel : Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Wanted to stick on the market a place and get your guys\u2019 perspectives just on the sort of broader under [indiscernible]. Joe Krocheski : I'm sorry. We have experienced a technical difficulty here. If you were in a question queue, could you please re-queue? I will unmute Scott Fidel\u2019s line in just a moment, Scott Fidel you are unmuted now. Scott Fidel : Okay. Thanks. We'll I guess we'll try it again. Hey, good morning. Just wanted to ask about your thoughts on the underwriting cycle in the exchange market that we've seen in the last couple years had considerably more capacity coming into the market, some of that pretty irrational in terms of some of the pricing strategies. And just trying to think about sort of where we're sitting in that dynamic heading into 2023, we've seen one of the most aggressive players in the market already talk about pulling back from a number of their state footprints and clearly losses for several of these [indiscernible] have gotten pretty extreme right over the last year or two. So just interested in how you guys are thinking about the competitive dynamic for the exchange market for 2023. And maybe how that presents itself around some of your strategy around pricing and growth for next year? Joe Zubretsky : Sure Scott, and then I'll kick it to Mark for color. But as [indiscernible] repeating the strategy is this is an adjunct to Medicaid. It leverages the Medicaid network. And it's a residual market for people that are no longer eligible for Medicaid, but still need subsidies to afford healthcare. We follow our Medicaid foot. So, the strategy is very, very well understood here at the company. And the financial profile again, bears repeating. We will allow revenue to flex up and down, whether it's trend related, whether it's new CMS rules related or whether it's competitive forces, we will let revenue flex up and down with the goal of maintaining this business at mid-single-digit margins, given that the financial complexity of it is, it's more complex than the other products we have in the portfolio. Mark Keim : Scott, your question is well placed though with many players not having a great experience with SEP, how will they price going is a really good question. As Joe mentioned, we will clearly prioritize our target margins over volume. As Joe said, revenue will flex up, flex down accordingly. But what I like about our strategy is we're in 14 states and I can't predict who is going to price how in any one of those states. We'll put our best pricing out at our target margins. And with the diversification of 14 states, I can't predict any one of them, but across those states we'll be well positioned in some maybe less competitive in others. But we should have a pretty good portfolio outcome at the target margins we're shooting for. Scott Fidel : Okay. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Stephen Baxter : Yes, hi. Thanks for the question. So, it's been a while since the 50% Medicaid retention figure was introduced, I was hoping you could give us a reminder of what your analysis just looks at to arrive at that figure? And then maybe some context about what metrics you're monitoring. Essentially the question is why or why not has this metric changed as a result of the really strong employment market that we're seeing in subsequent quarters and some significant improving the employment levels there? Thank you. Joe Zubretsky : Sure. Stephen I'll make some preliminary [ph] comments and then kick it to Mark. One of the things we like to remind people when they look at our 50% retention assumption, our membership organically grew approximately 25% since the beginning of the pandemic. If we say we're going to keep half of it that implies a growth rate net of attrition of about 12%. I think what a lot of us forget is that during the period of time if the pandemic never happened, the Medicaid roles will have grown or would have grown anyway, just due the natural growth in the population of the U.S., particularly at the end of the economy, the low wage service end of the economy. So, in our view, the amount of membership we're going to retain from the organic growth during the pandemic is not that much more greater than the natural growth that the industry would have experienced since beginning of the pandemic. Now I'll kick it to Mark about how we went state by state, and really try to drill down and understand the microeconomic effects in each state in order to arrive at our estimate. Mark Keim : Great. As Joe mentioned since the start of the pandemic, we've organically grown about 25%. If we're going to keep to that, that's about 12%. And if you look at the four or five years that that whole cycle takes, that's growth rate of 2%, 3% a year which is probably organically what Medicaid might have grown at anyway. So, arguably you are right back to where you were if there hadn't been a pandemic. Now, when we look bottoms up and we look at any given state where those members came from, that are in our increased roles, a good component of it is what's sometimes referred to as the woodwork effect, the people that were previously uncovered, but because of the pandemic realized it's a great time to come into the Medicaid pool and get covered, they're certainly going to stay with us. Every time we see a crisis like this the roles of Medicaid move up and never quite go back to where they were. So, at a bare minimum, that woodwork effect will account for some of the increase. And again, over the four to five years, arguably you might be where you were without a pandemic coming out of it, just on normal growth rates. Joe Zubretsky : And Steven, I also point to even though the unemployment rate national averages really don't mean a whole lot you have to actually look state by state and look at the low wage service economy. That's been ravaged by the economic distress that we're experiencing here in the U.S. That combined with the reservation wage, the wage at which people want to go back to work has increased dramatically. And of course, the great resignation with people just hesitant to go back to work due to other factors. So, the environment in this population certainly suggests that post-pandemic the Medicaid roles will be higher than they were pre-pandemic. Operator : The next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : Yes, good morning. And thanks for taking the question. I guess so this is kind of a broad-based question, but can you talk about how your rate discussions are going with states as you guys contemplate and think about inflation? And maybe just talk a little bit about how Molina kind of sees self-exposed to inflation is clearly a wage pressure internally. Like to what degree does providers wanting exact price kind of take a toll in your book if at all given the Medicaid population? And just like, I ask this question, selfishly, internally, we talked a time about inflation here. We just love to think about how you guys are thinking about inflation impacting kind of your business. And I'd probably ask you to focus on kind of like the ways that might not be obvious, like basically aside from wage pressure. Joe Zubretsky : Sure. Yes, I'll answer the second part first, because it bears repeating. Clearly, it's been harder to keep our capacity filled and this is industry wide hiring has been very, very difficult. And people are feeling the inflation pressures. And we noted some additional contract labor costs and some additional overtime costs in the first quarter. And people are feeling the stress of the pandemic. We feel that we've been very fair with our population and given them adequate merit increases to key pace with inflation. But we continue to monitor it. Right now, we see no unusual trend or outlook for our labor costs internally. Our biggest challenge is keeping the seats filled and making sure that we never disappoint a customer because we lack the capacity to service the volume. On the medical cost side, we're not seeing it. Now bear in mind the basis, the chassis for our reimbursement is the Medicaid fee schedule. And we're not seeing any dramatic shifts in the Medicaid fee schedules coming out from states. Now, you\u2019ll also negotiate individually a percentage of that Medicaid fee schedule with the individual providers, whether they are physician groups or hospitals. And we're seeing no additional pressure there either. I will tell you that we are comfortable that if we do start to see the inflationary pressures, the real question is, does the rating process keep pace with that? And we believe the answer is yes. States are very much in tune with the trends in medical cost and as are their actuaries. And if we start to see inflationary pressures, the real question is will rates respond? And we believe the answer is yes, they will. George Hill : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : And our final question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Josh Raskin : Thanks for taking the question. I guess my question will be on Medicare Advantage then this morning, the membership growth remains very strong. I was wondering if you could just speak to where those adds are coming about geographically and from where are they all coming from fee-for-service or competitors. And then just on the yields, it looks like the yields were relatively flat. So, I'm trying to figure out if that's product or geography mix or something else. And I just would have expected a little bit of inflation with risk adjusters. So curious if those were not as additive as expected. Joe Zubretsky : Well, Josh, our Medicare business is growing nicely. And of course, the margins don't get any better than this. It's a low income, high acuity strategy, MMP anti-SNP and in our MAPD launch, we clearly end the aim, the MAPD product at low-income individual. So, it's a low-income, high-acuity strategy. We grew 6,000 in a quarter up to 148. Some of came in through the Cigna acquisition and the MAPD launch was very, very successful. We have three distribution channels. We have an external broker channel, independent broker channel, captive agent channel and a tele-sales channel. And they are all really working hard to and have increased their productivity here over the last year under new leadership that we have in our distribution channel strategy. So, it's growing very nicely. I mean, the yields are in line with our expectation. Look at the margins in the business at an 85.6% or 86.5% MCR for the quarter and an outlook to be at the bottom end of our long-term target range. And the rate increase that we're getting for next year. We believe our product is competitive, it has all the ancillary services that we allow it to be competitive. Our star ratings are good enough that we can maintain these margins. And we're very, very bullish on the growth prospects of this business over time. We plan to grow it to 158,000 to the end of the year, which would be 10,000 growth just inside of the year. Operator : We have no further questions. So, this concludes our question-and-answer session, which also concludes today's conference call. Thank you very much for attending and you may not disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Krocheski, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Joe Krocheski : Good morning and welcome to Molina Healthcare\u2019s second quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining me today are Molina\u2019s President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our second quarter earnings was distributed after the market closed yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that the remarks made are as of today, Thursday, July 28, 2022 and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. In this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our second quarter 2022 press release. During our call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our 2022 guidance, our 2023 outlook, our growth strategy and expected growth, our RFP submissions, the COVID-19 pandemic, our acquisitions, our future margins and embedded earnings power and our long-term outlook. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that can cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report filed with the SEC as well as the risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe? Joe Zubretsky : Thank you, Joe and good morning. Today, we will provide updates on several topics : our financial results for the second quarter 2022, our full year 2022 guidance in the context of our second quarter results, our growth initiatives and the reaffirmation of our strategy for sustaining profitable growth, and an early outlook on 2023 premium revenue and earnings growth. Let me start with the second quarter highlights. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.55 for the second quarter, with adjusted net income of $266 million on $7.8 billion of premium revenue. Second quarter adjusted earnings were decreased by $0.44 per share for a true-up to our 2021 final Marketplace risk adjustment transfer payments. Excluding this out-of-period item, our adjusted earnings per share was $4.99. Our 88.1% total company MCR in the second quarter demonstrates strong operating performance even as we navigate prolonged pandemic-related challenges. As Mark will describe later, the reported MCR included increases related to the 2021 Marketplace risk adjustment true-up and the accounting impact of a revenue pass-through. As such, our underlying pure-period MCR was 87.2%. Similarly our reported pre-tax margin of 4.4% increases to 5%, which is at the top end of our long-term target range. For the quarter, we produced 18% premium revenue growth and 34% earnings per share growth. Our year-to-date performance highlighted by an 87.6% MCR, a 6.9% adjusted G&A ratio and a 4.7% pre-tax margin is squarely in line with our long-term targets. Adjusting for the Marketplace risk adjustment true-up and the accounting impact of the revenue pass-through, our underlying pure-period year-to-date MCR was 87.2%. Year-to-date, we produced 19% premium revenue growth and 21% adjusted earnings per share growth. Medicaid, our flagship business, representing 80% of enterprise revenue, continues to produce a very strong and predictable operating results and cash flows. The rate environment is stable, COVID costs have tempered and we are executing on the sound fundamentals of medical cost management. The ongoing and consistent high earnings quality in the first 6 months produced at reported MCR of 88.1%. Our diversified geographic footprint and mix of products, including management of high acuity members, provides us with an excellent earnings ballast. Our high acuity Medicare niche serving low-income members, representing 13% of enterprise revenue, continues to grow organically and outperform our long-term target margins. The year-to-date reported MCR of 86.7%, even while still pressured by the cost of COVID-related care, is below the low end of our long-term target range. Each of our products, D-SNP, MAPD, WEDI/SNIP and MMP, contributed to this favorable result. Marketplace at 7% of enterprise revenue is tracking to return to profitability in 2022 on a pure-period basis. We have succeeded in keeping the business small, keeping it silver and keeping it stable. The true-up to 2021 risk adjustment is largely due to the surge of special enrollment period membership that we experienced in the last half of 2021. On a pure-period basis, 2022 is on track to achieve a low single-digit pre-tax margin. In summary, we are very pleased with our second quarter and year-to-date performance. We executed well, delivered solid operating earnings and continued to deliver on our growth strategy. Turning now to our 2022 guidance, we now project premium revenue to be approximately $30 billion or $750 million above our previous guidance. Our updated 2022 guidance represents a 3-year 23% compound annual growth rate since our pivot to growth in 2019. Excluding the estimated impact of the redetermination pause, our 3-year compound annual growth rate is 18%. We are also increasing our full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share guidance to at least $17.60. Our increased 2022 outlook features strong premium revenue growth of 12%, which includes the impact of our conscious decision to reset the size and scope of our Marketplace business, a pre-tax margin at the midpoint of our long-term guidance range, and strong earnings per share growth of 30%. We have purposely remained conservative in our full year 2022 earnings guidance. Our year-to-date underlying performance is highlighted by effective management of medical costs, both COVID and non-COVID, that were favorable to our expectations. In this environment, which is still being affected by the emergence of new COVID variants, it is prudent to remain cautious in forecasting medical cost trends. In the first half of the year, for Medicaid and Medicare, which account for 93% of enterprise revenues, we produced MCRs at or below the low-end of our target ranges. We believe it is prudent to project MCRs to be within the target range for the second half of the year. Bear in mind that our target MCR ranges result in industry leading margins. With that being said, if we were to repeat our first half performance with respect to medical cost management in the second half, then it is highly likely we would outperform this full year earnings guidance. Turning now to an update on our long-term strategy for sustaining profitable growth. We remain confident that we will deliver on our long-term growth targets of 13% to 15% premium revenue growth and 15% to 18% adjusted earnings per share growth on average over time and sustained 4% to 5% pre-tax margins. Our recent performance is supportive of that outlook. Our model for organic growth remains sound. In Medicaid, our market share is high enough to be relevant to our state-based partners and gives us sufficient scale, but low enough to provide an environment for market share gains. Although it has been difficult to measure during the pandemic, we have grown market share in many of our states. The political landscape remains focused on reducing the uninsured population favoring government-sponsored programs and driving underlying growth in our current footprint. The economy has had a significant impact on the low-wage service sector as well. We continue to believe the post-pandemic Medicaid roles will be higher than pre-pandemic levels. On the RFP front, our past track record gives us confidence in successfully retaining the Medicaid contracts that are currently in a reprocurement process. Our RFP responses have been submitted in Mississippi, California and for Texas Star+ in our pending evaluation and subsequent award announcement. We are well positioned to retain these contracts due to our track record of operational and clinical excellence, standing and reputation, innovation and the demonstrated ability to write winning proposals. With multiple new RFP opportunities over the coming years, we remain confident in our ability to win additional new state contracts. We submitted our proposals in the states of Iowa and Nebraska and have many other new state business development initiatives well underway. In Medicare, the rate environment and demographic trends remain supportive of sustainable growth. Additionally, we have opportunities to further penetrate our Medicaid footprint in both D-SNP and low-income MAPD products. Our three distribution channels have achieved a high degree of productivity and have lowered our cost of acquisition. Consequently, we are investing heavily in these channels. In Marketplace, our focus is on keeping it small in the context of the overall portfolio and pricing with a goal of achieving mid single-digit pre-tax margins. As a result, we will grow this business only as allowed by this pricing strategy. Moving now to our inorganic growth strategy, our M&A platform continues to execute at a high level. Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of My Choice Wisconsin\u2019s MLTSS and core Medicaid assets for an attractive purchase price of approximately 15% of revenue. This acquisition is highly complementary to our expanding Wisconsin Medicaid footprint and our growing MLTSS business. My Choice Wisconsin serves over 44,000 members and generates premium revenue of approximately $1 billion. We expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive to adjusted earnings and deliver first year adjusted EPS of $0.15 and $0.45 at full run-rate. In addition to being perfectly consistent with our product and geographic growth strategy, the acquisition of My Choice Wisconsin validates the vibrancy and actionability of our expansive M&A opportunity pipeline. With the addition of My Choice Wisconsin, our enterprise MLTSS business will be attached to over $9 billion in premium revenue and over $6 billion of LTSS benefits paid. Over the past 10 months, between AgeWell and My Choice Wisconsin, we have announced nearly $2 billion in acquired revenue, which will be included in our 2023 premium revenue based on the expected timing of closing both transactions. We have now announced 7 acquisitions since we embarked on our growth strategy. The 5 already closed are achieving or exceeding their earnings accretion target. Given our track record and a pipeline replete with actionable and strategically focused acquisition opportunities, we are confident in our ability to continue to execute on this important dimension of our growth strategy. In summary, the company\u2019s financial and operational performance validates our long-term revenue growth strategy and its value creation potential. Turning now to our initial outlook for 2023, while it is far too early to provide specific 2023 financial guidance, I will offer a view of some of the building blocks of our initial outlook for 2023. First, with respect to 2023 revenue, we continue to build the 2023 book of business throughout this year. At this early stage, we have line of sight to nearly 10% growth in 2023 from our strategic initiatives and an early estimate of organic growth. This growth will be partially offset by the impact of redeterminations, which we have spoken about at length and one or two potential pharmacy carve-outs, the timing and extent of which are uncertain. We are only halfway through 2022, and therefore, additional M&A announcements and new Medicaid procurement wins would add to the 2023 revenue picture. Now turning to 2023 earnings. First, in 2022, we are carrying approximately $3 per share of embedded earnings power, which we expect to be realized in 2023 and beyond. This estimate, which has been updated since last quarter, comprises net effect of COVID and full accretion on M&A earnings, offset by redetermination impacts. Second, we expect the core book of business will grow organically. As we have demonstrated in the past, when we grow organically, we achieve our target margins. Third, in the quarter, we have finalized or significantly progressed on some major initiatives, which provide earnings upside, two of which are noteworthy. We recently renegotiated and executed a new PBM contract with CVS Caremark, which extends the existing contract term at substantially more favorable pricing. Since pharmacy accounts for 15% to 20% of our medical cost baseline, the improved rate structure will substantially improve our pharmacy economics and resulting medical cost trend. The CVS Caremark relationship has been essential to our delivery of excellent pharmacy service to our customers and members and has enabled strong cost control. We are very pleased to have extended this relationship. And secondly, we intend to move permanently to a remote work environment, a model we have been working under successfully for nearly 2 years. As a result, by the end of this year, we expect to formalize a reduction of our real estate footprint by approximately two-thirds, yielding substantial and sustainable G&A savings. These building blocks aggregate to a very attractive earnings trajectory for 2023 and beyond, although the timing of emergence for each of these is still evolving. That being said, with 2022 adjusted earnings guidance of at least $17.60 per share, embedded earnings power of $3 per share, the earnings contribution of organic growth and the operational catalysts we just mentioned, we fully expect our 2023 adjusted earnings to be at least $20 per share. Although it is too early in the cycle to provide specific earnings guidance for 2023, we are very confident in this earnings outlook. We will certainly update this outlook as it evolves, informed by our performance in the second half of 2022 and the ongoing execution of our strategic initiatives. In conclusion, in the second quarter, we performed very well across the enterprise. Our 2022 earnings base [Technical Difficulty], our growth strategy is working and our early outlook for 2023 is strong. We are executing on our long-term strategic plan and delivering results accordingly. Of course, we could not do this without our excellent management team and dedicated associates, now approaching 15,000 strong. We have produced these results under the difficult and rapidly changing circumstances of the pandemic. To the entire team, I once again extend my deepest thanks and heartfelt appreciation. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials. Mark? Mark Keim : Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss some additional details of our second quarter performance, our strong balance sheet, our updated guidance for 2022 and some initial views on the building blocks of our 2023 outlook. Beginning with our second quarter results. In Medicaid, our reported MCR was 88%. Normalizing for approximately $350 million of pass-through payments in our Texas plan, our reported MCR improves to 87.4%. This strong performance, better than the low end of our long-term target range, was driven by strong medical cost management and lower utilization. The net effect of COVID in the quarter was a modest 20 basis point increase to our reported MCR. In Medicare, our reported MCR was 86.9%, also better than the low end of our long-term target range. During the quarter, the net effect of COVID increased our reported MCR by 370 basis points as BA-5 and other variants resulted in increase in patient expense. This pressure was more than offset by favorable risk adjustment and strong medical cost management. In Marketplace, our reported second quarter MCR of 91.2% was inflated by a final true-up of 2021 risk adjustment transfer payments. Normalizing for this out-of-period item, our second quarter MCR was 85.7%. Recall, our Marketplace business was more than twice the size last year, so the prior year settlement had a disproportionate impact on the current year. Second quarter pure-period results were impacted by higher utilization due to the carryover effects of 2021 special enrollment period membership and approximately 50 basis points of net effect of COVID. We remain on track to return our Marketplace business to profitability on a pure-period basis in 2022. In aggregate, the net effect of COVID was consistent with our expectations and decreased net income by $0.68 per share in the quarter. The full year outlook for the net effect of COVID remains at $2.50 per share. Putting it all together, with the two adjustments I described, our reported second quarter MCR for the consolidated company of 88.1% improved to 87.2%. Similarly, our reported pretax margin of 4.4% increases to 5%. And the reported G&A ratio of 6.8% restates to 7%. We continue to expect our full year 2022 G&A ratio to be consistent with our long-term target, reflecting fixed cost leverage on our growth and ongoing discipline. Our results as reported and normalized, displayed the strong performance of our second quarter and the continuing earnings power of the business. Turning now to our balance sheet, our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and we remain confident in this reserve position. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter, normalized for pass-through payments, which inflate DCP, was 50.4% consistent with prior quarters. Our capital foundation remained strong. Debt at the end of the quarter was 1.9x trailing 12-month EBITDA, and our debt-to-cap ratio was 45.9%. On a net debt basis, net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.7x and 43.7%, respectively. Our leverage remains low. All bond maturities are long-dated, on average 8 years, and our weighted average cost of debt is just 4%. We harvested $165 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter, and we purchased approximately 660,000 of our shares for approximately $200 million. Parent company cash at the end of the quarter was $210 million. With substantial incremental debt capacity, cash on hand and strong free cash flow we have ample cash and capital to drive our organic and inorganic growth strategies. Now a few comments on our 2022 guidance. We have increased our full year premium revenue guidance by $750 million to approximately $30 billion, driven by two components : approximately $250 million, reflecting the latest extension of the public health emergency and the related delay in resuming a redetermination of Medicaid eligibility and approximately $500 million for the second quarter outperformance and some additional Texas pass-through revenue. We also raised our full year 2022 adjusted earnings guidance by $0.50 per share to at least $17.60. The increase is driven by three items : second quarter performance above our expectations by about $0.25 per share, margin on the additional revenue from the extension of the public health emergency, which we estimate at about $0.15 per share; an additional net income of $0.10 per share in the second half, driven by the recent rise in interest rates. Normalizing for the out-of-period risk adjustment item of $0.44 per share, our second quarter outperformance increases to about $0.70 per share. We have offset any extrapolation of this second quarter outperformance for the rest of the year with some tempered conservatism. Our first half MCRs outperformed the lower end of our long-term target ranges in both Medicaid and Medicare. In the second half, we are projecting those same ratios to be more in line with our long-term target ranges. As Joe mentioned, our updated guidance will prove conservative if the strong medical cost management and lower utilization we saw in the first half continues through the rest of the year. We expect second half earnings to be distributed fairly evenly between the third and fourth quarters. Finally, some additional color on the building blocks of our initial outlook for 2023. Beginning with premium revenue, our initial outlook is for the announced pending acquisitions of AgeWell and My Choice Wisconsin and organic growth to drive approximately 10% growth of our current 2022 premium revenue guidance. We expect this growth to be partially offset by redeterminations and potential pharmacy carve-out. Our 2023 revenue outlook will continue to evolve as we make progress on our in-flight strategic initiatives, including acquisitions and procurement. Turning to adjusted earnings, first, our embedded earnings power is now approximately $3 per share, comprising $2.50 net effect of COVID, $1.50 from our closed and pending acquisitions went at target margin, offset by approximately $1 from the eventual impact of redeterminations. While it\u2019s too early to guide on the emergence of these components, we offer some perspectives on what might impact 2023. Within the $2.50 net effect of COVID, corridors in just three states are the primary driver. We expect to see upside here as states terminate these corridors as Ohio already has and the lingering cost of COVID and patient services dissipates to a new normal. Our acquisitions typically reach target margin in the second year of operations. We feel confident we will see a significant portion of the $1.50 emerge in 2023 as Affinity and Cigna Texas will be in their second year and AgeWell and My Choice Wisconsin will make their first-year contributions. We now assume redetermination will begin in October, and we expect to lose approximately half of the 750,000 members we gained since the start of the pandemic. These membership attrition assumptions yield a 2023 headwind of $1.2 billion in revenue and $0.70 per share on EPS. Several highly credible data points give us confidence that the margin on members lost through redetermination, have a similar profile to our overall membership. Second, the attractive growth of our legacy business and the associated margin, partially offset by potential pharmacy carve-outs will yield incremental earnings in 2023. Third, as Joe described, we see a combination of new operating drivers that should enhance our 2023 earnings growth, including our recently renegotiated PBM contract, which improves the economics on 15% to 20% of our total medical cost spend and our expected real estate reduction. We plan to reduce the roughly 2 million square feet of leased office space by approximately two-thirds by the end of the year. Finally, we expect higher interest rates to translate into correspondingly higher net investment income. These building blocks provide an early view of some of the most impactful components of our outlook for next year. Our evolving outlook on 2023 will be informed by our performance in the second half of 2022 as well as the ongoing execution of our strategic initiatives. We now feel confident in setting our initial outlook for 2023 adjusted EPS to at least $20. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Josh Raskin : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just a question on the risk payable or risk transfer payable update, was that more your membership came in healthier than expected? You had codes rejected or something or was it the market was overall sicker? And how does that inform your pricing and thoughts around the opportunities for growth next year in the exchanges? Joe Zubretsky : Sure, Josh. Really, it was a function of the surge of special enrollment membership we experienced last year. If you recall, we took on 250,000 members between March and the end of the year. And of course, we had to really gear up and scale up to service that membership, including risk adjustment. So I think part of it was keeping pace with the surge of membership and getting the risk scores. I think part of it was the acuity of the membership. And I think another part of it was just the imprecise nature of actuarial estimations given that unstable environment. The good news for this year is we became aware of this emerging trend early in the quarter as we were developing our final pricing in the Marketplace, and we\u2019re able to take the current view of the acuity of this population into consideration as we filed our final prices for 2023. Josh Raskin : Okay, thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Matthew, perhaps your line is muted. Matthew Borsch : Sorry. Can you hear me? Joe Zubretsky : Yes, we can. Matthew Borsch : Okay. I apologize, having a new phone here. So I was just going to ask about another item in the quarter, which is the prior year reserve development. Looked like you got a little over $100 million, I mean I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a net benefit, obviously, because you\u2019re replenishing reserves. But can you just comment on that because I think in the year ago period, it was pretty much zero? Mark Keim : Yes, sure. Matt, good morning. It\u2019s Mark. I think you\u2019re looking at the year-over-year change. We had a little more prior year development this second quarter than we did a year ago at this time. And that\u2019s not unusual. The way development happens is not always the same year-over-year. The way our providers submit claims and the way our internal operations, including payment integrity work is a little different year-over-year. So yes, the pattern is a little bit different. But what\u2019s more important is I\u2019m reporting our DCP at 50.4%, which versus a year ago at 48% is clearly up. The other thing that you guys look at a lot of times is just the growth in premium versus the growth in reserves. My reserves are up 28% year over my premiums are up 18%. So I feel really good about where I\u2019m reserved. I think we\u2019re in a good spot. Matthew Borsch : Okay. Fantastic, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Stephen Baxter : Hi, thanks for the question. It was interesting here you talked about the several highly credible data points suggesting the decremental margin on the lost Medicaid redetermination membership would be in line with the portfolio average. Obviously, this is an area of concern or uncertainty for the market. So would love if you could maybe help us understand what you\u2019re looking at to better understand this issue and reach that conclusion. Thank you. Joe Zubretsky : Sure, Stephen. I\u2019ll kick it to Mark for some of the actual numbers. But as a matter of routine in the Medicaid business, one needs to understand the duration of its membership. Duration could have an impact on the acuity of a population. So it\u2019s something we routinely look at. I will tell you that during the pandemic, the duration of membership, the length of time people are on the Medicaid rolls didn\u2019t extend all that much. And I will tell you that the differences in acuity as measured by medical care ratios is not that much different on short duration members versus long duration members. We have lots of other actuarial and medical economics data points that suggest that the members that will leave, will leave at portfolio averages. But I\u2019ll turn it to Mark for a little more color on that. Mark Keim : Sure. Just a couple of data points that we track really closely. Remember, within our Medicaid business, there is a TANF chip, there is expansion and there is ABD. So we look at these within each of those. One of the first things we look is the duration, what percentage of our members are with us for more than a year. In TANF chip, it really didn\u2019t change meaningfully. ABD didn\u2019t really change meaningfully. Expansion is up a little, not huge. Within those populations, though, we also then compare what\u2019s the MCR for the folks that are maybe 2 years and longer with us versus the MCR for those less than a year. That\u2019s the durational acuity concept that Joe mentioned. It\u2019s really flat between those two cohorts in TANF chip. It\u2019s pretty flat on ABD. It\u2019s a really stable population. So it\u2019s up a little in expansion. On the percentage of members with no claims, another one that\u2019s good to look at. TANF chip pretty flat, ABD, once again flat. We\u2019re seeing a little bit more in expansion. So could you argue that there is going to be a little bit of pressure within expansion? Possibly, but at third of the overall Medicaid book, any impact there gets diluted. So we really don\u2019t see this as a big headwind. Operator : The next question comes from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Maybe just continuing to look \u2013 triangulate around the reverification question, so when you\u2019re giving those numbers for next year, are you assuming the full impact of the reverification plays out next year? I know some of your peers have talked about states taking as much as 10 months to gear back up fully, and therefore, you would sort of have a partial impact next year and the full impact annualized in 2024. Can you \u2013 those numbers you threw out are that \u2013 is that the full impact, or is that a partial year and you expect more spillover into \u201824? Joe Zubretsky : Two concepts, A.J., it\u2019s Joe. First, we always forecast and plan according to the status quo and since the PHE, right at this point will end in October, that\u2019s our planning assumption. We all expect it to be extended to the end of the year, but that\u2019s a separate issue. As we build up our models on a state-by-state basis based on conversations with the state and how they plan to execute the redetermination process, so the buildup of what we do is very much bottoms up. We do, in our forecast. Most of the impact is 2023, some of it spills over into 2024. The key numbers are $3.2 billion of Medicaid revenue gained as the 750,000 membership growth occurred. It will ultimately settle at $1.6 billion and that will roll out mostly in 2023 at $1.2 billion or $400 million spilling over into 2024. Mark, any color to add? Mark Keim : Yes. A.J., I would just always remind people to do the member month math because it gets complicated, right. If the PHE ends in October, the stipulation is that states have a year from the end of PHE to be done. So, they have got to be done next October. But if you look at the member months, it\u2019s as Joe mentioned, I have got $1.2 billion of headwind in for \u201823 and another $400 million in for 2024. A.J. Rice: Okay, great. Thanks so much. Operator : The next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Nathan Rich : Hi. Good morning. If I could ask a two-part question on the 2023 guidance that you gave. For the 10% growth in premium revenue, and obviously, that excludes redeterminations, if you back out the impact of acquisitions, it looks like low-single digit revenue growth. Could you maybe just talk about how that breaks down by line of business? And then you mentioned having industry-leading margins in \u2013 I think doing the quick math on the premium revenue outlook and earnings it looked like you were kind of continuing to be at the top end of that range. So, could you maybe just talk about margin potential from here as we think about the next several years? Joe Zubretsky : First on the growth assumptions, we have included a modest, but early view of our organic growth trajectory for next year. If you look back at our Investor Day models, in Medicaid, we say that just by being in Medicaid with premium yield and additions to the Medicaid roles, we are expecting 4% growth. In Medicare, that same phenomenon, yield and growth in the Medicare population, both on agents and penetrations of managed care, will add about 7%. So, when we talk about organic growth, we are talking about merely yield and the growth in the market. And if you weight that at 80% and 13% of revenue, you are talking about perhaps 5% growth just by being in those markets. Then of course, we have our strategic initiatives, which are only halfway done. We are only halfway through 2022. So, we have far more to do on building the book of business for next year. So, we are really happy that at this early stage between our strategic initiatives and an early view of organic growth, we are already accounting for 10% over the 2022 baseline. Your second question again? Nathan Rich : Yes, sorry, just on the margin opportunity, given that the business is kind of operating today at the high end of the long-term target. Joe Zubretsky : Well, one of the reasons why we settled in at $17.60 for our guidance is \u2013 let\u2019s frame where we are. We just printed [indiscernible], revenues growing at 18%, earnings per share growing at 34% on both a six-month and a three-month basis, our pretax margins are 5% and after-tax margins are at 3.7%, and we did that by outperforming the ranges of our MCRs, which produce best-in-class industry margins. So, to continue to forecast that level of outperformance going forward, we thought was a bit imprudent and perhaps too aggressive. So, we were purposely conservative to merely forecast the rest of the year as operating within our long-term target MCR ranges. We are going to end the year at 4.5% pretax margin, 3.3% after-tax and MCRs squarely in those long-term targets, which again produce best-in-class industry margins. We are always looking for ways to improve the performance of the business. We mentioned two very significant operational catalysts going forward, the renegotiation of our pharmacy contract and the fact that we are moving to a permanent remote work strategy. So, we are constantly working the system to try to find ways to attain fixed cost leverage, drive down our G&A ratios and perform at the top end of our long-term ranges for the MCR. Nathan Rich : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. I guess one quick clarification and then from the actual question. When you said 10% revenue growth for next year, then you said partially offset by redeterminations. Was that 10% number including those, or are you saying it was 10%, kind of giving us a sense of how you normally grow, but then net, it will be a little bit less than 10% because of those other items? Mark Keim : Hey. Good morning. It\u2019s Mark. The 10% is the announced, but not closed acquisitions of AgeWell and My Choice Wisconsin as well as that organic growth concept that Joe described, the 4% in Medicaid, more like the 7% in Medicare. The other items then are adjustments, but they are a little vague at the moment. We are still working through those. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. So, it\u2019s 10 minus something. That\u2019s how to think about it right now. Okay. And then, I guess as you think about the COVID impact. I guess I am struggling a little bit with how you talk about the cohort impact because it seems like it\u2019s a little bit different than how some of your peers are talking about the COVID impact because, like with Q2, you seem to be saying that COVID was a headwind, but that you were able to offset it with medical management. Where most of the companies seem to kind of be saying, for whatever reason, volume didn\u2019t come back the way that it normally does in Q2 and they are being cautious in the back half of the year. You are still being cautious in the back half of the year. But just tying to understand exactly what you think happened in the quarter. Was it an industry-wide phenomenon, or do you kind of view like your controlling trend below and it\u2019s kind of more outperformance or trying to be more sustainable versus maybe a blip in how people use utilization during COVID troughs and peaks and therefore, maybe a little bit less clear about what happens in the back half? Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : Sure, Kevin. We are pretty disciplined in how we measure the COVID impacts, both the direct cost of COVID-related care and the offsetting curtailment. It\u2019s been uncanny that as COVID infection rates spike, and therefore, the direct cost of COVID care increase, the offset of utilization curtailment has pretty much offset the direct cost of COVID-related care. Now, you are never sure whether that\u2019s going to continue to be that highly correlated. But as I look back over every quarter that \u2013 during the pandemic, that has basically been the case. So, for the most part, our COVID cost is about two-thirds the corridors, the three remaining corridors, and one-third the net effect of COVID direct offset by curtailment. Mark Keim : Yes. Just to build on that, our definition of the net effect of COVID has been consistent across the 2.5 years here of the pandemic. As Joe mentioned, it\u2019s about two-thirds corridors and then the rest is COVID inpatient direct, which we can measure and then the offsetting curtailment of certain services where we are just not seeing that. We are seeing that relationship be very consistent. We laid out the different impacts line of business by line of business. You saw our Medicaid and marketplace businesses had a relatively light impact. Medicare was a little higher at 370 bps. That\u2019s been typically tracking more around 200 bps. So, that one is just a little bit higher. Line of business to line of business, it bounces around. But across the portfolio, it\u2019s pretty much tracking where we would expect. We are still at that $2.50 for the full year. Joe Zubretsky : I was going to say the final proof point is our effective medical cost management actually contain utilization in areas that were unaffected by the COVID infection rate, which would suggest that our utilization routines, our payment integrity routines, all the things we do to effectively medically manage a population are working in areas that were unaffected by COVID. So, we are operating well and managing medical costs very, very well in areas unaffected by COVID. Kevin Fischbeck : I guess the thing I don\u2019t understand about the corridor comment because if you are at or above your target margin in Medicaid, but you are saying that when corridors go away, then that we should think about you permanently being able to operate above the Medicaid business? Because it seems like you are already at your peak margin in Medicaid. So, if corridors go away, then you would be \u2013 and that\u2019s the base to be thinking about going forward, that you are going to be permanently above that. So, I just \u2013 I am just talking a little bit with kind of how to think about corridors being the net COVID. Joe Zubretsky : We understand the math behind that. The simple math is if you take our embedded earnings and just convert it to actual earnings, it would suggest that the margins pop slightly north on a pretax basis of the top end of our range. But two things, one, embedded earnings is in guidance, and two, it doesn\u2019t all emerge at one time or within 1 year. Now, with respect to the corridors, there is only three that matter that remain, and one of them has already been eliminated for October. The two that remain are Mississippi and Washington. And if they persist beyond the pandemic, then they are part of the earnings baseline, and we will live with them for a longer period of time. But there is \u2013we are pretty optimistic that they will fall away over time. Mark Keim : And Kevin, just to put a point on that, that means that 15 of our 18 Medicaid states are not constrained by corridors. And that\u2019s part of where our margin story is. Kevin Fischbeck : Alright. Great. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Hall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Michael Hall : Hey. Thanks guys. So, just real quick first on the risk corridor. So, 15 out of 18 that aren\u2019t constrained. But \u2013 so you don\u2019t have any long-standing risk corridors that are pre-COVID in any of those other 15 states? Mark Keim : We do. That last conversation was specifically around the net effect of COVID and COVID-related corridors. Pre-pandemic, a number of states had different mechanisms that did constrain some profitability, but that\u2019s more our legacy profile. So, we are talking here specifically about COVID era corridors. Michael Hall : Got it. But presumably, you are in a net payable position in the other 15 states in some of them, right? Mark Keim : To a small degree, yes, and that changes year-to-year. Michael Hall : Okay. Got it. Thanks. And then my real question. So, it looks like you guys are now expecting low-single digit margins this year for exchange. But heading into the quarter, and I guess even this year, the shift of silver focused pricing efforts, there are seemingly a lot of confidence in improving to mid-single digits. But MLR this quarter, even without the risk adjustment payable, is still much higher than the Street at 85%. And now year-to-date, you guys are tracking the mid-80s, just curious what happened there? You mentioned higher core utilization. What are the dynamics you are seeing and or there is just some mispricing related to that. Joe Zubretsky : Well, I mean in summary, we are 200 basis points to 300 basis points off on 7% of our revenue, so putting it in perspective, which we are not happy about. We want to operate in the low-80s. The business breaks even at 85 and we are projecting to do 84 or better for the year, which would be modest profitability. First and foremost, we repositioned the book of business. That was the tall order for 2022, keep it small 7% of revenue. Keep it silver, 75% of our membership is now silver membership. Keep it stable, two-thirds of our membership is now renewal membership when that was completely as the opposite in prior years. So, we have the book of business positioned very, very well. Now, we will work on the 200 basis points to 300 basis points of pressure that is pressuring our MCR. And with the pricing we put in for 2023, on average, 13% to 14% in some states higher, we feel good about getting to those mid-single digit target margins. Michael Hall : Got it. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : Yes. Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I was just going to ask you about the new contract with CVS. I don\u2019t know if there is any chance that you can kind of quantify savings opportunity looks like or if there is any meaningful change in the scope or the services that are being provided or\u2026? Joe Zubretsky : No change in the scope of services. We have a very good balance between what we operate and what they operate, no change in that. The agreement was extended through 2026. We are not going to talk about the pricing of it. We obviously wouldn\u2019t have mentioned it if it wasn\u2019t an earnings catalyst. But 15% to 20% of our medical cost is pharmacy-related. And the pricing decrement we received was, in our view, noteworthy to discuss as an earnings catalyst for 2023 and beyond. But at this point, we are not going to actually size the pricing. George Hill : Okay. So, maybe sizing the pricing isn\u2019t the right way to think about it. But is the \u2013 if we use that range, is there a way to think about how we should think about like what the change to MLR can be as it flows through the income statement, or I guess just kind of any way to kind of quantify the earnings contribution you guys not necessarily the pricing on the contract? Joe Zubretsky : Well as I said, at this point in time, we have sized the size of the contract, $4 billion to $5 billion a year of pharmacy spend. But no, we are not yet prepared. When we give 2023 guidance, the CVS Caremark contract would likely be a meaningful contributor to that guidance, and we will potentially talk about it specifically then. George Hill : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The last question today comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : Hey. Thanks. Good morning guys. I was also going to ask about the exchange business, but a lot of that was covered. I guess the follow-up question around that, though, Joe, when you kind of mentioned those 13% to 14% premium increases that you put in place, how does that stack up relative to your medical cost trend expectation for exchange book for next year? And something that you are mainly focused on margins, but I guess do you expect profit growth within that book the way it stands right now for \u201823? I just want to confirm that. Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : Yes. Our strategy for the marketplace business is to target mid-single digit pretax margins and let the revenue float up and down accordingly pursuant to that pricing strategy. Based on the early read, where we actually now have seen competitive pricing, the price increases we put in, in a handful of markets remained very competitive. If we are number one or number two or a close number three or four in the market, we have maintained that position. So, the early read only in a handful of markets is that not only do we believe our pricing has appropriately captured trend, but we maintained our competitive position. So, the book of business shouldn\u2019t materially change. Mark Keim : The only thing I would add to that is now that we understand current year performance, the base period that we are jumping off we feel much better about. So, we are pricing in a trend that we feel good about going into 2023. Joe mentioned the 13% average rate that we are putting into the market. The only other thing that maybe isn\u2019t obvious as you build your model is that the assumption in there on risk adjustment, right. Those are the three big drivers trend, the changes in risk adjustment for the underlying acuity of the population, and of course, price. You put those things together, and we feel very well positioned for the return to that mid-single digit pretax next year. Steven Valiquette : Got it. Okay. Alright. Thanks. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. This concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Krocheski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Joe Krocheski : Good morning, and welcome to Molina Healthcare's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our third quarter earnings was distributed after the market closed yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that the remarks made are as of today, Thursday, October 27, 2022, and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. On this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures for 2022 can be found in our third quarter 2022 press release. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of our adjusted earnings outlook with GAAP measures for the years beyond 2022 without unreasonable efforts due to the difficulty of predicting the timing and amounts of various items within a reasonable range. During our call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our 2022 guidance, our long-term growth strategy, our recent RFP awards and RFP submission and the projected revenue and earnings growth associated with these awards, our outlook with regard to both fiscal year 2023 and 2024, our acquisition and M&A activity. The COVID-19 pandemic can redetermination and our current and future competitive earnings power and margins. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that can cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise the listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report filed with the SEC as well as the risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe? Joe Zubretsky : Thank you, Joe, and good morning. Today, we will provide updates on several topics, our financial results for the third quarter of 2022, our full year 2022 guidance in the context of our third quarter results, our growth initiatives and our strategy for sustaining profitable growth. Our outlook on 2023 premium revenue and earnings growth and lastly, given our recent new business success and early outlook on premium revenue for 2024. Let me start with the third quarter highlights. Last night, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.36, representing 54% growth year-over-year. Our earnings growth reflects strong premium revenue growth, sustained target margins and the realization of a meaningful portion of our 2021 embedded earnings. Our third quarter 88.4% consolidated medical care ratio, 6.9% adjusted G&A ratio and 4.3% pretax margin demonstrate strong operating performance even as we navigate prolonged pandemic-related challenges. Our year-to-date performance, highlighted by an 87.9% MCR, a 6.9% adjusted G&A ratio and a 4.5% pretax margin is squarely in line with our long-term targets. This reported pretax margin increases when normalized for the effects of revenue pass-through payments and the marketplace prior year risk adjustment true-up previously reported. Medicaid, our flagship business, representing approximately 80% of enterprise revenue, continues to produce very strong and predictable operating results and cash flows. The rate environment is stable. COVID costs have tempered and we are executing on the sound fundamentals of medical cost management. The year-to-date reported MCR of 88.2% is at the lower end of our long-term target range, reflecting the underlying strength of our diversified portfolio and our focused execution. Our high acuity Medicare niche serving low-income members, representing 12% of enterprise revenue, continues to grow organically and demonstrate strong operating performance. The year-to-date reported MCR of 87.4%, even with sustained cost pressure from COVID-related care is fairly in line with our long-term target range. Marketplace, at 7% of enterprise revenue, continues to track towards a return to profitability in 2022 on a pure period basis. We have succeeded in keeping the business small, keeping it silver and keeping it stable. In summary, we are very pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance. We executed well, delivered solid operating earnings and continued to deliver on our growth strategy. Turning now to our 2022 guidance. We now project our 2022 premium revenue to be approximately $30.5 billion or $500 million above our previous guidance. From the time of our pivot to growth in 2019, this updated 2022 revenue guidance represents a 3-year, 23% compound annual growth rate. Excluding the estimated impact of the redetermination pause, our 3-year compound annual growth rate is 19%. In addition, we have increased our full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share guidance to at least $17.75. This represents a $0.75 per share increase compared to our initial 2022 guidance despite absorbing an additional $0.50 per share from the net effect of COVID and $0.44 per share for the prior year Marketplace risk adjustment true-up. As we prepare to head into 2023, we have a very solid earnings baseline off of which to grow. Turning now to an update on our long-term strategy for sustaining profitable growth. We are executing well on the many dimensions of our growth strategy. On the RFP front, we continue to build on our track record of success in both retaining our existing Medicaid contracts and winning new ones. The quarter's highlights were many. In Mississippi, Molina was selected to continue serving Medicaid members across the entire state. In California, we've not only retained our current footprint, but we're also selected to serve the important county of Los Angeles, which will add significant membership in premium revenue. In Iowa, we were awarded a new statewide contract entering as one of 3 managed care organizations serving a total managed Medicaid population currently at 800,000. And we were awarded a new statewide contract in Nebraska as one of 3 managed care organizations serving a total managed Medicaid population currently at 360,000. Once it commences in January 2024, the California contract award is projected to provide membership growth, measured on current membership roles in excess of 1.2 million members as well as the associated significant premium revenue growth. This projection is based on the state's own published county-by-county Medicaid membership count. We were 1 of 2 plans selected in each of Sacramento County and San Diego County, which are existing Molina counties, but where we now expect additional membership in 2024. We were also selected to be the sole commercial health plan in Los Angeles County, which is a 2-plan model county. Finally, we also won awards in both San Bernardino and Riverside Counties known as the Inland Empire, where we expect our current membership levels to remain the same. With awards in each of these 5 California counties, we were successful in being selected in every county on which we bid. We are very confident in our ability to operationally prepare for this expansion. We have a deep knowledge of the [Medicare] program, and we have an existing long-term presence in Los Angeles. We have already commenced the 15-month build-out for this significant expansion. In combination, all of these contracts will expand our Medicaid portfolio to 20 states. These new contracts are expected to add approximately $5.8 billion in annual premium revenue and at least $3 of earnings per share, once we achieve full run rate margins. Looking forward, our RFP response has been submitted for [Texas STAR+PLUS]. It is pending evaluation and subsequent award announcement. We believe we are well-positioned to retain this contract due to our track record of operational and clinical excellence, standing and reputation, cutting-edge innovation and the demonstrated ability to right winning proposals. With multiple new state RFP opportunities over the coming years, we remain confident in our ability to win additional new state contracts. We have submitted our proposal for the LTSS contract in the state of Indiana, and have many other new state business development initiatives well underway, including the potential for returning to New Mexico and expanding to our former nearly statewide footprint in Florida. In summary, our track record of success validates our long-term revenue growth strategy and its value creation potential. Before I turn to some further particulars regarding our outlook for both 2023 and 2024, I want to briefly put a point on the magnitude of the company's achievements in the third quarter and what those achievements mean for the future of our company. Stated at a high level, the new business wins will have a profound impact on our company over the next few years. As a matter of year-by-year sequencing, in 2023, we will be busy scaling our proven operating infrastructure to service this new revenue, incurring front-end implementation costs. In 2024, we expect to achieve full run rate contract revenue with earnings beginning to emerge from this significant new revenue. And finally, in 2025, we expect to achieve our full run rate target margins. Against the background of this sequencing and high-level view, I will now provide some color regarding our 2023 outlook. 2023 will be an important year as we prepare for our new revenue growth. We will be hiring and training additional staff to expand our already expert teams and extending our systems to ensure ample capacity. We expect that the onetime nonrecurring expense in 2023 associated with this robust growth will be $0.75 per share. Given our strong current performance, we are raising our 2023 core earnings outlook, the earnings that would have been produced by our company before these recent wins from at least $20 per share to at least $20.25 per share. This core earnings outlook, a meaningful measure of underlying performance, represents 14% growth on today's updated 2022 guidance of at least $17.75 per share. When we include the onetime nonrecurring $0.75 per share implementation costs, our reported earnings per share outlook for 2023 is now at least $19.50. Turning now to our premium revenue outlook for 2024. While it is far too early to provide specific financial guidance for 2024, we do have line of sight to many of the premium revenue growth drivers that we expect to materialize in 2024. First, we expect to continue to grow organically in our current geographic footprint. Second, we expect our recent RFP wins in California, Iowa and Nebraska as well as our AgeWell and My Choice Wisconsin acquisitions to be operating at or near full run rate revenue. And third, we expect that these growth drivers will be partially offset by the impact of redeterminations and through potential pharmacy carve-outs. Combined, these revenue building blocks create an attractive growth trajectory and path to at least $37 billion in premium revenue in 2024. With over a year to go, additional M&A announcements and new Medicaid procurement wins would add to this already attractive 2024 premium revenue picture. A few words on our embedded earnings profile, which provides a forward view of our earnings potential beyond 2023. As previously described, the $5.8 billion in incremental revenue in 2024 from our recent RFP wins adds at least $3 per share in incremental earnings. These earnings are anticipated to begin to emerge in 2024 when all of our new RFP wins will then be operational. With this $3 per share addition, our total 2023 embedded earnings power is now nearly $6 per share. This is strong latent capacity to achieve our near- and long-term earnings objectives. In summary, we are very pleased with our business performance and the exciting developments over the past few months. Combined, this has created a solid and growing financial profile, at least $20.25 per share of core earnings in 2023, $37 billion of premium revenue in 2024. 2023 embedded earnings power of nearly $6 per share and all of this is before any impact from the continued execution of our growth initiatives. Of course, we could not accomplish all of this without our excellent management team and dedicated associates, now approaching 15,000 strong, who in concert with our hallmark proprietary operating model and management process, have produced these results. To the entire team, I once again extend my deepest thanks and heartfelt appreciation. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional insight on the financials. Mark? Mark Keim : Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss some additional details of our third quarter performance, our strong balance sheet, our updated 2022 guidance and some additional color on the revenue and EPS building blocks driving our outlooks for 2023 and 2024. Beginning with our third quarter results. In Medicaid, our reported MCR was 88.5%. This strong performance squarely in line with our long-term target range, was driven by strong medical cost management. The net effect of COVID in the quarter was a modest 10 basis points within our reported MCR. Year-to-date, our reported MCR was 88.2% and at the lower end of our long-term target range. In Medicare, our reported MCR was 88.7%, a figure which is above our long-term target range, driven by higher COVID and non-COVID utilization. During the quarter, the net effect of COVID increased our reported MCR by 350 basis points. Despite continuing COVID-related utilization, our year-to-date reported MCR of 87.4% was squarely in line with our long-term target range. In Marketplace, our reported third quarter MCR was 86.3%. Similar to previous quarters, the MCR was impacted by higher utilization and approximately 90 basis points of net effect of COVID. We remain on track to return our Marketplace business to profitability on a pure period basis in 2022. Though it varies by business, in aggregate, the net effect of COVID was consistent with our expectations and decreased net income by $0.59 per share in the quarter. Our full year outlook for the net effect of COVID remains unchanged at $2.50 per share. Additional drivers of our strong third quarter results include a 6.9% adjusted G&A ratio, a 40 basis point improvement over the prior year third quarter and higher net investment income from recent increases in interest rates. Turning now to our balance sheet. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters, and we continue to be confident in this reserve position. Days and claims payable at the end of the quarter was 50%, consistent with prior quarters. Our capital foundation remains strong. Debt at the end of the quarter was 1.7x trailing 12-month EBITDA, and our debt-to-cap ratio was 44.2%. On a net debt basis, net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.5x and 41%, respectively. Our leverage remains low. All bond maturities are long dated on average 8 years and our weighted average cost of debt fixed at just 4%. We harvested $120 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter. Parent company cash at the end of the quarter was $298 million. With substantial incremental debt capacity, cash on hand and strong free cash flow we have ample cash and capital to drive our organic and inorganic growth strategies. Now a few comments on our updated 2022 guidance. We increased our full year premium revenue guidance by $500 million to approximately $30.5 billion, driven by 3 components : approximately $200 million for the third quarter outperformance, approximately $200 million for the addition of AgeWell, which closed October 1; and approximately $100 million to reflect the impact of the latest extension of the public health emergency through January and the related delay in resuming redeterminations, which we now expect to begin in 2023. We also raised our full year 2022 adjusted earnings guidance by $0.15 per share to at least $17.75. The increase is driven by several items. Third quarter outperformance of about $0.15 per share, margin on the additional revenue from the extension of the public health emergency, which we estimate at about $0.05 per share and additional net investment income of approximately $0.10 per share in the fourth quarter, driven by the recent rise in interest rates. Partially offsetting these items is approximately $0.15 per share of expected higher G&A, driven by fourth quarter marketing and open enrollment activities as well as the recent new contract wins. Turning now to our earnings outlook for 2023. Based on the expected timing of the known revenue building blocks, our initial outlook for 2023 premium revenue is approximately $31.5 billion. We are increasing our 2023 core EPS outlook. The earnings before the onetime nonrecurring implementation costs to at least $20.25 or 14% growth compared to our updated 2022 guidance. Our earnings growth outlook reflects several drivers. First, we expect a portion of our 2022 embedded earnings to [emerge] in 2023. Second, the attractive growth in our current footprint and the associated margin, partially offset by potential pharmacy carve-outs will yield incremental earnings in 2023. Third, a combination of new operating catalyst should enhance our 2023 earnings growth, including our recently renegotiated PBM contract, our expected real estate reduction, and finally, we expect higher interest rates to translate into correspondingly higher net investment income. Recognizing the onetime nonrecurring implementation costs of $0.75 per share on our new contract wins in California, Iowa and Nebraska, yields our updated outlook of at least $19.50 per share for 2023. Our evolving outlook for 2023 will be informed by our performance in the fourth quarter of 2022 as well as the enrollment season for Medicare and Marketplace and the ongoing execution of our strategic initiatives. As Joe mentioned, our 2023 embedded earnings power is nearly $6 per share, made up of the following components. We start with our previously reported 2022 embedded earnings of $3 per share, we add at least $3 per share of earnings from our recent new contract wins, we decreased it by $1 that is now in our 2023 outlook, and finally, we add the implementation costs for new contracts of $0.75 per share to recognize the onetime nature of IT platforms, program enhancements and several months of staff ramp-up. Now some additional color on the premium revenue outlook for 2024. The following building blocks provide a path from our expected 2022 premium revenue of approximately $30.5 billion to $31.5 billion in 2023, and to ultimately, at least $37 billion of projected revenue for 2024. First, we expect approximately $5.8 billion of premium revenue from our 3 recently announced Medicaid contract wins. This projection includes a conservative estimate of the impact from redeterminations and is composed of $3.6 billion in California, $1.6 billion in Iowa and $600 million in Nebraska. Based on contract inception dates, we expect a portion of Iowa premium revenue to emerge in 2023, while we expect the premium revenue from California and Nebraska to be realized in 2024. Second, we expect organic growth in our current footprint of $1.7 billion, consistent with underlying growth in rates and membership. Third, the incremental premium revenue for the full year impact of AgeWell and the My Choice Wisconsin acquisitions is expected to be approximately $1.4 billion, most of which will emerge in 2023. Partially offsetting these growth drivers are 2 regulatory impacts. Approximately $1.6 billion for the impact of redetermination, which we expect to emerge evenly between 2023 and 2024 based on the latest outlook for the end of the PAG in January. And approximately $700 million of pharmacy carve-outs, most of which will emerge in 2023. Of course, continued execution of our strategic initiatives creates upside to this revenue outlook. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Josh Raskin at Nephron Research. Josh Raskin : Question I want to say on L.A. County on the win there and maybe you could speak to the preparations for that contract implementation. I'm specifically interested in network development and provider contracting and then infrastructure build-out. And I'm curious if there's a potential deal with the incumbent to help accelerate that readiness or you think you guys can do it all on your own? Joe Zubretsky : Josh, this is Joe. First, I would answer your second question first. All that is to be determined. As you know, in past contract wins, both here and in the industry, that is certainly a possibility, but I'll leave that to further discussion. On the preparation, we've been in California for 40 years. We know Sacramento and San Diego very well. Our membership is likely to double there. We'll scale up. And so we don't see much of a big and heavy lift for Sacramento and San Diego. Bear in mind, we are in L.A. County. We're a subcontractor to the current commercial plan. We know the providers, we know the landscape and we're really confident that with 15 months to prepare, we have the 3 things that you need to be ready on day 1. We have the time, we have the money and we have the know-how. And we will be fully ready on 1/1/24 to handle the significant new membership in LA County. Josh Raskin : Perfect. And then just that $0.75 then, is that a charge that you guys expect to be taking? Or is that just additional costs born through the P&L that you're calling out? Joe Zubretsky : Well, I think, managerially, it's a charge. I mean it's a cost that has to be incurred in advance of the revenue showing up, but we have to take it through earnings. 1/3 of it is IT scaling. The other 2/3 is staff. Take the variable cost of running $6 billion of revenue and look at having 2 to 4 months of that cost paid for trained and ready to go in advance of the contract. And you can see how easily it's going to cost $60 million pretax and $0.75 a share. Operator : And our next question today comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Justin Lake : First off, maybe you can walk us through the components of the $1.7 billion of organic growth. Maybe just price and membership growth along your 3 business lines? Joe Zubretsky : Justin, I'll turn it over to Mark, and he'll be able to peel that back for you. Mark Keim : Sure. When we think about the $1.7 billion of organic growth, that was a 2-year number from our build that's looking over 2 years. Justin, we typically think of 3% to 4% organic growth on an annual basis. Generally, that's about half membership and about half rate. In a year, that's more or less. We're in a lower rate environment right now, which certainly matches trend. But you can do a little bit of math on our current book and work with those organic growth numbers. The other thing that you'd want to stack on top of this, as you think about that organic growth rate is you have to adjust for some of the pass-throughs that we have in our book right now. We've got about $500 million of pass-through revenue this year. So of course, that's going to make a year-over-year comparison less than it might otherwise look because that's not a recurring item, right? Then the only other thing to think about on organic growth is, as Joe mentioned many times on Marketplace, our Marketplace strategy is not to grow ambitiously. So I would not put a meaningful growth rate or any growth rate necessarily on Marketplace year-over-year. But I think if you add those things together, you'll get very close to the 1.7 number I talked about. Justin Lake : Great. And then just lastly, there's I know the folks who didn't win in California are trying to get a stay from a judge on the award and then go to court. Is there anything that you could share with us on timing on what we might hear from that? And how that might play out? Joe Zubretsky : No, Justin, this is Joe. We won't comment specifically on the protest process itself, but with all 3 awards. We believe that the RFPs were thoughtfully designed and well executed by the various states and that our proposals were effectively judged on their merits. We are very familiar with the protest processes in these various states and are actively engaged and well-resourced to handle it. And right now, we're heads down, preparing for day 1 implementation. We're pretty confident that many of these protest processes will not be protected and come to culmination and an answer in due course very soon. Operator : And our next question today comes from Nathan Rich, Goldman Sachs. Nathan Rich : If I could ask a follow-up on the new contract wins. Could you talk about how the margins on that contract ramp up in 2024 and beyond. It looks like you're targeting about a 4% margin on that new business. Can you talk about maybe what we should expect in 2024 versus the years beyond that? Joe Zubretsky : First, Nathan, this is Joe. Your math is correct. The $3 sort of implies a 4 percentage point pretax margin, 3 percentage points after tax. And I will -- the first thing I'll say before kicking it to Mark, is we generally do not impute fixed cost leverage on either our acquisitions or new contract wins. So that's a fully loaded margin, fully burdened with all the fixed costs to run the business. Obviously, with $6 billion of incremental revenue, growing our Medicaid book of business [true-up] by 25% in a short span of time, we expect to get a significant amount of fixed cost leverage off these installations but we kind of hold that back. We'll report it when we realize it, and it will either drop to the bottom line or potentially offset perhaps other pressures in the [MLR]. Mark, anything more on the margins on the new wins? Mark Keim : No, that's exactly right, Joe. The 3% is fully loaded. As we've said numerous times with fixed cost leverage, we would ideally see a few bps go to the G&A ratio. But this is conservative and assumes maybe that you give a little bit back in rate. But nevertheless, a conservative view on outlook -- now part of your question might have been 24 ramp into 25 run rate. The 3% is a conservative view of run rate. On the 24, how does that ramp up? It's interesting. Some markets, if folks are new to Medicaid, they can come in hot in the '90s for the first couple of quarters. Other markets where people have been in Medicaid and are quite used to the product and on normal utilization. They'll come in more at the normal run rate. So to be conservative, I'd say that the [MLRs] will be a little bit hotter than we aspired to. Remember, 88% to 89% is our longer-term Medicaid outlook. Would they come in a little hotter than that in the first year? Maybe. But I wouldn't think too much. And so conservatively, we say it takes a year to get to our run rate there. Nathan Rich : Great. And if I could just ask a follow-up. You called out some continued pressure from COVID in the quarter, I think, particularly on your Medicare business. Have your expectations changed at all for COVID and maybe flu as we think about the fourth quarter and then into '23, both on the COVID front as well as non-COVID utilization, any changes there to your assumptions? Joe Zubretsky : No, I think our outlook for COVID remains the same. It's going to cost us $2.50 a share. And generally, what's been happening is the direct cost of COVID-related care, which have been pretty modest quarter-to-quarter have been nearly -- entirely offset by what we call COVID-related utilization suppression. And therefore, the net COVID cost has been the amount of outperformance in our Medicaid contracts that goes into the risk-sharing corridor. So our outlook on that hasn't really changed. Yes, we are expecting a normal flu season for 2022 into '23. $40 million plus is a normal flu season for us. It went to nearly 0 in the first flu season after pandemic. It's now increased to about half the normal size at about $20 million, and we expect it to go back to $40 million plus into next year, fully baked into our forecast. Operator : And our next question today comes from Stephen Baxter of Wells Fargo. Stephen Baxter : Congrats on the Medicaid wins. I think you guys mentioned in the prepared remarks, potentially this being a little bit of a lower rate environment on the Medicaid side. I was hoping you could give us a sense of how you're thinking about the outlook for rates inside of your guidance for the next couple of years. And then separately, I was hoping you could give us an update on the total amount of Medicaid premium return you expect to see in 2022, both for COVID era provisions and also for any preexisting provisions that were in the states? Joe Zubretsky : Stephen, I think the summary comment on the rate environment, it's continued to be stable and rational. The traditional process of establishing a credible medical cost baseline, a trend off that baseline, adjusting for changes in the acuity of the population and carve-in and carve-out benefits has been tried and true and supported this business well for decades, and that's the traditional process that is used. As we indicated many months ago, the risk-sharing corridors that were introduced during the pandemic to capture [software] utilization have generally subsided. There's 3 remaining. And we'll play it by year in terms of whether those persist into the future or not. So the rate environment is very stable, very traditional process of establishing a cost base line and a trend off that baseline. And I would say, the overall rate environment is stable. I had trouble hearing your second question, but I'll kick it to Mark. I think he has it. Mark Keim : Yes. Just on the Medicaid revenue build, I'll work off 2024 just for the full picture. We talked about $5.8 billion from the 3 new states. The acquisitions will add $1.4 million, that's AgeWell, which is about $0.5 billion on top of this year and My Choice, which will be the full $900 coming in -- full $900 million. Other components of Medicaid revenue build redetermination across the 2 years, I see revenue headwinds of $1.6 million. And we mentioned in the prepared remarks, that would be split between the 2 years pretty evenly, we expect. Then finally, we have mentioned 2 pharmacy carve-outs that will affect our Medicaid revenue for about $700 million across the 2 years. You put your best assumption on the organic growth for Medicaid, and I think that would give you the components of the Medicaid building blocks. Operator : And our next question today comes from A.J. Rice of Credit Suisse. A.J. Rice: I know you're saying that particularly for next year on the Marketplace, you're not assuming a lot of growth there. Any comment on where you think the margins will go and what your objective is there longer-term as well? Any updated thoughts? Joe Zubretsky : Sure, A.J. Our outlook for the margins of the Marketplace business is mid-single digits on a pretax basis. This year, we expect to be profitable on a pure period basis, eliminating the effects of the prior year risk adjustment true-up which we experienced in the second quarter. We break even in this business at around 84%. So if we can operate between 80% and 83%, we think we can push the business to mid-single-digit pretax margins. And I will mention 2 things. The SEP membership that we are attracting this year is far lower than the SEP membership we attracted last year. We are attracting 25,000, 30,000 a month last year, and it's barely 25,000 to 30,000 a quarter. That SEP membership, as we said last year, it usually comes in with higher acuity. So that's in check. And secondly, as a reminder, we put 13 to 14 points of rate into the market. We've looked at our competitive positioning and looking at where our product now stands against the competitors, and we're pretty confident that we've maintained our competitive position in many of our larger markets and have no reason to expect that our membership will meaningfully increase or decrease as a result of our competitive positioning. A.J. Rice: Okay. And then I know in your prepared remarks, you talked a little bit about reverification impact being spread over '23 and '24. Any updated thoughts about looking at it today. Obviously, we did have a 3-month delay on the PAG. And I don't think you guys have talked -- any updated thoughts about how much would be in '23 versus '24 and where you ultimately land. And then I don't think you've talked much about recapture with your Marketplace offering. Do you think you'll recapture any of the lost lives? Joe Zubretsky : On the second point, our redetermination forecast on how much revenue we will likely lose as a result of people becoming ineligible does not include a recapture on Marketplace. We're holding that as upside. It's very hard to forecast who is going to be eligible for a highly subsidized Marketplace. We believe many of them will. We have operational protocols in place to warm transfer ineligible Medicaid members over to our Marketplace business. So it remains upside to our forecast. I'll turn it to Mark to give you how the revenue emerges over a 2-year period. Mark Keim : Yes. Just as a reminder, the most recent extension was on October -- mid-October to mid-January. We expect that the earliest states would start to redetermine then a month later in February and expect them to do it in a straight-line basis, more or less, across the year. CMS has required states to be done in 1 year, whether they can do that or not remains to be seen. But let's assume that they get there across 12 months. We're currently carrying roughly 750,000 members since the start of the pandemic. Our assumption, A.J., is that at the end of the year, we will have retained 50% of them and lost only 50% to redetermination. I model a PMPM across the book of about $3.75 on these. So when I do the math, the total revenue loss would be $1.6 billion. But remember, that's spread across 2 years. While the membership comes down this year, the revenue was half this year and half next year. If you look at the member months, so call it 0.8% this year, 0.8% next year, back to that into your revenue models. And of course, the member months will support all that. Operator : And our next question today comes from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. I just wanted to make sure I understood the $6 in earnings power fully. So I guess, first, you guys said -- I believe that you started with the $3 that you have this year at the $3 on the new business, that makes sense. But then you said if you took $1 out of the existing $3 and added back to $0.75, I just -- I don't know where that dollar that you're taking out is from? Is that from the COVID bucket from the deal bucket? How should we think about that? And then I guess we're applying this to $6 to the $19.50, I just want to make sure we have the right base to think about with the earnings power. Joe Zubretsky : Kevin, I'll turn it to Mark. The $0.75 charge actually creates a little bit of complex -- accounting complexity here, but it's either $5 per share or $5.75 depending on whether you're pro-forming the $19.50 or the 2025. So we're just under $6 per share at $5.75 have been better earnings when compared to the $19.50 of reported earnings for next year. Mark? Mark Keim : Yes. So let me walk you through that. In our last call, we talked about $3 of embedded earnings. As Joe mentioned, we're increasing that by an additional $3 to recognize the run rate of the 3 new states. So we're at $6 currently. The dollar that comes down -- excuse me, we're going to put $1 into our guidance -- our outlook for next year. It's a combination of the acquisitions and the net effect of COVID. I'm expecting about $0.50 to come off the net effect of COVID that we're currently carrying. I'm expecting to realize about $1 of the acquisitions that are in our embedded earnings. And then finally, on redeterminations, $0.50 will go the other way. In my embedded earnings, I'm carrying $1 -- a negative $1 on a redetermination $0.50 of that's going to go into our outlook for next year. So you add that up, that's the dollar. Then finally, we're recognizing the $0.75 of onetime costs. So that gets you to $5.75 million to $6 a dollar for what we're putting into our outlook, increased it for $0.75 for the implementation cost that gets you to $5.75. And to be very clear, that $5.75 is off the $19.50 of adjusted earnings outlook. Joe Zubretsky : The other thing I would say about embedded earnings just to put a point on it, I just want to make sure we don't get to caught in what I'll call false precision here. Our embedded earnings concept, given the historic nature of the pandemic and then the incredible growth we've had due to acquisitions and new contract wins, is to give our investor base a view of the future earnings power of the business, whether it's $5 or $5.75 or $6, it's sitting on top of $19.50 or $20.25 of earnings per share in 2023 and should give you a pretty good leading indicator of where the business is headed. Now I would further say on embedded earnings. Embedded earnings is really only theoretical unless you have a history and a track record of harvesting it. And when you look at our earnings per share track record of going from $13 per share to $17 and now to $20, we -- this is not theory. This is actual embedded earnings due to timing, which is yet to be harvested, and we have every full intention of pulling that through. Mark Keim : Joe, I'd just put a point on that. A year ago, we had more than $6 of embedded earnings and 4 of that went into current year performance. So it's quickly converting into real earnings. Kevin Fischbeck : That's really helpful. And I guess just as far as the redetermination dynamic, we're still talking about a revenue dynamic. You guys still feel pretty comfortable that there shouldn't be any margin implications from redeterminations? And I know you shared some data in the past. Is there anything that you would point out to is kind of giving you confidence that there won't be a margin implication from a risk pool dynamic? Joe Zubretsky : We continue to look at the data. And we see -- we do see increased duration across our products. It's not as much as you might think because the disenrollment rate is still pretty high. Nonutilizing members are off but only up modestly and longer duration members do have more favorable [MLRs]. This really doesn't affect the ABD population because they're chronic, that's 1/3 of the revenue. And so if we do have any pressure, we're likely to see it in the expansion population, but we expect it to be minimal. Mark? Mark Keim : That's exactly right. I studied this across the second and third quarter, it's quite in-depth. On members that are with us for longer than 1 year, of course, they're up. But as Joe mentioned, they're not up as much as you might think because the disenrollment rate is actually quite meaningful still. It's not like no one leaves. We still have meaningful disenrollment rates. So what we look at is the members with no claims, it's up a little but not that much. Some folks have also looked at the members in the 0 to 25 MLR range. That's up kind of like the no claims cohort, but not that much. When we then model through what the impacts are, as Joe mentioned, ABD really hasn't changed. That's a very stable group of folks. It's really in the expansion population that we expect to see some impact, but that's 30% of our revenues on a weighted average basis. I'm not seeing a meaningful impact here. Kevin Fischbeck : Can I just follow up on that? Because the point about 0 utilizers, I guess, it doesn't take much of the increase your utilizers to have an increase on -- or an impact on MLR like if you had 90% MLR and then the following year, 50 basis points, more people had 0 reserve utilizers, wouldn't that take your MLR down by 50 basis points and take your Medicaid earnings up by over 10%? Like when you say there's just not a big delta in your utilizers, like what are we -- are we talking about 10 basis points? Are we talking about 100 basis points and when you say that you mean like the expansion? Or do you mean like overall across the entire book of business? Mark Keim : In expansion, it's fairly slight. But the other thing is what are they changing to? If there are 0 utilizers now, if they go to 90%, to your point, that's a big impact. But if they're going to anything in between, obviously, the weighted average impact not so much. And again, more to the point, if it's mostly an expansion, which is 30% of our book, the impact gets greatly diluted. Joe Zubretsky : And of course, the underlying assumption is that even if those low utilizers, the percentage did change, the underlying assumption that is being made is those are the ones that are going to leave and there's really no evidence. We always have 0 utilizers. We always have low MLR members -- and there just is no statistically relevant data that suggests that, that's going to put pressure on the MLR. Operator : And our next question today comes from Steven Valiquette at Barclays. Steven Valiquette : Great. So just regarding the L.A. County Medicaid contract award. I mean, every state is a little bit different in how they handle the outcome of a successful appeal under that [indiscernible]. So I guess my question really is just around the scenario analysis, just to confirm that one way or the other. I guess is the scenario that your new award in L.A. County could be 100% completely reversed by a successful appeal by the incumbent? Or under the other scenario, does Molina stay in place as a new plan sponsor no matter what. And the incumbent would just be added back in as an additional plan sponsor over and above the existing awards and to sort of dilute the membership you would gain otherwise? Just curious to get the thoughts on that. And also for the other state awards too, if there's any just high-level color on that as well. Joe Zubretsky : I'll answer the last part of your question first because there was an important data point that just emerged Tuesday. And that is the one protest in Nebraska was denied on Tuesday. That's public information. So I'm not announcing anything that's private. And whether that goes through an appeal process or other administrative processes, I don't know. But that was -- that protest was denied on Tuesday. With respect to your question, I don't want to speculate. I think it would be actually inappropriate for me to speculate what the state of California, the Medicaid department and the administration would do during the protest process. I think there are ranges of scenarios of outcomes. The one we're planning for is that our award was in a well-structured thoughtfully design process. It was evaluated on its merits, and we are heads down preparing for day 1 implementation to make sure that members have access to services, providers have their questions answered, our staff is fully ramped up, and that operational excellence has been our hallmark. So I think it would be improper and perhaps even speculative for me to contemplate what the state might decide. I think there's a range of options. But right now, we think that we're going to be in business in L.A. County on 1/1/24 and getting ready to do so. Steven Valiquette : Okay. All right. So it sounds like it's still TBD. Okay. That's helpful. Operator : And our next question today comes from Scott Fidel at Stephens. Scott Fidel : I was hoping maybe you could just do a quick diagnostic for us. Just when we look at the recent success that you just had in the RFPs and really was quite substantial. And Joe, I know that sort of fixing and accelerating the RFP capability has been a key strategic priority really since you came on board. But really just sort of seem to just really hit its stride more recently. So if you had to pick 2 or 3 things that you think of just resonated in particular with the states in these recent awards, would be helpful to hear about that. And then how transferable do you think those are to somebody's big RFPs that are still ahead in Florida and Texas. Joe Zubretsky : Yes. Our new business development capability, it's really an apparatus. I mean it's a business unit, and there's a playbook. The playbook [indiscernible] go into the state 2 years in advance in anticipation of an RFP developing the relationships with providers, with community leaders and really getting an intense understanding of the hot buttons of the state and what particular -- what their particular concerns are with respect to their Medicaid population and their Medicaid program. Whether it's our government affairs engine, whether it is our community involvement engine, our network developers. And secondly, I would say that it's -- and our proposal writers, which we've proven that we can write high-quality proposals that are easy to understand and that score really well. But I will tell you, the key to writing a great proposal is actually being able to stand behind it and actually perform and the referenceability of our national capabilities, social determinants of health, managing high-acuity populations, opioid use disorder, substance abuse and other types of behavioral conditions, our ability to value-based contract, I mean, it's one thing to write well to innovation. It's another thing to be able to stand behind it with referenceability. And as a pure-play Medicaid player, our skills and capabilities are entirely referenceable, are playing really well and seem to be winning. Scott Fidel : And if I could just ask one separate follow-up just back on the exchanges. And I know that you're really trying to manage the membership and keep this exposure relatively limited. But obviously, 2023 is going to be a pretty unusual year with some of these really aggressive players like Bright now exiting the market, which is going to going to put a lot of membership back sort of into the pool. So how are you approaching that? I mean we did see in the landscape data yesterday that 14% premium increase you talked about and that your premiums are pretty conservative versus the market. But you probably can still end up right with adding a lot of membership potentially. So just interested in how you're sort of thinking about that sort of incremental enrollment and then managing sort of trying to keep the business still relatively low exposure? Joe Zubretsky : Sure, Scott. And we did see that note and we thought it characterize our approach perfectly that we priced for margin and not to grow market share in this business. With respect to the market exits that you've read about, we've mapped our footprint to the companies that are exiting. There's not a lot of overlap there. Where there is, CMS has sort of \"assigned\" or at least suggested to various members that they move to a Molina product, but it's measured in the thousands, not the tens of thousands. We still don't know what the overlap is in Texas. We haven't seen the data yet. But all in all, I would say that the market exits should not have a meaningful impact on whatever our growth rate is going to be next year, the market exits should not have a meaningful impact. And yes, you're absolutely right, we priced purposely to produce mid-single-digit pretax margins, but the revenue fall work made. Operator : And our next question today comes from Calvin Sternick at JPMorgan. Calvin Sternick : Sort of related on the Marketplace. I know you talked about positioning that sort of complementary to Medicaid and not really looking to grow it. But if you hold on to California, do you think you'd get maybe a natural lift in that business? Just having the overlapping Medicaid and Marketplace products in that county? Joe Zubretsky : Yes, Calvin. One of the things we haven't talked about yet because right now, job one is to scale up our operations in California to handle the Medicaid membership, job one. But yes, L.A. County, in particular, has a very high concentration of D-SNP members and Marketplace participants. And while we have those products in California, because of our small presence currently in L.A., I wouldn't say that we have a large LA presence in those 2 products. But yes, we would quickly evaluate whether we would -- once we're comfortable, we've got the day 1 readiness in place, fully scaled and operating well in Medicaid, we would absolutely evaluate whether our Medicare product and our Marketplace product would be -- we followed the same pattern we followed across the country, plant the Medicaid flag come in with our ancillary products and build a robust and diversified product portfolio. I would consider that upside to the growth case, but we have not included it in our current estimate. Calvin Sternick : And is that something that you think about as maybe being a 2024 opportunity? Or is that more 2025, just given that there is the protest, it could go to court and you have to submit your Medicare bids by middle of next year. Because what are you thinking on the timing? Joe Zubretsky : Well, right now, we're planning that we will be implementing our Medicaid contract on 1/1/24. That's what we're planning on. And let's assume that happens. I would say that we would not be -- we haven't valued in this yet, but I think would be pretty quick and pretty early to then be filing 2 ancillary products 6 months later until we know that we've got the Medicaid population well serviced and operating excellently. So I would say, just off the top of my head now that you've asked, it would probably be more like a '25 filing for '26, and not '24 to '25. Operator : And our next question today comes from Dave Windley at Jefferies. Dave Windley : Joe, I just wanted to get your updated thoughts on M&A environment in terms of opportunities, valuation expectations, then also higher cost of capital environment. a lot of organic scaling on your plate? Just what are your thoughts about continued M&A? Joe Zubretsky : I'm sorry, David, I couldn't hear the last end of your question, continuing to do what. Dave Windley : What are your thoughts about continuing merger and acquisition activity for you. Joe Zubretsky : Thank you. Well, with all the new contract wins, we didn't spend a lot of time during this earnings report to talk about M&A. But I will tell you, the portfolio, the pipeline continues to be very robust with the same type of bolt-on tuck-in acquisitions that have been our hallmark. We're up to about $10 billion of revenue purchased. We've only allocated capital. We've only cost us about 22% of revenue, which includes regulatory capital. And we've gotten every dollar of accretion we promised and more out of these acquisitions because we turn our operational leaders and their playbook on some of these underperforming properties and we get them to target margins rather quickly. So we have ample capacity, as Mark talked about in his prepared remarks, ample debt capacity, great cash flows. We're in no way capital constraints to continue on the growth trajectory. We've had 18% to 19% growth since our pivot to growth in 2019. We promised 13% to 15% at our Investor Day. We produced close to 20%. We can continue to grow at this rate, either by acquisition or by organic or by new contract wins and continue to fund this growth from existing cash flow and debt capacity. Mark Keim : Just to put a point on that, Dave, the pipeline is robust. At any given point, we're relationship building. We're in discussions with numerous targets out there. So I'm very encouraged by that. On a capital perspective, looking out over the next 18 months, I feel very comfortable with our capital position. Just organically, we can self-fund most of anything I see in the pipeline between the capital commitment I need for these new procurement wins as well as the capital for some of the potential M&A. I see ample organic cash flow and capital to support all that without even going outside. Now I wouldn't say I would never go outside to raise more capital. But with everything I see over the next 18 months, we can self-fund all that growth, and we're still looking at our M&A pipeline to see what else is there. So we feel pretty good about that outlook. Operator : Our next question today comes from Michael Hua Ha of Morgan Stanley. Michael Hua Ha : Appreciate the question, and I appreciate all the new guidance update details. Clearly, a lot of new embedded earnings. But when I think about '23, it looks like there's potentially even more tailwinds that could drive upside to your new guidance, upside from recapturing redetermined lives in your exchange book, that's not in your guide, family glitch fix benefit potential benefit to your exchange Medicaid book if recession picked up, maybe better net investment income and rising rates. So are any of these items actually included in your new guide? Am I missing any other tailwinds that could drive upside? And on the headwinds, drive from redetermination in Florida rate cut, pharmacy carve-outs are there any large headwind buckets that should be on our radar? Joe Zubretsky : I think I'll take it and hand it to Mark to give you the tail take. But as we said, when you're trying to bridge from the $17.75 of earnings per share guidance for this year to the $19.50 reported for next year or 2025 core, the components are harvesting a component of embedded earnings, organic growth, which we have a great track record of harvesting, significant operational catalysts that Mark mentioned during his prepared remarks, and then, of course, we do expect a tailwind from interest rates given the short-dated nature of our portfolio. So Mark, why don't you take through the numbers? Mark Keim : Great. As Joe mentioned, starting from $17.75, as I've mentioned, about $1 comes in from our embedded earnings. It's a little bit off the net effect of COVID. It's the M&A portion that's yet to be realized. And then it's a little bit of a headwind on redetermination in 2023. Organic growth, we talked about that, which is just the recurring growth of rates and membership. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the operational catalysts, the PBM renegotiation and the upside on that, the real estate rationalization, which I expect to address here at some point in the fourth quarter. Investment income, definitely upside on that. We manage an $8 billion portfolio today split between cash and longer-term investments. Who knows where short-term rates are going. But certainly, on the cash portion, our net investment income is very responsive to those rates. So I think some nice upside there. All those things bridge you to the 2025 core number that Joe mentioned the $0.75 gets you back to the $19.50. Michael, you addressed a bunch of the things that are potentially. We're still working through on the Marketplace, how will open enrollment work, more importantly, on redetermination. What is the cross-sell opportunity as folks come off Medicaid, maybe into Marketplace, that's all upside. We don't assume any of that in our outlook. -- you certainly hit on the net investment income upside. We continue to work through this rate environment as we go into the new year, most of our rates aren't known definitively. We work through that as we go, so that's something we're thinking about every day. But as Joe mentioned, those rates need to be tied to trend, that's an actuarial requirement. So let's see where trends in rates move. That's one thing that's still evolving in our outlook. But overall, I think you got the core components there, and you mentioned a number of the potential items on top of it. Michael Hua Ha : Just a quick follow-up on organic growth, if I may. Just specifically on Medicare Advantage. I think you mentioned last quarter, 7% revenue growth on both yield and membership. If I'm not mistaken, that would imply roughly low single-digit to mid-single-digit growth. But based on the landscape, it looks like you're targeting pretty strong footprint [indiscernible], doubling your accounting footprint in nondual moving entirely to 0 premium plan, raising your maximum out-of-pocket. But overall, at first [plant], it looks like your offering has improved pretty significantly. You've taken big steps and geographic expansion. So just curious, your thoughts on membership growth next year have been improved since last quarter. Joe Zubretsky : I think from a footprint perspective, counting the number of counties can actually give a misleading answer because we're only probably at about 50% or 60% of the Medicaid counties. However, were in counties that cover 90% of the population. So we're pretty well saturated and penetrated in the Medicaid counties, which is our strategy, follow bring D-SNP into where you're concentrated in Medicaid. Our strategy is very simply is to grow at low teens rates in Medicare. It's a low-income offering, D-SNP, we have our demonstrations, which are basically auto assignment and you roll with the auto assignment algorithms of the federal government. And then, of course, we did launch what we call traditional Medicare Advantage, but it is a low-income strategy. We're not trying to compete with the big guys who are going after affluent seniors. We're targeting people that have enough resources to operate just above the D-SNP income levels and wherewithal levels, but still need a Medicare Advantage product. So it's still a low-income niche offering, and we expect to grow, as we said at our Investor Day, at low teens rates. Mark Keim : And just 2 things to put a point on that. The service area expansion was largely for the '22 year. For '23, we're not seeing a meaningful service area expansion. And I know you know this, when you look at our growth rates on the Medicare segment, the growth that Joe is talking about is related to the Medicare Advantage and D-SNP products. The other half -- more than half of that segment is the MMP product, which, of course, has a different growth characteristic being a close block of business. So I know you know that dynamic, but it's important to think about the 2 components of growth separately. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, our final question today comes from Joseph France with Luke Capital Markets. Joseph France : I just want to follow up on Scott's first question in response, which were both very helpful. Would you tell us about the scope of your subcontractor relationship with the commercial plan in Los Angeles? Joe Zubretsky : Sure. It's -- there's one commercial plan in Los Angeles. And we are a subcontractor meaning in return for a percentage of the premium we service the members. It's under 100,000 members. But we know the environment very well. But it's a very small relationship. It's only a couple of hundred million dollars in premium, and I believe that latest count that I've seen is we're probably at around 70,000, 75,000 members in that book of business. So it gives us familiarity with the territory. Obviously, we have a big installation there with respect to headcount footprint. So we know the area very, very well. But that relationship while it gives us the familiarity that's going to help us scale up, it's financially very small. Joseph France : So it really had no bearing on the RFP itself. Joe Zubretsky : I couldn't comment whether it did or not, but I would suspect that that's correct. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session and today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Krocheski, Senior Vice President, Molina Healthcare. Please go ahead. Joe Krocheski : Good morning, and welcome to Molina Healthcare's fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our fourth quarter earnings was distributed after the market closed yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those of you who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that the remarks made are as of today, Thursday, February 9, 2023. It has not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. On this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures for 2022 and 2023 can be found in our fourth quarter 2022 press release. During our call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our 2023 guidance, our projected 2024 outlook and revenue, our recent RFP awards, recent and future RFP submissions, including those in Indiana, New Mexico and Florida, our acquisitions and M&A activity, Medicaid lease terminations, our long term growth strategy and our embedded earnings power and margins. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report filed with the SEC, as well as the risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe? Joe Zubretsky : Thank you, Joe, and good morning. Today, we will provide updates on several topics. Our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022, our initial 2023 revenue and earnings guidance, our growth initiatives and our strategy for sustaining profitable growth, and our outlook on premium revenue for 2024, given our new business successes in 2022. Let me start with the fourth quarter highlights. Last night, we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.10, representing 42% growth year-over-year. Our fourth quarter 88.3% consolidated medical care ratio, 7.5% adjusted G&A ratio, and 3.9% adjusted pretax margin demonstrate continued strong operating performance. The fourth quarter completes another strong year of operating and financial performance. For the full year, we grew premium revenue by 15% to approximately $31 billion and grew adjusted earnings per share by 32% to $17.92. Our full year adjusted pretax margin of 4.4% was squarely in line with our long-term targets. Medicaid, our flagship business representing approximately 80% of enterprise revenue continues to produce very strong and predictable operating results and cash flows. For the year, we grew membership by approximately 10% and premium revenue by 21%, driven by the inception of our Nevada Medicaid contract, recently closed acquisitions and organic growth. The rate environment is stable and we are executing on the fundamentals of medical cost management. The full year reported MCR of 88% is at the low end of our long term target range and consistent with pre-pandemic levels, reflecting the underlying strength of our diversified portfolio and our focused execution. Our high acuity Medicare niche serving low income members representing 12% of enterprise revenue, continues to grow organically and demonstrate strong operating performance. For the year, we grew membership by 10% and premium revenue by 13%. Membership growth was driven primarily by our low income MAPD product, which more than doubled in 2022. The full year reported MCR of 88.5% was modestly above our long term target range, but includes approximately 300 basis points of pressure from COVID-related care. In Marketplace, the smallest of our three lines of business, we repositioned the business both in terms of its size in the portfolio and metallic mix. On a pure period basis, the business performed at roughly breakeven. While the financial performance did not meet our initial expectations for the year, we believe we have positioned our marketplace business to achieve target margins in 2023. Turning now to the execution of our growth strategy for the year. The successes in 2022 were many. On the M&A front, we closed on the acquisition of Cigna's Texas Medicaid business at the beginning of the year. And the AgeWell acquisition, at the beginning of the fourth quarter. In July, we announced the My Choice Wisconsin acquisition further adding to our market leading LTSS franchise. Our performance on Medicaid RFPs in the year was exceptional. We renewed our contract in Mississippi, doubled the size of our California contract for 2024 and won two new contracts : first in Iowa and then Nebraska for a 100% win rate on RFP responses submitted. In total, we project that these RFP wins for the year will add $4.4 billion in run rate premium revenue. In summary, our full year 2022 enterprise results continue to demonstrate our ability to produce excellent margins, while expanding our franchise by growing premium revenues. Turning now to our 2023 guidance. You can easily see the results of the repeatable earnings pattern we have created. We built new store contract backlog and harvest the earnings as the contracts and acquisitions mature. Meanwhile, we continue to focus on the operating fundamentals and drive operational improvements, which allows us to grow the core business at attractive margins. With regard to our 2023 guidance, we project 2023 premium revenue of $32 billion, representing a 19% compound annual growth rate since our pivot to growth in 2019. The 2022 earnings per share of $17.92 serves as a solid high margin earnings jump-off point. We expect that $1 per share of prior embedded earnings will emerge into 2023 earnings. We expect to produce $1.50 per share of core growth and operational improvements. We expect all of these elements will combine to produce 2023 core earnings per share of at least $20.40, offset by $0.65 per share of one-time contract implementation costs, which results in our 2023 adjusted earnings per share guidance of at least $19.75. The operating improvements supporting the margins in our guidance are durable. The various elements which could impact earnings, COVID, flu, RSV, any margin impacts from redeterminations have been considered informing our guidance. The metrics implied by guidance are squarely in line with our long-term target ranges. As our guidance produces a 4.7% pretax margin, with a growth rate of 14% in core earnings and 10% on a reported adjusted basis. This is an attractive growth profile in a model that is repeatable. In addition to the growth within our guidance, we continue to build an earnings base for the future in the form of our embedded earnings profile, which provides a forward view of our earnings potential beyond 2023. The new store component of our embedded earnings defined as earnings from achieving target margins on acquisitions and new Medicaid contract wins is now at least $4 per share. The ongoing net effect of COVID, which at this point is the continuing earnings impact from the three remaining risk corridors, adds $2 per share of additional upside to this figure. This latent earnings growth estimate does not take into consideration any future organic growth or future strategic initiatives. Turning now to our growth strategy. We have taken major strides toward our $42 billion 2025 premium goal. At this early stage, we already have a clear line of sight to $35.5 billion in 2024. The key to our strategy is balanced, a stellar record of new contract wins, Kentucky, Nevada and now filling in the middle part of the country. The doubling of the size of our California business, including significant expansion in Los Angeles County, preserving and securing all of our incumbent state contracts and no large reprocurements in the near-term, continuing to build the M&A pipeline as this aspect of our strategy has already produced seven transactions for $10 billion. in revenue. Not to mention, organic growth, one member at a time by focusing on greater member attraction and retention and overcoming the regulatory headwinds of redeterminations and pharmacy carve outs. With that as the backdrop, I will now provide an update on some specific in flight opportunities related to our long term growth strategy. At the end of January, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission posted a notice on its website indicating that it was issuing a notice of intent to award our Texas Health Plan, a contract for all of our existing eight service areas in the state. We expect to be able to provide more of an update once these contracts have been finalized and signed. Our RFP response for the Indiana LTSS program has been submitted, it is pending evaluation and subsequent award announcement. In New Mexico, the state announced it has terminated the RFP that was in process and according to their press release, intends to issue an expedited reprocurement as soon as possible. We have many other new state business development initiatives well underway, including the potential for expanding to our former nearly statewide footprint in Florida. Our growing Medicaid footprint still only represents half of the 41 states with managed Medicaid. With multiple new state RFP opportunities over the coming years, and our demonstrated capabilities, referenceability and track record, we remain confident in our ability to win additional new state contracts. Our acquisition pipeline remains replete with actionable opportunities. While the timing of transactions remains difficult to predict, the strength of our pipeline and our track record of success gives us confidence in our ability to drive further growth from this important element of our growth strategy. In summary, we are very pleased with our business performance and the progress made in 2022 on our growth strategy, which has created a solid and growing financial profile. At least $20.40 of core earnings per share and $19.75 per share of adjusted earnings in 2023. Current new store embedded earnings power of at least $4 per share with an additional $2 of upside, if and when the few remaining COVID era corridors are eliminated. And $35.5 billion of identified premium revenue in 2024. All of this is before any impact from the continued execution of our growth initiatives. Of course, we could not accomplish all of this without our excellent management team and dedicated associates now approaching 15,000 strong, who in concert with our hallmark, proprietary operating model and management process have produced these results. To the entire team, I once again extend my deepest thanks in heartfelt appreciation. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional insight on the financials. Mark? Mark Keim : Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss some additional details on our fourth quarter and full year performance, our strong balance sheet and our 2023 guidance. Beginning with our fourth quarter and full year results, our consolidated MCR for the fourth quarter was 88.3%, reflecting continued strong medical cost management. For the quarter, flu, RSV and COVID-related medical costs in total were largely in line with our expectations, but the impact varied by line of business, with Medicare being disproportionately impacted. Our full year consolidated MCR was 88%. This result was consistent with our expectations and was driven by the continued strong performance of our flagship Medicaid business. In Medicaid, our fourth quarter reported MCR was 87.3%. This strong performance was driven by effective medical cost management, and favorable retroactive premiums. The net effect of COVID in the quarter was a modest 30 basis points within our reported MCR. Our full year Medicaid MCR of 88% was at the low end of our long term target range and consistent with pre-pandemic levels. In Medicare, our fourth quarter reported MCR of 91.8% was driven by higher COVID, flu and the mix effect of our significant growth in MAPD. During the quarter, the net effect of COVID was 300 basis points within our reported MCR. Our full year Medicare MCR was 88.5% modestly above our long term target range and was similarly burdened by 300 basis points of net effect of COVID. In marketplace, our reported fourth quarter MCR was 93.8%. The MCR was impacted by normal seasonality and increased utilization in a handful of markets. The net effect of COVID was approximately 50 basis points within our reported MCR. In the quarter, we also settled some provider balances dating to prior years, which disproportionately impacted our Marketplace MCR by approximately 300 basis points. Our full year Marketplace MCR of 87.2% exceeded our long-term target range and includes approximately 120 basis points of net effective COVID, as well as approximately 130 basis points from the impact of a 2021 risk adjustment true-up recorded in the second quarter. Additional drivers of our strong fourth quarter and full year results include a 7.5% fourth quarter adjusted G&A ratio, which was in line with expected seasonal expenditures related to open enrollment and spending on community and charitable activities. Our full year adjusted G&A ratio improved year-over-year to 7.1% as we remain focused on delivering fixed cost leverage as we grow, even while making the appropriate investments to sustain our growth. Fourth quarter and full year results also feature higher net investment income as expected from recent increases in interest rates. Turning now to our balance sheet. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters, and we continue to be confident in our reserve position. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter was 47%, about three days lower sequentially. The decline was driven by the increased mix of LTSS claims, which settled more quickly, resulting from the closing of the AgeWell acquisition as well as an additional payment cycle in the quarter. Our capital foundation remains strong. Debt at the end of the quarter was 1.8 times trailing 12-month EBITDA, and our debt-to-total cap ratio was 44.9. On a net debt basis, net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.5 times and 40.7%, respectively. Our leverage remains low. All bond maturities are long dated on average eight years and our weighted average cost of debt fixed at just 4%. In the quarter, we harvested $268 million of subsidiary dividends and repurchased approximately 590,000 of our shares. Parent company cash at the end of the quarter was $375 million. With substantial incremental debt capacity, cash on hand and strong cash flow to the parent, we have ample dry powder to drive our organic and inorganic growth strategies. 2022 full year operating cash flow was lower compared to the prior year, primarily due to the cash settlement in 2022 of large prior year marketplace risk adjustment and Medicaid risk corridor payments. Normalizing for the timing of these payments, 2022 operating cash flow was $1.6 billion. Turning now to our 2023 guidance, beginning with membership. In Medicaid, we expect organic growth, the midyear inception of the Iowa contract and membership from our My Choice Wisconsin acquisition to be largely offset by the second quarter resumption of redeterminations. We expect this to result in 2023 year-end membership of approximately 4.7 million members. In Medicare, based on our performance in the annual enrollment period, we expect to begin the year with 160,000 members and continue to grow during the year, ending 2023 with total membership of approximately 175,000 members. Our Medicare membership growth for 2023 is expected to be evenly split between our D-SNP and MAPD products. In Marketplace, based on open enrollment, we expect to begin 2023 with approximately 290,000 members, reflecting our pricing strategy to achieve target margins in this business for 2023. Accounting for a limited SEP and normal levels of attrition through the year. We expect to end 2023 with approximately 230,000 members. We continue to treat any marketplace membership from Medicaid redeterminations as upside to these projections. Moving on to premium revenue. Our 2023 premium revenue guidance is $32 billion, representing 4% growth from 2022 Our revenue guidance is comprised of several items, $1.2 billion for the full year impact of AgeWell and expected revenue from the My Choice Wisconsin acquisition when closed. $1 billion of organic growth in Medicaid and Medicare and $900 million for the midyear inception of our new Iowa contract. Several offsetting items include : $600 million for the known pharmacy carve-outs, $500 million for the impact of the resumption of redeterminations beginning in April, $600 million for the lower Marketplace membership, and $300 million in 2022 pass-through revenue that we don't expect to recur in 2023. Turning to earnings guidance. We expect full year adjusted earnings to be at least $19.75 per share. Our EPS guidance reflects the realization of approximately $1 per share of 2022 embedded earnings, consisting of the contribution from acquisitions and a portion of the net effect of COVID partially offset by the impact of redeterminations. To this, we add $1.50 for the underlying organic growth plus several operating levers, including our real estate reduction strategy, the full year effect of our PBM contract and net investment income, partially offset by the negative impact of known pharmacy carve-outs. These drivers combined to deliver core earnings per share of at least $20.40. Recognizing the one-time non-recurring implementation costs in 2023 for our new contract wins that we now project to be $0.65 per share, yields our 2023 earnings per share guidance of at least $19.75. Moving on to select P&L guidance metrics. We expect our consolidated medical care ratio to be approximately 88%, consistent with our 2022 results. We expect our adjusted G&A ratio to fall slightly to 7%, even while absorbing the impact of the one-time non-recurring implementation costs for our new contract wins. This reflects disciplined cost management and fixed cost leverage from our revenue growth. Excluding the new contract implementation costs, our adjusted G&A ratio would have improved year-over-year to 6.8%. The effective tax rate is expected to be 25.3%, adjusted after-tax margin is expected to be 3.5%, well within our long-term target range. Weighted average share count is expected to be 58.1 million shares. And we expect our quarterly adjusted earnings per share profile to be fairly flat over the year, with the first two quarters of the year at roughly $5 each. As Joe mentioned, our 2023 new store embedded earnings power is at least $4 per share and is comprised of at least $3.50 from our three recent new contract wins, and $0.50 per share for AgeWell and My Choice Wisconsin acquisitions, achieving full accretion. We continue to carry approximately $2 for COVID era risk corridors providing additional potential upside to be at least $4 of new store growth embedded earnings. I'll now turn the call over to Joe for some concluding remarks. Joe? Joe Zubretsky : Thanks, Mark. In looking back over the past five years, we pause briefly to reflect on our company's accomplishments. We won $5 billion in new Medicaid awards over the period and defended all of our existing contracts. We acquired $10 billion in profitable revenue. In short, we doubled the revenue base. We have produced industry-leading margins in our core products, averaging 4% to 5% on a pretax basis. The top line growth and margin expansion allowed us to grow earnings per share from a loss in 2017 to nearly $20 per share in 2023 guidance. We've ascended to Fortune 125 status and were promoted into the S&P 500. We have a pure-play government managed care franchise to grow and build on. We only take this retrospective journey to express our excitement, enthusiasm and energy for the next five years. There are so many more opportunities to continue to grow and expand our franchise. As we say here at the company, reaching milestones is not a cost for celebration, but a cause for consternation as reaching one merely marks the point in time to set new aspirational goals. We plan to share our view over the next five years with you at an Investor Day later this year. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Josh Raskin : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. So the guidance for the 2023 MLR is overall flat. I assume it would be fair to expect the Marketplace MLR to be down meaningfully. But even just based on size, probably not a meaning contributor. Would it be fair to assume that the Medicaid MLR embedded in there is actually up? And maybe you could help quantify some of those absolute changes by segment and maybe specifically how reterminations are impacting your view of the Medicaid MLR? Joe Zubretsky : Sure, Josh. That is correct. We are going to produce a consolidated medical care ratio of 88% in each of 2022 and our guidance through 2023. We get there in a slightly different way year-over-year. Obviously, with our repositioning of the Marketplace business, we're projecting that with pricing actions, with the small silver and stable strategy, we will bring that MCR down within the long-term range at the high end of the long-term range of 78% to 80%. Medicare slightly underperformed our long-term target for the year because of 300 basis points of pressure. We now project that Medicare will come into its long-term target range, perhaps in the middle of that range. And yes, because we have been outperforming our long-term guidance range in Medicaid, 80% of our revenue, we are forecasting a reversion to the mean, considering all the impacts of flu, RSV, COVID, any potential nuanced reaction to retermination process puts us in the middle of the range at 88.5%, our long-term range being 88% to 89%. So that's the line of business tail of the tape for MCR projection into 2023. Mark Keim : That's right, Joe. Josh, it's Mark. Total guidance at 88% MLR. As Joe mentioned, each of the segments I've got pretty much right in the middle of long-term guidance. So think of Marketplace, 79% to 80%; Medicare Advantage 87.5% and Medicaid, call it, 88 5%. For weightings, pretty similar to what we had this year, probably about 5% marketplace, which is a little bit smaller as the portfolio about 13% Medicare Advantage, about 82% in Medicaid. So you round all that out. The only other thing I'd say is, we finished full year Medicaid in 2022 at an 88%. We're obviously in our guidance saying an 88.5% roughly for Medicaid. So that's an additional 50 basis points for new stores, who knows redetermination or just general conservatism, but that's how I'm thinking about the MLRs there. Josh Raskin : Okay. So no specific explicit redetermination, but sort of capturing it in that 50 basis points of general conservatism? Mark Keim : That's the way to think about it, Josh. Josh Raskin : Perfect. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe I'll just -- I know it's a smaller portion, but on the public exchanges or marketplace, your decline in enrollment. I know you've been talking about for a while that for '23, you would price for margin. Are you surprised -- was that decline in enrollment consistent with what you thought. It seems like, as we hear from your peers and everyone, there's quite a divergence in and what people are seeing. Any comment you can make on what you saw in benefits as this market become very sensitive to slight changes because some people are showing huge growth, others are not. And I'm just trying to put that in perspective. And then you're saying you do not have any assumption that you'll pick up lives on the public exchanges as redeterminations play out. Can you give us a sense of what that might look like possibly if you're not baking in the guidance? And do you have any view? I know there's been a lot of discussion about how those redetermined lives when they come on the public exchanges might affect the risk pool, I'm assuming that net-net, because you don't have anything in there, you think it would be a positive for you, even if maybe they're a little sicker than your average person on the exchanges today. But anyway, just fleshing out some of the public exchange commentary. Joe Zubretsky : Sure, A.J. The membership results starting the year with 290,000 members, finishing the year with 230,000 members. We'll aggregate to about $1.6 billion in premium for the year. And that was fully in line with our expectations with respect to our pricing strategy. Look, we're allocators of capital and this business has shown that due to the instability of the risk pool by the introduction of the special enrollment period and other factors that it does have some inherent volatility. There also has been some irrational pricing over the past couple of years. So pushing the pause button and going silver stable, in small was exactly the right approach and the business for 2023 has landed in a good place for us to achieve our mid-single digit margin target, if we conclude that the risk pool has stabilized due to the lack of government movement of the risk pool rules, pricing is rational, we likely would conclude to allocate more capital to this line of business and grow it again. Mark, anything to add? Mark Keim : Yeah, A.J., good morning. As Joe mentioned, starting off with 290,000 members going down, I think, to 230,000 by the end of the year, really exactly what we expected. We put 9% rate into the market this year. If you look at the mix of what we got and the pricing we put into the market, so with 9% not surprised with that result at all. Now you asked about the MLRs. To the extent we pick up folks from redetermination, I'm expecting the MLRs coming over to be quite consistent with our underwriting range. Those folks will not be new to health insurance. They will not be coming in with pent-up demand. So I'm expecting a pretty stable pool as they come over. A.J. Rice: Okay. That\u2019s great. Thanks a lot. Operator : The next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions on the numbers side. First, on Medicaid membership, can you give us the membership? I know it's going to be flat. You talked about some new growth of acquisitions offsetting redeterminations. Can you give us those numbers in terms of what you're expecting there for each of those buckets? And then, how should we think about redeterminations from '23 into 2024 in your mind? And then on the reserves, I've heard you talk about DCP and I saw in the release that you mentioned a bunch of payments in the quarter. I did go back and take a look at fourth quarter paid versus fourth quarter kind of reserved or medical costs, last year to this year, it didn't look like there was a significant change in paid claims as a percentage of total in the fourth quarter of this year versus last year. So hoping you could just flesh that out a little bit in terms of what you were seeing there? Thanks. Mark Keim : Great. So a bunch there, Justin. Let me start with Medicaid. We ended 2022 with about 4.7 million members. As Joe mentioned earlier, I expect to conclude 2023 with about the same. We'll go in there. The moving pieces is redetermination probably around 300,000 or more coming off, but replaced by a number of good guys. For example, the Iowa acquisition about 200,000 members, the My Choice acquisition about 40,000 members; California fee-for-service coming in a bunch of offsets there. So pretty much flat over the year from a membership perspective. On the DCP, you're talking about and the payments related to medical expenses. In general, when I look at DCP and I look at our reserving, our purchase is the same. It's the same actuarial on leadership, same approach to development and our triangles, the same external audit review. So I feel very confident about our process. What has changed is, in the fourth quarter, we added AgeWell, which brought in the LTSS membership, that membership adjudicates a whole lot faster and pays a whole lot faster. We also had the extra payment cycle. So when I look at the fourth quarter, we actually paid more than what I recorded in medical expense. So that's driving a bunch of that DCP decline from 50 to 47. Hope that helps. Justin Lake : Right. Thanks for the color. Operator : The next question comes from Calvin Sternick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Calvin Sternick : Hey. Good morning. Just a quick follow-up. It sounded like you said if the marketplace was stable, you could look to grow it again next year. And that just sounds a little different than some of your previous comments where you kind of let the membership float up and down year-to-year. I just want to understand that in the context of your overall strategy. Is the growth outlook for Marketplace just based on your evaluation in the market this year, and that's something that you look to reevaluate next year or are you saying that you kind of want to grow Marketplace going forward. Joe Zubretsky : Now in that line of business, we are going to look at the stability of the risk pool, chasing and moving target with respect to the government rules around who's eligible, how many people are eligible when they become eligible has thrown in the past couple of years, that risk pool into what we consider to be a period of instability. If that should stabilize and now we're convinced that the pricing that's put into the market by us and the competitors is rational. I've always said, we could put this business back into the growth category, allocate more capital to it and grow it, but grow it in a very responsible and measured way. So I'm not sure, we're seeing anything new, but right now, keep it small silver and stable until we conclude that we should allocate more capital to it and grow it in a very measured and responsible way. And that's been our strategy all along. Calvin Sternick : Got it. And I know you're not forecasting growth from Marketplace from redeterminations. But just curious if you have a sense for what the recapture rate was pre-COVID. So when someone got redetermined in Medicaid, how long did they typically go uninsured before they got coverage elsewhere? And I guess how often are you able to recapture some of those members in a Molina Marketplace product? Joe Zubretsky : The way I would answer that is one of the reasons we haven't forecasted to capture is because the data around how it's worked in the past is pretty imprecise. I mean we could create all the models with various scenarios. We decided not to forecast it. We have operational protocols in place with member outreach in the states that allow that through text, phone and mail to help members reestablish eligibility and if determined that they are ineligible for Medicaid but eligible for a highly subsidized Marketplace product, we will then warm transfer them over to our distribution channels for Marketplace and capture them in that manner. But because this is uncharted waters, it's just -- it's never been done before, we chose not to create a model and forecast it, but consider it as upside to our membership growth. Calvin Sternick : All right. Great. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I guess, I'll use my question just to try to fill out a couple of the other modeling elements for 2023. Just interested if you could give us your thoughts on operating cash flow, and then also investment income and interest expense for 2023? Mark Keim : Sure. Scott, it's Mark. So when I think about operating cash flow, I focus on cash flow at the parent because that's what restocks my firepower. I expect to take pretty meaningful dividends. I've got a few acquisitions to pay for this year and I've got some growth organically that I need to fund. So all told, at the parent, I expect to have more than $0.5 billion by the end of the year. Interest expense, you can model going forward, you know my bonds, you know my rates. On interest income, that's a wildcard, right? We're all guessing on that. finishing 2022 with about $7.5 billion of cash and investments. I expect across 2023 to end the year with about $7 billion of cash and investments, including everything at the subs. Now the wildcard here is, what kind of an interest rate to put on that, right? We've had one Fed raise already this year. If you look at the Fed Funds future rates. We've got maybe one more raise coming and maybe one or two declines back half of the year. So how do I think about that across the year? Not quite sure. I think you could model any place between mid and high 2s on a yield basis and come out with a pretty credible interest forecast there. Scott Fidel : Okay. Thanks. And just one quick follow-up question. Just on the M&A side, how you're thinking about the pipeline and sort of the pacing of engagement in 2023. Obviously, you've got some significant installations of new business in flight. So interested in how you're thinking about layering in M&A as well. Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : Yeah, Scott. Even with the significant backlog of both integrations on in-flight acquisitions and new contract implementations and our new wins, we have continued to aggressively pursue the M&A pipeline. And nothing has really changed with respect to the appetite of single state operators not for profit plans to listen to the Molina story and want to be part of this larger enterprise, where they continue -- they can continue to fulfill their local mission and have access to the broad and deep capabilities and financial resources that we bring. So it's a great story and nothing has really changed there. I would say, given the size of the pipeline and the level of activity and the maturity of some of the opportunities, we feel very confident in some announcements here in 2023. Scott Fidel : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Hall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Michael Hall : Hi. Thank you. Just wanted to touch on the marketplace, again and just ask about like what happened in '22. So at the beginning of the year, you're expecting 79% MLR, but Q2 I think there was a large miss really full year expectation to 84%. And then this past quarter, even excluding the 300 bps of scheduling past provided balances still ended up higher than expected. Now you're at 87% to end the year. So I thought pricing was more disciplined than you went through this major recalibration of your metal peers to cover. So I would have expected more MLR stability than what we saw. Could you walk us through about like what happened with Marketplace and why the large divergent from initial expectations? Joe Zubretsky : Sure. And as we said in our prepared remarks, even with the exclusion of the one-time items, the COVID-related items the risk adjustment true-up in the middle of the year. And in the fourth quarter, the significant settlement of some prior year provider balances, we did not meet our expectations in marketplace. The continuing MLR drag from that significant SEP membership that renewed into the current year, continued to drag on the MLR. We now believe that the special enrollment period might produce this year 3,000 to 4,000 a month, where it was producing 20,000 to 25,000 a month and the height of the SEP gives the risk full more stability, and we're priced for it. So we did not meet our expectations even while ignoring the one-time items. But this year, we feel that with the high-single digit price increase, low-single digit trend, good visibility on our renewal membership to make sure we get appropriate risk scores that we're in good shape to hit mid-single digit margins in 2023. Operator : The next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Stephen Baxter : Yeah. Hi. Thanks. I wanted to follow up on the Medicaid MLR question. I appreciate the color on your expectations. How should we think about Medicaid MLR? I know you probably want to guide it too close quarterly, but do you expect to generally operate around that 88.5 level kind of consistently throughout the year or is there any slope to that line that we should maybe be thinking about? And then just to kind of put a bow on the question on the DCP for the AgeWell business, could you just give us a sense of what the DCPs would look like on a stand-alone basis, we can try to put that into context? Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : So I'll turn it to Mark. But yes, given the mix of the business has changed and many of the dynamics of the businesses have changed, the seasonal patterns of how MCRs emerge, has changed slightly over time. So I'll turn it to Mark to give you a view of how Medicaid might perform over the quarters. Mark Keim : Yeah. I'm expecting pretty flat. And if you look historically, we've run pretty consistently on Medicaid, certainly more so than Medicare in the marketplace. So I think you can model that one pretty straight line. On the AgeWell, we'll follow up with you offline. I don't have a discrete number on that. I know what it does to my weighted average, but we can follow-up with that. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Nathan Rich : Great. Thanks for the questions. You mentioned the $2 per share of earnings power from the three remaining COVID risk corridors. What's the time line to potentially realize these earnings? And then just more generally on state rates, how do you think the process plays out for states potentially revisiting rates as redeterminations occur and potential changes to the underlying risk pools take place. How do you think the states are going to approach that? Thank you. Joe Zubretsky : Sure, Nathan. We actually consciously separated the two major components of our embedded earnings because one of them is, in our view, entirely controllable, harvesting the $4 of earning our target margins on latent contracts and M&A is something we have a proven track record of doing. We separated that from the $2 of lingering COVID era corridors because eliminating them is outside our control. They were put in place during COVID. They're articulated as being related to COVID. There are three remaining two that matter. Washington, State of Washington and Mississippi, and we believe over time that they will either be compressed or eliminated, but we don't control that. With respect to rates, I would say that states, our customers and their actuaries are vary at least aware of the potential for an acuity shift somewhere due to the redetermination process. And the fact that they're aware of it. And we would -- and if or not, we will certainly make them aware if we experience it, leads us to believe that if there is a significant shift in acuity somewhere in the book of business that the actuarial soundest principle will prevail, and we'll be able to have a productive conversation about that. Mark Keim : Nathan, just to build on that, a number of our states were in 19 on Medicaid now. A number of our states have told us, if and when there's any impact from that redetermination, they are quite willing to reopen that to revisit it. So we feel good between that commitment and our advocacy efforts that the rates will move as they need to. Nathan Rich : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Gary Taylor with Cowen. Please go ahead. Gary Taylor : Hey. Good morning, guys. Most of my questions are answered, just two quick ones. One on the exchange membership loss driven by repricing. Is there any particular state you'd point out in your footprint or is that pretty evenly distributed that rate increase in the enrollment decline? And then just secondly, because 99% of all the incoming investor angst about Molina is around redetermination risk and potential impact on margins, et cetera. Just wondered if you could share with us any additional work you've done on low utilizers, zero utilizers, people, populations most likely to be redetermined, et cetera? I know you've shared some of that before and just anything else you might add to provide some comfort around your Medicaid, MLR guide would be helpful, I think. Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : Gary, I'll answer your second question first and then kick it to Mark for more detail. But the analysis that we've shared with you and investors is the same one, because we're looking at all the data. And there's so many theoretical arguments of why an acuity shift could happen. We focus on the numbers and the data. We look at members greater than one year duration, less than one year duration. We look at the MLR for members with less than one year duration, greater than one year duration. We look at members with zero to 25% MLRs. We look at the lapse rate of membership, which hasn't gone to zero. There still is a disenrollment rate that occurs in the Medicaid book. So we look at all that data, and it leads us to believe that while maybe somewhere there could be a slight acuity shift probably in the expansion book, not in the tenant book or the ABD book, but manageable and will be easy to deal with, particularly because the states are aware of it and we believe we'll have a productive rate discussion if and when there is a shift in acuity that makes the rates actually unsound. Mark? Mark Keim : Yes. So we update this analysis every quarter and the conclusion is really not changing. Joe mentioned a couple of the data points, the folks with us more than one year versus less the folks in the zero to 25% MCR bucket. Expansion, we're seeing a little bit of an increase, but across the board is not much. Remember, expansion is just 30% of our total revenue. The other data point that some folks have been talking about is coordination of benefits or duplication of benefits, do we see any increase in that population. Once again, not really, a little bit of an expansion. So across the board, is there something here? Maybe, but it's really minimal. So again, not expecting much of an impact here to the extent it plays out. Now I refer back to the previous question, where I think the states are quite amenable to revisiting it. On your first question, are we fairly even distributed on our Marketplace? Yeah. I don't see any real estate density in any outliers of one state being disproportionately dense. We've got pretty good distribution across our 14 states here. Gary Taylor : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : Great. Thanks. Good morning. So just a follow-up question on the exchange business. Here you mentioned the shift from bronze to silver has been the right move the better margin profile demonstrates that. So I know you talked about this more a year ago, but just remind us again why bronze has proven to be more tricky from your point of view. Has that gotten better or worse currently versus a year ago? What would have to change within that just to give you comfort to reexplore bronze on a greater level? Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : Steven, it's really an anomaly of the product design, not anything that we design, but the way the product is priced from an industry perspective, where one thing I can point to that is absolute fact is for the same member in bronze and silver with the same acuity level, the same services and therefore, the same HCCs, the risk score produces less revenue in bronze than it does in silver. And there are other aspects of it that make it just slightly less attractive. Mark? Mark Keim : Yeah. I'd say a couple of things just building on Joe's thoughts. It's a lower actuarial value product. Sometimes that attracts folks that don't think they're going to use a product but do, the way the rules are set up, the balance on risk adjustment is a whole lot better on gold and silver than it is on bronze. And finally, just at a lower revenue load, it becomes slightly less attractive from a G&A perspective and some of our other operating ratios. You take those things all together, it's more volatile, and we just don't see the margins there. Steven Valiquette : Okay. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Mr. Hill, I'm not sure, some trouble hearing you. All right, your connection may have gone down. We'll go to the next questioner, who's Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. One quick clarification question before I jump into the real question. The $6 of embedded earnings, it wasn't 100% clear to me. Is that in addition to the $0.65 coming back or is that $0.55 in the 3.50? Mark Keim : So the total of $6 is $4 of new store EPS; $2 of net effective COVID; and there are two other items in there that cancel each other out. There's the implementation costs, which are a bad guy in the current year of $0.65, but go away next year, right? And then, there's also the remaining hit on redetermination of expecting in 2024, which is also $0.65. So those two cancel each other out, you're looking at $4 and $2. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. So that $6 on the current guidance is not on the 20, 40 earnings power number. Mark Keim : Correct. Kevin Fischbeck : All right. And then I just want to go back one more time to the redeterminations because it's interesting because on the one hand, it sounds like you thought about redeterminations as a potential MLR pressure in your Medicaid MLR guidance, which is different, I think, than how you've talked about it in the past, but then throughout the call, you've kind of dismissed it as a potential pressure to MLR. So just trying to understand a little bit finer like are you saying you've put it in, but you think it's set most 10 basis points or something like that, something kind of immaterial or how exactly are you thinking about and what exactly are you including in this year's guidance? And then I guess to build on that, if it is a pressure this year, would you expect that pressure to be higher or lower next year? Higher because more members are being determined or lower because states have more time to adjust rates? Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : Kevin, I'll give it to Mark. We are not and haven't parsed all the specific trend factors that go into an MCR forecast for the Medicaid business, but we have been outperforming even the low end of our range, a range which produces best-in-class industry margins and we just think it's not prudent to continue to forecast that we'll continue to outperform the outperforming that range. So we call it a reversion to the mean. We're forecasting an 88.5% for the Medicaid business, which is right in the middle of the range, citing medical cost pressures due to any of the items like flu, COVID, RSV and then, of course, any pressure that might be experienced with an acuity shift knowing that a significant acuity shift will probably be absorbed by retroactive rate increases. So I'm not going to parse it, but that's why we were somewhat conservative in forecasting the middle of our long-term Medicaid range rather than continuing to forecast that we outperform it. Mark Keim : That's exactly right. So we finished last year at an 88% for the year. Our guidance anticipates an 88.5%, and we don't attribute any specific basis points to a driver. But in general, reversion to the mean flu, RSV, number of different things we could think about in there. Don't forget, we also have some new stores coming along, Iowa, the acquisition of My Choice Wisconsin. In general, just a little bit of conservatism, reversion to the mean, not attributing any basis points specifically to redetermination. But look, we've all had the conversation enough. We're acknowledging that, that's something that's potentially in there. in our reversion to the mean. Now you also mentioned maybe what happens next year. So to the extent any of this starts to manifest it will largely be back-end loaded in the year, just given the way redetermination is going to play out. I think that gives all of us a lot of time to anticipate it but just as much work with our state partners to make sure that rates in the concept of actuarial soundness anticipate the same thing. Kevin Fischbeck : All right. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : Hi, guys. Is it working better this time around? Operator : Yes. Thank you, sir. Joseph Zubretsky : Yes, we hear you. George Hill : Okay. Thank you, guys. Joe, and I think you kind of just touched on this in the last answer, but my question was around the $0.65 in implementation costs in 2023. I guess could you kind of break out the buckets that they're typically going to fall into. And again, this was just commented on, but I assume no part of that repeats in '24 that all goes away and there's no part of that cost structure that's durable. Joe Zubretsky : I'll answer the last part of your question first. On the cost for -- obviously for Iowa, California and Nebraska, yes, those once spent should not repeat themselves. But as I said many times, and not tongue in cheek, I hope in the future, we continue to have one-time implementation costs on new contract wins can have a better spend than that. There are technology implementations, which are fixed in nature. And then, of course, you need to hire the people that are going to service these businesses in advance of the revenue stream, which is a major part of the $0.65 implementation cost. Mark? Mark Keim : Right. I'll just build on that. So if you think about the $0.65, the way I think about it, about a third of it is IT, sort of a fixed component and about two-thirds of it is staffing, mostly highly variable, right? We have to staff up ahead of day one membership. So that's the way to think about it. It obviously, it comes to us ahead of when we start booking revenue. So I wouldn't say that it goes away specifically. What it does is it goes into the anticipated margin once we run these businesses. We've talked about $3.50 of same-store -- of new store embedded earnings here. That $3.50 is, of course, after operating costs. The reason we have $0.65 is we're not booking revenue yet. So $0.65, one-third, fixed; two-thirds variable, that's the right way to think about it. Joe Zubretsky : Yeah. It goes away as a one-time item, but it becomes consumed into the run rate of the new contracts is the way to think about it. George Hill : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our last question comes from David Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead. David Windley : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I hope you can hear me. I have a few small ones. In your discussion around, the state's willingness to revisit these rates, as redetermination progresses. Do you have a sense of the urgency around that? Meaning, will they do that on a relatively short notice or will they want to have that discussion in the next rate cycle or after the majority of the redetermination in their state has played out. Joe Zubretsky : We don't know that specifically. All we know is that they're aware of the theoretical possibility that there's an acuity shift in the book, likely, could result in prospective rate changes, but also retrospective rate changes. And it all has to be data driven. So to the point on timing, the data has to mature. The claims have to complete, the data has to be analyzed and then reasonable people will get in a room and figure out whether a rate change is necessary. So I would look at it, I don't know whether they're going to wait until the entire redetermination process is complete. But it's got to be data driven. So the data has to complete, and it has to be verifiable and actionable. Mark Keim : And David, it's Mark. The fact that a number of these states have also led with this thought, unprompted to me is encouraging that will be somewhat proactive here. David Windley : Okay. That's interesting. Second question is any thoughts on trends post-COVID in medical costs that are more durable and maybe distinction as to whether you're betting on that or not. So thinking about things like lower ER utilization and that type of things. Joe Zubretsky : No, I think the medical trends we've experienced late in the year seem to have fallen into a nice pattern of, lack of volatility and understanding what COVID is actually costing sort of like on a run rate basis. It almost evolved into a $40 million to $50 million monthly run rate. And as long as it stays stable, as long as we know where the COVID infection rate is spiking, it certainly is -- the inpatient cost is certainly the more costly component, and that certainly hits the Medicare more than the Medicaid book. We have pretty good line of sight into what those services will cost us. But late in the year, it sort of settled into a nice pattern of $40 million to $50 million a month. David Windley : And then lastly, Joe, I appreciate your comments on your -- it sounds like your M&A pipeline is still very robust. Does the cost of capital change in the environment impact cadence or appetite? Has it impacted expected valuation on the seller side? Joe Zubretsky : No, not at all. We obviously measure the returns against our weighted average cost of capital. Obviously, we're earning more on the free cash now than we were before. So there's less of a drag. But no, it hasn't caused any change in momentum in terms of the appetite for counterparties in the market to want to speak to us and think about becoming part of the Molina enterprise. David Windley : Great. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session and Molina Healthcare's fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation there will an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Krocheski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Joe Krocheski : Good morning, and welcome to Molina Healthcare's first quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our first quarter earnings was distributed after the market close yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that remarks made are as of today, Thursday, April 27, 2023. It has not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. On this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our first quarter 2023 press release. During our call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our 2023 guidance, Medicaid redeterminations, our recent RFP awards and related revenue growth, our acquisitions and M&A activity, our long-term growth strategy and our embedded earnings power and margins. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report filed with the SEC, as well as the risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. Lastly, we want to invite you to attend our 2023 Investor Day meeting scheduled for Monday, May 15, where we will share more about our future growth plans and longer term strategy. Details for the event can be found in our Investor Relations website. I will now turn the call over to Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe? Joe Zubretsky : Thank you, Joe, and good morning. Today, we will provide updates on our financial results for the first quarter 2023, our full year 2023 guidance in the context of our first quarter results and our growth initiatives and our strategy for sustaining profitable growth. Let me start with the first quarter highlights. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of $5.81 or 19% year-over-year growth. Total premium revenues at $7.9 billion were as expected, representing a 5% increase over the prior year. Our 87.1% consolidated MCR in the first quarter demonstrates continued strong operating performance. We produced a 5.5% adjusted pretax margin, 4.1% after-tax, a very strong result that is above the high-end of our long-term target range. In the first quarter, we continued to generate excellent margins in our Medicaid business with a medical care ratio of 88.4%. This result was in line with our guidance and long-term target range. Our portfolio of 19 state contracts in 2023 growing to 21 states in 2024, provides earnings [balanced] (ph) and diversification related to rate setting and contract reprocurements. Actuarially sound rates prevail, as the rate-setting process continues to capture a credible medical cost baseline with forward trend and benefit changes and core medical cost trends remained stable and well-controlled. In Medicare, our reported MCR was 88%, which is at the high-end of our long-term target range as a result of driving growth into high acuity low-income consumer segment. In Marketplace, we ended the quarter with 271,000 members. Our Marketplace business is appropriately sized in the overall portfolio, given the inherent volatility of that risk pool. Our first quarter Marketplace MCR was 68.6%, significantly below full year expectations even when considering seasonal patterns. This result reflects the successful implementation of our pricing, metallic mix and membership continuity strategy to restore this business to mid-single digit target margins. In summary, 2023 is off to a very strong start. Medicaid, our flagship business representing over 80% of revenue continues to produce strong predictable operating results and cash flows. Our high acuity Medicare niche serving low income members continues to grow organically and Marketplace is now well positioned to achieve target margins in 2023. Turning now to our 2023 guidance. Based on our strong start to the year, we are increasing our full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share guidance to no less than $20.25 or 30% growth year-over-year, even after absorbing $0.75 of one-time implementation costs for new contract wins. We have deliberately reframed from increasing our guidance beyond the first quarter outperformance as we continue to apply appropriate conservatism to our forecast. We believe this conservative discipline is appropriate for several reasons. First, we would not project our significant first quarter Marketplace outperformance to be repeated for the balance of the year. Second, we are not forecasting short-term interest rates to remain at their current levels. Third, as a general matter at this early-stage in the year, it is prudent to anticipate potential medical cost variations. And fourth, and lastly, we do not believe the acuity shift due to redeterminations will have a significant net margin impact, but there is the potential for some sporadic and isolated shifts in acuity. If that were to be the case, there are significant mitigants to any potential impact. These mitigants include a commensurate mix effect premium benefit, experienced rebate and minimum MLR offsets in certain states, and of course, actuarially sound rate adjustments, both retrospective and prospective. That being said, we believe that any potential shift in Medicaid member acuity that could increase medical costs for 2023 is captured in our 88.5% Medicaid MCR guidance for the year. Turning now to an update on our strategy for sustaining profitable growth. Building on our momentum from last year, we are off to a strong start in 2023. At the end of January, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission posted its intent to award our Texas Health Plan, a contract for all our existing eight service areas in the state. Given the continuity of coverage in these service areas and strong brand loyalty, we expect to see continued market share gains and revenue upside in Texas. In March, we announced that our Indiana Health plan was awarded a four year contract to provide managed long-term services and supports. We believe this contract will commence in mid-2024. As one of four managed care organizations in the program, we expect to serve approximately 33,000 members, resulting in annual premium revenue of approximately $1 billion. With the addition of the Indiana LTSS win, our five recent state RFP wins driving within $5 billion in incremental revenue, with a portion included in our 2023 guidance, but most emerging in our 2024 outlook and achieving full run rate in 2025. Based on known building blocks, we now have line of sight to $36 billion of premium revenue in 2024 or 13% growth before additional strategic initiatives. Our new store embedded earnings are now $4.50 per share, providing meaningful visibility into our future earnings growth potential. We see an additional $2 per share of embedded earnings upside if and when the several remaining COVID era corridors are eliminated. Our acquisition pipeline remains replete with actionable opportunities. While the timing of transactions remains inherently difficult to predict, the strength of our pipeline and our track record of success give us confidence in our ability to drive further growth from this important element of our growth strategy. The company's performance continues to validate our long-term strategy, and its value creation potential. Our strategy is sound and it's working. We are delivering topline growth, both organically and with accretive acquisitions, while sustaining industry leading margins. Our model is clear and proven. We will grow organically in our existing footprint. We will win new state contracts and sign new acquisitions, building clear visibility to new store revenues and their related embedded earnings. We will harvest the embedded earnings and include them in our guidance as the contracts incept and the acquisitions closed, all while adding yet additional new revenue streams to our forward outlook. I look-forward to sharing more about our future growth plans and longer-term strategy at our Investor Meeting on May 15th. As is our hallmark style, we will provide you with our detailed playbook for achieving our growth targets and maintaining industry-leading margins. We will not only [declare those] (ph) but also show you with transparency and specificity, how we will achieve them. Our May 15th Investor Day session is appropriately titled, sustaining profitable growth, the next wave. With that I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials. Mark? Mark Keim : Thanks, Joe, and good morning everyone. This morning I will discuss some additional details of our first quarter performance. I'll then turn to the balance sheet and some thoughts on our 2023 guidance. Beginning with some detailed commentary on our first-quarter results, our consolidated MCR for the first-quarter was 87.1%, reflecting continued strong medical cost management in each of our segments. In Medicaid, our reported MCR was 88.4%, a strong result that was in-line with our expectations and long-term target. During the quarter, flu, RSV and COVID related medical costs were minimal. The major medical cost categories were largely in-line with our expectation and normal quarter-to-quarter trend fluctuations. In the quarter, our Medicaid results were burdened with the prior-period premium adjustments. Absent those adjustments, our MCR was at the low-end of our long-term target range. In Medicare, our reported MCR was 88%, also within our long-term target range. During the quarter, we saw sharply lower flu and a continuing decline of COVID related costs, somewhat offset by the impact from continued growth in our D-SNP and MAPD products. In Marketplace, our reported MCR was 68.6%. This strong result reflects our pricing strategy to return this business to target margins, as well as seasonal patterns, which favored the first-half of the year. Recall, our pricing strategy increased our premium yield by approximately 9% this year and with approximately three quarters of our book in renewing members and two-thirds [indiscernible] metallic products, our risk scores should be optimally valued. We feel well-positioned to achieve our Mid-single digit target margins in this business for the year. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 7.2% which includes new business implementation spending ahead of the new contract wins, incepting in July and next year. Turning now to our balance sheet. Our capital foundation remains strong. We harvested $100 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter and our quarter-end parent company cash balance was $283 million. Debt at the end of the quarter was unchanged and just 1.7 times trailing 12 months EBITDA with debt to cap ratio at 42.3%. Net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.5 times and 39.3%, respectively, reflecting our low leverage position and ample cash and capital capacity for additional growth and investments. Turning to reserves, our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters, and we continue to be confident in the strength of our reserve position. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter was one day higher sequentially at 48 days of medical cost expense. Prior year development was favorable in the quarter demonstrating the integrity of our actuarial and reserving practices. I would note that the reported favorable prior year development, includes the release of margins on the prior year reserves, which is reestablished in the current quarter. And remaining P&L impact was largely absorbed by prior year minimum MLRs and experienced rebates. Finally, a few comments on guidance. We increased our 2023 adjusted earnings guidance by $0.50 to at least $20.25 per share. This increase is driven by first-quarter performance above our expectations. Partially offset by additional new store implementation costs for our recently-announced Indiana LTSS win and some general early in the year conservativism. We projected a little more than half of this year's earnings in the first two quarters. As Joe mentioned, our new-store embedded earnings in 2023 is now expected to be $4.50 per share comprised of two components : $4 per share, up from previously reported $3.50 for our recent new contract wins in California, Iowa, Nebraska and now including our new Indiana LTSS contract, plus $0.50 per share for the AgeWell and My Choice Wisconsin acquisitions achieving their full run-rate accretion. We continue to carry approximately $2 per share for COVID era risk corridors, providing additional potential upside to the $4.50 of new-store embedded earnings. Within our guidance, our outlook on the resumption of redeterminations and the impact on our business is unchanged. Through March closing, we estimate we gained approximately 800,000 members organically since the start of the pandemic. We continue to expect to retain roughly half of the members gained. We expect the premium impact to be approximately $1.6 billion and that portfolio average margins the earnings impact to be approximately $1 per share. Due to the timing of when members dis-enrolled, we are projecting one-third of the premium and earnings impact to emerge in 2023 with the remainder mostly in 2024. Given that redetermination and disenrollment have just begun on April 1st in only one of our markets, we are unable to share additional data driven insights. However, we remain comfortable with our outlook on margins as we expect numerous items to minimize any potential trend impact from redetermination. First, as discussed in past quarters, our internal membership cohort analysis indicates limited acuity shift potential from several perspectives. Second, the mix effect of impacted membership cohorts dampens the impact. To be clear, redetermination likely effects lower PMPM members. So any cost pressure would be muted by the weighted average of continuing higher premium PMPM members. Third, the gradual rate of dis enrollment over the course of 2023 into 2024 dilutes any ultimate impact ahead of normal rate cycle adjustments. Fourth, the remaining COVID era risk corridors and pre-existing experienced rebate mechanisms as minimum MLR's in many states provides a cushion to absorb potential adverse trend development should it emerge. And finally, rate adjustments, both on-cycle and off-cycle prospective or retrospective will countering emerging trends as states honor their commitments for actuarially sound rates. In summary, we are very pleased with our first-quarter performance in each of our segments and our increased full-year earnings guidance. We look forward to sharing more about our growth strategy and compelling value creation story at our May 15th Investor Day. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Josh Raskin : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Appreciate the comments you just made, Mark, on the re-verification impact and that you'll keep 400,000 of the 800,000 lives that you gained since the start of the pandemic. But of the 400,000 that get redetermined, can you just update us on your views on how many you think end-up in -- of those Medicaid lives end-up choosing exchanges? And then how granular can you be in terms of assisting your specific re-verified members to find in exchanges. For example, can you target specific populations or even specific individuals in terms of trying to get them to choose exchange products? Thanks. Mark Keim : Great, thanks for the questions, Josh. I'll take the second one first. The states have a lot of different protocols and policies about how we can interact with members ahead of redetermination. The good news is, they're giving us the list of at risk members months ahead of time, which is very helpful to reach-out to them, interact with them, see if we can re-verify them or in many cases, put them into our Marketplace product if appropriate. Now in the cases where members are being redetermined, they lose their eligibility, which we're estimating is about 50%. I don't know that I had great insights on specifically where they'll go. And Josh, it's complicated, because what we see is some will get re-verified, lose eligibility and move right into another product, others may go uninsured for a few months and then eventually wind-up in one of those products. So I don't have good estimates on that. The only other thing I'll remind you of is, we didn't put any upside on retaining redetermined members in our Marketplace outlook. So anything that we pick up through redetermination is upside to our Marketplace outlook. Josh Raskin : Perfect, thanks. Mark Keim : You bet. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Stephen Baxter at Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Stephen Baxter : Yes. Hi, thanks for the question. I appreciate that you're thinking on redeterminations hasn't really changed. Over the past few months, though, we have seen a lot of states come out with their own projections on membership losses. It does seem like these estimates would generally skew towards lower levels of retention and 50%. You're assuming -- I assume you spend time talking to the states about their expectations. I'm curious what you think is the key difference between what they're assuming and what you think will play out? Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : Stephen, our analysis is bottoms up state-by-state. And of course, we are in active discussions with our state-based customers and helping them manage the 90 million people nationwide and we're going to go through the redetermination process. As Mark had mentioned, many of the states have various protocols and different protocols on how interactive we can be. But we are in very active discussions with our state-based customers. They have given us a list of what they consider at risk members, meaning, members that will likely have to go through a reverification process. And from everything we've learned since this all started months ago and now has only started in one state actually in the month of April, we stand pretty firm that our 800,000 member increase during the pandemic will decrease by 50% and end up at 400,000. Mark Keim : And just to put a point on what Joe said, Stephen, maybe what you're reacting to is some of the at-risk member data points. The states are putting those out specifically so that managed care organizations can reach out to those members and whether its eligibility issues or verification issues, interact with those members to minimize it. So the list of at-risk is certainly bigger than the list of folks that will actually lose eligibility. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, our next question today comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks, good morning. A couple of things. One, Medicare Advantage, you talked about mix pushing you to the higher end of the MLR range there. What is the long-term MLR range you expect for Medicare Advantage? And can you give us a little color on the mix of business and why it's pushing it towards the higher end? And then lastly, just a number question on investment income, what is assumed in your guidance for investment income this year? Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : Justin, on the MLRs for Medicare, we continue to hold firm on our long-term forecast of between 87% and 88%. And I would just summarize it by saying, the faster we grow, it would push you towards the higher end of that range because the members we yet -- are not yet risk-scored, they're not yet into care management programs. And it takes a while for that a year or two for that MLR to settle back into our target range. So if we're growing nicely, which we are today at greater than 10% a year, it will push the MLR up into the higher end of that range, and we're very comfortable with that. On investment income, sure, short-term interest rates are very high currently. As our guidance suggested, we do not forecast them to remain at this level. I will remind you that half of our investable base is locked in at two to three year duration in short-term bonds. But the other half is entirely floating, it's cash and it's floating at short-term rates. And Mark and his team were, I think, appropriately cautious in projecting those rates to decline for the balance of the year. Mark Keim : Yes, that's exactly right, Joe. The things to think about there is the investable balance will decline over the year from where it is and about $8.2 billion right now. It will decline as we pay down previous year corridors, minimum MLRs, things like that. Second, we're mostly in cash, which means we're instantly responsive to any cuts in rates. And when I look at the Fed funds outlook, most folks are baking in maybe another raise in the second quarter, but likely two cuts in the back half of the year. So we are cautious in our outlook. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, our next question today from comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Nathan Rich : Great, thanks for the question. I wanted to ask on the Marketplace business. How much of the outperformance, do you see as sustainable? It sounded like it was mainly driven by pricing and I guess, helped by strong retention. I guess, do you have an updated view of where MCR will land for the year? And then enrollment was a little bit lower than we had expected. I just wanted to get your updated thoughts on if 230,000 members by year-end is still the right target. Joe Zubretsky : Nathan, it's Joe. Our strategy is working. The strategy to reallocate capital to businesses that add less inherent volatility like Medicare and Medicaid and to keep this at about 5% of the portfolio keeping it small, 5% of the portfolio, keeping its silver with two-thirds of our members in silver products and keeping it stable, 75% of the members renewing. Not only as is projected toward our target mid-single digit pretax target margins, but probably with less inherent volatility. So we're really pleased with that. The first quarter MCR had some seasonality aspects to it, and we did outperform. I would say that our guidance includes something closer to the bottom end of our long term range of 78% to 80%, perhaps a little lower than that. But particularly that more of the business was bronze than we had projected and bronze has higher deductibles. The seasonality tilt is a little steeper than we originally projected. We're on target for the bottom end of our 78% to 80% long-term target range for the full year. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Scott Fidel at Stephens. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I was hoping to get some of your analysis on the final 2024 MA rates and then on the risk model as well in terms of what your estimated -- your MA rate impact will be? And then maybe give us some insights just into how you're thinking about the impact of the risk model to your particular membership base, which is heavily weighted, obviously, towards D-SNPs? Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : Scott, it's Joe. Yes, there are a variety of factors, regulatory factors that have been introduced in the past number of months that have caused folks in the Medicare Advantage business to think differently about the earnings trajectory. First, let me remind everyone that Medicare is only 15% of our total book. Also remind you that of that Medicare book, half of it are the MMP demonstrations. Now while MMP demonstrations aren't totally insulated from these industry dynamics, they do not have STARS scores. They're not subject to the rate notice, although rates come in a different way, 40% of that revenue is actually Medicaid driven and not Medicare-driven. So I wouldn't say we're insulated from it, but with half the book being in MMP, which is not responsive to those various rate type actions. We're pretty well insulated. But it does relate to our D-SNP book. We believe that our product is competitive. It is replete with value-added benefits. Many of these factors affected the entire market. So, if we have to pull back on value-added benefits to keep the product at zero premium and competitive, we think we can do so. I think we're well positioned for a couple of other good years in Medicare. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Michael Hall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Michael Hall : Thank you. Just quickly first on Medicaid revenue PMPM looks like it was roughly flat year-to-year, which may have driven your Medicaid revenue to be slightly below the street this quarter. I am having a tough time just thinking of what could have driven this, especially given higher LTSS mix, which presumably would have increased the blended PMPM. So any color you could provide there? And then on your comments about redeterminations, not expecting the acuity shift to have net margin impact, but could see some strategic cases. And I know you mentioned, Joe, that the shift in acuity captured in your current 88.5% guide. But comments today do sound a bit more optimistic. Is it fair to say what you've learned since fourth quarter about the acuity of your at-risk redetermined lives might be more incrementally positive? Joe Zubretsky : I'm going to take the second part of the question first and kick it to Mark for the analysis of Medicaid revenue. No, we know very little more than we knew at the fourth quarter. Only one state has actually started the redetermination process, and it's a very small state for us. Now we believe that our cohort analysis, which analyzes various aspects of durational acuity, how many members do you have greater than a year or less than a year. How many members do you have that have zero 25% MCR. What's your lapse rate. Didn't go to zero, it decreased, but members were terminating during the pandemic. What's your coordination of benefits rates. It's up slightly, but not a lot. So the data does not suggest that there's a huge shift of members, durational acuity members, and we start there. Second, all we did was mention the mitigants that if something should occur somewhere in one of our markets. There's premium adjustments, premium mix will help us if we're deep into a rebate mechanism or a minimum MLR in that market, that will be the first cushion for a potential effect. And then, of course, you're into the rate cycle. And we believe -- not we believe, we know that the state and CMS have been in active discussions about what could potentially happen and they are not only amenable, but they're very supportive of potential retrospective or prospective rate actions. So that's our point of view. It really hasn't changed from the fourth quarter because we know very little more today than we do at that point. Mark Keim : And Michael, it's Mark. Let me just take the first question on Medicaid, not sure what your model was, but the Medicaid revenue for me came in right about on expectation. But there's things that can move it a little up, a little down quarter-to-quarter, which might be driving some of what you're seeing. Certainly, mix changes quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year. Retro premiums, which are driven by a number of different items, retro membership updates, things like that certainly drive variations in revenues. And don't forget when we book corridors, minimum MLRs or any form of experience rebates, those run through the revenue line as well. So you put those things together, my hunch is, that's what explains what you're seeing. But overall, I think we're pretty close to just out everybody's model on first quarter. Operator : And our next question today comes from George Hill at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : Yes. Good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the question. Joe, one of your competitors talked about kind of getting enhanced from the states as they start to go through the redetermination process. Would just be interested to hear kind of like what kind of data that you guys are having access to as this process begins to kick off and kind of how that impacts your early thoughts about 2024? Joe Zubretsky : Sure. I'll send to Mark. But for the most part, what we're getting from states is what we're calling members at risk, members that will have to go through some form of process, either specifically or on an [indiscernible] basis to be redetermined. Mark, you're closer to the situation. Mark Keim : Absolutely. So we started one state in April, but the vast majority of my states won't actually go through eligibility and redetermination until June and July. So, we're fairly back-end loaded here, which is why we're a little limited on data just at the moment. We've got one state. But as Joe mentioned, the way this works is long before a member would actually get redetermined or lose eligibility, they go on in at-risk list. And the states define at-risk in two ways. One, places where they have some data that suggests the member will lose eligibility, some data point that suggests that or just verification failures where they can't reach that number. They're giving us those lists months in advance. So I\u2019m mostly back ended for June and July. But in many cases, I have a list of those members already. We can start reaching out to them, contacting them through all of our different channels long in advance. Now that data is not particularly helpful on what will happen because the whole point of that data is to preempt some of the people that shouldn't lose coverage. So, it's very helpful on us retaining members, but it's not helpful in saying from a data perspective, how many will we lose or what would the economic impact be, if any? Now the real data points on real stairs and levers don't happen until redetermination actually occurs. And again, for us, that's just one state so far. The states published files 834s, 820s, which let us know specifically who's coming and going, who the stairs and levers are. And we're way too early to have real insights on that given one state so far. George Hill : Okay. So maybe just a quick follow-up to simplify this is, what you guys largely have now is kind of the medical data and the claims data on all these members. You guys don't have the economic and eligibility data, and it's kind of the eligibility. Like, I'm trying to figure out what is the data like, what changes from a data access perspective that kind of better informs what you guys see? And it sounds like it's really kind of like the eligibility data and the at-risk list. Joe Zubretsky : Yes. Just because the member has been identified as someone who will have to go through the reeligibility process. And by the way, that data is very immature. It's not in hundreds of thousands of members. It's tens of thousands of members. We can extrapolate very little from that. And so, it's way too early to make -- draw any conclusions from the early at-risk member data that we've seen. It will build over time. And as we have insights and we report quarters, we'll fill you in on where we are. George Hill : Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from A.J. Rice of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Albert Rice : Hi, everybody. Thanks for the question. Two, I guess, really. One, when you think about the flow of information as it comes in both on the -- your enrollment assumptions and whether they're correct and then also on the risk pool itself and what's happening there when you think about claims experience, et cetera. How do you see incremental information developing? When -- at what point over the next 12 months do you think you'll have a pretty good sense that, hey, our estimates are pretty accurate on enrollment, our estimates about the risk pool are pretty accurate. I guess I'm trying to figure out, was that a fourth quarter of this year? Is it a first half of next year? Any thoughts on that? And then you've mentioned a couple of times some protection from being in a Medicaid corridor payable position. I guess, I'd love to get a little bit more color, if there is any, on how extensive that is across your Medicaid book rather and how much protection you think that provides on kind of deterioration in the risk pools? Joe Zubretsky : A.J., I'll answer the second first. We talked about risk-sharing corridors during the pandemic that were introduced in a dozen of our states as a direct result of the pandemic. Reminding everyone that pre-pandemic, dating all the way back to earlier in the decade, various types of mechanisms existed in 17 of our states, MLR floors experience rebates. Those have always been in place. And because of our performance, we routinely pay into them. The better you perform, the more you'll pay into them. And the more you pay into them, the greater the cushion should your fortunes reverse later in the year. So we're not going to go through the actual numbers because it actually matters where you're in the money, in what state and it's way too difficult to project anything other than we have routinely paid into these mechanisms, the experience rebates, we did last year in 2022 because we were very profitable. Reminding you, we still have best-in-class industry margins even after having paid into them. And yes, should an inflection occur later in the year for whatever reason, redetermination for any other reason, these payables act as the first cushion to financial performance. Mark, do you want to take the question about what quarter we'll have visibility? We've talked about that a lot. And it\u2019s might be third, more likely fourth. Mark Keim : Absolutely. I mentioned that the majority of our states don't actually redetermine members. That is, take members off the roles until June and July. So we, across our 18 Medicaid states are very back-end loaded. That means the true data development won't really start to accrue until Q3 and Q4. Now remember, these states have a year to go through this process. Some will move a little faster, some will move a little bit slower. But picture on a weighted average going down over time, this data will start to develop, and I think we'll have a meaningful discussion in Q3 and Q4 on real data-driven insights. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Calvin Sternick with JPMorgan. Calvin Sternick : Yes. Thank for the question. Sort of a follow-up to A.J's . In terms of the potential mitigants. As you go through the discussions of the states as they finalize their implementation plans for determinations, do you have a sense for how they're thinking about making the rate adjustments are most looking at it doing it on a retrospective basis? Or is it mostly perspective? And then do you have a sense for what level of margin degradation needs to occur before the state sort of look to step in there? And any color on whether like how many we could look to do it off-cycle versus how many would look to do on-cycle adjustments? Thanks. A - Joe Zubretsky Calvin, I'll start and I'll kick it to Mark for a more detailed discussion. But the timing of how the redetermination process is unfolding couldn't actually be better timed with the timing of our rate cycles. We have a September 1, we have an October 1. But for the most part, we're January 1. In early discussions with many of our states, they're willing to have discussions about both retrospective rate adjustments and prospective rate adjustments, and they're willing to have a conversation on-cycle and off-cycle. The conversations have been very productive. I can't speculate as to how much of an acuity shift would actually cause them to take action, but their actuarial resources, CMS's actuarial resources are all very much geared to engaging in a conversation both on a retrospective and prospective basis in both on and off cycle. As this information unfolds, we will be smack dab in the middle of our January 1 traditional rate cycle, which couldn't be better timing. Mark Keim : Hi, Calvin, it's Mark. Joe got it exactly right. The majority of our states, the calendar year is the same as the fiscal year. Which means, if data is developing in the third and fourth quarters it positions you very well for an on-cycle rate review. Now at least two of our states have already committed to a mid-cycle rate review as well, anticipating that at least we should look at the data together. So we feel good about that. Overall, I think on the topic of retrospective and prospective, states have been really open to both. And in many cases, I think they're waiting for the initial gimps of data to decide on-cycle, off-cycle, retrospective, prospective, how they might do that. But the general signal from the states is very much of a partnership here to work through this rate cycle. Operator : And our next question today comes from Sarah James of Cantor. Please go ahead. Sarah, your line is muted perhaps. Sarah James : Yes. Sorry about that. So I wanted to follow-up on the timings. As far as your discussions with state goes, they have 12 months to get through the redetermination, but some of the states have been vocal about staffing issues on teams that would be evaluating that. So as you talk to them, what kind of color are they giving you on how ratable or front-end loaded their process might be? And then just to follow-up on your earlier bronze mix shift in the exchanges. Has that influenced how you accrue for risk adjusters versus past years, given the shift in metal tier? Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : Sarah, I'll answer the last question first, and Mark and I will tag team the question on timing. With respect to bronze, we've limited bronze to four markets, three markets require us to sell it. In Florida, we actually want to sell it because it's a bronze market, and it's very profitable. We sold more in Florida this year, which accounts for most of the -- the shift to bronze wasn't significant, but it was entirely accounted for our Florida sales efforts, and it's very profitable in Florida. It does add to the seasonality tilt since Bronze has higher deductibles. But we're very comfortable on the profitability of the bronze book because most of the states where we actually want to sell and try to sell. Mark, on the other question? Mark Keim : Yes. Hi, Sarah. On your about timing, don't forget the states have 12 months from the end of the PHE to complete redetermination, the PHE ends in May. So even though some states began redetermination in April, the clock starts ticking as of May. So 12 months from May, I think there may be a difference between states intentions of how fast they move versus how fast they actually move. And we're seeing a little bit of that in some of our partnership discussions with them. So we'll obviously be accommodative of any schedule they want to roll out. But staffing issues, resource issues, it will be interesting to see how the next 13 months here play out. Joe Zubretsky : I'll give you the editorial comment. We have not projected it to take longer than we said originally. But I expect that it would. And states are going to be -- most states will be very careful to make sure they don't strain members without coverage if they're in fact eligible. We're not projecting it to take longer, but it could be more back-end loaded than we have projected. Sarah James : Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. For the first quarter itself, Mark, you mentioned that the major medical cost categories were largely in line with your expectations. So I guess just trying to reconcile this with some of the strong inpatient and surgical volume growth trends coming out of the public hospital companies this quarter. Just curious if you can just remind us what magnitude you may have anticipated this and factor that into the guidance across the different books of business as far as any sort of extraordinary growth in inpatient? Medicaid and Medicare MLRs were still both up year-over-year in 1Q 2023 versus 1Q 2022 despite the MLR beat versus the street. But again, just curious how much elevated inpatient costs maybe not have been a factor in the MLR dynamics in the first quarter? Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : Steven, our medical cost trends were completely in line with expectations, flat in Medicaid, 2% in Medicare, 3% in Marketplace year-over-year. We saw an increase in utilization, but it's important to note when we say that to make the companion statement that expensive inpatient stays were down but less expensive. Our outpatient services, ambulatory services were up. So [indiscernible] were up, but the intensity of service and the types of services really reduce unit costs. Our trends were completely in line. We saw nothing in the quarter that wasn't expected or anticipated, trends are completely in line with what we assumed in pricing. Mark Keim : Right. On inpatient, I hear you on the data points, but we're seeing just something just a little bit different. Lower surgical and obviously, lower COVID as the effects of the pandemic are diminishing, but also increasingly outpatient type of care for COVID cases. So as Joe mentioned, a fairly light trend for the first quarter. Joe Zubretsky : COVID has gone from almost being completely and inpatient phenomenon to almost completely a laboratory phenomenon. You trade one inpatient -- the cost of one inpatient stay for one lab test all the time. So it has changed dramatically year-over-year, some pandemic-related and some just trend-related. Steven Valiquette : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, our last question today comes from Gary Taylor at Cowen. Please go ahead. Gary Taylor : Hi, good morning. Two quick ones for me. Just one, I think I missed just a little bit of the opening comment on exchange. So I just want to go back to that for a second. I know that trended better than you thought, but I didn't hear if that change where you thought you would land on your original 78% to 80% for the year. And then I just also wondered if anything you've seen so far makes you change your outlook on whether you have a receivable or a payable accrual in exchange for 2023? Joe Zubretsky : Gary, our fast start to the year and the exchanges at 68.6% gives us great comfort that we'll operate at or below the low end of our long-term target range of 78% to 80% on the MCR. A little bit more seasonality due to the heavier than expected bronze mix, but completely in line with expectations. We are on target to hit our mid-single digit margin target for the year. With respect to the risk pool, the risk pool has really stabilized. A lot of the irresponsible pricing is out of the market. We have our arms around special enrollment. It's coming in at much lower levels due to the cutoff at 150% of FPL. So we have our arms around that. The risk pool has somewhat stabilized, which gives us really good visibility, not only into the acuity of our members, given that 75% of them are renewed members, but also two-thirds of them are in a silver product, which gives us the opportunity to optimize the value of a risk floor. We're in good shape on the marketplace so far, and we expect to operate at the low end of our long-term target range for the full year. Mark Keim : The only thing I'd add to that is, with risk adjustment, the correlation between medical cost experience and risk adjustment at this point is pretty tight. So if the risk pool changes a little bit, I'm expecting effectively a hedge from our performance on risk adjustment. Gary Taylor : And then just last quick one, if I could. You mentioned the prior period premium adjustments in Medicaid having impact on Medicaid MLR. I mean, presumably, there is a pretax earnings headwind that you bore in the quarter for that as well? Joe Zubretsky : Yes. Given where we performed -- I'm sorry, we couldn't hear the first part of your, you're referring to Medicaid, correct? Gary Taylor : Medicaid, yes. Joe Zubretsky : Thank you. Yes. As I said, 17 of our states have always for a long period of time had mechanisms, experienced rebate mechanisms and minimum MLR mechanisms, which are set at pretty low levels, which allow you to actually earn excellent margins as we have been even though we still have been paying into these mechanisms. So yes, as I mentioned, last year, we had a good year and paid into them. And in the first quarter, again, good first quarter. We also paid into them in the first quarter. We don't disclose how much, but it's a routine part of the business. It's part of the overall earnings trajectory of how we think about the business and the first quarter was business as usual, excellent margins in Medicaid and still paid into these corridors and rabates. Gary Taylor : Thank you Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session and today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. And have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note, today\u2019s event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Krocheski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Joe Krocheski : Good morning, and welcome to Molina Healthcare\u2019s second quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining me today are Molina\u2019s President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our second quarter earnings was distributed after the market closed yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that the remarks made are as of today, Thursday, July 27, 2023, and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. On this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our second quarter 2023 earnings release. During our call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our 2023 guidance, Medicaid redeterminations, our recent RFP awards and related revenue growth, our recent acquisitions and M&A activity, our long-term growth strategy and our embedded earnings power and margins. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report filed with the SEC as well as the risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe? Joe Zubretsky : Thank you, Joe, and good morning. Today we will provide updates on our financial results for the second quarter 2023, our full year 2023 guidance in the context of our second quarter results, Medicaid redeterminations and our growth initiatives, and our strategy for sustaining profitable growth, including our 2024 premium revenue growth drivers. Let me begin with the second quarter highlights. Last night, we\u2019ve reported adjusted earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of $5.65, or 24% year-over-year growth on $8 billion of premium revenue. Our 87.5% consolidated MCR in the second quarter demonstrates continued strong operating performance in medical cost management and was at the low end of our long-term target range. We produced a 5.3% adjusted pre-tax margin or 3.9% after tax, a very strong result that was above the high end of our long-term target range. Year-to-date, our consolidated MCR is 87.3% and our adjusted pre-tax margin is 5.4%. We note that investment income produced higher than expected results due to the increasing yield environment. In the second quarter, we continued to generate excellent margins in our Medicaid business with an MCR of 88.3%, bringing our year-to-date MCR to 88.4%. This result was in line with our full year guidance and long-term target range. As expected, the medical cost impact of redeterminations was negligible, although we are in the very early stages of that process. In Medicare, our reported MCR was 89.2%, which is above the high end of our long-term target range. We are experiencing some cost, pressure and professional and outpatient services and higher first year MCRs associated with growth. With a year-to-date Medicare MCR of 88.6%, the book of business continues to produce attractive margins. In Marketplace, our reported MCR was 73.7% for the quarter and 71.2% year-to-date. This result reflects the successful implementation of our pricing, metallic mix, and membership continuity strategies to restore this business to mid-single-digit target margins. In summary, our second quarter results built on our strong start to the year. Medicaid, our flagship business representing over 80% of revenue continues to produce strong, predictable operating results and cash flows. Our high acuity Medicare niche serving low-income members continues to grow organically and our Marketplace business is now well positioned to achieve target margins. Turning now to our 2023 guidance. Based on our strong second quarter results, we are increasing our full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.50 per share to at least $20.75 or 16% growth year-over-year. Consistent with our long-term earnings per share growth target of 15% to 18%. Our earnings per share guidance is now $1 per diluted share higher than our initial guidance issued in February. Our pre-tax margins are exceeding our expectations. The Medicaid MCR is right on target, Medicare slightly behind target and marketplace substantially better. We note that these target ratios produce best in industry margins. Then of course, the interest rate environment has allowed us to produce investment income that has provided a short term earnings boost. Now, a few words on Medicaid redeterminations. During the second quarter, all but four of our states began disenrolling members with the remaining states initiating disenrollments on July 1. Our Medicaid membership declined by 93,000 members during the quarter, which was well within our expectations. Although the medical cost profile of members who have left is slightly more favorable than the portfolio average, the impact on our overall Medicaid MCR was negligible and within our expectations. We continued our outreach to members to minimize procedural disenrollment. We also continued to work with our state partners to ensure rates remain actuarially sound to account for any potential shifts in acuity. To date, all of our states have expressed a willingness to adjust rates as needed to account for any changes in acuity or trend. Mark will provide more color on redetermination during his remarks. Turning now to an update on our growth strategy. At our May Investor conference, we laid out our strategy for sustaining profitable growth. We plan to grow premiums at 13% to 15% through a combination of growth in our current footprint, strategic initiatives and accretive acquisitions. We also established a 2026 premium revenue target of $46 billion. We already have significant momentum toward achieving these growth goals. Our five recent state RFP wins drive more than $5 billion in incremental premium revenue. A portion of this incremental revenue is included in our 2023 guidance attributable to our Iowa contract, which we successfully launched July 1 with approximately 200,000 members consistent with our expectations. Most of the remainder emerges in our 2024 revenue outlook and a small component in 2025. We are also executing on the M&A component of our growth strategy consistent with our strategy of acquiring capitated government-sponsored assets. In June, we announced the acquisition of Bright HealthCare\u2019s California Medicare Business for an attractive purchase price of approximately 28% of expected 2023 premium revenue. Bright\u2019s Medicare business serves approximately 125,000 MAPD, D-SNP and C-SNP members across 23 counties in California with 60% membership overlap with Molina\u2019s Medicaid footprint. We expect the transaction to add approximately $1.8 billion of premium revenue, deliver $1 of adjusted earnings per share at full run rate, but no earnings contribution in the first full year of ownership. We expect the transaction to close by the first quarter of 2024. The closing is subject to the solvency and continued operation as a going concern of Bright Health Group throughout the pre-closing period, as well as federal and state regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. Based on known building blocks, we now have line of sight to approximately $38 billion of premium revenue in 2024 or 19% growth before executing on additional strategic initiatives. Our new store embedded earnings is now $5.50 per share, providing meaningful visibility into our future earnings growth potential. We see additional embedded earnings upside if and when the several remaining COVID era corridors are eliminated. Two short months ago at our Investor Day, we reaffirmed our long-term financial targets, the centerpiece of which is the long-term earnings per share annual growth rate of 15% to 18%. Our performance this quarter supports that outlook. The revenue base and new store earnings profile continue to build with highly accretive new contract wins and M&A. Our second quarter and year-to-date operating results provide a very solid earnings base off of which to grow, and we have seen nothing in the early stages of the Medicaid redetermination process that changes our view of the earnings trajectory of the business. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials. Mark? Mark Keim : Thanks, Joe, and good morning everyone. Today, I will discuss some additional details of our second quarter performance, the balance sheet, some thoughts on our 2023 guidance, including an update on redeterminations and our 2024 premium revenue outlook. Beginning with our second quarter results, our consolidated MCR for the second quarter was 87.5%, reflecting continued strong medical cost management. In Medicaid, our reported MCR was 88.3%, a strong result that was in line with our expectations and long-term target range. The major medical cost categories were largely in line with our expectation and normal quarter-to-quarter trend fluctuations and COVID-related costs have largely subsided. Second quarter Medicaid membership is down 93,000 from the first quarter, largely attributable to the expected initial impact of redeterminations. In Medicare our reported MCR was 89.2%, which is above our long-term target range. During the quarter, we saw increased utilization of outpatient and professional services, as well as the continuing expected impact from strong growth in our D-SNP and MAPD products, due to the normal lag in new member margins. We make note of two key dynamics of our year-to-date Medicare performance and implications for 2024 bids. First, our MMP block of business representing half of our Medicare premium is not tied to annual Medicare bid process. And second, we were conservative in our trend assumptions in our 2024 bid process. In Marketplace, our reported MCR was 73.7%. This strong result reflects our pricing strategy to return this business to target margins prior year risk adjustment true up benefiting the quarter, as well as normal seasonal patterns for utilization. We call our pricing strategy increased our premium yield by approximately 9% this year, and with three quarters of our book in renewing members and two-thirds in silver metallic products, our risk scores should be appropriately valued. We feel well positioned to achieve our mid-single-digit target margins in this business for the year. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 7.4% and includes the expected new business implementation spending, ahead of new contract wins incepting in July and next year. Turning now to our balance sheet. Our capital foundation remains strong. We harvested approximately $150 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter, and our parent company cash balance was approximately $0.5 a billion. We expect to fund the acquisition of Bright HealthCare\u2019s Medicare business in the first quarter of 2024 with cash on hand. Debt at the end of the quarter was unchanged at just 1.6 times trailing 12 month EBITDA with our debt to cap ratio at 40%. Net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.3 times and 35% reflecting our low leverage position and ample cash and capital capacity for additional growth and investment. Turning to reserves. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and we continue to be confident in the strength of our reserve position. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter was 47. Now some additional color on our 2023 guidance. We increased our 2023 adjusted earnings guidance by $0.50 to at least $20.75 per share. This increase is driven by second quarter operating and investment income performance above our expectations and higher expected investment income in the second half of the year, partially offset by some continued conservatism. As Joe mentioned, our current new store embedded earnings are $5.50 per share, comprised of $4 per share for our recent new contract wins in California, Iowa, Nebraska, and Indiana, plus a $1.50 [ph] per share for the acquisitions of AgeWell and My Choice Wisconsin and now the recently announced acquisition of Bright Health\u2019s Medicare business, all achieving their full run rate accretion. Elimination of the remaining COVID era with corridors would provide upside to the $5.50 of new store embedded earnings. Turning to redeterminations. While the redetermination process differs from state to state and is quite complex at this early stage, we have not observed any emerging trends that would change our membership or financial outlooks. We have built robust tracking and monitoring systems to maximize retention of members that meet the eligibility criteria and to also promptly understand any financial impacts of redeterminations. Some early observations include the following, starting with membership. Our outreach protocols have been successful in helping eligible members remain in the Medicaid program. Each state has implemented an ex parte membership renewal program from state to state. We see automatic re-enrollment rates through these ex parte programs ranging from 20% to 70% of members reviewed. Data suggests and states have verified that two-thirds of those disenrolled have been procedural rather than due to verification of ineligibility. Many of these members potentially remain fully Medicaid eligible and will have a high likelihood of reconnecting to the Medicaid program. Members have 90 days to 120 days to reconnect depending on state policies. Once reconnected, Medicaid coverage and premiums reinstate retroactively to the date of disenrollment. As we interact with members who lose eligibility, we seek to warm transfer them to our Marketplace team for potential enrollment in that product. This process is in its beginning stages. Turning to early observations on the financial impact of redeterminations. Terminated members have slightly lower medical costs than the portfolio average. However, these impacts are well within our expectations and our overall MCR outlook for the year. Of course, as trends emerge, we\u2019ll be working with our state partners to ensure rates reflect any impacts of redetermination either prospectively in the normal fiscal year rate cycle, off cycle or retrospectively if necessary. We are still in the early stages of the Medicaid redetermination process. States representing half of our Medicaid revenue just began the process in June, and states representing a third of our revenue are now initiating disenrollments in July. Based on our experience to date, our current outlook on the impact of redeterminations on our business remains consistent with our previously stated expectations. Through the end of the first quarter, we estimated we had gained approximately 800,000 Medicaid members organically since the start of the pandemic. We continued to expect to retain roughly half of the members gained with no assumption for marketplace recapture. We expect the premium impact of members disenrolling to be approximately $1.6 billion and at portfolio average margins, the earnings impact could be approximately a $1 per share, split one-third in 2023 and two-thirds in 2024. Lastly, some additional color on our 2024 premium revenue outlook. As Joe mentioned, we have line of sight to the building blocks that are expected to deliver approximately $38 billion in projected revenue in 2024 or 19% growth off our 2023 premium guidance of $32 billion. These building blocks include $1.1 billion of organic growth in our current footprint, plus $4 billion from our recent state contract wins and approximately $2.3 billion of acquisition related premium, consisting of the full year of My Choice Wisconsin and the recently announced California Medicare acquisition. Partially offsetting these growth drivers is $1.4 billion for the impact of redeterminations and known pharmacy carve-outs. In summary, we are very pleased with our second quarter performance and the momentum we have established toward achieving our growth targets.  This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s first question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Josh Raskin : Hi. Thanks. Appreciate all the color on the redeterminations. That\u2019s where I\u2019ll start. So could you just sort of speak to the discussions that you\u2019re having with the states? I know it\u2019s early and, four of them, you know, literally started this month, but just the conversations around rates and the impact from reverifications. You mentioned this slight mix shift that you\u2019re seeing, but could you just walk us through sort of the timing of potential rate adjustments and, how you think that plays out over time? And then is there a scenario where you can accrue higher rates based on discussions with the states, or are we going to need to see, you know, something in writing or something, formally passed at the state level before you can match, your rates to the change in acuity? Joe Zubretsky : Sure, Josh, I\u2019ll start and then I\u2019ll kick it to Mark for some color. First of all, the rate cycle in terms of the \u2013 our portfolio of states and how the rate cycles emerge actually couldn\u2019t be better positioned for how the redetermination process is going to unfold. 25% of our revenue has rates that renew between April and July, another 25% in the early fall and 50% on January 1, which gives us good opportunity to have great visibility into any potential impact of redeterminations and engage in those discussions with the state, which are already occurring. Now as you know, and I\u2019ll note the impact of acuity shifts is a normal rating criteria. Rating criteria includes a credible medical cost baseline, a trend off the baseline, benefit changes, plus or minus, and any potential acuity shift. So the fact that there\u2019s an acuity shift that\u2019s speculated to occur is actually part of the dialogue we\u2019re already having in the states. Now only a handful of states actually implemented rates between April and July. And I\u2019ll hand it over to Mark and he can give you some color on how those discussions went. Mark Keim : Hey, good morning Josh, so in July, we had five states representing about 10% of our revenue move into a new pricing cycle. About half of those states led with a proactive concession for what\u2019s going on with redetermination. The other half said, gee [ph], we have no data yet. But as data develops, we will either retro or mid-cycle make an adjustment. I think the overarching theme here, it is still so early, even here in late July to be looking at data-driven conclusions on redetermination. So all states have made the commitment that rates will be actuarially sound. And just about all states have said that mid-cycle, they\u2019ll make a mid-cycle adjustment or a retro adjustment to do a catch up if needed. And of course, we\u2019re in there talking with states that on normal rate cycles, we\u2019re getting things proactively where we need it. The other part of your question, our accounting policies require that we have specific documentation on rates \u2013 so we\u2019ll book them as they actually get confirmed by the states. Josh Raskin : Okay. So bottom line half are reflecting this already in some sort of perspective, we see it coming and the other half are going to make you whole at some point? Mark Keim : Of the states in July, that is correct. Josh Raskin : Yes. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Justin Lake at Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. Just a couple of questions on numbers. First, on the exchanges, can you tell us what the potential benefit was or what the actual benefit was to second quarter in terms of the 2022 final risk adjustment true-up. And then you said there that you\u2019re confident in mid-single-digit target margins your MLR looks to me like it\u2019s down 10% plus in the first and second quarter. Last year was flat. So it looks like you\u2019re on target to do well better than 5%. And am I missing something there? Or is the back half going to be kind of flat year-over-year on an MLR basis? Joe Zubretsky : Justin, it\u2019s Joe, I\u2019ll kick it to Mark for some color. The marketplace business, our strategy of keep it small, silver and stable, plus starring in a 9% price increase for the year clearly has us on track for mid-single-digit margins. In fact, our guidance contemplates about just over 6% pretax margin for the full year. Now to your question, while you\u2019re at 71.2% for the first half, that must mean you\u2019re at 85% for the second half. Two factors. One, we\u2019re taking on special enrollment period membership as the year goes on. So as the year progresses, more \u2013 higher mix of your membership is special enrollment membership, which carries a higher initial MLR and second, a greater proportion of our book is in higher deductible products, which makes the seasonality toward the back half more dramatic than it has been in the past. 71% first half, 85% second half, 78% for the year. Mark, do you want to talk about the drop? Mark Keim : Sure. I saw some analysts right on this topic. And some of them, we\u2019re throwing around some pretty big numbers as much as $66 million in positive development of December 31. Just on risk adjustment. And what those analysts miss is that about half of that benefit a little more is tied up in margins. For those of you that follow the accounting, when we hang up an actuarial liability for risk adjustment, we try to identify the liability, but we also book a margin associated with it in case we\u2019re wrong.  More to the point, we also book a margin for risk adjustment data validation or RADV. So that $66 potential benefit that folks were looking at is roughly cut in half, a little bit more than cut in half just by the retention of margins that don\u2019t fall to the bottom line. So then you\u2019re working with a little bit less than half of that. The other thing is, as these risk adjustment liabilities ultimately emerge, most of you are aware that a service called Wakeley [ph], which anonymously combines the inputs from everybody so that we can all get some insights as we move along. As a result, quarter-to-quarter, we\u2019re accruing and getting pretty dialed in on the ultimate liability. So this big number we\u2019re potentially talking about more than cut and half, and largely recognized in first quarter with a little bit in the second quarter. The only other thing I\u2019d say on the topic is this is normal development of risk adjustment kind of like IBNR, you always book it, but you expect it to roll off slightly favorable. So I wouldn\u2019t call this necessarily an anomaly, but it is spread between the first and second quarter, and it\u2019s in our numbers. Joe Zubretsky : And Justin, the last thing I would say on the topic, the return to mid-single-digit margins is really a result of that disciplined strategy that has worked and was executed perfectly for the year, 6% pretax for the full year not because of accounting adjustments, but because of the pricing discipline and the positioning of the book. Thank you. Justin Lake : That\u2019s great detail. Thanks. I\u2019ll \u2013 can I squeeze in one on investment income, Joe? What\u2019s the expectation for the full year? And then you said some of this is temporary. What should we think about normal investment income as we take out to 2026? Joe Zubretsky : Well, the way we look at it, first of all, your pick on the yield curve would determine for the most part, what that would look like. But what we try to remind folks is that of our $8 billion portfolio, half is in intermediate term securities where we won\u2019t be immediately responsible to interest rate changes and the other half is in cash, which will be immediately responsible to interest rate changes. That\u2019s the first fact. And make your yield curve pick for the rest of the year. We certainly are forecasting lower interest rates for the back half of the year on our cash balance, which also will be reduced between mid-year and end of the year due to the payment of some significant government payables that we need to get paid. Mark, any more color? Mark Keim : Joe\u2019s got it right. Half of the portfolio is in cash, we made close to 5% on that cash in the second quarter. Now if anybody\u2019s guess what the Fed does here. But our balance sheet is obviously very responsive to changes in Fed short-term rates. So 5% of that cash in the second quarter, but it\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess where these rates go third and fourth quarter. And as Joe mentioned, I\u2019m also forecasting a slight decline in cash balance as we pay out some payables and some other true-ups on our balance sheet. Justin Lake : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Stephen Baxter of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Stephen Baxter : Yes. Hey, I appreciate all the color on redeterminations and the procedural terminations that we\u2019re seeing out there. I guess I wanted to ask on the ex parte reviews and the success getting some members reenrolled. I\u2019d love to get a sense of what percentage of members getting terminated for procedural reasons are actually getting these ex parte reviews? Is it all members that are terminated for those reasons or some kind of subset, and then is your expectation that going forward, more of these reviews will be happening ahead of disenrollment \u2013 my understanding was that\u2019s generally how it\u2019s supposed to work. So I\u2019m surprised there\u2019s so much focus on it now occurring on the back end? Thank you. Joe Zubretsky : Let me just reframe the numbers, and I\u2019ll keep it to more. Our states have all have executed ex parte processes. The automatic renewal rates have ranged from 20% to 70%, which is actually quite high. On terminations, at least two-thirds of the terminations have been procedural, in some cases, up to 75%, which then means \u2013 and this is the important point on the procedural terminations. The number of reconnects of the members that will reconnect to the process within the 90- to 120-day grace period is actually expected to be quite high since the procedural termination rate was also quite high. Now we haven\u2019t seen that yet. Because this process just started. But we believe throughout the third quarter into the fourth, we\u2019re going to see significant reconnection activity, which will carry with it retroactive premium back to the initial data disenrollment. Mark, some color on the detail numbers? Mark Keim : Absolutely. So, ex parte, 20% to 70% of folks reviewed, just to be clear, that\u2019s in advance of any loss of membership. It\u2019s obviously a way to avoid folks losing their eligibility. There\u2019s a few resources out there that have published views on this 40% of members when they go through eligibility verification, are losing their eligibility. 60% are retaining eligibility. It\u2019s estimated that 50% of the 60% that retain get it through ex parte. So it\u2019s obviously very powerful, and CMS is encouraging states to step it up and do more ex parte.  Finally, as Joe mentioned, with two-thirds of the folks losing eligibility due to procedural reasons, this reconnects is really important. States are giving between 90 and 120 days for folks that lose eligibility to become aware of it, refile and get back on rolls. And if they do it within 90 to 120 days, their eligibility goes retro to the day they lost it. So we cover any claims in the interim, but also the premium for us goes retro back to the day they lost their eligibility. So very powerful on these reconnects. It\u2019s too early here in July for us to really see good data on reconnects. Most of our markets started in June, which means reconnects will just start coming in the next month or two, but a really powerful part of these enrollments. Stephen Baxter : Thanks. And just one quick follow-up, if I can. You mentioned the medical cost profile on the early disenrollment slightly favorable. I guess at this stage, how are you thinking about what that could look like for the reconnects. Thank you. Joe Zubretsky : Didn\u2019t get the last part of your question. But yes, on the members that are disenrolling the medical loss ratio is slightly more favorable than the portfolio average as expected. All contemplated within the 88.5% medical care ratio that we projected for the Medicaid business for the full year. We have seen nothing that suggests that we will not be able to hit that. And bear in mind, as we mentioned many other times, we also have, in many of our states, either a corridor or a minimum MLR, that carries with it a rather significant liability that we\u2019ve already recorded. Any medical cost inflection that happens in the back half of the year would be first absorbed by any corridor or minimum MLR liability before impacting our earnings. Mark? Mark Keim : Yes. Just to add to that, levers are slightly lower on MLR. We\u2019re expecting a lot of reconnects. How will reconnects come back on MLR? Well, there\u2019s a theory out there that reconnects many of them will only become aware of their need to reconnect because they have another claim or another doc visit, which means when they\u2019re coming back on, they may come with a claim but they were also likely to come with two to three months of premium revenue. So I\u2019m expecting pretty much a reversion to our mean as we see these reconnects and not a lot of volatility there. Stephen Baxter : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from A.J. Rice of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice: Hi everybody. Maybe just quickly, a couple of other aspects on the reverification process. I wonder you can see the states are publishing about how many members are getting disenrolled and how much of process disenrollments, I know you\u2019ve got a lot of outreach efforts. Is your own experience at this point different than the aggregate numbers we\u2019re seeing states? Are you able to engage more effectively? And I\u2019d also wonder I know these people engage with the health system, clinics, ERs and hospitals, pharmacies, et cetera. Do you have any data on how often a member engages with one of those locations that might end up being a catalyst to get renewed proactively? Joe Zubretsky : Well, I think on the first part of your question, first of all, state mix is really important. As we said in our prepared remarks, some states moved very aggressively initially, some states more cautiously. Some states, even \u2013 three of our states pause to let the administrative processes catch up with the flow of work. So I think state mix is really, really important as you judge any one company or any one state against sort of the market average. But we have seen nothing in the process that is outside of our expectations as we said. In terms of experience, we believe that a member will be reminded that they need to be on Medicaid if and when they have to go to the doctor or the emergency room or for some procedure. And as Mark said, maybe they\u2019ll come back with a claim, but they\u2019ll also come back with three or four months of retro premium. And that means the reversion to the mean to the portfolio average MCR is supported by that thesis. Mark Keim : A.J., the only other thing I\u2019d add is so many of our members are associated with family members and the incidence of one family member over the first couple of months needing medical care of some kind is high, which means the whole family gets renewed. So that\u2019s really a helpful fact as we think about these reconnects. A.J. Rice: Okay. And maybe just one follow-up on the \u2013 in your comments about the Bright Health acquisition. You mentioned that one; you\u2019ve got a solvency contingency in there. Is that related to the California plan you\u2019re buying? Or is that related to all of Bright Health and would there be any opportunity if there is any issues for you to support the California plan as you\u2019re waiting to get the regulatory approvals. Joe Zubretsky : No, that comment did not relate to the properties that we acquired \u2013 the properties we acquired will carry with it the amount of regulatory capital needed to run the plan. They are underperforming on margin, but really good line of sight to membership and revenue. That comment was really to state that the ongoing, going concern in the financial solvency of the parent company would obviously be critical to their ability to close the transaction. That\u2019s all that referred to. The properties have intact revenue and will be delivered with the required amount of capital. A.J. Rice: Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Calvin Sternick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Calvin Sternick : Yes. Thanks for the question. I know it\u2019s pretty early on the marketplace side of things, but just curious what kind of sort of trends you\u2019re seeing in terms of applications or enrollment in June and July that you can speak to? And then maybe just one follow-up on the Bright business, $1 per share of embedded earnings, no contribution next year, but can you give a sense for what sort of the time line is to reaching run rate on that business? Joe Zubretsky : Sure. I\u2019ll comment on the Bright acquisition first, and then we\u2019ll comment about the marketplace. This is the first Medicare acquisition we\u2019ve done. And Medicare, as works on an annual cycle for star ratings, for risk adjustment for rates, et cetera. The business had its own profit improvement plan in place. So the answer to your question is unknown at the time. How much profit improvement will that business have during the period time to close, we don\u2019t know. We are still confident that whatever is delivered to us at the time of closing, we will be able to get that to our target margins by the end of the second year. So when we said no earnings contribution early because we don\u2019t know exactly what the financial status, the margin status of the plan that will be delivered to us will be at the time of closing. So breakeven initially a minimum, and then we\u2019ll build a target margin in a two year period, and we\u2019re very confident in the $1 estimate that we\u2019ve given you. Mark Keim : On the marketplace question, you\u2019ll appreciate with special enrollment period, we\u2019re constantly picking up members month-to-month. That\u2019s a pretty routine phenomenon here. What will be different going forward is we\u2019ll start to pick up people that came off the Medicaid roles. Now we\u2019ve got good visibility in special enrollment period, month-to-month, who\u2019s coming in from Medicaid. Who\u2019s coming in from our Medicaid plans, who\u2019s coming in from other Medicaid plans, those numbers are still quite de minimis. Within our special enrollment period gains. But I would expect them to pick up dramatically in the months ahead. Remember, June is still the first month that most folks came off. So July, August, September, I would expect to see the marketplace numbers start to creep up. And we\u2019re able to track those who\u2019s coming from Medicaid and what plans. Joe Zubretsky : And just as a reminder, our membership forecast do not include the retention of Medicaid membership losses into our marketplace product. We didn\u2019t have a good estimate of what that would look like. We still don\u2019t \u2013 that would be upside to our membership projection. Calvin Sternick : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Actually just wanted to stick on the marketplace topic. And just interested in some of your early thoughts around positioning for 2024, given that if you\u2019re going to be back at target margins here this year, I know that you\u2019re very sensitive to managing the exposure on this business given how volatile it\u2019s been on the margin side, but it definitely looks like there\u2019s a pretty hardening pricing environment for individual and small group occurring \u2013 for 2024. And then if there is continued opportunity on the Catcher\u2019s Mitt side for [indiscernible] in 2024 as well. So really just sort of thinking about where your sort of philosophy is right now on that growth versus margin question for the exchanges in 2024. Joe Zubretsky : So Scott, our position on margin versus growth for Marketplace has not changed. We will position the business to earn mid-single-digit target margins and then allow it to grow at whatever rate can produce those margins, small, silver and stable. Now we\u2019ve just put out a revenue estimate for next year an outlook of $38 billion or 19% growth year-over-year, which includes only a modest amount, a moderate amount of projected growth in Marketplace. So we do plan to allocate more capital to Marketplace next year, but the growth we anticipate by the prices we filed will be measured and moderate. We actually don\u2019t need to allocate more capital to Marketplace in order to produce high-teens growth rates in the business, 19% premium growth year-over-year with only modest and moderate growth in Marketplace since Medicaid is doing so well. Scott Fidel : Okay. Got it. And then just for the follow-up. Interested if you could maybe just walk us through what\u2019s now factored into guidance for Medicare MLR for the back half of the year? And then just, I guess, obviously, you\u2019re not giving 2024 guidance here, but some early thoughts on some suggestions on how we should think about Medicare MLR sort of modeling for 2024. Obviously, it\u2019s a bit elevated this year and looking out to a pretty challenging rate environment next year and then you\u2019ve got the Bright asset coming online as well at breakeven. So just sort of your thinking here on sort of Medicare MLR, I guess, sort of trajectory in the back half and it\u2019s 2024. Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : Sure. For 2024, first of all, we are \u2013 we believe we were conservative in our trend estimates that we included in our Medicare bids for 2024. Second point is, recall, only about half our business actually relies on the Medicare bidding process. The other half is the MMP business, where we get rates that are not tied to that process. When it comes to star ratings and risk adjustment and all those other features and factors, again, the fact that we\u2019re in the half of the business is MNP is helpful to that process. And when it comes to stars, we have plenty of value-added benefits, the actuarial value of value-added benefits is significant as it is with competitors. So we believe that we can maintain margins by pulling back some of the ancillary benefits still have a very competitively priced product and a very competitively positioned product from a benefit perspective to continue to grow the business. Mark Keim : And just to build on that, I feel good that we had a reasonable line of sight into Q2 as we put in our pricing for next year. Scott, just on your question on the rest of 2023, we\u2019re conservative guys within our guidance is mid-to-low 88 [ph] for the rest of the year, and that\u2019s within the guidance we\u2019ve given. Scott Fidel : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. Sarah James : Thank you. Some of the states have filed waivers that allow you to be a little bit more hands on in communicating updated contact information. I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re noticing any difference in those states with the procedural and unable to contact terminations. And then in the states that didn\u2019t file the waivers like Florida, when [indiscernible] opened the door for more collaboration between health plans and states on that. Did that make a difference in your discussions with Florida around how to reach out correctly to eligible? Joe Zubretsky : Well, Sarah, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to comment on any particular state, but we \u2013 our protocols that we started building a year ago on member outreach and every state was different. Some states allowed significant involvement from MCOs, some states less so. Some states allow you to actually help the member reestablish eligibility by filling out forms. Some states didn\u2019t. Now as you know, CMS has stepped in and sort of suggested through policy statements that states should allow MCOs to be more involved in the reverification process. So I assure you that we are locked in to every single state in which we do business with the state regulatory authorities and are working hand in glove with them to make sure that everybody that should be on Medicaid is and people that shouldn\u2019t be thrown off Medicaid aren\u2019t. State by state. And yes, it has had an impact on our outreach efforts and gives us really good line of sight and good visibility into the fact that if a member should be on Medicaid, we\u2019re pretty confident between the state\u2019s efforts and our efforts that we\u2019ll be able to keep them in the system. Sarah James : Great. And then just to follow up on Scott\u2019s question around the Medicare bids. If I think about in context of the book that you\u2019re acquiring from Bright, and your guidance of breakeven in year one, are you assuming that if there is any industry-wide utilization inflation on Medicare that, that was captured in their 2024 bid? Joe Zubretsky : Without getting into specifics, I will answer the question this way. Our due diligence process through a clean room process allowed us visibility into their bid through an independent third party. And we are confident that the transparency that was provided in that process gives us confidence that the bid was rational, included all trend factors that should be included in a bid. And as I said, their profit improvement plan is going to be the key factor. How much of that profit improvement did they actually achieve between sign and close in terms of what we inherit is actually going to determine whether \u2013 what the bet earnings picture looks like at the point of closing. Sarah James : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Michael Ha with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Michael Ha : Thank you. Just quickly, first on redetermination, Mark, I know you mentioned the state made proactive concessions and rates for redeterminations in July. Just wanted to clarify, were those rate adjustments ready embedded in your current 2023 guidance? Or does that represent upside to your guide and are you able to provide a sense on magnitude of those rate concessions? Mark Keim : Well, a couple of things. Those couple of states that we already had rate concessions in the July 1 race. A very small part of our revenue and also done somewhat academically as the data hadn\u2019t developed in those states quite yet. All of that is incorporated in the guidance I\u2019ve given you. But again, such a small component. I think I mentioned five states started their new fiscal year, July 1, representing just 10% of revenue, and the states that gave those concessions were a subset within that. So not really a big deal, but in guidance. Michael Ha : Got it. Thank you. And just to dive deeper into MA MLR, curious, what specific type of outpatient utilization driving the pressure this quarter? Was it pent-up demand, hips, knees, could you walk us through the progression of the utilization year-to-date? Like how much of it might have been 1Q versus 2Q? And on the \u2013 I think there\u2019s about $27 million of unfavorable PPD in the quarter. Curious if you could help us break it out between MA commercial Medicaid. Thank you. Joe Zubretsky : I\u2019ll keep the PPD question to Mark, but on the Medicare MLR, it was outpatient, mostly ambulatory surgeries. Our population really doesn\u2019t have a lot of the hips, knees and joints that you\u2019d see in a more standard Medicare advance population. But we\u2019re also seeing PCP visits and the typical routine preventive screenings come back. I won\u2019t call it pent-up demand, but returning to normal, the types of services that Medicare patients and members normally get. Ambulatory surgeries, PCP visits, preventive screenings and care, a little bit of drug usage, but not a lot. And keep in mind, we\u2019re only operating \u2013 I need to \u2013 I\u2019m not rationalized again, 120 basis points above the top end of our range. The Medicare book is well positioned to earn a 4.5% pretax margin this year. So we\u2019re in good shape there. Mark, do you want to talk about the PPD? Mark Keim : Yep. Michael, what\u2019s your question about the prior year development? Michael Ha : Yes. Mark Keim : Yes. So\u2026 Michael Ha : About $27 million. Mark Keim : You got it exactly right. So in general, overall development was favorable. We take great confidence in quarter-after-quarter, our development is favorable. The prior year portion, as you point out, negative by a small amount. Typically, we would expect that to develop positively. But whenever there\u2019s a particular provider contracts settlement or something going on, it can create some noise. But in particular, what happened to this quarter was there\u2019s something some of you may be familiar with California SB 510, which was a specific court ruling that held health plans liable for certain COVID expenses. We\u2019ve recognized that charge as did some of our other competitors this quarter, and that created a little bit of the noise you\u2019re seeing. Michael Ha : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : Great. Thanks. Good morning. So I guess, given your comments earlier on the call to address all the investor debate as to whether or not the Medicaid MLR could be adversely impacted by just lower utilization members coming off the rolls during redeterminations and thus risk of higher Medicaid MLR on the remaining Medicaid members. Really just the conclusion around all that is what is your level of concern around this higher Medicaid MLR risk at this point, if any? Can be now put this to bed from your perspective. And also, if you could remind us, is there any preliminary buy as you can point to for your 2024 Medicaid MLR to be either better, in line or worse versus what you guided for Medicaid MLR for 2023? Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : Well, Steven, since we haven\u2019t changed our outlook for the redetermination process, 800,000 members up, 400,000 down, $1.6 billion in premium, one third this year, two thirds next and an 88.5% Medicaid MCR for the year. Since we haven\u2019t changed all our acuity determination and we\u2019re holding firm on our Medicaid outlook \u2013 Medicaid MLR outlook for the year \u2013 that\u2019s all been contemplated. So we\u2019re in good shape there. We see nothing that causes us to change that point of view. The fact that the MCRs of levers is slightly more favorable than the portfolio average is not a surprise, and it\u2019s maybe not as dramatic as one might think. The other point to make and bear in mind, and we don\u2019t disclose year-by-year how much of this we have. But most of our states have some form of either minimum MLR or some type of corridor program that we are well into because we operate very efficiently, we historically have paid into these mechanisms. Any intra-year impact from on medical margin, whether it\u2019s trend or whether it\u2019s yield, would be first absorbed by the significant liabilities we have already recorded for these conventions. That gives us great confidence that the 88.5% is a very good estimate for the year, all contemplated within the $20.75 guide for the year. Mark, do you want to talk about maybe some of the bridging items in the next year? Mark Keim : Yes, into next year, specifically around Medicaid MLRs \u2013 it will be partly a function of these pricings and rate cycles that we\u2019re having, most of which are in front of us. 50% of our revenue comes up for our January 1 fiscal year. That \u2013 those pricing discussions, obviously, actuarial policies require that states recognize anything that goes on with redetermination. And then finally, as Joe mentioned, even into next year, those continuing corridors and minimum MLRs continue to give us great comfort on our projected margins. So not looking at a lot of volatility into next year. Steven Valiquette : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Kevin Fischbeck at Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Great, thanks. I want to go back to a question a couple of times, I\u2019m not sure if you answered it. Is there a way to quantify how much the states who have built in something for rates are putting in? Is it something like 20 basis points? Is it 200 basis points? Like how should we think about how the states are thinking about the types of rates that need to be adjusted to reflect redeterminations. Mark Keim : Yes. Thanks for the question, Kevin. I\u2019m hesitant to give specific numbers because it differs state to state. But the real reason I\u2019m hesitant to give the numbers is two things. One, for the most part, they were done academically, not on data they were done prospectively academically, so means they were guessing no better than all the rest of us were three months ago. So academic prospective. But the bigger point is you might get a specific concession for redetermination. But in the presence of seven or eight adjustments up and down for other reasons, it gets lost co-mingled into the grand scheme of things. We have to come back to the overall concept of actuarial soundness. And if those rates develop in a place that just aren\u2019t appropriate, we\u2019ll be back with our states to make sure that they are. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. That makes sense. And then I guess maybe just on trend, generally speaking, \u2013 it seems like a lot of companies are talking about MA trend being higher, but not seeing it in commercial or Medicaid. Is there a reason why you look at this and say, that makes sense why it\u2019s not broader, like MA has been below trend, but I guess Medicaid has kind of been below trend, too. So why do you think that we\u2019re seeing an above-average return on Medicare Advantage, but not within Medicaid? Joe Zubretsky : It\u2019s really hard to say. First of all, our Medicare book, the profile of it is vastly different than many of the other books of business. This is not mainstream MAPD. This is high acuity, D-SNP and the demonstrations, which are the fully integrated Medicare and Medicaid product. So the population is vastly different. Look, our trends in the quarter were very simple to understand, 3% in Medicaid, 6% in Medicare, 7.5% in Marketplace. All well within expectations. And I would just say that the mix of the book of business and the profile of the book of business better said, is probably reasons for some of the differential as competitors report their results. Kevin Fischbeck : I guess when you think about it within your own book of business, if Medicaid is come in well during COVID and Medicare came in well during COVID and now Medicare snapping back of Medicaid is not is there a reason why by case, not snapping back? Joe Zubretsky : I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any discernible answer to that. The 81% of our book of business is Medicaid. The trend is behaving exactly within our expectations. And why one is behaving slightly hotter or more warm than the other, it\u2019s hard to tell. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Nathan Rich at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Nathan Rich : Great. Good morning, and thank you for the question. Just as it relates to the exchange opportunity from members that go through the redetermination process. It sounds like you haven\u2019t seen much, if anything, on that front yet. But I guess in the outreach you\u2019re doing with members, \u2013 have you had any kind of early success with potentially directing those members to a Marketplace plan who might not be eligible for Medicaid. Joe Zubretsky : Well, the process \u2013 again, it\u2019s early. The process is in full gear. We have robust distribution channels internally, call center employees or licensed agents who know how to do this, and the warm transfer process is enacted and in process. All we\u2019re saying is because it\u2019s so early, we have not seen a huge uptick in the number of marketplace members we\u2019re getting out of Medicaid. We track what we obtain in marketplace out of our own Medicaid plans, but we also track what we get in the marketplace from other Medicaid plans. And because it\u2019s drilling the process, all we\u2019re saying is that monthly figure has not increased dramatically, but we expect it will as this process gets more traction. Mark Keim : I think that\u2019s right to build on that. Remember, two-thirds of these folks that are coming off are procedural, which means they don\u2019t even know that they\u2019re losing coverage. When they do, they\u2019ll either come back on to Medicaid or what a great chance to get them on the Marketplace. Nathan Rich : Great. And then some state Medicaid programs, I think, are looking at covering the GLP-1 drugs for obesity. I guess, have you had any conversations with states with respect to that? And what factors they might be considering and how that could be worked into state programs just as we think about what potential impact could be? Joe Zubretsky : Yes. Right now, I think the way to look at it is Medicare doesn\u2019t pay for off-label uses. And when it comes to the individual states, some do allow it for weight control and many don\u2019t. But as they contemplate it, it\u2019s a rate discussion. My view is there\u2019s no medical cost that is inappropriate. If there\u2019s a medical cost or a benefit that\u2019s included in the program as long as it\u2019s rated for that\u2019s fine. So the trend in these prescriptions is well known and well documented. Some states already included in their formularies, others don\u2019t. And when that conversation comes up, then it\u2019s a conversation between actuaries in terms of the pharmacy component of the rate and whether it covers the $12,000 a year that it\u2019s going to cost to dispense one of these prescriptions. Nathan Rich : Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, our final question today comes from George Hill at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : Hey good morning guys and thanks for sneaking me in. I know it\u2019s a small part of the business. But I guess is there a way to big picture think about like the magnitude of the change in the value of the benefit in MA for 2024 as you guys try to balance the kind of the challenging rate environment with the changes to the risk model with kind of the need to preserve the margin profile of the business or preserve the margin profile of the business. Everybody kind of talks about the kind of the like the drawing down on benefit bout just trying to get a sense of magnitude, if there\u2019s a way to quantify that or kind of talk about it directionally. Joe Zubretsky : George, we couldn\u2019t hear the first part of your question. Are you talking about Medicare Advantage? George Hill : Yes, I was. And just like with the challenging rate environment, everybody is talking about kind of like the raining and it benefits a little bit. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a way to quantify that a little bit or kind of speak to it directionally kind of the magnitude of the change of benefit. Joe Zubretsky : Yes. No, I understand. We\u2019re not going to begin to publish sort of the percentage of actuarial value of the product that\u2019s represented by ancillary benefits. But it\u2019s significant. Our products are very competitive. With all the types of benefits, vision, dental, those cash card benefits, travel benefits, gym memberships, all those things are included in the product. And our competitive intelligence and analysis suggests that we can have a zero premium product with competitive benefits if and when our star ratings aren\u2019t necessarily benchmarked with the rest of the market. We\u2019re not going to size that, but we\u2019re pretty confident that we can pull in benefits marginally, still have a very, very robust product in respect to ancillary benefits and still be competitive. Mark Keim : The only other thing I\u2019d add, George, is when we think about benefit design, there are a number of items which for a competitive shopper are must-have. And there\u2019s a bunch of other things, which are part of the benefit load that are nice to have but don\u2019t necessarily influence the buying decision. You can imagine how we\u2019re thinking about changing benefit design. But we and our decisions probably won\u2019t be much different than the broader markets. So I\u2019m expecting a pretty even competitive dynamic next year. George Hill : That\u2019s great color. Thanks guys. Joe Zubretsky : And with no other calls, that concludes our call today. Thank you, everyone.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Molina Healthcare Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Krocheski, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Joe Krocheski : Good morning, and welcome to Molina Healthcare\u2019s third quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining me today are Molina\u2019s President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our third quarter earnings was distributed after the market closed yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those of you who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that all of the remarks made are as of today, Thursday, October 26, 2023, and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. On this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our third quarter 2023 earnings release. During the call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements including, but not limited to, statements regarding our 2023 guidance, Medicaid redeterminations, our recent RFP awards and related revenue growth, our 2024 outlook, our recent acquisitions and M&A activity, our long-term growth strategy and our embedded earnings power and margins. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. That could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report filed with the SEC as well as our risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe? Joe Zubretsky : Thank you, Joe, and good morning. Today, I will provide updates on several topics. Our financial results for the third quarter 2023, our full year 2023 guidance, Medicaid redeterminations, our growth initiatives and our strategy for sustaining profitable growth and our 2024 premium outlook. Let me start with our third quarter performance. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of $5.05 or 16% year-over-year growth on $8.2 billion of premium revenue. Our results reflect the continued execution of our strategy for sustaining profitable growth. Our third quarter 88.7% consolidated MCR and 4.6% adjusted pretax margin demonstrate continued strong medical and operating cost management. Our year-to-date consolidated MCR of 87.8% is squarely in line with our long-term target range and our 5.1% pretax margin is above the high end of the range. We note that investment income continues to bolster our year-over-year earnings growth and already a strong margin profile. Our Medicaid business performed as we expected. Our 88.8% MCR was within our long-term target range. Medical cost trend including the net effect of redetermination acuity shifts in corridors in several states was within our expectations. Medicare\u2019s results came in below our expectations with a reported MCR of 92.4%. In the quarter, we continue to experience higher utilization of outpatient, professional and in-home services, all of which we believe we appropriately addressed in our 2024 bids. And finally, marketplace with a reported MCR of 78.9% continues to perform well. Medical cost trends are in line with our pricing assumptions, and our improved risk adjustment performance is meaningful. Our small silver stable strategy is working. In summary, our third quarter results build on our strong first half performance. Turning now to our 2023 guidance. Based on our third quarter results, we are affirming our full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share guidance of at least $20.75 or 16% growth year-over-year, consistent with our long-term earnings per share growth target of 15% to 18%. Our fourth quarter outlook takes full account of our year-to-date performance and considerations for seasonality and conservatism. Now a few words about Medicaid redeterminations. As of July, all our Medicaid states have begun disenrolling members. Despite the redetermination activity, our third quarter Medicaid membership was nearly unchanged from the second quarter. Growth driven by the initiation of the Iowa contract and the closing of the My Choice Wisconsin acquisition offset the $200,000 member decrease from the net impact of redeterminations and new enrollment. While many uncertainties remain on the ultimate impact of redetermination, we now believe it prudent to lower our retention assumption from 50% to 40%. Mark will address implications for revenue and our unchanged outlook for $38 billion in premium revenue for next year in his remarks. Although, the medical cost profile of members who have left the Medicaid roles continues to be more favorable than the portfolio average. When combined with the impact of corridor offsets in several states, our overall Medicaid MCR was within our expectations. Mark will provide more color on redeterminations during his remarks. Turning now to an update on our growth initiatives and our strategy for sustaining profitable growth, beginning with our recent state wins. The implementation of our new California contract, which will nearly double the size of our current membership in the state and add approximately $2 billion in annual premium is proceeding as planned for a January 1, 2024 start date. In July, we finalized our contract for the Texas STAR+ program, retaining our entire existing footprint. With numerous new entrants likely attracting low share, we expect our share of membership in the state to grow, driving incremental annual premium revenue of approximately $400 million. Also in July, we successfully launched our Iowa health plan serving approximately 180,000 members, consistent with our expectations. Our Nebraska implementation is tracking to a successful launch on January 1, 2024, and will contribute estimated annual premium of $600 million. In August, we announced that we will once again be serving Medicaid beneficiaries in the state of New Mexico. We expect the new contract to begin mid-2024 and produce approximately $500 million in annual premium revenue. In Indiana, the state deemed us not to have met the readiness requirements for a Medicaid contract due to our Medicare DSNP product becoming available in the state on January 1, 2025, and not by January 1, 2024, as required. We are proud to have won the initial award as testimony to our proposal skills, but disappointed we did not meet that one readiness requirement. Our growth agenda is in full gear. Even with the development in Indiana and changing assumptions for redetermination retention, all of these new contract wins and reprocurements combined keep us on track to approximately $38 billion of premium revenue in 2024, as previously forecasted. Shifting to our M&A activity. In early September, we announced the closing of the My Choice Wisconsin acquisition. Recall, this transaction adds approximately 40,000 mostly MLTSS members and approximately $1 billion in annual premium revenue. The regulatory approval process for the Bright Medicare acquisition is proceeding as planned. We continue to work with Bright management on satisfying the remaining closing conditions and continue to expect to close by the first quarter of 2024. Now looking ahead to 2024. Assuming a timely close of the Bright Medicare acquisition, we remain confident that all of the known building blocks provide line of sight to approximately $38 billion of premium revenue in 2024, which represents 19% year-over-year growth, even before executing on additional strategic initiatives. While there are many positive earnings catalysts going into next year, which Mark will speak to in a moment. There are also some factors, which has not yet fully developed. As is customary, we will provide our specific earnings guidance with you in February. Recall that at our Investor Day earlier this year, we announced our long-term financial targets, the centerpiece of which is a long-term earnings per share compound annual growth rate of 15% to 18%. With the visibility we have into our earnings trajectory, we are comfortable in reaffirming our commitment to that compound annual growth rate target over the next three years. As always, I would like to thank our management team who worked tirelessly every day to deliver these results. Our team has evolved to keep pace with our growth and to execute each stage of our strategy. Recall that most recently, we promoted both Jim Woys and Mark Keim to the position of Senior Executive Vice President with Jim adding the title of Chief Operating Officer. In further shaping our lineup under Jim and Mark, two Molina veterans, Executive Vice President, Deb Bacon; and Dave Reynolds will now lead our flagship Medicaid business. We are also adding additional management talent in our Medicare and Marketplace businesses and scaling up our integration platform, all to support our substantial growth. Marc Russo will be leaving the company with our thanks for his service. Not only our executive team, but all of our colleagues throughout the enterprise and across the nation are vital to our success. I want to extend my special thanks to our nearly 18,000 associates who are dedicated to deliver access to high quality healthcare to our members. It is my privilege to serve with such a committed and capable group of professionals. In summary, we are very pleased with our performance this quarter. We have maintained our attractive margin profile during this unprecedented industry-wide redetermination process, while continuing to generate double digit growth. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials. Mark? Mark Keim : Thanks, Joe, and good morning everyone. Today I\u2019ll discuss some additional details of our third quarter performance, the balance sheet and our 2023 guidance and embedded earnings. I\u2019ll also provide an update on redeterminations, our 2024 premium revenue outlook and some early thoughts on the drivers of 2024 earnings. Beginning with our third quarter results. For the quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.05 and a consolidated MCR of 88.7%. In Medicaid, our reported MCR was 88.8%. The MCR included a moderate impact from the net effect of redetermination acuity shifts and corridors in several states. Our third quarter MCR was also slightly elevated from a provisional retroactive rate adjustment in New York State. Across our Medicaid segment, the major medical cost categories were largely in line with our expectation and normal quarter-to-quarter trend fluctuations. In Medicare, our reported MCR was 92.4%, above our long-term target range. During the quarter, we saw a continuation of increased utilization of outpatient professional and in-home services. Recall, we observed these trends emerging in the first and second quarters in time to inform our 2024 bids and benefit design. We are confident our 2024 bids will produce target margins next year. In Marketplace, our reported MCR was 78.9%. This strong result reflects our pricing strategy to return this business to target margins. Our enhanced focus on silver and renewal members helps us to drive strong performance and risk adjustment. Based on our year-to-date performance, we are well positioned to exceed our mid-single-digit target margins for the year. Also in Marketplace, we recorded a non-recurring charge in the quarter on our Texas Marketplace risk adjustment receivable from 2022 due to the financial difficulties of one major program participant in that state. While we have made our best estimate of the shortfall in collections, we will continue to pursue regulatory paths to collecting the full receivable due to us. Given it\u2019s unusual and one-time nature, we have excluded it from our adjusted earnings. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 7.1 consistent with our expectations. This result includes new business implementation spending for new contract wins in Iowa, as well as several new contracts beginning in 2024. Turning now to our balance sheet. Our capital foundation remains strong. We harvested approximately $175 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter and used a similar amount for our Wisconsin acquisition leaving our parent company cash balance unchanged quarter-over-quarter at approximately $0.5 billion. Debt at the end of the quarter was unchanged at just 1.6x trailing 12 month EBITDA with our debt-to-cap ratio at 38.3%. Net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.3x and 33.2% reflecting our low leverage position and ample cash and capital capacity for additional growth and investment. Turning to reserves. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and we continue to be confident in the strength of our reserve position. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter was 51, elevated from normal levels due to the inclusion of My Choice Wisconsin and our new Iowa plan. Adjusted for this temporary impact, our reported DCP would have been consistent with Q1 and Q2 levels. Now some additional color on our 2023 guidance and embedded earnings. We\u2019re affirming our full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share guidance of at least $20.75. Our full year guidance now effectively the remaining fourth quarter reflects our third quarter results, which were largely consistent with our expectations and includes considerations for seasonality and conservatism. New store embedded earnings remains unchanged at $5.50 per share, comprised of $4 for our recent new contract wins and $1.50 for acquisitions. The $4 per share for our new contract wins now includes approximately $0.50 for the combination of Texas STAR+PLUS and New Mexico replacing the same amount previously expected from the Indiana contract. The $1.50 per share of acquisition earnings includes achieving full run rate accretion from AgeWell, My Choice and Bright Health\u2019s Medicare business. Turning to redeterminations. As we discussed on prior calls, we have built robust tracking and monitoring systems to maximize retention of members who meet the eligibility criteria and to also promptly understand any financial impacts of redeterminations. Across our states approximately one-third of our members reviewed have been termed, of which over 70% have been procedural disenrollment rather than due to verification of actual ineligibility. As a result, we are seeing nearly 30% of those termed being reconnected, and we expect these numbers to grow. In the quarter, we estimate that we lost approximately 200,000 members due to the net impact of redeterminations bringing the year-to-date figure to approximately 300,000. Given the high number of procedural terminations and increasing state and CMS interventions, we expect reconnects will likely continue decreasing currently reported membership losses. As we interact with members who lose eligibility, we seek to warm transfer them to our Marketplace team for potential enrollment in that product. Throughout the process, we are seeing an increasing rate of former Medicaid members, both ours and our competitors enroll in our Marketplace products. Turning to our observations on the margin impact of redeterminations. We see that terminated members have lower medical costs than the portfolio average. However, combined with the impact of corridors in several states, the net effects from acuity shifts remains well within our expectations and our overall MCR outlook for the year. Of course, as trends have emerged, we are working with our state partners to ensure rates reflect the impact of redeterminations either prospectively in the normal fiscal year rate cycle, off cycle or retrospectively if necessary. In our states through the end of September 10 of 12 with draft or final rates have included an acuity adjustment with several considering retroactive or mid-cycle adjustments. Lastly, some additional color on 2024 starting with our premium revenue outlook. As Joe mentioned, we have line of sight to the building blocks that are expected to deliver approximately $38 billion in premium revenue for 2024 or approximately 19% growth off our 2023 premium guidance of $32 billion. These building blocks include $1.1 billion of organic growth in our current footprint, plus approximately $4 billion from our recent state contract wins with the expected premium from our Texas STAR+PLUS and New Mexico contracts, largely replacing the approximately $500 million that we had previously projected from Indiana next year. This we add approximately $2.4 billion of acquisition related premium consisting of [Audio Dip] of My Choice Wisconsin and the Bright California Medicare acquisition. Partially offsetting these growth drivers is $1.6 billion for the impact of redeterminations and known pharmacy carve-outs. We have revised our original 50% retention assumption to 40% reflecting the earlier redetermination activity we have seen and a generally conservative approach to forecasting. While this changing assumption will lower 2024 premium revenue by $300 million, we expect that gains in marketplace through increasing cross-sell and SEP and an expected strong OEP will effectively offset this result. We maintain our $38 billion in premium revenue outlook for 2024. Finally, some early thoughts on the drivers of 2024 earnings. We note the following elements that will positively influence our 2024 earnings trajectory. We have a solid 2023 earnings baseline off of which to grow. Our new store embedded earnings remain unchanged at $5.50 and continue to provide meaningful visibility into our future earnings growth potential. Investment income will likely continue to be strong. We believe our Medicare performance will improve as a result of our 2024 bids. And the impact of new business implementation costs of $0.75 a share this year go away as we begin recording premium revenue on our new business wins. However, there are some remaining variables as we close 2023 and move into 2024. First, our 2024 outlook will be better informed with another quarter of redetermination activity observed. Second, rates impacting 60% of our 2024 Medicaid premium revenue are still unknown, but we are confident that the principle of actuarial soundness will prevail, including appropriate acuity adjustments for redeterminations. We do note that rates have been finalized to date have generally been satisfactory. Finally, the first year earnings contribution from the Bright acquisition is still under review. In summary, we are very pleased with our third quarter performance and the momentum we have established toward achieving our growth targets. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Josh Raskin : Thanks. Good morning. I want to pick up on that last thread around the exchange growth from the redeterminations and what you\u2019re seeing early. I\u2019m curious in terms of trends and members coming in. And then is it fair to assume that that would be better risk? They\u2019re coming into your product and they\u2019ve probably been previously insured, right, coming out of Medicaid? And then I\u2019m just curious if this early experience, I understand a little less retention, does that change your view of the exchanges in 2024? I think last quarter you said that they would be relatively low growth in terms of premiums for 2024. Joe Zubretsky : Josh, when it comes to the exchange business in the special enrollment period, we are seeing an increase in special enrollment, monthly special enrollment. It was averaging 8,000 to 9,000 a month until the redetermination process happened, and it\u2019s increased to 12,000 a month and growing. So we are getting membership flow into the Marketplace from Medicaid redeterminations, not only from our book of business, but from competitors\u2019 book of business. We do have a product and every place we have a Medicaid footprint. But in many cases that product isn\u2019t as competitive \u2013 competitively priced as competitors. So where we\u2019re competitively priced we\u2019re getting Medicaid membership from other competitors, and we\u2019re getting Medicaid \u2013 Marketplace membership from our own book of business. So we\u2019re pretty pleased that we did not forecast Marketplace membership growth. We continued it upside to our membership case and we\u2019re seeing a nice result there. Mark, anything to add? Mark Keim : Sure. Josh, I added about 40,000 members through SEP in the quarter compared to the 200,000 net we lost in Medicaid. So if you put some conversion rate on how many of the 40,000 came from our Medicaid book or someone else\u2019s Medicaid book, that conversion rate is pretty good. Call it, 15% or 20%. On the rate that they\u2019re coming in at, it looks like they\u2019re coming in pretty much at our portfolio run rate within Marketplace. We\u2019re not seeing pent-up demand or anything like that. So we\u2019re liking the pickup and the implications for future volume and those margins, so far are looking pretty good to us. Joe Zubretsky : The second part of your question, Josh, you asked about the retention percentage. We just followed the data and with 300,000 membership losses to date, the first thing we say is it\u2019s ill-advised to extrapolate any current result. Many of our states front loaded the process and by front loading we mean they specifically targeted members more likely to lose eligibility. And the fact that 70% of the terminations were procedural means that the reconnect rate has been high averaging 25% and now moving to 30% of those members who have lost eligibility. So we just followed the data and we originally said we would lose 400,000 of the 800,000 members we gained during the pandemic, and now that number has increased to 480,000. And I suppose that would mean that it is likely that whatever we\u2019re seeing in terms of Marketplace pickup would likely increase as well. Josh Raskin : Perfect. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. I guess two questions. One, within the Medicaid business as you talked about how MLR is coming in line with expectations seems like every time we do that, you also mentioned that net of risk corridors and things like that. Is there any way to quantify what the pressure would\u2019ve been without the offset of risk corridors? And then as far as the MA commentary, it sounds like you\u2019re saying Q3 came in worse, but you still caught it in time for your bid. So I\u2019m trying to figure out how MLR in Q3 could be higher than expectations, but not be a problem for 2024 if you submitted bids in June? Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : On the Medicaid MLR, I\u2019ll kick it to Mark here for more color. But as we\u2019ve always said and we made a big point of this at Investor Day. On the pre-COVID minimum MLRs and corridors that set sort of an industry benchmark of medical margin performance. We have routinely outperformed those benchmarks, which gives rise to a payback to the state in the form of a liability in many of our states. And some of those corridors we\u2019re deep into them, meaning that we\u2019re in the 100% tier. So with that having been said, if performance deteriorates during the year for any reason, whether it\u2019s an acuity shift for redetermination, whether it\u2019s a trend inflection, whether it\u2019s flu or COVID for whatever reason that liability acts as sort of the first financial cushion to absorb it before rates pick up, meaning the acuity adjustments, trend assumptions, always being baked into rates, fulfilling the concept of actuarial soundness. And we\u2019ve said that from the beginning of this process that this is developing exactly as planned. We knew there\u2019d be an acuity shift, manageable and modest as it is, and would put pressure on the underlying MCR. Our corridor liabilities would act as the first point of financial cushion until the rate process takes full credit of the acuity shift and trend. And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening today. Mark Keim : Right. And just to put a little color around that. If in normal times you\u2019re booking corridor expense and underlying trend increases quarter-to-quarter in our situation, I\u2019ll just book less corridor expense. But it is important to note, I still booked meaningful corridor expense in the third quarter. So it\u2019s not like the corridors have completely been offset. We\u2019re still booking corridor expense and we still have a significant ultimate on those liabilities. Now, as Joe mentioned that corridor works well in the current fiscal year and that it\u2019s about the new rate cycle. But remember, we tend to be best-in-class margins, which means that new rate cycle always works for us and replenishes our corridor position and keeps us in the mode we\u2019re currently running. Joe Zubretsky : Kevin, the second part of your question was on the Medicare MCR, which admittedly ran hot in the quarter at 92.4% and was running in the high 80s earlier in the year. We\u2019re still on target to produce 2.5% to 3% pre-tax margins in that business. It should be twice that, our target is 5% to 6% pre-tax. And yes, we saw some trend inflections in the third quarter that were higher than we observed in the first part of the year. But we\u2019re conservative pricers. We caught some of these trends early in the year, whether outpatient, professional services, screenings and PCP visits are back both on the medical side and on the behavioral side. And LTSS hours, the hours assigned to the frail members who are getting in-home services increased slightly in the quarter. All in, we believe we captured a conservative view of medical cost trend, which right now is running at 7% year-over-year higher than we had expected, but we believe we\u2019ve captured that in our 2024 bids and fully expect our Medicare business to be back to 5% to 6% pre-tax margins in 2024. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Nathan Rich : Great. Good morning. Thanks for the questions and thanks for the detail on the earnings drivers for next year. Joe, I think you kind of framed the 15% to 18% EPS growth is the average over the next three years. I guess, could you maybe just go into a little bit more detail on sort of the biggest unknowns from your point of view on that could impact growth next year relative to that that 15% to 18% range? And then just a quick clarification, on the retroactive rate adjustment in New York is it possible to quantify what impact that had in the quarter? And do you see a potential for an adjustment to this going forward potentially to be more favorable? Thank you. Joe Zubretsky : Sure, Nathan. I\u2019ll provide the framing and then kick it to Mark. And I think Mark gave some of the building blocks in his prepared remarks. First and foremost, we\u2019re very confident in the $38 billion revenue outlook for next year. That\u2019s 19% year-over-year growth in a year where we\u2019re still producing best-in-class margins. First, I would say we\u2019re starting with a very high quality solid 2023 earnings baseline. We generally grow organically in our footprint, embedded earnings of $5.50 a share of both new store, both M&A and new contract wins is certainly a catalyst into next year. Those implementation costs of $0.75 reverse. We believe interest rates will continue to be high. Bear in mind that half our investible base is in intermediate term bonds, so they\u2019re locked in, and then the rates on the short-term portfolio are going to fluctuate with what the Fed does. But our outlook there is that interest rates will remain high going into next year, even to the end of next year. The three variables that we need to see more of before giving a specific earnings per share forecast for 2024 is how does redetermination experience emerge in the fourth quarter? To date, it has been completely in line with our expectation. We did increase our ultimate loss assumption as spoken. And we\u2019d like to see how the rates develop on our 60% of our Medicaid revenue for next year. We know about rates on 40% of our Medicaid revenue next year. Those rates have been actuarially sound. We\u2019ve been satisfied with the acuity adjustments. As Mark said, those acuity adjustments were resident in 10 out of the 12 rates that we already know about. But we want to see how the rates develop on 60% of the book. So those are the variables going into next year. As you cited at the beginning of your question, we are confident and committed to the 15% to 18% long-term earnings per share growth rate off the 2023 baseline, which means that 2026 earnings per share will be 52% to 64% higher than 2023 of $20.75. Mark, anything to add? Mark Keim : Yeah, the only other thing Nathan, I think you asked about the rate adjustment in New York. We reported as you know an 88.8% in Medicaid for the quarter. I\u2019d estimate someplace around 30 bps is related to that specific phenomenon. And the reason it\u2019s a little uncertain is in several of our states the retro rates constantly get revisited. I\u2019m optimistic that this one gets a little bit better, but at the moment we book that adjustment. Nathan Rich : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Good morning. Sorry about that. Appreciate the question here. The \u2013 two things I wanted to touch on were \u2013 you had a fair amount of prior year development in the third quarter kind of abnormally high relative to previous. Just curious what segments of the business might have drove that and the potential impact to earnings there. And then secondly on, Joe, you mentioned investment income. I\u2019m curious as you\u2019re having these conversations with the states on rates. Just want to confirm, like historically my understanding is states didn\u2019t really take when they set your margin \u2013 your rates actuarially sound with a margin target behind it. That margin target was before investment income. Are they looking at investment income and say, geez, maybe we could pay you a little bit less because your earnings are higher because of the investment income? Or is that still left outside of the calculation? Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : I\u2019ll answer the second question first. Investment income is not only generally, but almost entirely outside the conversation of rates, which generally focused on what we call medical margin or trend assumptions. In some cases they also focus on a G&A load, but that\u2019s rare and infrequent. On the PYD, I\u2019ll kick it to Mark because we\u2019re very confident in the strength of our balance sheet. Two points I\u2019ll make. From a business perspective, our payment integrity routines are both prepay and postpay. In a postpay routine where you identify things that you should not have paid for and recover it from providers. By definition, that is accounted for in prior period development because it relates to prior periods. That is a large share of any prior period development that we report. Second point to note is, don\u2019t forget, we have corridor liabilities relating to some of these prior periods. And to the extent that PYD went against a state in a period where a corridor liability existed, then it was muted in terms of its financial impact. Mark Keim : That that\u2019s exactly right, payment integrity has become such a fundamental part of our operations and we do it fairly well. That prior year amount that you pulled from the earnings release was largely offset by corridors. Now, more to the point when we see strong prior period development, it\u2019s tempting to be concerned about current reserving. Did they somehow offset to make earnings, something like that? Look, I\u2019d point to the strength of our current reserve position, 51 days, DCP the growth versus revenue. So I feel both good about our current reserving position, but the strength of this prior year exercise as well through our payment integrity function. Operator : Our next question comes from Calvin Sternick from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Calvin Sternick : Yes. Thanks. Maybe just switching gears here a little bit. I\u2019m curious what you\u2019re seeing in the cohort of members who haven\u2019t reconnected within that 90 to 120 day window, but realize afterwards that they\u2019re still eligible for Medicaid. What are the membership additions looking like there relative to what you expected? And I know you\u2019ve talked about in the past investing in quality initiatives to move up in the auto sign algorithms. So just wondering if you\u2019re seeing those efforts bear fruit here or if it\u2019s still too early to tell or just too much noise going on with redeterminations? Joe Zubretsky : I think you answered the question in your last statement. Because the gap is 90 to 120 days, we\u2019ve seen very little of it, given that the redetermination was in full throws, May and June. But your supposition \u2013 your theoretical supposition is correct. That member is going to go to the doctor or to the pharmacy for a service or a script realize they don\u2019t have service and then reconnect obviously with no retroactivity back to the data termination. So we suspect that member will come back in somewhere around the portfolio average because they\u2019ll be requiring services. Anything to add Mark? Mark Keim : Yes. When we talk about reconnect, just to set the stage for everybody, we tend to think about two categories, most of them are what we call seamless that is within 90 to 120 days, they realized they lost coverage, contacted the agency and got back on as though they never lost coverage and we pick up the retro premium. Now as Joe mentioned, we\u2019re only three, four, five months into this dynamic. So the people that are outside the 90 to 120 day window are only starting to emerge now. We call those reconnects with a gap. They will come in through the typical auto assign process. And through a number of algorithms, we\u2019re getting better and better on auto-assigns in states. So I feel good about our recapture of those reconnects with the gap. Calvin Sternick : Thanks. If I can just ask a follow-up, and I apologize if I asked this is nitpicking a little bit, but you said the rates are generally satisfactory. Was that just a hedge against New York, maybe coming in a little bit lower? Just curious what you\u2019re seeing on the rest of the book if some things are generally better, in line or if you have something on the other side that aren\u2019t as good as you expected. Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : I think we use the word generally, obviously, because we were reporting a retroactive rate that not only us but the entire industry is advocating a guest. So that was the reason for the term. But for the most part, about 40% of rates that we know about that impact 40% of our revenue for 2024 in the Medicaid business, the rates have been actuarially sound and have included what we consider to be actuarially reasonable adjustments for acuity. Calvin Sternick : Great, thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Stephen Baxter : Yes, hi, thanks for the question. I just wanted to come back to the acuity discussion. I think you mentioned it was running in line with your expectations at this point. I guess, how do you think about the higher level of procedural disenrollments, having impacted that? I guess like how much does that make it challenging for you to feel like you have good visibility there at this point? And then I think you mentioned that the reconnect population you expected, the MLRs there will be in line with sort of like the rest of the stayers. I guess, do you have data at this point to support that? Or can you look back and see what utilizations look like over the past couple of years for those people. So I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s based on data at this point or it\u2019s still kind of a working period? Thank you. Mark Keim : So on the reconnects themselves, we\u2019re seeing them come back in closer to the stayers average, the portfolio average. Now I appreciate your question about historical benchmarks of data, but the problem is over the last two to three years, we didn\u2019t really have such a phenomena. But I am feeling pretty good about the MLR of these reconnects, both seamless and with the gap. Joe Zubretsky : The other \u2013 maybe the last point to make on this point is a really important one. Durational acuity and lever stayers and joiners is not a new phenomenon to tracking a book of business. It\u2019s just that in this environment, it\u2019s more important to track it and to be able to forecast it. People come in to Medicaid because they need services, they can end higher than the portfolio average. And by the time they leave, they\u2019re using fewer services and leaving out lower than the portfolio average. That\u2019s the way the business works. And we have produced through all of that, on average, 88% \u2013 between 88% and 89%, 88.5% on average MCR. That\u2019s the way the business works. The issue here is because of the redetermination pause during the PHE, there\u2019s twice as many people leaving than joining. So this has always been a phenomenon. We\u2019ve had tracking mechanisms for durational acuity. We understand the levers, stayers and joiners analysis really well. But it is very early in the process. And I come back to the point we made earlier. It is ill-advised to mathematically extrapolate any of these data points, certain states front-loaded the process. And as you suggested, with the procedural termination rate being so high, the reconnect rate is higher than anybody expected and likely growing. Operator : Next question comes from Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel : Hi, thanks. Would appreciate if you can just give us sort of, I guess, your sense on your comfort levels right now with the current performance and then the bid positioning of the Bright Medicare asset that you\u2019re going to be acquiring. And maybe just sort of talk about how you\u2019re thinking about sort of factoring that into your 2024 outlook and maybe some of the downside protections that exist if that performance does come in, let\u2019s say, a bit meaningfully below optimal levels. Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : So Scott, we\u2019re very pleased with the strategic complement to our Medicare business, taking it from a $4 billion business to nearly a $6 billion business in a very important state for us, obviously, in California, where we\u2019re doubling the size of our Medicaid business. So from a strategic rationale perspective, we\u2019re very excited about it. In our embedded earnings is a run rate accretion level of $1 of earnings per share, ultimately, given the way the CMS pricing cycle works, it is going to take us a little longer than normal to get there, but we\u2019re confident in doing so. I\u2019ll stop short on commenting about their financial performance. They\u2019re a public company. This is a material to their operations. So I would allow them to report on how they\u2019re doing. But we do have visibility into how they\u2019re performing. And when we said that one of the variables going into next year is how will it perform in the first year. We don\u2019t yet know because we don\u2019t know where it will be performing when we close on it. I\u2019ll stop short of commenting on their performance because that would be inappropriate. Obviously, they\u2019ll report earnings soon, and you can get a view as to how the Medicare business is doing. Operator : Our next question next question comes from A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice: Just maybe to ask about the exchanges a bit more. It sounds like you\u2019ve got some conservatism, at least you believe you have in the fourth quarter baked in. I know you\u2019ve been running a pretty low MCR year-to-date and exchanges. Are you allowing for significant uptick? Sometimes we see that utilization. Obviously, as people hit their deductible limits, et cetera, and exchanges. Can you give us any sense of what you\u2019ve baked in? And I think the comment was made and as you look ahead to 2024, you\u2019re not expecting a lot of premium growth, it seems like you\u2019ve repriced the business pretty well. Why not take a little more active approach to growing that product line next year, given it sounds like you\u2019re hitting your margin targets pretty easily this year in that product? Or maybe I\u2019m missing something. Joe Zubretsky : So yes, you aren\u2019t missing anything. Thanks for the question. Let me frame it in terms of you asked two questions, one about the MCR and one about membership growth. On the MCR, when we gave guidance at the end of the second quarter, we built in roughly an 85% back half MCR. And obviously, we outperformed that in the third quarter. We continue to bake in something in the mid-80s for the fourth quarter, which would put us at 76% for the full year, which is 200 basis points below the low end of the range. This business is going to produce 8.5% to 9% pretax margins for the year. Small, silver and stable work given the potential for inherent volatility in the risk pool, I think we have this right. Now to your point, Mark mentioned it in his prepared remarks and some, but he mentioned it, that we do plan to grow the marketplace business next year. We plan to grow it measuredly and modestly. The early read on our pricing competitiveness. I\u2019ll just give you one stat that\u2019s really important. In our Silver product, which is our flagship product, we are now number one or number two priced in 30% of our counties versus 20% this year. It will grow next year. We plan to do it measurably and modestly, all with the view are producing at least mid-single-digit pretax margins, which this year will be very high single-digit pretax margins. Anything to add Mark? Mark Keim : A.J., the only thing I\u2019d add is Joe has been adamant about small, stable and silver in this product. And so when we set rates last June, we set them on our discipline on our margin expectations. It looks like the risk pool next year is stabilizing with some of the more strangely players dropping out, which means the risk pool for the rest of us has stabilized as a result on pricing we committed to last June, we\u2019re seeing a much better competitive position. Joe mentioned 20% of our county is now growing to 30%, where we\u2019re number one or number two, which means I\u2019m expecting to get more volume than I thought before at margins that conform with our discipline. So we\u2019re feeling good about that outlook. A.J. Rice: Okay, thanks. Operator : The next question comes from George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : Hey, good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the question. I guess with respect to the retrospective rate adjustments that you guys talked about, is there any way to quantify both how far you guys are through the process? And simplistically speaking, I guess, how much money you guys think you might be owed from rate adjustments that kind of didn\u2019t \u2013 that need to be trued up historically? Mark Keim : I\u2019ll take that. Obviously, I\u2019m in no position to comment on retro rates that haven\u2019t been contractually committed to by our state partners. But with our actuarial team and our data-driven process, we\u2019re in there working with them. And I\u2019d say there\u2019s a handful right now where the data is compelling. The state is receptive to the discussion. We\u2019ll let that play out. And of course, I\u2019ll book those benefits if and when they come. George Hill : Okay, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Gary Taylor from Cowen. Please go ahead. Gary Taylor : Hi, good morning. I had two questions. One was just on the $5.50 of embedded earnings, which I think you reiterated I think a portion of that historically was Indiana that might have only been sort of $0.15 or $0.20. So I just wanted to make sure understanding what sort of backfilling that to keep the embedded earnings at $5.50. And also, if you would agree, it sounds like maybe just the Bright year one profitability is the biggest I guess, question mark right now in terms of how much of that embedded earnings will get realized in 2024. Is that fair? Joe Zubretsky : First question, Gary, this is Joe. Yes, as embedded earnings, you\u2019re absolutely right. We removed Indiana from embedded earnings but replaced it with New Mexico and an expansion in Texas now that the contract is finalized. And yes, as I said, we\u2019re very confident that we can get Bright to target margins after a two-year period and achieve the $1 earnings per share accretion number. And again, we\u2019re just saying that we just don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to inherit in terms of earnings per share closing to forecast the first year. Mark Keim : And given that company is going into OEP themselves, they\u2019re probably still working through what their outlook is for next year. So it\u2019s definitely too early given the situation for us to comment on that one. Gary Taylor : Thank you. Operator : The last question comes from Sarah James from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. Sarah James : Thank you. One clarification on the rejoiners, can you give us a split of what\u2019s coming back in exchanges versus coming back on Medicaid? And then in the two of the 12 states that didn\u2019t put in the acuity adjustments, are you able to see any pattern there, either in how the cost that is coming in, maybe the timing that they started redeterminations or how the rate is structured with risk corridors that you\u2019re able to determine maybe why those two were outliers? Joe Zubretsky : I\u2019ll kick it to Mark for the cover on these, but the first point I\u2019ll make is on your second question. I think we appropriately need to include the word yet in the two that haven\u2019t. Bear in mind, some of our rate cycle actually incepts only as the redetermination process starting even before it started, which makes it not possible for any Medicaid department to project what the acuity shift would be. So I would introduce the word yet. And who knows, maybe we\u2019ll get a retro or a mid-cycle adjustment on those two states. Mark? Mark Keim : Hey Sarah, on the reconnects, when we use the term reconnects, both seamless and with a gap, that is purely a Medicaid concept. So that 25% going to 30% that we\u2019re seeing is strictly within Medicaid \u2013 then separately, as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re picking up members in the marketplace. I mentioned closer to 40,000 through SEP in the third quarter. So that would be a different concept. And obviously, as an enterprise, only helps \u2013 in the overall membership story. And then Joe is exactly right, on the two of the 12 states where we haven\u2019t seen it yet, there\u2019s a few things driving that. The timing of when folks started impacts how quickly data develops to have a data-driven process. The timing of the fiscal year is definitely a component, but in all cases, the concept of actuarial sales just means it\u2019s a matter of getting the data into timing consistent with fiscal years and appropriate retro periods. So we feel good about that process. And again, the vast majority have already given us those concessions. So we feel good about how the process will unfold. Sarah James : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. Standing in for Joe Krocheski today is Jeff Geyer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jeff Geyer : Good morning, and welcome to Molina Healthcare's fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call. Joining me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky, and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings was distributed after the market closed yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those of you who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that all of the remarks made are as of today, Thursday, February 8, 2024, and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. On this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures for 2023 and 2024 can be found in our fourth quarter 2023 earnings release. During the call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our 2024 guidance, Medicaid redeterminations, our recent RFP awards and related revenue growth, our recent acquisition and M&A activity, our long-term growth strategy and our embedded earnings power and projected 2025 earnings per share. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report filed with the SEC as well as our risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe? Joe Zubretsky : Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Today, I will discuss several topics. Our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023, our growth initiatives and our strategy for sustaining profitable growth, our 2024 premium revenue and earnings guidance and an affirmation of our long-term growth targets. Let me start with our fourth quarter performance. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.38 on $8.4 billion of premium revenue. Our fourth quarter results and performance metrics demonstrated strong medical cost management and operating cost discipline. Medicaid continued to perform well, withstanding the impacts of the unprecedented redetermination process. Medicare experienced higher than target medical costs, consistent with prior quarters and Marketplace performed very well despite the late in-year medical cost seasonality typically experienced. Our fourth quarter completes a strong year of operating and financial performance. Full year adjusted earnings per share of $20.88 represents 17% year-over-year growth, squarely in line with our long-term target range of 15% to 18% and 6% above our initial 2023 guidance of at least $19.75. Our full year premium revenue of $32.5 billion represents 5% year-over-year growth, and our pretax margin of 4.8% is at the high end of our long-term target range heading into 2024. In Medicaid, our flagship business representing over 80% of revenue, we reported an 88.7% MCR for the full year, which is within our long-term target range. Throughout the redetermination process, we have managed through a number of factors that shape Medicaid's performance, all to land the full year result at a solid jump-off point into 2024. These factors included medical cost utilization, various state corridors and MLR minimums and prospective rate changes. In Medicare, the full year MCR was 90.7%. While the business is profitable, we did not meet our performance expectations due to higher utilization of supplemental benefits, in-home services and high-cost drugs. I am confident that our 2024 bid strategy, adjustments to benefit design and various operational improvements will return the business to target margins in 2024. In Marketplace, we reported a 75.3% MCR for the full year, below the low end of our target range, which reflects the successful execution of our small, silver and stable strategy. This business is now positioned to grow at a rate, which allows us to sustain mid-single-digit margins. In addition to delivering strong financial results, in 2023, we continued to execute on our profitable growth strategy. To recap the growth milestones achieved in 2023. In January, we successfully reprocured our contract in Texas for the state's STAR+PLUS program, retaining all eight regions and likely growing market share. In July, we successfully launched our Iowa Medicaid plan following the RFP, which we had won in a highly competitive process in late 2022. In August, we announced that we were awarded a contract to once again serve Medicaid beneficiaries in the state of New Mexico. In September, we closed on the My Choice Wisconsin acquisition, further expanding our market-leading LTSS franchise. In June, we agreed to acquire Bright Health's California Medicare business, which we have now closed effective January 1, 2024. Also effective January 1 and after another win in a highly competitive bid process, we successfully launched our Nebraska health plan. And finally, on January 1, we launched our expanded California platform, including Los Angeles County, which doubled the size of our business in the state. Collectively, these acquisitions and RFP successes represent $7 billion of annual premium revenue, a portion of which was in our 2023 results, most of which is in our 2024 guidance and all of which will be fully realized in 2025. To say we are pleased with the execution of our 2023 growth initiatives would be an understatement. But the growth story doesn't stop there. The pipeline of opportunities, fueling our future growth trajectory is extremely strong. Let me begin with reprocurements. We have submitted our RFP responses for contract renewals in Florida, Virginia and Michigan. We are proven partners with all three of these states, and we are confident in our ability to retain and grow these relationships. With regard to new state opportunities, including the Florida opportunity just described, there is over $50 billion of total premium revenue opportunity, active or near term, up for bid in several states over the coming years. We have already submitted bids in the states of Kansas and Georgia. With our demonstrated capabilities and referenceable track record, we remain confident in our ability to continue to win new state contracts. With respect to our M&A initiatives, our acquisition pipeline remains robust with actionable opportunities and we are confident in our ability to deliver growth from this key component of our strategy. Since 2019, we have completed eight transactions having acquired over $11 billion of premium for which we paid 22% of revenue. This capital allocation to M&A will continue to be a value driver. Turning now to our 2024 guidance. We project 2024 premium revenue of approximately $38 billion, which is consistent with our previous outlook and represents 17% year-over-year growth. We project 2024 adjusted earnings per share of at least $23.50, representing 13% year-over-year growth. Mark will take you through the detailed guidance build in a few minutes. But in the meantime, let me offer some high-level commentary. Our projected premium revenue growth to $38 billion represents a well-balanced combination of new contract wins, acquisitions and growth in our current footprint, partially offset by the impact of Medicaid redeterminations. With respect to earnings guidance in the core business, in Medicaid, our guidance fully considers the impact of the redetermination process. From a margin perspective, this is playing out as we have predicted. The impact of acuity shifts is real, but not significant. The risk corridors acted as a financial buffer and rates prospective and retrospective are largely capturing the trend impact. On a same-store basis, we are projecting the 2024 Medicaid MCR to be within our long-term range. We expect Medicare to return to mid-single-digit profitability in 2024 as a result of our bid strategy, adjustments to benefit design and operational improvements in the legacy business. Our Marketplace product has been priced right, is competitively positioned and the risk pool has stabilized. We expect the business to achieve mid to high single-digit margins, membership to grow over 30% and revenue to grow 17%. On top of our 2024 earnings per share guidance of at least $23.50, we now have $4 per share of new store embedded earnings, which, as you may recall, represents the expected accretion produced by our new store growth. Mark will review the components of the updated $4 per share in his remarks. Our confidence in our 2024 guidance starts with a high-quality 2023 earnings baseline and then takes a thorough account of all the various factors, exogenous and company-specific, that could impact earnings in 2024. Now, a few comments on our longer-term trajectory. Our 2024 guidance picture is one more data point that validates our long-term targets of 13% to 15% premium growth and 15% to 18% adjusted earnings per share growth. We committed to these targets at our Investor Day last May, and we reaffirm that commitment today. With the majority of the $4 of new store embedded earnings expected to emerge in 2025, we already see a clear outlook to achieving the low end of our long-term EPS growth target in 2025, even before considering the execution of additional growth initiatives and driving growth from our current footprint. In summary, we are very pleased with our 2023 performance, our trajectory to deliver the growth and profitability inherent in our 2024 guidance and the embedded earnings outlook we provided for 2025. Our confidence in continuing to achieve our long-term targets is data-driven as demonstrated by the following historical fact set. We have reprocured approximately $12 billion in existing revenue. We have added approximately $7 billion of new revenue through wins of new or expanded contracts in seven states. From 2020 to 2023, we achieved 21% annual premium growth and 25% annual earnings per share growth. 2024 guidance, 17% premium revenue growth year-over-year, 13% earnings per share growth year-over-year. And for 2025, and we expect to harvest the majority of our $4 per share of embedded earnings. Our strategy is clear and simple. We are in the business of providing access to high-quality health care for individuals relying on government assistance. Our business model is also clear and simple. We take on capitated risk, take or make rates that are commensurate with medical cost trends, and manage those trends to consistently achieve our target margins while maintaining higher standards of quality. The execution of our strategy and business model has been and will continue to be strong which is why we look to the future with a great deal of confidence. In conclusion, I want to extend my special thanks to our 19,000 associates who are dedicated to delivering access to high-quality healthcare to our members. It is my privilege to serve with such a committed and capable group of professionals. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials. Mark? Mark Keim : Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss some additional details on our fourth quarter and full year performance, the balance sheet redeterminations and our 2024 guidance. Beginning with our fourth quarter and full year results. For the quarter, we reported $9 billion in total revenue and $8.4 billion of premium revenue. I will note that total revenue includes approximately $380 million in reimbursement for our California MCO tax item that was retrospective to April. This item modestly distorts our reported G&A and margin ratios, but has no net economic consequence. On a consolidated basis, our fourth quarter MCR was 89.1% and our full year was 88.1%, reflecting continued strong medical cost management. Our full year consolidated MCR was consistent with our expectations and squarely in line with our long-term target range. In Medicaid, our fourth quarter reported MCR was 89.2%. The MCR included a moderate impact from the net effect of redetermination acuity shifts and corridors in several states, as well as some MCR pressure from the additions of our Iowa health plan and our My Choice acquisition. Across our Medicaid segment, the major medical cost categories were largely in line with our expectations and normal quarter-to-quarter trend fluctuations. Our full year Medicaid MCR was 88.7%, within our long-term target range and consistent with our expectations. In Medicare, our fourth quarter reported MCR was 93.3% and our full year was 90.7%, both above our long-term target range and impacted by increased utilization of supplemental benefits, in-home services and high-cost drugs. As Joe mentioned, we are confident that our 2024 bid strategy adjustments to benefit design as well as operational improvements will produce target margins in our Medicare business in 2024. In Marketplace, our reported fourth quarter MCR was 79.8%, reflecting our continued success in returning this business to target margins. Our full year Marketplace MCR of 75.3% was well below our long-term target range. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 7% as reported. However, when accounting for the California pass-through premium tax item, the ratio restates to 7.3%. This result includes new business implementation spending for new contract wins in California, Nebraska and New Mexico as well as expected seasonal expenditures from Medicare and Marketplace marketing. Our full year adjusted G&A ratio was 7.2%. Recognizing the California tax item in the fourth quarter, the full year G&A ratio restated to 7.3%. Turning to our Bright acquisition. We successfully closed the transaction effective this past January 1, at final price of $425 million net of tax benefits which was lower than our initially announced terms. The acquisition adds 109,000 members and contributes $1.6 billion in premium this year. We acquired the business with a premium deficiency reserve, which is expected to moderate first year losses, but we still expect the acquisition to be approximately $0.50 dilutive to 2024 adjusted EPS. Now that we have owned the business for six weeks, we have increased confidence in our assumption that the Bright acquisition will deliver an ultimate accretion of $1 per share as final run rate margin. Given the expectation of this modest lot in the first year, we are updating the 2024 new store embedded earnings from the Bright acquisition to $1.50 per share, reflecting this $0.50 of first year dilution. Moving on to Medicaid redeterminations. In the quarter, we estimate we lost 200,000 members driven by redeterminations, bringing the full year figure to approximately 500,000. We are now updating our estimate of members gained during the pandemic to 1 million to include new business additions in 2023 and 2024 as well as the legacy business. Given the high rate of procedural disenrollments rather than through verification, we are seeing a nearly 30% reconnect rate, consistent with previous quarters. As reconnects continue, we expect the membership losses just described to restate to a lower level over the coming months. We continue to project ultimately retaining 40% of our updated members gained, which implies a net loss of 600,000 from the redetermination process. The offsetting positive impact from our growth initiatives is significant. We ended 2022 with 4.8 million Medicaid members, and we expect to close out 2024 with 5.1 million members, a net 300,000 member growth over a two-year period, despite the losses from redetermination. Moving to Medicaid rates. We now have visibility into rates impacting approximately 80% of our 2024 premium. All but one of our states have now included an acuity adjustment for redetermination for 2024. We continue to work with our state partners to ensure appropriate rates through the normal rate cycle, retroactive or mid-cycle adjustments given the experience to date. We are confident that the requirement for actuarially sound rates will offset trends as they may emerge. Updated rates and trend assumptions have been considered in the 2024 Medicaid MCR that supports our guidance. Turning to our balance sheet. Our capital foundation remains strong. We harvested approximately $280 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter, and our parent company cash balance was approximately $740 million, a portion of which was used to fund the Bright Medicare acquisition just after the first of the year. Debt at the end of the quarter was 1.4 times trailing 12-month EBITDA with our debt-to-cap ratio at 36.3%. These ratios reflect our low leverage position and ample cash and capital capacity for additional growth and investment. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters, we are confident in the strength of our reserve position. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter was 50. Now some additional details on our 2024 guidance, beginning with membership. In Medicaid, we expect new membership from our recent new contract wins to add approximately 650,000 members. We expect to lose 100,000 members over the remainder of the redetermination process in 2024. The net result in 2024 year-end membership of approximately 5.1 million members or 12% growth year-over-year. In Medicare, the Bright acquisition added 109,000 members. Combined with our legacy business, we expect to end 2024 with 270,000 Medicare members, representing 58% growth year-over-year. In Marketplace, based on open enrollment, we expect to begin 2024 with approximately 320,000 members, representing 14% growth from year-end 2023. We expect growth to continue through the year, boosted by the redetermination conversions and ending with approximately 370,000 members, representing 31% growth year-over-year. We are still 75% silver, which bodes well for medical margin stability. Our 2024 premium revenue guidance is approximately $38 billion, representing 17% growth from 2023. Our revenue growth is comprised of several items, $3.3 billion of revenue tied to our recent RFP wins. To this, we add $2.4 billion of revenue from our recently closed acquisitions, including $1.6 billion from Bright and $800 million from a full year of My Choice Wisconsin. And finally, $1.7 billion of organic growth across Medicaid, Medicare and Marketplace. Partially offsetting these growth drivers is a higher estimated full year impact of $1.9 billion in decreased revenue from redeterminations. Moving on to earnings guidance. We expect 2024 full year adjusted earnings of at least $23.50 per share. Our EPS guidance reflects the realization of approximately $2 per share of 2023 new store embedded earnings, approximately $2 for the underlying organic growth across our current Medicaid and Medicare footprints, the realization of $0.75 benefit from the onetime nonrecurring implementation costs incurred in 2023, partially offset by $1.25 impact from redeterminations and $0.50 impact from the Bright acquisitions first year operating and carrying costs and finally, $0.25 from a conservative view of earnings contribution from investment income. Turning to MCR guidance. Our consolidated Medical Care Ratio is expected to be 88.2%. Our Medicaid MCR is expected to be 89%, at the high end of our long-term target range. This guidance reflects the inclusion of our significant new store growth, which runs at a higher MCR in the first year. Our legacy or same-store Medicaid MCR is expected to fall in the middle of our long-term range. We anticipate our Medicare MCR to be 88%, while at the high end of our long-term target range, the MCR reflects our expected success in our 2024 bid strategy adjustments to benefit design and various operational improvements. For Marketplace, we expect the MCR at the low end of the long-term target MCR range of 78% to 80%. Moving on to select P&L guidance metrics. We expect our adjusted G&A ratio to fall to 7% as new business implementation costs subside, and we leverage the increased scale of our business. Effective tax rate of 25.7%. Adjusted pretax margin of 4.6%, well within our long-term target range. Weighted average share count unchanged at 58.1 million shares. And our quarterly EPS will be weighted slightly heavier towards the second half of the year as we drive improved performance in our new business portfolio additions over the course of the year. Turning to embedded earnings. We ended 2023 with $5.50 per share of new store embedded earnings. Our 2024 guidance includes the realization of $2, resulting in a new base of $3.50. To this, we add $0.50 for the impact of Bright acquisitions first year loss, leaving us with $4 remaining at the end of 2024. We expect the majority of this to emerge in 2025 giving us further confidence in our 15% to 18% long-term growth rate for EPS. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe 2 things. On the Medicare MLR margin, it sounds like you're attributing your improvements you're expecting largely to benefit design changes and operational improvements. Any comment on what you're assuming relative to underlying utilization trends? And then just on the Medicaid, you're sounding like you'll be on the legacy business in the middle of your long term MLR targets. How are you thinking about margin profile coming out of redeterminations? Is there an opportunity for further improvement? Is it steady? Any thoughts on that? Joe Zubretsky : Sure, A.J. With respect to the Medicare MLR question, we have three components of medical costs that ran higher than expectations. One was LTSS hours on the Medicaid side of the MMP business. Second, high-cost drugs. And third, supplemental benefits, vision, dental, cash card, over the counter was a little too richly designed in 2023 to be honest. We pulled back on those benefits in our 2024 product design and bids. We reshaped some of the allowance-based benefits to be more managed, and we're confident that that cost category will come back into line. On LTSS hours on the Medicaid side of the MMP benefit, we know where, we know why, and those corrective actions are in place. And it's not unusual in a soft economy for in-home service hours to increase. So we are very confident in the restoration of our MCRs back to the top end of the range in Medicare to 88% in 2024. You also asked about the Medicaid MLR. And let me frame it this way, and then I'll turn it to Mark. The re-determination process actually unfolded exactly as we had planned and as we had predicted. The acuity shift was noticeable, but it was -- it wasn't dramatic and it wasn't significant, but it was noticeable. And that began to happen as the redetermination process began. We then said, and it occurred, that the first financial cushion would be the corridors, the payments into the corridors that existed in the latter half of 2023. That acted as a financial buffer. In the meantime, as the acuity shift became noticeable to our state partners, they began to introduce rate adjustments to account for the acuity shift. So going into 2024, the rate actions completely compensated for what we call [poor] (ph) medical trend, completely compensated for any acuity shift, and that's why we're able to print an MCR in Medicaid at the high end of the range at 89%, which includes a little bit of pressure from the new business that we put on the books. Mark Keim : Joe summarized that well. Look, we finished 88.7% in 2023 for Medicaid. And as Joe mentioned, that included a little bit of pressure from the acuity shift from redet, but also as we projected the benefit of some corridors. So really tracking exactly where we expect it. Here in the new year on our legacy book, trend roughly equals the rates that we're getting from our state partners. So on our legacy book into \u201824, we're roughly seeing about a flat MLR versus where we finished 2023. Now, why are we at an 89% in guidance? Just as Joe mentioned, we're adding significant new store business through both our acquisitions and a number of big wins. Whenever we have new store go into our portfolio, it tends to be a little bit hotter in the first year on an MLR. So we're seeing a pretty much flat carryover on legacy, a little bit of increased pressure on new store. That's how you get to that 89% that we have in our guidance. A.J. Rice: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : The next question comes from Cal Sternick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Cal Sternick : Yeah, thanks for the question. I wanted to ask about the Marketplace. It sounds like the book is running really well and I think you were a little bit more competitively priced this year than you were previously. So I guess first, is the expectation when we talk about mid-single digit to high single digit margins that you're within sort of that 5% to 7% range, do you expect to be towards the upper half of that, or maybe a bit above? And then second, how do you think about the market and the positioning for 2025? Do you think you're still going to maintain the current pricing position or do you expect to, I guess, be more competitive across your total footprint again? Joe Zubretsky : Our strategy in marketplace until we were satisfied that the risk pool was stabilized is to keep it as we say small, silver, and stable. But as the risk pool has stabilized, irrational pricing has pretty much left the market. We will allocate more capital to this business and we'll grow it at a rate that allows us to earn mid to high single-digit margins. That's the key for us. The risk pool can have inherent volatility and we believe that a margin target of 5% to 7% as you suggested is the right target margin and we will grow the business at a rate that allows us to achieve that target margin. We're very competitively positioned this year. We are in our silver product. We were number one and two in 30% of our counties this year as compared to 20% last year. 75% of the book is still silver. 50% of the book is renewal, which gives us good insight to capture appropriate risk scoring. The book is very well positioned to grow. 31% membership growth, 17% revenue growth just this year, and hopefully we'll be able to grow it at this rate in the future, all with the goal of achieving mid to high single-digit margins. Cal Sternick : All right, great. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : All right, great. Thanks. Maybe two questions as I get in. I guess the first one on the Medicare side, I just want to make sure I understand your commentary around MLR because you're bringing in Bright with a PDR, but you're still saying you are going to be at the overall target margin. You're talking about the core business being at target margin, or even with Bright losing money you'll be at target margin on the consolidated book. And then thinking about the exchanges, I guess there was potentially some issue about redetermination to kick people off and then the sickest part of that population comes onto the exchanges. Are you seeing any of that or does the risk pool benefit of lower subsidies just kind of make that not really an issue? Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : Thanks, Kevin. I'm going to kick it to Mark for detailed commentary on the Medicare MLR, but I think it's really important to frame the Medicare business and its component parts. They're somewhat different and situationally, they are quite different. You have $6 billion of revenue forecasted for 2024 in Medicare. $1.6 billion is Bright newly acquired, subject to the premium deficiency reserve, as you suggested, and Mark will explain that in a minute. $2.4 billion is our legacy [indiscernible] business, and $2 billion are the MMP demonstrations, where rates are received from CMS. You're not [bidding] (ph) against the benchmark. So the dynamics in the book of business are quite different. You need to look at the three components in order to develop your view of the various profitability components. But with that as the backdrop and the context, I'll kick it to Mark for detailed commentary and how you build the Medicare MLR, particularly with respect to Bright and the premium deficiency reserves. Mark? Mark Keim : Yeah, fantastic. Good morning, Kevin. So Bright comes to us with a PDR in place. With that PDR, the benefit goes into the MLR line and effectively reduces the MLR. So on the bright component, which is a third of our book, you'll see an MLR that's below our target range at the moment. On the DSNP, which is another third of our business, we're seeing a trend of probably around 4%. But overall, we're able to offset that and pull that into our target range. And of course, on MMP, which is the third component of the book, the rates that we're getting from our state and CMS partners, we feel are quite adequate to bring us all told to that ADA in our MLR guidance. Joe Zubretsky : With respect to your second question, if I remember correctly, it had to do with the exchanges and members coming off of the Medicaid roles into the exchanges. If you look at the last couple of years, membership has already always started the year at a higher point and ended the year at a lower point due to the natural attrition in the book. This year, we're starting the year at 320,000 members and plan to grow it to 370,000 by the end of the year. The natural attrition rate is still 2% or 3% inside that number, but we do plan to pick up more members from not only our own Medicaid plans, but competitors' Medicaid plans. I think we're seeing a penetration rate of people coming off Medicaid of about 10% of members lost. Mark, anything to add? Mark Keim : Yeah, in the past, when we picked up SEP members, they put a little pressure on our MLR. What we're seeing in the third and fourth quarter in \u201823, and what I expect into \u201824 is they'll come over at more sustaining and normalized levels. That is, they won't put pressure on, because they're coming off normal using services. There's not pent-up demand. They're not new to the product. So I'm expecting to see a good pickup on SEP, as we did in Q3 and Q4, and not pressure on the MLR. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron. Please go ahead. Josh Raskin : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Two for me as well. The health insurance exchange membership up 31%, but revenues up 17%. Is that state geography mix-related or is that reductions in prices and what's driving that versus a market that's generally raising prices? And then I'm still confused on Bright, how the target -- how the MLR for Bright that you're booking this year is below the target range, but you're actually increasing the embedded earnings by $0.50 to $1.50? Maybe just help us understand those two parts. Mark Keim : So a couple of things, and good morning, Josh. Our metallic mix has remained unchanged. So what you're seeing in Marketplace is not at all metallic or mix related. That's state footprint related. As you know, we're in 14 states, and our mix among the states, as we're more competitive in some, maybe not so much in others, our mix does shift a little bit. So that'd be the driver there. On Bright, on the PDR, with the PDR that was booked before we bought the business, that benefits the MLR and pulls it down to a level that's actually a little bit below our target range. Now remember, our target range is largely DSNP and MMP because that's our legacy Medicare book. On the bright with the PDR in the MLR line, it does pull it down a little bit below our target range. Josh Raskin : So how does that impact -- I'm just trying to -- so it feels like with the PDR, you guys will sort of reverse that through the year. How does the embedded earnings go up? Right. I'm confused with how is Bright, MLR low, but they're losing more money? Mark Keim : It's a good question and thanks for raising that. I knew we were going to get that sooner or later. So with the PDR, as you know, the PDR should largely normalize expected operating losses on a contract year. PDR accounting doesn't allow you to put all of the losses into the PDR. There are certain accounting matters that are still held out. So even with the PDR, I'll have a very small operating loss, Josh. But the other thing is when we talk about embedded earnings, we always include the carrying costs. The embedded earnings are essentially fully capitalized or fully funded for their carrying costs. So when I say I have about $0.50 of dilution this year, it's about half operating costs that aren't covered by the PDR and about half carrying costs. Remember we paid about a half billion. The opportunity cost or interest on that is maybe the other half of the $0.50. So as a result, I'm carrying a $0.50 hole in this year's EPS bridge. Since that's a $0.50 hole, I said I'd have $1 of ultimate benefit from this property. The dollar now goes to $1.50 because I'm going to crawl out of that hole over the next couple of years. Josh Raskin : Okay. Got it. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. I just want to follow up on Bright. So a few things here. First, can you give me the PDR number that you put through there for 2024? Mark Keim : Sure, we acquired the business with a $75 million PDR on the balance sheet. Justin Lake : Okay, and so you're saying the -- I understand the PDR getting it to normal levels potentially, but how does the PDR get it below normal MLR levels? Mark Keim : The PDR books all of the losses. It picks up a little bit of the G&A losses, with the medical cost losses, and books them into the medical cost line. So to the extent that there were some G&A items, it'll get picked up in the MLR line. It's just an accounting convention where the net of losses get picked up in one line item or the other. Justin Lake : Okay, so your point is that just thinking about the math of this, the MLR is going to go up next year because it's actually below normal and you're saying the SG&A will come down. Mark Keim : There will be a little bit of that, Justin. Justin Lake : Okay. And you expect to get this full dollar back plus in 2025? Joe Zubretsky : And that's the important point. The important point here, first of all, the first year losses were fully contemplated in the value we paid. So there was no surprise there. The business is running at a 92% MCR and a 14% G&A ratio. We plan to get the 92% down to 88% to 89% and the 14% down to 9% to 10%. So half to two thirds of the turn is G&A related and we have very, very clear line of sight to how to take their cost burden down from 14% to 9% or 10% where it should be. That dollar of accretion is expected to emerge in the third full year of ownership. First year protected by -- mostly protected by a PDR. Second year, breakeven to probably slightly profitable. Full dollar of accretion in the third full year of ownership. Getting the MCR from 92% down to 88% or 89%, getting the 14% G&A ratio down to 9% or 10%. Justin Lake : Got it. And then lastly, just on, there's a big RP as you know in Florida, I think a lot of anticipation there around when that might be communicated. My understanding is we're kind of into the second round in negotiations. I assume you can't tell us whether you're still kind of in the running there, but any idea given that given where you are today, any idea when you think that under normal conditions that MLR would be announced? Or should the RFP would be announced, not the MLR? Joe Zubretsky : Sure, sure. And we appreciate your sensitivity to the situation. Yeah, we observe the sanctity of all these bidding processes, including the ITN process, so we can't comment specifically on it. But look, as we -- yet we run a nice business in Florida. It's smaller than it used to be to regions. We used to be statewide back in 2017. It runs really well. We're the only four-star plant in Florida. And the same team that works on all our successful bids, our $12 billion of re-procured revenue and our $7 billion of new contract wins, that is the same team that worked on this. So we go into it with a great deal of confidence and we would hope to expand our footprint in Florida. There's $14 billion of Medicaid revenue in Florida regions where we are not currently represented. But let's see how the process plays out and hopefully something will be announced, awards will be announced sometime later this spring. Justin Lake : Thanks for the color. Operator : The next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Stephen Baxter : Hi, thanks. I appreciate all the commentary on your Medicaid expectations for the year. I was hoping you could help us think about the bridge from your Medicaid MLR exit in the year to your same-store Medicaid MLR in 2024, around the midpoint of the range. I'm curious if you think that the [core] (ph) could kind of get there earlier in the year because some of the one-one rate adjustments that we've been focused on, or do you think that'll take some time to work through the business and then other seasonal factors play out? Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : As a general framework for how we stay within our long-term range year-over-year, in fact, on the same story basis, almost equivalent, we talk about the redetermination process, which late in 2023 began to put pressure on the MLR until rates caught up with it. As Mark commented in his prepared remarks, we know about Medicaid rates on 80% of our revenue for 2024. That rate increase came in at 4%. So that blends to about 3.2%. We forecasted the other 20% at less than half that. So we have a 3.5% rate increase built into our 2024 guidance. And that was exactly commensurate with trend, trend even as influenced by the modest acuity shift that we and our state customers have observed. So pretty much business as usual. There's nothing, no medical cost category that needed to be accounted for or accommodated. It's actuarially sound rates impacted by acuity adjustments that 20 of 21 of our states included. And it was completely in line with our contemplated medical cost trend, even as influenced by an acuity shift. Mark, anything to add? Mark Keim : No, I think that's exactly right. As we look at the rates and the trend being roughly equal, our legacy book pretty much holds flat. As you know, we're bringing in a bunch of additional new business that puts a little more pressure in the first year, which rounds us out at the 89% that we have in guidance. Operator : The next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Nathan Rich : Hi, good morning and thanks for the questions. I wanted to ask on the Marketplace MCR, I guess moving back to the low end of the long-term range. So up about 300 basis points year-over-year. Can you just talk about what's driving that increase year-over-year? Is that just a function of the membership growth that you saw? And then have you thought of -- how, I guess, are you thinking about maybe the long-term target for that business? Is 78% to 80% still the right range to use? And then just one clarifying question for Mark. I think you said quarterly EPS is weighted towards the back half of the year. I think usually the back half is about 45% of the total year. So does that mean this year will be over 50% or is that not the right way to interpret the comment that you made? Thank you. Joe Zubretsky : David, I'll take the Marketplace question first. We were running really well in the middle of the 2023. Our experience was quite positive. So we consciously, consciously bid to grow the business modestly and moderately, as we suggested we would. And so we priced somewhat below the observed trend, not usually below the observed trend, but slightly below the observed trend, to essentially invest some of the excess margin. We earned nearly 10% pre-tax in that business in 2023. So in a sense, we invested some of the excess margin in growth, hence the 31% membership growth and 17% revenue growth. Mark, on the phasing -- quarterly phasing? Mark Keim : Yeah, absolutely. Nathan, and good morning. Yeah, you got it right. We're normally 55-45 on the front half versus the second half of the year. I'd almost flip that around this year because the dynamics are a little bit different. One, we put on a lot of new business this year. As you can see in our revenue bridge, we got $5.7 billion of new revenue coming into the company, which always comes in just a little bit warmer in the first year, but in the first quarters in particular. So I'm expecting to get some momentum on MLRs in Medicaid and Medicare as we kind of grow into our new footprint there. So that'll change the dynamic a little bit. The other thing is, and I think Joe touched on this, very often, Marketplace has attrition throughout the year such that Marketplace declines during the year. This year is a little bit different. With all the members rolling off on redet and us expecting to pick up our fair share of them in Marketplace as they convert, we'll see a growing book in Marketplace. And as you know, we've got some confidence on the margins given that we really prioritize margin over volume in Marketplace. So for those two reasons, you're going to see a little bit more of a back-end loaded EPS trajectory this year. I think that should address your question. Nathan Rich : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. Sarah James : Thank you. Can you clarify for us what you guys contemplated in for two midnights and V28 into your 2024 plan design and also for Bright? And when you mentioned the pressures that you were seeing on Medicare, you guys didn't flag outpatient or some of the inpatient trends that the rest of the group is seeing. So I wanted to clarify if you are seeing this? Joe Zubretsky : Hi, Sarah. I'll kick it to Mark for we have very detailed analysis of the changes in the risk adjustment rules and what it meant for our book. In answer to your second question, one of the reasons I articulated earlier the configuration of our book of business being somewhat different than what I call mainstream Medicare Advantage is that we have a low income, high acuity population. Our members are using services from the first day of the year to the last day of the year. They're chronic. They have comorbidities and are polychronic. And so the notion of discretionary utilization means far less to our business based on its mix than it might be to a mainstream population where discretionary or the pedic procedures are being done, screenings are taking place, perhaps, and up demand from the pandemic. In our book of highly chronic patients, high acuity members, that's less of a dynamic. And so the three cost categories that I articulated previously, LTSS hours, high cost drugs, GLP-1s, and the supplemental benefits were really the drivers in our book. Mark, do you want to take the risk adjustment question? Mark Keim : Sure. And I think, Sarah, it's important, as Joe mentioned, when we talk about Medicare, it's in fact three things. Your probably question is most aimed at the DSNP, or high acuity component of our Medicare, which is a third of the book. Obviously, it's less relevant to MMP. On the two things you mentioned, on the two midnight rule, I've seen a little bit of buzz about that lately, and we're a little bit surprised because it's certainly not new. And many of us have factored this in for quite some time. And what I always remind folks is even though there's a two midnight rule, providers still have to prove medical necessity, so there's really not a big window there for a change in trend or a change in risk adjustment issues as we can see it. On V28, it's got some interesting dynamics. It is certainly a drag in many places for folks, but there's an interesting dynamic around V28 and high acuity. On single-chronic, people use the example of diabetes, where there's diabetes, but there's some other conditions that kind of correlate or are highly associated with diabetes. V28 will be a reduction on risk adjustment for those kind of situations. But when there's polychronics where there's different comorbidities that are in fact quite different than each other, V28 is actually helpful. And in our high acuity chronic book, we actually have many of those polychronics. So we don't quite see the same dynamic that maybe some of the other folks do out there. Sarah James : That's helpful. And one more clarification if I could, just on your comment with the exchanges, I know you guys are guiding to a really favorable MLR for this year, but is there still a step-up in earnings as you mature this new book? I guess in other words, your year one is still slightly below target range, right, on new members? And then there would be an implied earnings lift as that book moves into the second year of operations? Joe Zubretsky : I'm not quite sure I've captured the essence of your question, but we are forecasting a 78% MCR for the year, which is at the low end of our long-term target range, which means we'll be operating high single-digit margins, certainly not the 10% pre-tax we achieved in 2023. But look, if you grow the book more aggressively, more of your members are going to be new to the book. And so you have to -- in our view, you have to strike a balance about how fast you're going to grow it and how many new members you want. Every new member that comes in, you need to find risk adjustment. If they come in during SEP, if they're chronic, you better find risk adjustment quickly or they won't get the profitability in the near term. So there's a -- very much a balance between what you get in annual enrollment, what you pick up in SEP, and how one thinks about how fast do I grow the book to achieve mid-single-digit margins when the maturity of the membership and the duration of the membership is pretty important to the stability of the risk pool. You have to balance those two factors. Sarah James : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : Yeah, good morning guys. And I think Nate and Sarah kind of covered everything I wanted to hit on the exchange, but I'll try to bring up one more topic, which is I guess, can you talk about underlying utilization trends and kind of cost growth trends there because it sounds like you guys priced the book for growth in 2024 but the utilization is going to kind of continue to remain low. So I guess I'm trying to parse the spread between utilization trends and price growth for the margin expansion. Kind of any color on that would be helpful? Mark Keim : And, George, your question is focused on Marketplace? George Hill : Yeah, Marketplace. Mark Keim : Yeah, look, as Joe has been very clear, we're prioritizing margin over volume in this business, and the way we do that is we keep it silver, which we believe is the best product for both the member and the payor. But we keep it stable, which means we continue to have really good renewals. As we look at our pricing objectives here, we're putting price into the market to make sure that we can defend reasonable margins here. We did concede a little bit of margin in our pricing for 2024 just because we were well below our target range. Remember our target range is 78% to 80% and we printed something a little bit south of that in \u201823. So there's no reason to leave volume on the table if we can put a little bit of price back, drive some volume and still hit our margin targets. Hope that helps. George Hill : It does. And maybe if I can just sneak in a quick follow-up. I know it's a tiny piece of the business. Could you talk about kind of the expected disruption in PDP in 2025 given the changes from IRA? Joe Zubretsky : I'm sorry, we had trouble hearing the last part of your question, George. PDP? George Hill : Yeah, but like I said, I know it's a tiny part of the business, but we're expecting kind of PDP to be pretty disruptive or disrupted in 2025 because of the IRA changes. I know it's a tiny part of the book, but if you guys have any commentary on what you're saying would be helpful. Mark Keim : Yeah. So on PDP, as you know, we don't price a PDP product and the IRA or the Inflation Reduction Act, as you're pointing out, is certainly a headwind for that sector, but that's not too relevant to our business, George. George Hill : Thank you. Operator : The last question today will come from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel : Thanks. Right before the bell here. I just was interested if you could walk us through your preliminary analysis on the 2025 MA advance notice and whether you're able to parse that down between the legacy business impact and then what you're projecting will be the preliminary impact on the Bright book? Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : Sure, Scott. I mean, on balance, our view is the same view that you've heard from others, is that the advance notice does not appear to be adequate to compensate for trends that we're all observing. I think in our book, if you take the CMS advance notice and project it to our book, I think we're projecting about a 50 basis point, 0.5 point of rate increase, which we believe is, along with others, is insufficient, and we'll see where the final notice comes out. It usually comes out, as you know, better than that. But our view is not any different from anybody else's. Mark Keim : Yeah, just to build on that, and a lot of this data is in the public domain at this point. On the effective benchmark rates in the advance notice and then risk or normalization, most folks are seeing across the entire market, the net of those at about zero, right? As Joe mentioned, we see a net of about a positive 50 bps. So we're a little bit better on the benchmark rate, and we're a little bit not so bad on the risk score normalization for some reasons I alluded to earlier. So we're seeing about a 50 BP benefit there, and obviously the rest of STARS impact and what ultimately everyone does with risk scores has yet to play out. But that's our initial point on the legacy book. Scott Fidel : Thanks. And then just to clarify, so the 50 bps, that's for the overall book, right? And then I would assume that, [directionally] (ph) the legacy book probably better in the Bright book, a little worse than the legacy in that? Is that a fair assumption? Mark Keim : We're still working our way through that. There will be a couple things going on there. As I mentioned earlier, we're six weeks into owning it. We're working through those issues with the team there. There will also be a bunch of dynamics that happen this year. There are actually two entities there. One is Community Health Plan, and the other one, Brand New Day. There will be some issues between them on exactly how we balance the effects of all this between those two entities. So a little bit of work there and not ready to comment on that one. Joe Zubretsky : But I would say that we're not anticipating in any analysis when completed on rates that would move us off of achieving the $1 accretion in the third full year of ownership. We're pretty confident in that trajectory. Scott Fidel : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session and also concludes the conference call.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host today, Jeffrey Geyer. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Geyer : Good morning, and welcome to Molina Healthcare's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our first quarter 2024 earnings was distributed after the market closed yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those of you who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that all of the remarks are made as of today, Thursday, April 25, 2024, and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. On this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the first quarter 2024 earnings release. During the call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our 2024 guidance, Medicaid redeterminations, our recent RFP awards and related revenue growth, our recent acquisitions and M&A activity, our long-term growth strategy, our embedded earnings power and future earnings realization and our Medicare business performance in 2025. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors, discussed in our Form 10-K annual report filed with the SEC as well as our risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe? Joseph Zubretsky : Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Today, I will cover our traditional quarterly topics, our reported financial results for the first quarter, which were in line with our expectations, highlighted by $5.73 of earnings per share. An update on our guidance, which we reaffirm at $38 billion of premium revenue and at least $23.50 in earnings per share and an update on our growth initiatives, which in the quarter were mixed, but we are maintaining our $4 per share estimate of embedded earnings and our long-term growth outlook. Let me start with our first quarter performance. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.73, a $9.5 billion of premium revenue, supported by excellent operating metrics across all lines of business. Our 88.5% consolidated MCR reflects continued strong medical cost management with all 3 segments reporting MCRs, in line with our expectations. We produced a 4.5% adjusted pretax margin or 3.4% after tax, a very strong result that is in the middle of our long-term target range. In Medicaid, we continue to deliver strong operating margins while growing our franchise as the business produced a first quarter MCR of 89.7%. Our expanded platform in California and our new Nebraska health plan, together, added over 0.5 million members and along with our new store additions in late 2023, drove an increase in the MCR above our long-term target range, but in line with our quarterly expectations. We believe we have now experienced approximately 90% of the Medicaid redetermination impact. The acuity shift unfolded as we predicted and appears to have stabilized in most of our markets. Rate changes, both on cycle and off-cycle largely offset the security shift with risk corridors capturing any temporary shortfall. Medicaid rates remain actuarially sound with 19 states that represent over 95% of our revenue, providing acuity-related rate adjustments within 2024. Turning to Medicare. Our first quarter reported MCR was 88.7%, our performance in line with our expectations. The higher utilization we experienced in the second half of 2023 due to higher LTSS costs and pharmacy utilization continued into 2024. But the operational improvements and supplemental benefit adjustments to be made in our legacy business have thus far proven to be successful. Our first quarter experience of the newly acquired Bright Medicare plans provides us with confidence in our turnaround plan to deliver the embedded earnings. Our strategy of leveraging our existing Medicaid footprint to serve high acuity, low-income Medicare beneficiaries is working well. In Marketplace, the first quarter MCR was 73.3% and in line with our expectations. Our membership mix comprised 50% renewal members and 70% of members in our silver product. Strong renewals gives us keen insight into the acuity of our membership base. We continue to expect this business to grow throughout the year as the Medicaid redetermination process provides a great opportunity to capture membership during the special enrollment period. Turning now to our guidance for the full year. Based on our consolidated first quarter results, we reaffirm our full year 2024 adjusted earnings per share guidance of at least $23.50 or 13% year-over-year growth. Our full year premium revenue remains unchanged at approximately $38 billion or 17% year-over-year growth. While we are seeing increased underlying strength in our core business, we are maintaining our full year guidance to account for any potential earnings headwind in the second half of the year from potential contract losses in Virginia and Florida. Our 2024 revenue and EPS guidance provides a strong foundation for profitable growth in 2025 and beyond. Now some comments on our growth initiatives. In Medicaid, we had mixed success in the quarter. We were awarded a large RFP win in Texas and a large reprocurement win in Michigan, but we're not awarded contracts in 2 other existing states, Virginia and Florida. All these impacts combined caused no net change to our embedded earnings, which remains at $4 per share. Let me provide some commentary on these RFP outcomes. In Texas, the state announced its intent to award us all 7 of our preferred service areas as part of the STAR and CHIP programs. This contract is expected to begin in September 2025 and last for 6 years with the option to extend up to an additional 6 years. The award expands our footprint and increases our market share. We successfully defended our position in Michigan and were awarded a contract in 6 regions. While these regions represent 93% of our current membership, the award reduced the number of payers in many of our retained regions and thus, we expect to grow our market share. We were very disappointed with the outcome in the Virginia RFP, but we are exercising our right to challenge this decision. We were also disappointed with the RFP result in Florida, but history has shown that the ultimate outcome there could be more favorable. We will continue to refine our membership, revenue and embedded earnings estimates as we gain clarity on the new contracts, our expanding market share and the unwinding of any lost revenue. Now with respect to future growth initiatives, our growth pipeline remains replete with opportunity. Regarding RFPs, many opportunities remain with over $60 billion of premium opportunity up for bid over the next 3 years. This includes in-flight RFP bids in 2 states, Kansas and Georgia, and a projected near-term RFP in North Carolina. The Texas STAR Kids program is likely going to RFP soon, where we now have a very strong statewide presence and great momentum. We remain confident in our ability to win new state contracts and deliver clinical and financial outcomes that align with the needs of our state partners. Although this quarter's RFP results were mixed, since we began our growth strategy, we are 7 for 9 in reprocurements and 8 for 10 in new business procurements. This track record gives us great confidence in our strategy and our continued ability to drive growth. With respect to M&A initiatives, our acquisition pipeline contains many actionable opportunities. We have executed 8 transactions totaling $11 billion in revenue over the past 4 years, and M&A will continue to be a key component of our strategy. Next, as we look forward into 2025, 2 comments about the outlook for our Medicare portfolio. First, our Medicare product profile has different characteristics than mainstream MAPD business. Our business is a combination of legacy D-SNP, MNP demonstrations and our newly acquired Bright business. With this lineup of products, factors such as rate setting, bidding and revenue drivers do matter, but to a lesser extent. Second, the product portfolio is well positioned to contribute to our growth. Our penetration in dual eligible populations, high acuity and dual income will benefit from further integration of Medicare and Medicaid benefits. BMS recently announced rules to closely align dual-eligible populations with Medicaid MCOs, which means our Medicaid footprint will be a growth catalyst for attracting and retaining dual-eligible membership. With our 2024 guidance reaffirmed, we remain committed to delivering on our long-term premium and earnings per share growth earnings. With all of the successful growth activity in M&A in new and expanded contracts, even considering the potential for contract losses or reductions, we maintain our embedded earnings outlook at $4 per share. Mark will provide insight on the components in a moment, but the majority is still expected to emerge in 2025. In summary, we are very pleased with our first quarter 2024 financial and operating performance. That performance, combined with our successful track record for producing top line revenue keeps us on track for sustaining profitable growth consistent with our long-term targets. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials. Mark? Mark Keim : Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss additional details on our first quarter performance, the balance sheet, our 2024 guidance and thoughts on embedded earnings. Beginning with our first quarter results. For the quarter, we reported approximately $10 billion in total revenue and $9.5 billion of premium revenue with adjusted EPS of $5.73. Our first quarter consolidated MCR was 88.5% and reflect continued strong medical cost management. The change health care outage did not materially impact quarterly results, and all of our segments reported MCRs in line with our expectations. In Medicaid, our first quarter reported MCR was 89.7% as expected, the new store additions in California and Nebraska as well as Iowa and the My Choice Wisconsin acquisition in late 2023 drove a higher reported MCR in the first quarter. Recall, we have added approximately 800,000 Medicaid members in the past 3 quarters, and these new store members typically experience higher MLRs in the early stages. Across our Medicaid business, the major medical cost categories were largely in line with our expectations and the normal quarter-to-quarter trend of fluctuations within our guidance. In Medicare, our first quarter reported MCR was 88.7%, in line with our expectations. Higher LTSS costs and pharmacy utilization continued in our legacy business but were somewhat offset by the operational improvements and benefit adjustments that we implemented for 2024. Segment results now include the newly acquired Bright plans with initial performance as expected. In Marketplace, our first quarter reported MCR was 73.3%, and we are pleased with the high renewal rates and significant silver membership composition. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 7.1%, as expected, reflecting operating discipline and the continued benefit of fixed cost leverage as we grow our business. Moving on to Medicaid redeterminations. In the quarter, we estimated a net loss of 50,000 members due to redeterminations. This was on track with our expectations and brings the total net loss from redetermination since its inception to 550,000. We estimate that our membership is approximately 90% of the way through the redetermination process. We expect to lose another 50,000 members in the second quarter, the last quarter of pandemic-related redeterminations to reach our total estimated net loss of 600,000. Our reconnect rate was 30%. We expect this rate to remain near 30% in the second quarter. And of course, some of the reconnect benefit will continue into the third quarter and beyond. We continue to see strong marketplace SEP membership growth as Medicaid members losing eligibility moved to Molina Marketplace products. Turning to our balance sheet. Our capital foundation remains strong. On January 1, we closed the Bright acquisition at a final price of approximately $425 million, funded with cash on hand. In the quarter, we harvested approximately $110 million of subsidiary dividends, bringing our parent company cash balance to $194 million at the end of the quarter. Debt at the end of the quarter was unchanged and 1.4x trailing 12-month EBITDA with our debt-to-cap ratio at about 35%. These ratios reflect our low leverage position and ample cash and capital capacity for additional growth and investment. In the quarter, both S&P and Moody's upgraded our credit ratings based on our low debt, stable earnings profile and high transparency. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter was 49% and consistent with prior quarters. While the Change Healthcare outage impacted our February operations with claims 20% lower than normal, we're pleased to report that our quick response through alternative clearing houses restored claims and payments to near normal levels in March. Given the mid-quarter disruption, we have been appropriately prudent and are confident in the strength of our reserve position. Next, a few comments on our 2024 guidance. As Joe mentioned, we reaffirm our full year guidance with premium revenue of approximately $38 billion. Our revenue guidance remains unchanged as we work with state partners to understand the timing and impact of any contract losses in Virginia and Florida. Our full year consolidated MCR is unchanged at 88.2%. Medical cost trends are in line with expectations across all businesses, and we remain appropriately conservative in our outlook on utilization and acuity trends at this stage in the year. We continue to expect full year EPS of at least $23.50 per share. We see underlying strength in our core business. However, we are maintaining our full year guidance of recognizing any potential earnings headwinds in the second half of the year from potential contract losses in Virginia and Florida. Looking ahead to 2025, a few observations on our Medicare portfolio. The CMS final rate notice for Medicare Advantage has received a lot of attention. For Molina, it's important to note that only 2/3 of our Medicare segment revenue or only 10% of total enterprise revenue is fully subject to these rates. With a heavy concentration in California, we yielded a more favorable rate profile than CMS national averages. The remaining 1/3 of our Medicare segment, the MMP demonstrations received rates determined by CMS and our state partners, which continue to be appropriately commensurate with cost trends. We remain confident that the rate environment and our product profile will position us to grow our Medicare business profitably. The integration of our recent Bright acquisition is off to a great start. Recall that we are expecting modest dilution from Bright this year. We expect an improvement to break even in 2025 and then full run rate accretion of $1 EPS in 2026. Looking at our Medicare segment from a different perspective. As Joe mentioned earlier, we believe that the recent CMS 2025 final role, strategically advantaged us to grow. Currently, many dual eligible members received their medicated Medicare benefits from 2 different MCOs. CMS announced rules that will move these unaligned dual members to the D-SNP plan run by their Medicaid MCO. As such, incumbent Medicaid players will see increased growth opportunities in D-SNP. While the new rule will phase in over time, it's clear that our substantial Medicaid footprint positions us well to grow our D-SNP product to serve due eligible members. This shift, along with demand from state partners to service these complex populations gives us confidence, our Medicare portfolio will meet our long-term growth and margin targets. Turning to embedded earnings. We continue to guide to $4 of new store embedded earnings as we now expect approximately $0.80 from the new contract win in Texas incepting next year to be offset by our best estimate of next year's impact of the Virginia and Florida potential losses. We expect the majority of this new store embedded earnings to emerge in 2025 with the remainder in 2026. giving us further confidence in our 15% to 18% long-term growth rate for EPS. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from Kyle Sternick with JPMorgan. Kyle Kristick : I guess, first, I wanted to start on the guidance here, is -- you talked about the strength in the core business and the MCR sort of being in line with your expectations. So I guess, is the right way to think that the strength is really coming from G&A? And then when we think about the back half is -- I guess, is the outperformance in the current business enough to allow you to maintain guidance? Or if you think about the -- those potential contracts going away, are there additional SG&A savings you'd need to target in the back half to be able to offset those losses? Just any color to help us frame that would be great. Joseph Zubretsky : Okay. We are clearly saying that if we have a revenue loss in the third and fourth quarters due to the contract losses and the related earnings, the strength of the core business will produce enough earnings power to offset that. And it's no one thing. It's just general performance of all our portfolios. The loss ratios in our Medicaid and Medicare business get better as the year progresses for a variety of reasons.  Obviously, in marketplace, it's higher in the back half due to the normal seasonality of that business. But there is 90 basis points of improvement projected in the Medicaid of MCRs in the last 3 quarters of the year and 90 basis points of improvement in the Medicare MCRs in the second, third and fourth quarters. So it's just general performance of the business. The seasonality happens for a variety of reasons, general strength of the business to offset any potential earnings drag from potentially lost contracts. Kyle Kristick : Got it. And then I wanted to ask about the SNP regs as well. Specifically, how does that change your strategic thinking about M&A. I mean, I think the bright deal is really the first big Medicare asset begun purchased. Does this change the way you think about whether you'd be more biased towards MA or Medicaid? Or is it really just more motivation to sort of double down on the organic growth? . Joseph Zubretsky : It doesn't really change our M&A strategy. I mean we look for opportunities across all of [indiscernible], most of our M&A activity has been in Medicaid, but the Bright acquisition represents first M&A opportunity that we actioned in Medicare. But what we're really saying is the fact that we have this 20-state footprint in Medicaid and growing. The decent opportunity is just one more way to monetize your significant Medicaid footprint. And the fact that we have a very robust and very operationally excellent decent business. Those 2 platforms combined will allow us to participate in the duly eligible population growth rate that's going to happen here over the next number of years. So we're very, very pleased with the final rule that came out from CMS, which basically says that Medicaid will be the anchor tenant for action in the dual eligible population. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Joshua Raskin : Just to go back on the Virginia and Florida. I heard the $0.80 from Texas and then the offset Virginia, Florida. Is that $0.80 an annual number? And is it, say, $0.40, $0.45 for 2024 specifically? And then just a second question on the M&A pipeline, a follow-up there as well. I'm curious if your experience with the acquisition of Bright and then the 2025 rate update. Has that changed the way you thought about Medicare Advantage? Joseph Zubretsky : I'll kick it to Mark for the question on the Florida and Virginia earnings. Go ahead. Mark Keim : On Virginia and Florida, just to set the stage, we think right now, that's about a $2 billion revenue run rate and about $1.10 on EPS full year. Now the simplifying assumption is we lose both in the fourth quarter, the headwind would be $0.5 billion on revenue and $0.30. But look, we're still working that through. Those are under protest and exactly what the timing is, is somewhat unclear. But if you deposit that assumption, it would be a $0.30 component to this year's guidance. which, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, is offset by the underlying strength of the business. So if the full run rate is $1.10, we recognized $0.30 this year, what's left is $0.80 for embedded earnings. -- and that is exactly offset by the $0.80 of accretion we see in STAR and CHIP. Joseph Zubretsky : Josh,and your second question related to Bright now that we've owned the business for a full quarter, we are very optimistic and confident in the $1 of ultimate accretion. The way to think about that business is actually very simple. Operationally breakeven in year 1 with a slight earnings drag related to the carrying costs, breakeven in your -- operationally breakeven in year 2. And full $1 accretion in year 3 and we get there by -- we inherited a 95% MCR in the business. We've managed it to 87%. We inherited a 13% G&A ratio in the business. We managed to 8%, that's 1,300 basis points of turnaround, which on $1.6 billion of revenue would show you how we get to the full accretion. The G&A savings will likely happen sooner as we need to go through 2 pricing cycles to get the MCR down to 87%. But now that we've owned it for a quarter and have excellent line of sight to the operating metrics and the dynamics of the business we're very confident in producing that portion of our embedded earnings. Operator : And the next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Stephen Baxter : Two questions for you. Just first, I was hoping you could potentially spike out the new store Medicaid impact to MLR? And then when you think about the 90 basis point improvement that you're talking about, how much of that is normal seasonality versus maybe new store coming down or maybe just getting back some of the last bit of acuity adjustment? And then the second question is just on the Medicaid deal pipeline. I think your last announcement on that front? I know they still take a long time to close was in July, I think, 2022. I was just wondering if you could give us an update on the pipeline there? And it seems like maybe there's been some slowdown maybe as reformation distribution, maybe it's now just kind of hear when you think about the pipeline in Medicaid over the next 6 to 12 months. Joseph Zubretsky : Stephen, I'll answer the first question first and then kick it to Mark on the Medicaid MCR. The Medicaid MCR of 89.7% in the quarter was as expected and heavily influenced by 20% of the member month volume in the quarter was on new business, either new business that came in from California and Nebraska on [ 11 ] or our -- second half of our Iowa contract from 2023 in the My Choice acquisition. That new business runs in the '90s. So you can do the math. That created pressure on the Medicaid MCR in the first quarter. As we work through the Molina playbook, operational improvements across all the dimensions of managed care, that performance improves, second, third and fourth quarter, which really creates a very different tilt to the way the earnings pattern is emerging this year versus prior years. It starts out high and improved throughout the year. As I said, the MCRs in the last few quarters are 90 basis points better than the first and we're still on target to hit 89% in our full year guidance on Medicaid, which is at the top end of our long-term target range. Mark? Mark Keim : Stephen, I'd just add to that. A year ago, our Medicaid MCR was 88.4%. This quarter, the legacy NCR was very close to that. So as Joe mentioned, coming out at 89.7% is a function of that new store MCR, which comes in hot. And recall, we said that this year, margins and earnings were a little bit back-end loaded consistent with our expectations. We came out really right where we expected. On the deal pipeline, I wouldn't say it slowed down. It's always fits and starts. What's most important to Joe and I is we constantly have a pipeline of advanced stage discussions. Sometimes they're banker processes, but just as often, they're one-off bespoke discussions, relationship development where we're out selling the Molina story, which is very appealing to many not-for-profits. So we've got a good pipeline of both if we could waive our wand and time them exactly where we want it, you might have seen one this quarter. But look, we are always hopeful that the pipeline is developing. We like what we see. So stay tuned on that. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Kevin Fischbeck : Can you talk a little bit about how redeterminations are going, both from the Medicaid and the exchange side of things. It sounds like you're 90% done, but you still expect strong growth on the exchanges. I guess when should that tailwind kind of be fully into the numbers? And then on the Medicaid side, you talked about a 30% recapture rate. Just trying to see any details about the acuity of that population. Joseph Zubretsky : I'll start off and then I'll kick it to Mark, but just to recap the entire redetermination process from start to finish. We estimate that at the high of the PHE, we have grown 1 million members due to the pause in the redetermination process. We are now projecting to lose 600,000 of those, 550,000 lost to date, another 50,000 in the second quarter. we have been experiencing a 30% reconnect rate. And once the redetermination process stops, that reconnect rate will continue on into the late spring and perhaps even into the summer. We are seeing a significant increase in our special enrollment in marketplace. Now whether you're coming in from Medicaid or not is a self-reporting feature. So we don't have exact statistics on how many are coming from other companies' Medicaid roles. But we've been averaging 12,000 to 15,000 SEP members in prior quarters, and that's double. It's up to 30,000 hour, which is obviously being heavily influenced by members coming off of Medicaid into marketplace. Mark, anything to add? Mark Keim : Yes. If you look at our marketplace, we reported 346,000 members in the first quarter. We'll go to 370,000 per our original guidance. That's unchanged. And that's on the continued strength of folks coming in from redeterminations, which is obviously an anomaly this year. Remember, Marketplace always had normal lapses through the year. So typically, marketplace volumes declined through the year. in this case, will increase through the year to our guidance of 370,000.I think you asked about the reconnect rate. We're still seeing 30% on reconnects coming back in. And both the folks coming in to marketplace as well as the reconnects, we're not seeing an anomaly on the MORs that would really change our outlook for the year. So pretty much right on track, Kevin, right where we want to be. . Operator : And the next question comes from A.J Rice with UBS. Albert Rice : Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe just to follow on that last train of thought, but a little different focus. Obviously, as we move into next year, you'll have given the redeterminations will subside as we get through the summer. you'll have the full impact of whatever change on the acuity risk pool there is, for legacy, people to stay on the Medicaid. When you sort of look at that at this early date, you got -- you signaled that you got these decent rate increases proactively in 17 states this year. Do you need a second year, do you think, of above-average rate increases when that acuity is fully reflected in the run rate for all of next year? And what is the timing on knowing whether you're getting adequate rate increases for next year? Joseph Zubretsky : Let me recap where we are in the rate environment, and then I'll kick it to Mark for some more color. We couldn't be more pleased with the way our state customers have responded to having rates be commensurate with normal cost trends and trends that have been influenced by the acuity shift. We received acuity-related adjustments in 19 states, representing 95% of our revenue. We had 5 retroactive rate adjustments, and we're actually anticipating perhaps 4 more. So the states have been very responsive and rates have been actual really sound. Look, we're guiding to the top end of our MCR rate for the entire year at 89%, and that's with 2 very unprecedented phenomenon going on in the book of business. One is the unprecedented shift in the national [indiscernible] due to the redetermination process, and the other is bringing on 800,000 new members that committed higher MCRs. With those 2 found on influencing how medical costs emerge, producing an MCR at the high end of our long-term range is something we're very, very pleased with. The answer is no. We expect rates next year to be actually sound, we expect them to be commensurate with the medical cost trends we're experiencing, fee schedule increases, benefits carved in and out, that's the normal process, and we have every reason to believe that rates will be actually sound going into next year. Mark, anything to add? Mark Keim : You mentioned the rate increase is kind of proactive, there probably more reactive, right, as so many of the states react to observe trends as opposed to proactively put it in. I wish they did. But as Joe mentioned, we're okay with the rate increases for this year. The rate increases we've seen look like they match the trend we're expecting. In we saw the acuity impact on trend really level off. And I think that's commensurate with the volume. So far, we've had 550,000 members leave only 50,000 were in this last quarter. So it's really leveled off. And we've seen a similar impact with the reAcquity-- redebt acuity impact here. So right now, I'd say rates look okay for the year. If they're not, the good news is 50% of our revenue comes up for new rates every January 1 which means if there's back half pressure this year, it's time really well for January 1 on the next rate cycle. Albert Rice : Okay. And maybe if I could just ask on the Marketplace product. Obviously, the last 1, 1.5 years, you've been focused on repricing and margin. Now that you sort of have gotten that in place. Any update on your long-term strategy toward marketplace and growing that? Or what's your thought on that? Joseph Zubretsky : Sure. A.J., the small silver and stable strategy was a short-term reaction to having to re-position the business to maintain a profile of single digit -- mid-single digit pretax margins. That was a temporal way to look at the business. we invested about 300 basis points of what call excess margin from last year into the business this year, and that's why we're growing membership at 30% and premium revenues are growing at 20%. So we like the nice steady progression of the business. We do expect to grow it. But being in the insurance business as long as I have, you never try to grow any portfolio organically that quickly because when underwriting isn't allowed, which -- that's what this product is, you have to be very wary of where you're bidding against the market, who else is in the market and where your results are coming out for the prior year. So we're going to be cautious. But the nice steady growth we saw this year feels really good to us. We're able to maintain a profile of high single-digit pretax margins and grow at this rate I think that's what to expect. Operator : The next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Justin Lake : A couple of questions here. First, last quarter, Joe, you mentioned an expectation that the company had visibility to grow EPS at the low end of your 15% to 18% outlook for 2025. Is that still the expectation? And then secondly, Joe, you mentioned that you're assuming in Texas or it looks like you're assuming in Texas that you get an average amount of share of the state from your new wins meaning there's 4 plants in a region, you get 25%.  First, is that correct? And then second, what are the level of visibility here? The reason I ask is that your local regional market share in Medicaid varies pretty broadly by state across plans. Texas, your share currently appears to be in the high-single digits versus a state like Washington, where I recall you have way above average share. I'm just curious on your visibility on getting that. Joseph Zubretsky : Yes. Justin, the -- last quarter, we gave you the building blocks for an outlook into 2025, and we have not changed our view of those building blocks. Obviously, embedded earnings still at $4, we have actually changed the composition of that and how those emerge in upcoming years has changed slightly. But the building blocks haven't changed. We continue to harvest earnings out of our existing footprint. We talked about operating leverage, talk about embedded earnings. Obviously, there likely will be a natural headwind from interest rate declines into next year. So the building blocks haven't changed, and that's still our forward look for 2025, again, not guidance, but an outlook. On Texas, we don't know. We used very conservative estimates of what our market share would likely to be in the 7 regions that we won and use kind of the average portfolio margins. I don't think there's anything more to read into it than that. We think it's a conservative and reasonable estimate of what that business will produce. Justin Lake : So can you share that market share assumption? Joseph Zubretsky : I don't -- it's far too early, and we don't want to get ahead of our customer on that. So we'll wait and see until we have more visibility into how membership will be allocated. I think that's the prudent thing to do here. Operator : The next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Nathan Rich : I wanted to ask on Florida. Joe, I think you talked about the protests and the ultimate outcome could be different. I guess I'd be curious to get your view, Florida kind of shifted to more of a comprehensive care model in the state. And in your view, does that create, I guess, more friction than normal for the appeals process and potential changes there? And then as a follow-up, I wanted to ask if you had an updated view on the $46 billion revenue target by 2026.  Obviously, that included some assumption for RFP wins, but there are a number of other factors in that bucket. So just curious if you still feel like that's the right shooting point for 2026 revenue. Joseph Zubretsky : In, on Florida, we're not making a prediction on how the process will unfold. We're citing historical precedent. Historical precedent would suggest that this is not the end, it's sort of the beginning of the end of the process. that there's more discussions that will take place. So I don't want to, again, get ahead of the state on this. But if you look at the past 2 procurements in Florida, there have been extended conversations and there are regions in Florida that still do not have maximum awards given. So again, just citing historical precedent. On the $46 billion of revenue, but we have a $60 billion new contract pipeline. Kansas and Georgia are sitting out there currently live and in process. as I mentioned, Texas STAR Kids. We have great momentum in the State of Texas. North Carolina, we didn't be down North Carolina last time because it was too early in our turnaround plan to bid on anything. So we're looking at the $60 billion pipeline and feeling pretty good about our prospects there. Look, we're for 7 for 9 reprocurements and we started our growth journey. We're 8 for 10 and new business wins. We have 8 M&A transactions totaling $1 billion of revenue over the past 4 years. We're feeling really good about the long-term revenue target here and our ability to produce continued 13% to 15% revenue growth and 15% to 18% earnings per share growth. Nothing's changed. And our trajectory here, even though we're disappointed with the 2 RFP situations in the second quarter -- in the first quarter. Operator : The next question comes from Gary Taylor with TD Calin. Gary Taylor : I had 2 policy questions actually. One, just because I get asked a lot just about the expiring ACA credits for 2026, maybe leaving aside whether or not they get renewed and the politics of that. Just wondering, from a technical basis, how are you guys thinking about sort of elasticity of demand for exchange product, if some of the income level categories see a fairly material percentage change in the premium that would be required, just what you're thinking now, if end of the worst case, those went away. What the impact might be, how much is retained. And then the second question would just be the big Medicaid rule that was out earlier this week, managed care, Medicaid rule. I think we were primarily focused on the state-directed payments changes there, but I know there are a few things on MCO transparency, MLR reporting changes. I just wanted to see if there's anything that you felt was material to you going forward. Joseph Zubretsky : On the -- I believe your first question was on the enhanced subsidies for Marketplace. I understand it -- it's hard to say. -- bear in mind, they do go away unless legislation is passed to extend them. That's -- sometimes that's misunderstood. They are going away because the subsidy enhancement was temporary. and a less legislation is passed to extend them they will. Now I can go through all types of political scenarios and legislative scenarios. There's lots of people who think that, that can easily be given up for an extension of the Trump tax cuts. I'm not going to make any political conclusions here, but it's probably a 50-50 push on how that gets done and if it gets done. We did not grow significantly when those enhanced subsidies came in because our members, keep in mind, we leverage our Medicaid footprint. We go after highly subsidized, low-income members and we didn't benefit a lot by the enhanced subsidies as most of our membership was already very, very highly subsidized. So from our perspective, we're not looking at it as a huge issue for us in terms of membership loss. And that's the way I would answer the first part of your question. The second part had to do with which ruling. I want to make sure I understood your question. Gary Taylor : The managed care, the Medicaid managed care access finance quality accrual that was out earlier this week. Joseph Zubretsky : Not significant. We're still analyzing it. We're obviously aware of it. We're analyzing it. lots of different features to it, many of which incept over very extended periods of time. So there's nothing to immediately react to. But nothing in that guideline changes of the long-term trajectory of the business. As I've said many times, I often asked, is there any political legislative or judicial environmental issue that causes you major concern on the viability of the businesses you're in. And the answer is no. The way the election comes out, whether Congress is split, whether things can get done vis-a-vis the 60 votes in the Senate needed to do something fundamental, the reconciliation process, et cetera. We don't -- we think the legislative and political scenarios are pretty neutral for the sustainability of the businesses we're in. Mark Keim : Gary, the one thing I would point out is certainly when they streamline Medicaid and chip eligibility and all the procedural items that folks have to go through to maintain or get eligibility, it just makes it easier for the appropriate coverage to go to the right people, and we think that's obviously a good tailwind for our business. Operator : The next question comes from George Hill, Deutsche Bank. George Hill : Joe, just a high-level question. One of your peers this week talked about a normalized individual MA margin of 3% or better. I know that your book of business is a little bit different. But I was just wondering if you guys would be willing to kind of speak to what you think the normalized margin profile of individual MA is and kind of how you think that varies between the D-SNP book and the individual book. And I know that you guys have a heavily subsidized population. So the book is a little bit different, but I appreciate any color. Joseph Zubretsky : Yes. Well, our target for our Medicare business is mid-single-digit pretax. I wasn't sure whether you're referring to pretax or after tax, our NCR range for the products we're in is 87% to 88%. As we said, we hope to get -- not hope. We're projecting to get right down to 87% here over the next couple of years. So we still target mid-single-digit pretax margins in this business. We like the D-SNP business not only can produce excellent profits, but monetizing our Medicaid footprint for dual eligible population here over time is going to be a significant growth category for us. So we're perfectly positioned, but at least we're well, well positioned to take advantage of the growth in the deorgible population here, and we still target mid-single-digit pretax margins, MCRs in the 87% to 88% range. Mark Keim : George, the only thing I'd add is it's really hard to compare a Molina book of business to some of our big competitors in Medicare. Remember, we skew really heavily to the dual eligibles. So we've got an awful lot of our book in the high teens to $2,000 PMPMs, which are high acuity. If you're very good at managing medical costs -- there's a big opportunity on those high-dollar members to get to the margins that Joe talked about, even in the presence of some headwinds. So I think it's really hard to make that comparison to others. Operator : And the next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Scott Fidel : Two questions. The first one, just if you've gotten the scoring results yet from Florida and have been able to start to develop the factual points that may be the basis of your appeal in Florida is definitely interested in your thoughts on that? And then just second, on the HICS side, just if you want to refresh us at this point after seeing results so far, what you're expecting for full year MLR and pretax margin offer 2024 for the HICS business. Joseph Zubretsky : On these protest processes, I think I've said about all I really should say about them. They are legal processes, and we have to see how they unfold. But of course, through various requests, I'm sure everybody's got the information they need to document their findings and to put their case forward. So that's all I'll say about it. Your last question was about market to marketplace. As I said, we, last year, having good visibility into the business, having priced up, we were producing pretax margins in low double-digit [indiscernible] 10%, 11%. We decided consciously to invest 3 in some places, 400 basis points of that margin into growth, which is why membership grew 30% and revenues grew 20%. So we're well positioned to continue to produce our target MCR range, which is 78% to 80%. And this year, we expect to finish the year at the low end of that range. which would produce a high single-digit pretax margin. It's right where we want to be. And as somebody suggested earlier, a very now stable position, half the membership being renewal membership, 70% of it being silver, a nice platform off of which to grow measurably and modestly. Scott Fidel : Okay. Got it. So reaffirming the initial guidance you gave us for the exchange MLR margin? Operator : And the next question comes from Andrew Mok with Barclays. Andrew Mok : I think I heard you say that you're prudent in your reserves due to change. Was there any favorable PYD in the quarter? And if so, did you reestablish that into your reserves? Mark Keim : It's Mark. Yes, absolutely, there's favorable PYD, and you'll see that in the earnings release where we showed the prior year development on current year reserves. It tracks about as it normally does, not higher, not lower. And of course, we always replenish that. So we feel very confident I showed a 49% days claims payable, which is right in the middle of our standard range. We feel very good about our reserves even with a little bit of noise from the change situation that happened back in February. So very confident, reserves replenished, we feel adequately reserved. Andrew Mok : Was there any P&L impact in the quarter from the PYD? Mark Keim : There always is. That's a normal part of a reserving cycle. Typically, the way you reserve is in the current period, you pick a number, which is generally a little bit conservative. And typically, prior periods developed favorably. That is a standard cycle of the actuarial and reserving process and how we recognize earnings. Nothing unusual there in this quarter. Operator : And the next question comes from Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald. Sarah James : I wanted to clarify the mix on the 2026 revenue guide. So IDA, you guys talked about it being about 1/4 organic, quarter M&A and 50% contracts contract wins. Do you still see that as the mix? And then could you give us any clarity on your rate renewal timing? What percentage of your book renews in January versus April and September. Joseph Zubretsky : I'll answer the second question first. We have a really nicely laddered renewal pattern in our portfolio, which is great from a risk management perspective. of our revenue renews on January 1. 21% renews in the fall. The rest of it is [indiscernible] so the renewal pattern is nicely better throughout the year. Right now, given our guidance, we know 82% of rates, we know the rates on 82% of our revenue for this year's revenue guide, which leaves us very little rate risk to our forecast. That's the -- that's how we have great visibility. And as Mark said, if you get pressure, cost pressure, in the second half of the year. In fact, at 52% of the revenue then cycles into January 1, or we capture that nicely. Your other question was? Sarah James : Yes. On the $46 billion premium rev in 2026, do you think of it as the buckets that you laid out at I-Day, which was about 50% of the growth being from contract wins, 25% from M&A, 25% from organic? Joseph Zubretsky : Yes. I think that's nothing has caused us to change that outlook. I mean it's a very high-level outlook and more of it comes from M&A, that's fine. When you're buying the properties with the capital efficiency, we buy them at which we buy them. But that actual mix could change, but that's probably the way to think about it. That is the way we think about it. But again, if the mix changes, we have more contract wins and more M&A. It's all very accretive and as long as we're refilling the bucket of embedded earnings, we feel good about it. Operator : And this concludes the question session as well as the call itself. Thank you so much for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your phone lines.",

After today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference to Jeffrey Geyer, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Jeffrey Geyer : Good morning, and welcome to Molina Healthcare's second quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our second quarter 2024 earnings was distributed after the market closed yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those of you who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that, all of the remarks are made as of today, Thursday, July 25, 2024 and has not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. On this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the second quarter 2024 earnings release. During the call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to statements regarding our 2024 guidance, Medicaid redeterminations, expected Medicaid rate adjustments, medical cost initiatives, and our projected MCR, our recent RFP awards and related revenue growth, our acquisitions and M&A activity, our long-term growth strategy, and our embedded earnings power and future earnings realization. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K Annual Report filed with the SEC, as well as our risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe. Joseph Zubretsky : Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Today, we will provide you with updates on our reported financial results for the second quarter highlighted by $5.86 of earnings per share, which was in line with our expectations. An update on our full year 2024 guidance, which we reaffirm at $38 billion of premium revenue and at least $23.50 in earnings per share, and our growth initiatives and strategy for sustaining profitable growth. Let me start with our second quarter performance. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.86 a $9.4 billion of premium revenue. Our 88.6% consolidated MCR reflects disciplined medical cost management despite experiencing some modest medical cost pressure. We produced a 4.6% adjusted pre-tax margin or 3.5% after-tax, a very strong result that is in the middle of our long-term target range. Year-to-date, our consolidated MCR is also 88.6%, and our adjusted pre-tax margin is 4.5%, both within our long-term target ranges. Our well-balanced portfolio of businesses and focusing on managing medical costs continue to produce results in line with our expectations. In Medicaid, the business produced a second quarter MCR of 90.8%, above our long-term target range. This quarter included a one-time prior year retroactive premium item in our California business. Excluding this one-time item, the second quarter MCR was 90.1%, elevated by higher MCRs from our new store additions, a dynamic consistent with the first quarter. It also reflects slightly higher than expected medical costs in the legacy Medicaid portfolio, attributable to the ongoing acuity shift of redeterminations. We continue to have risk- corridor protection in many geographies and expect that this medical cost pressure will be adequately captured by known rate adjustments in the second half of 2024. We expect our Medicaid results to improve in the second half of the year. Several data points indicate we are well on track in this regard. First, the California retro rate item will not repeat. Second, our new store addition results will continue to improve as they did in the second quarter. Third, we received rates in many states for the second half of 2024 that were in line with first half developing cost trends. Approximately 35% of our Medicaid premium revenue renews in the second half. Combined with several off-cycle adjustments, these account for the expected legacy Medicaid MCR improvement through the remainder of the year. Then, with approximately 55% of our Medicaid premium revenue scheduled to renew on January 1, our rate cycle cadence is well timed for early 2025. Providing upside to our outlook for the balance of the year would be continued success with rate advocacy initiatives that could provide positive off-cycle rate adjustments. Turning to Medicare, our second quarter reported MCR was 84.9%, representing better than expected performance across all our Medicare products, primarily due to favorable risk adjustment results as well as benefit adjustments implemented for 2024. Our newly acquired Bright business in California is performing in line with expectations, and we remain confident in ultimately delivering the full one-rate accretion of $1 per share. Our strategy of leveraging our existing Medicaid footprint to serve high-acuity, low-income Medicare beneficiaries is working well. In Marketplace, the second quarter MCR was 71.6%. This business performed better than our expectations, even as we saw higher special enrollment period membership gains from redeterminations. Our mix of renewing members, prior year pricing actions, and improved risk adjustment results position us well to continue to profitably grow this book of business. Turning now to our guidance for the full year. We remain confident in delivering our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of at least $23.50, or 13% year-over-year growth. Strong net investment income and known rates will offset the one-time retro premium item and the second quarter pressure experienced in Medicaid. Performance in our core business remains strong, and we expect second half improvements to be driven by known on and off-cycle rate increases and new store MCRs reverting to target. Our guidance also includes our Florida and Virginia contracts extending through year end. Our full year premium revenue remains unchanged at approximately $38 billion or 17% year-over-year growth. Our 2024 revenue and earnings per share guidance provide a strong foundation for profitable growth in 2025 and beyond, and the building blocks to get there remain intact. Now some comments on our growth initiatives. Our business is well positioned to capitalize on unique long-term growth opportunities in all three segments. First, a few comments on our recently announced acquisition of ConnectiCare from EmblemHealth. ConnectiCare currently serves approximately 140,000 members with $1.4 billion in annual premium revenue. This is a well-diversified government sponsored healthcare play, which serves primarily Marketplace and Medicare membership in Connecticut. Historically, our strategy has been to establish these core product lines only in our pre-existing Medicaid footprint to leverage our Medicaid infrastructure. While that option is not available to us in Connecticut, a Medicaid fee-for-service state, we believe this is a great opportunity to execute the time-tested Molina M&A playbook. Acquire a stable revenue stream in our core products, deploy capital efficiently, and improve the assets' performance in the proven and reliable Molina way. We expect this acquisition to provide earnings accretion of $1 in earnings per share, which is now added to our embedded earnings. Our M&A pipeline remains full of many actionable opportunities. In Medicaid, we remain confident in winning new and renewal business contracts. Some comments on recent developments. In Florida, we were recently awarded a contract that successfully retains our foothold in the state. We will retain our 52,000 Medicaid members in the Miami-Dade region. In addition, by agreement, we will grow to approximately 90,000 members through preferential auto assignment. We estimate the annual premium revenue of $500 million. In Wisconsin, we successfully defended our LTSS position as the state announced its intent to award Molina a contract to provide services in Region 5, the first of a series of regional reprocurements. Additionally, we were just re-awarded our sole contract position in the IRIS Self Directed Personal Care program. In Georgia, while we await the award announcement, we remain confident as to our prospects and believe that we are well positioned to serve that state's Medicaid population. Finally, there was significant market opportunity out for bid over the next three years. This includes the Texas STAR Kids RFP, which represents a meaningful opportunity in a state where we have demonstrated recent success. In Medicare, we remain sharply focused on further penetration of low-income, high-acuity dual-eligible populations and on our high-acuity MAPD population in California. The new CMS rules on Medicare and Medicaid integration position us well to attract dual-eligible members over the coming years, as our footprint combines both products in most of our states, enabling a fully integrated member experience. We are in the process of further developing our suite of integrated duals products, and we will soon be establishing a new dedicated organization to lead this effort. In Marketplace, we are positioned to grow organically in underpenetrated markets, given the stabilized risk profile and margins we've achieved. We believe our rate filings for 2025 make us very competitive in underpenetrated geographies and position us well to grow. As a reminder, our growth outlook in this business can be simply stated as grow at a rate that allows us to sustain mid-single digit pre-tax margins. We are confident in our ability to grow organically, win new state contracts, and execute our M&A strategy. These remain consistent pillars of our growth strategy, and we expect to meet our target of $46 billion of premium revenue in 2026. With our 2024 earnings per share guidance of at least $23.50 reaffirmed, and with our embedded earnings outlook of $5, we remain committed to delivering on our long-term earnings per share growth targets. As Mark will describe shortly, the building blocks to get there are intact. In summary, we are pleased with our second quarter 2024 financial performance. The Medicare and Marketplace businesses significantly outperformed, while Medicaid is on track to improve in the second half of the year through known rate increases and continuing new store MCR improvements. In the meantime, we continue to focus on executing on the fundamentals, which has been the hallmark of our financial performance. The unprecedented redetermination process, which will be a 24-month journey from beginning to end, has presented some challenges that we have successfully navigated. But nothing has occurred during this period that changes our view that these are attractive businesses for the near and long-term, and profitable growth can and will be sustained. In fact, our results demonstrate that the principle of rate soundness works in that Molina's unique rate corridor position protects against transient quarter-to-quarter fluctuations of rates and medical costs. Finally, we look forward to updating you on our outlook for sustaining profitable growth at an Investor Day event on Friday, November 8th in New York City. As in past years, we will provide you with our detailed playbook for achieving our growth targets and maintaining industry-leading margins. We will outline our long-term goals and how we will achieve them with the transparency and specificity that you have come to expect from us. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials. Mark Keim : Thanks, Joe. And good morning, everyone. Today I'll discuss some additional details on our second quarter performance, the balance sheet, our 2024 guidance, and the building blocks of our 2025 EPS outlook. Beginning with our second quarter results. For the quarter, we reported approximately $10 billion in total revenue and $9.4 billion of premium revenue, with adjusted EPS of $5.86. Our second quarter consolidated MCR of 88.6%, was slightly above our expectations, but still on track to support our full year guidance. In Medicaid, our reported MCR was 90.8%. As Joe mentioned, this result includes a 70 basis point increase from a one-time retroactive premium adjustment in California related to the prior year. It is highly unusual for a state to retroactively reduce rates, and all of our known and expected future rate actions are positive as states address recent trends. Adjusting for this one-time prior year item, our reported MCR of 90.8% falls to 90.1%. Within that result, new store additions continue to run at a higher MCR, but lower than the first quarter and in line with our expectations. Recall, new store additions comprise almost 20% of our Medicaid segment this year. Adjusting for new store impact, our reported MCR falls another 80 basis points. We expect the MCR on this component to continue to decline over the coming quarters as these plans progress towards portfolio target margins. Excluding the one-time prior year item and the new store additions, our legacy Medicaid MCR was 89.3%, approximately 30 basis points above the top end of our long-term target range. We continue to experience the impact of redetermination related acuity shifts, a little more pronounced in the second quarter. Of course, Molina's strong performance in medical cost management means that in many states in recent years, we have typically been paying into minimum MLRs and corridors, an expense averaging 200 basis points within our reported MCR. As medical cost trend has modestly outpaced rates in the first and second quarters of the year, corridor expenses declined, largely shielding us from the temporary difference between rates and observed trend. We expect these corridor positions to be restored in coming quarters with our continuing medical cost discipline and the known and expected rate cycles. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, as Joe mentioned, we expect a number of items to drive the second half Medicaid MCR lower. For the first half of 2024, our reported Medicaid MCR was 90.2%. Our guidance includes the second half Medicaid MCR of 88.4%, a 180 basis point improvement driven by a few items. First, we reduced the second half expected MCR for the impact of this quarter's retro rate item, a benefit of 30 basis points to the second half Medicaid MCR compared to the first half. Second, new store additions, initially running higher than the legacy book, will continue to improve as they did in the second quarter as they approach portfolio target margins. New stores, a combination of new RFP wins and acquisitions, benefit from the execution of the Molina playbook quarter-over-quarter, and we expect 80 basis points of improvement to the second half Medicaid MCR compared to the first half. Third, the rate cycle of our state mix is well timed to return rates in line with the trend for the remainder of 2024 and into 2025. States are required to fund Medicaid MCOs with actuarially sound rates. Most states determine those rates based on demonstrated market trends and completed data rather than working hypotheses or speculation. As such, the higher trends most plans are seeing in the first and second quarters provides hard data for the rate setting process in coming months. We now have full visibility on higher final rates that offset observed trend representing approximately 35% of our revenue renewing in the second half of the year. In addition to the normal rate cycle, our rate advocacy efforts have already yielded positive off-cycle adjustments in four states that benefit the second half of the year. We are encouraged that several other states will follow this approach, although we do not include those in our guidance. Together, these known rate adjustments drive an expected benefit of 70 basis points to the second half Medicaid MCR when compared to the first half. Combining the first half reported MCR in our expectations for 180 basis point improvement in the second half as detailed results in full-year Medicaid guidance of 89.3% up from our previous guidance of 89%. This small increase in full-year Medicaid MCR guidance is almost entirely explained by this quarter's retro rate item. Also in Medicaid, a few comments on membership. While two of our states are continuing with redetermination in the third quarter, we are largely through the process. In the second quarter, we estimate a net loss of 100,000 Medicaid members through redetermination, taking the cumulative total to 650,000. Due to the timing of reconnects that will continue into the third and fourth quarters, our outlook for the ultimate total net loss of approximately 600,000 or 40% of the members gained is unchanged. Our full-year membership guidance remains at 5.1 million members. Conversions to marketplace remain strong as Medicaid members losing eligibility move to Molina marketplace products. In Medicare, our second quarter reported MCR with 84.9%. All Medicare products perform better than expected, driven by favorable risk adjustments and the benefit adjustments we implemented for 2024. Utilization in the quarter reflected consistent pressure from LTSS costs and pharmacy utilization. As Joe mentioned, the integration of the Bright business is on track to provide the projected ultimate $1 of earning accretion. In Marketplace, our second quarter reported MCR with 71.6%, better than expected. Despite higher special enrollment period membership year-to-date, we remain focused on growing this business while producing mid-single digit pre-tax margins. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 6.9%, as expected, and reflects operating discipline and the continued benefit of fixed-cause leverage as we grow our business. Turning to the balance sheet, our capital foundation remains strong. In the quarter, we harvested approximately $175 million of subsidiary dividends, and our parent company cash balance was approximately $235 million at the end of the quarter. Debt at the end of the quarter was unchanged and 1.4 times trailing 12-month EBITDA, with our debt-to-cap ratio at about 33%. These ratios reflect our low-leverage position and ample cash and capital capacity for additional growth and investment. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter was 50 and consistent with prior quarters. We remained confident in the strength of our reserves. Our operating cash flow for the first six months of 2024 was lower than prior year due to the timing of corridor payments, CMS receipts, as well as taxes. This year, we made several large corridor settlement payments related to prior periods. Next, a few comments on our 2024 guidance. As Joe mentioned, we reaffirm our full-year guidance with premium revenue of approximately $38 billion. We continued to expect full-year EPS of at least $23.50. Our EPS guidance now includes $0.65 of higher expected investment income as short-term rates are expected to hold up through the year, higher for longer, and $0.30 from the extension of the current Florida and Virginia contracts through 2024 year end. These items are offset by approximately $0.65 from the one-time retro premium adjustment and $0.30 due to Medicaid performance in the second quarter. Within our guidance, the full-year consolidated MCR increases slightly to 88.4% driven by the second quarter performance in Medicaid. As detailed, the full year Medicaid MCR is now expected to be approximately 89.3% up 30 basis points, primarily due to the second quarter one time item. Our MCR guidance on Medicare remains unchanged at 88% with strong, consistent year to date performance in our duals membership and the Bright acquisition. In Marketplace, we continue to expect the full year MCR to be 78% and at the low end of its long term target range while producing mid single digit pre-tax margins. Conversions to Marketplace due to Medicaid redeterminations are expected to continue into the second half of the year, while SEP growth typically comes with a higher MCR, we considered this in our 2024 guidance and the pricing of our 2025 bids. Turning to embedded earnings and the building blocks of our 2025 EPS outlook, our guidance on new store embedded earnings is now $5 per share, an increase from our prior outlook of $4. This increase reflects $1 from the ConnectiCare acquisition. We expect a little more than half of the new store embedded earnings to emerge in 2025 with the remainder in 2026. Finally, we see a clear path to achieve our EPS growth target heading into 2025. The building blocks include the embedded earnings we expect in 2025, the continuing organic growth and margin in our current footprint, and our in-flight organic and inorganic strategic initiatives. With 55% of our revenue renewing on January 1st of next year, our rate cycle is well timed for 2025. Even allowing for some headwinds from likely declining interest rates next year, the path is clear and compelling. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Operator : Yes, thank you. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS. A.J. Rice : Hi, everybody. Thanks for the question. Just maybe as a point of clarification. You're calling out risk adjustment true-up that's helped you both in public exchanges and in Medicare Advantage. Any way to size that and talk about how much of a positive variance it was relative to guidance? And then my other follow-up would be on the Medicaid side. Some of your peers, not all of them, but some are calling out that the legacy population they are left with seems to be having a little bit higher utilization than they had previously seen. It's not just deterioration on the risk pool related to redetermination. Have you seen any of that or is this what you are seeing in Medicaid, 100% related to just what's happening as a result of redetermination? Mark Keim : Great. Hey, good morning, A.J. I'll take the first one and Joe will pick up the second one. On risk adjustment, let's touch on Marketplace and Medicare. On Marketplace, some of you have seen from the CMS files, we recognize about $20 million of additional risk adjustment benefit from the prior year between first and second quarter. Remember, we have insights on the development of that through the weekly service and other things, but across the first half, about $20 million from the prior year. So, first half revenue is about $1.2 billion. You do the math, a little bit less than 20 basis points in our first half, first and second quarter MLRs for Marketplace. Just for reference, it was about the same a year ago. So the year-over-year as compared, it's about the same, about 20 basis points of benefit. Joseph Zubretsky : A.J. on your second question related to \u2013 I'm sorry. Please, go ahead. A.J. Rice : Just on the... Joseph Zubretsky : Say it again A.J. A.J., I think we lost you, but let me take your second question related to medical cost trends in the business. In Medicaid, as always, you see pockets of utilization increases in various geographies and in various healthcare categories. We see some pockets of skilled nursing facility cost increases, hours in home-based care. BH is spiking in a couple of geographies, but nothing we've never seen before. Pharmacy trend to high-cost drugs in the GLP-1s, certainly putting some cost pressure on the system. But again, nothing out of the ordinary and nothing that can't be dealt with, particularly as our corridor position absorbs these trends and then rates kick in to pick up the slack. A.J. Rice : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Andrew Mok with Barclays. Andrew Mok : Hi, good morning. Just a question on the underlying Medicaid pressure in the same-store portfolio. I don't remember you calling out pressure in Q1, but it sounds like that may have developed slightly worse. Is that correct? And can you clarify when core Medicaid pressure started to materialize this year? Thanks. Mark Keim : Sure, you are right. We saw a little bit more pressure in the legacy book in the second quarter versus the first quarter, and one of the drivers is just simply membership. You might recall, in the first quarter we noticed that we lost about 50,000 members due to redetermination. We were a little more than that in the second quarter at about 100,000. Just to round that out, we're currently at 650,000 total cumulative, and we expect to get back about 50,000 in the rest of the year through reconnects. So the volume, the membership up a little bit in the second quarter. I don't doubt that drove a lot of the higher legacy impacts we saw. Andrew Mok : Got it. But did Q1 also come in worse than what you had expected when you actually saw the claims? Joseph Zubretsky : It was a little bit higher than normal, but not worse than we expected in the first quarter. Andrew Mok : Okay. And then secondly, it sounds like you are describing a more modest pressure relative to peers. So I just wanted to better understand that experience. How much pressure was offset by the risk corridor buffer? And do you see modest pressure across most states or concentrated pressure in a few states? Thanks. Joseph Zubretsky : The pressure is isolated. It's various healthcare cost categories in various of our individual health plans. And Mark covered this in his prepared remarks. Sometimes it's overlooked. We've been routinely over the past four years, paying into the risk corridors at minimum MLRs to the extent of about 200 basis points inside our NCR, which basically means if you are reporting an 88, you are performing at an 86, which gives you 200 basis points of cushion if a medical cost should inflect for any reason, whether it's an acuity shift or whether it's normal trend. So we see pockets of utilization increases as I described, in various categories, in various plans, but largely picked up by the corridors and mid-cycle rate increases and on-cycle rate increases, particularly in the second half of the year where 35% of our revenue renews in the second half. Andrew Mok : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Ryan Langston with TD Cowen. Ryan Langston : Hey, good morning. Following up on Medicaid, we've heard some commentary just from some peers that there's this pull-through effect when folks are receiving their enrollment loss information and then they might be utilizing more services before they actually use it. I guess, are you seeing that same kind of experience? And then maybe further, do you have any sense of what the utilization profile actually looks like for folks who actually are able to re-enroll once being redetermined off? Is that any different than sort of the normal population? Thanks. Joseph Zubretsky : We've heard the discussion about over-utilizing in advance of losing coverage. We have not experienced that. Our leavers are leaving at the same MCR from the beginning of the redetermination process to the end. No change and no indication that they are using services in advance particularly, because in the termination process, many of them don't know that they've been redetermined. So they don't have any advance notice. They are just off the Medicaid rolls. They weren't using services and now they are off through the redetermination process. So we haven't seen that. Mark Keim : Ryan, I\u2019ll just build on that. What we've been citing and what many others are seeing, is that of the folks that get redetermined, they lose their eligibility, 70% are for procedural reasons. That means they just didn't fill out the paperwork or weren't aware. So that certainly argues against any kind of last minute usage, when in fact they weren't aware they were losing coverage. I think you also asked about the reconnects, when they come back in. Yes, very often for the first month we'll see a little bit of higher utilization. And think about it, somebody lost their eligibility. They might not know they lost it until two or three months later when they go to the drug store to fill out a script. At that point they are utilizing and that first month might be a little bit higher. But typically they are going to quickly resolve to the portfolio average. So we're not seeing any meaningful impact there. Ryan Langston : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Josh Raskin : Hi! Thanks. Just a clarification on the margin side of the Medicaid book. So could you just tell us what your Medicaid margins were in 1Q versus 2Q and what's embedded in guidance for the second half? And then my bigger question is just, the commercial MLR last year, exchanges were 75%. I think you said 78% MLR this year. It looks like you are tracking probably favorable to that. So how are you thinking about the potential for rebates next year? And should we be thinking about a strategy of reducing price to get higher membership for 2025? Joseph Zubretsky : I'll take the last part of that first Josh on marketplace. Clearly running at 72 for the first half and predicting 78 for the back half seems to be a push. But be mindful of the fact that SEP membership is quite high and those members are coming in at higher utilization rates than the existing membership. And then of course you have the natural seasonality of the business. Now, you are absolutely right. Last year, we actually invested margin in growth and we grew at $1 billion to $1.2 billion of revenue this year. Where we're running this year, we think we're at par. We think we're right in the single-digit land, but we could. You could see us be a little more aggressive on growth next year and try to grow this business as we did in 2024 over \u201823. So the margin position is solid. And again, our growth rate is going to be determined by our ability to produce mid-single-digit margins, just given the inherent volatility that exists in the business itself. Mark Keim :  Great, and I'll go ahead and take the second one. Josh, per our reported results, as you know, the MCR in the first quarter on Medicaid was an 89.7. We reported a 90.8. Across the first half of the year, that's an average of a 90.2. We're tracking to an 89.3 for the full year, and I gave you the walk in my prepared remarks of how the second half supports that. We have great confidence in those three building blocks that support that. Now the 89.3 for the full year guidance is up from 89. The last time we were together, so we've raised the full year guidance by 30 bips. Two-thirds of that was just recognizing that one-time California item we had to jump over in the second quarter. So the rest is just a little bit of pressure from the second quarter legacy business, otherwise very much on track for an 89.3 full year. Josh Raskin : Okay, so target margin, but this year not terribly off from target margins, right? Sort of towards the lower end maybe of the turn. Okay, perfect. Joseph Zubretsky : Correct, and I think there'll be enough strength that we pointed out otherwise in the business to more than overcome that 30-bip increase. So I think we're in good shape. Josh Raskin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Kevin Fischbeck : Great, thanks. I guess we're having a hard time kind of reconciling your view about where MLR is in Medicaid versus what a lot of your peers are doing. So I guess, your comment seems to be that your risk corridors are allowing you to kind of offset a lot of this pressure. Can you give us a sense of on a gross basis then what\u2019s the MLR pressure? Are you saying you had 200 basis points of risk corridor and now it's only 100? And then there's another 10 or 20 in the core net because of payables not completely matching everything. Like just kind of size it for us. It seems like everybody else seems to be saying somewhere between 100 and 150 basis points of MLR pressure and just to hear 10 or 20 in the core, it\u2019s hard to reconcile. And then, I guess you mentioned you expect people to be coming back as the year goes on. Shouldn't that be a pressure on MLR in the back half of the year? It didn't seem like you were building anything in for rejoiners putting up a pressure on MLR in your bridge from one half to two half. Thanks. Joseph Zubretsky : Well, Mark gave you the numbers in the prepared remarks that are actual in the last four years. We have been paying in to the corridors to the extent of 200 basis points, contributing to the Medicaid MCR, 200 basis points. We said at the beginning of the redetermination process, we said this repeatedly, that the corridors were going to act as a financial buffer until such times rates pick up the slack, which is exactly what's happening. So yes, suffice it to say, this year our corridor liability isn't 200 basis points. We've used some of it to cushion the results, but some of it does remain in various geographies in a meaningful way. Now, the other point to make on the corridors is they don't just disappear forever. They replenish at the next rate cycle, whatever the state fiscal year is. And so if you could actually sound rates at the next rate cycle and you continue to relatively outperform that benchmark, you are back into the corridors and you are recreating that 200 basis points of cushion. Mark Keim : And Kevin, just a couple more thoughts. Since our last guidance in the first quarter, we probably see trend across our business for the year, up 150 basis points, 1.5% higher trend than we thought before. That's capturing what we saw in the second quarter and what we're expecting for the third and fourth. And of course, to your point, that includes the dynamic for the rejoiners and just as importantly what we're actually jumping off in the second quarter. So we're seeing a higher trend than we previously thought of 1.5%. Now, as we detailed, we've got known rate adjustments in the second half, both on cycle and off cycle, which defray about 1% across the full year of that trend. The other 50 bips is picked up by corridors. So we feel pretty insulated from a higher trend here, both on known rates and as Joe mentioned, this very important corridor dynamic we bring to the table. So yeah, we've been carrying 200 bips over the last couple of years within our reported MCR. It'll be lower this year, but that'll be a function of actual rates and the ultimate trend. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. First, it looked like your PYD benefit to MLR was almost 200 basis points in the quarter. I'm curious if you could share with us whether that was evenly spread among the three segments or was balanced in one or two specifically. And then Joe, can you talk to us a little bit about exchanges, a lot of focus going into the elections. What's your early view on, if the subsidies aren't extended, the enhanced subsidies I should say. If they aren't extended at the end of 2025, what do you think happens to the exchange population in general? Joseph Zubretsky : On the PYD point -- I'll kick it to Mark, but the first point to make before which lines of business did it affect. Most of it, if not nearly all of it, was picked up by prior year corridors. Mark, do you want to take it? Mark Keim : Right. So Justin, your question is, yes, it's a little bit bigger than we've seen in the past, but we're a bigger business than we've been in the past. A lot of this stems from our payment integrity business, which reaches back into prior years to make sure that fraud, waste and abuse, things like that are addressed. So it's a little bit bigger. Of course, Medicaid and Medicare is where you expect to see it mostly, and that's what you'll see in the Q when it comes out. A little bit in marketplace, but most of it was in Medicaid and Medicare. As Joe mentioned, it really isn't a good guy this year, because we were big time corridor payers last year, and of course the prior year development goes to last year's corridors, so most of that got caught up in prior year corridors. Joseph Zubretsky : And your question related to the exchanges, everybody's got models. We see models in the industry. We have our own models in terms of what would happen if the enhanced subsidies are in fact, do expire. And there's industry estimates we have our own. You look at the level of subsidies, you look at your FPL cohorts, and you can argue that 10%, 20% of membership could be affected and priced out of your silver product, but then again, you have a lower priced bronze product, perhaps sitting right next to it. So how many of those are going to recapture into one of your bronze products, a little priced hard to say. But we've seen industry estimates of 10% to 20%, and then the wild card is if you have a bronze product sitting alongside your silver product in a certain geography, will you recapture some of that in bronze? Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Stephen Baxter : Hi, thanks. Just a couple of follow-ups on the Medicaid discussion. I guess, can you provide us specifically the first half number that's comparable to the 200 basis points of the typical corridor expense that you cite? And then can you also update us on what percentage of your premiums have some level of protection here versus your more directly exposed to whatever the underlying performance in the Medicaid book is? And then just trying to understand the rate update process. I think you suggested, obviously the states want to operate on hard data and not theories. But it does seem like a lot of this deterioration is happening in the second quarter, which is not fully developed at this point. So is this largely because maybe the acuity adjustment compensated the lower level of disenrollment [inaudible] your conversation? I'm just trying to understand why the states would be compelled to act, kind of on a more recently developing trend. Thanks. Mark Keim : Hey Stephen, it's Mark. There's a lot to unpack there. Can you start with the first one? I want to make sure I understand it. Stephen Baxter : Yes. The 200 basis points of typical corridor expense that you cite, I would just like to know specifically in the first half of the year if you could give us a comparable metric there. And then when we think about the percentage of your Medicaid premiums that have some level of protection from those corridors versus are more directly exposed to the underlying performance of the business, like is it 50%, is it 75%? How should we think about that? Mark Keim : Sure. Now, the way to think about corridors, in prior years, roughly 200 was usually embedded in our reported MCR. Corridors track to an ultimate across the full year. So you don't really know until the year is over where you come out, and again, that's going to be a function of rate and trend. But what I can tell you is in the first half, I think about half of that normal rate was within our number if we look at what's happened and our expected ultimates. So we're definitely using some of it year-to-date. And as we mentioned in our remarks here, we're expecting to use some of it in the rest of the year. So think across the full year, roughly half of that normal run rate number. Joseph Zubretsky : And Stephen, we have very detailed models. We have an entire accounting system on NIM and MLR and corridor tracking. And one of the reasons we don't give specific numbers generally is if 50% or 75% of your premium has a corridor, you say, well, it's protected. Well, it's only protected if that's where the medical cost deterioration happens. And so looking at the gross number can just be very, very misleading. We have our arms around it. We know where we're protected. We know where we have upside opportunity and some geographies there's upside opportunity depending on where you are in the corridor. So we generally don't like to give specific numbers on how much premium is protected, because I think it gives a false positive. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald. Sarah James : Thank you. I appreciate you reiterating the 2026 premium guidance. I was hoping that you could refresh the bridge a little bit. When you laid it out at I-Day [ph] off of the 23 base, you were talking about $4.5 billion of M&A and $2.5 billion of strategic initiatives. Is that still the mix that you see? And then when you think about M&A, how do you think about the mix between Medicaid and exchange that could play out through 2026 or that exists in your pipeline? Joseph Zubretsky : It is possible that if we're redoing that projection right now, it would have to be a little more influenced by M&A, just given where we are in the reprocurement cycle, but we're very active in the M&A space as we just demonstrated. Yeah, comments have been made that the last two transactions that we executed were Medicare and marketplace, which some people are calling non-core. They are core. They are as core as Medicaid. And our pipeline is still very active with Medicaid opportunities, and you'll hopefully see Medicaid transactions here over the next 12 to 18 months. We're still very active in that space. The last two we did were non-Medicaid, but that doesn't mean we're not actively pursuing them and working them. Sarah James : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Michael Hall with Baird. Michael Hall : All right, thank you. So a quick clarification and then my real question. I was surprised to see no cash flow from Ops so far, first half of the year. I know you called out special timing, corridor payments, CMS receipts, etc. I was wondering if you could break out some of the amounts of the larger pieces to help bridge us back to what maybe normalized cash flow from Ops would look like. And then the real question on MA risk adjustment benefit. Wondering if you could just \u2013 how much specifically did you benefit from it for your 2Q MA MLR? And generally, isn\u2019t it true that, yes, the risk adjustment fleets tend to result in some slight favorability, but also from my understanding, plans generally don't see a huge benefit, because they simply accrue to whatever the risk adjustment was in their early 1Q payments. So my question is, how did you recognize such a large benefit? Was there something unique going on with BrightHealth's MA assets where maybe you took a more conservative approach on the risk adjustment accrual? So more color on that would be great. Thank you. Mark Keim : Hey, Michael. Good morning. It's Mark. Let me take OCF. As we mentioned, and for everybody's benefit, Michael's asking about a large difference in this year's first six months operating cash flow versus prior years. Just a note on that, I think some people forget that government services MCOs have a lot lumpier cash flow than maybe some of our diversified competitors. Commercial businesses tend to have much more stable quarter-to-quarter OCF as do services businesses. Government businesses, because of the timing of large payments, risk adjustment and corridors will be a little bit lumpier. The only other comment I'll make, and I'll get into the details Michael, is we are a growing business, and a growing business should always have OCF ahead of net investment income, because a growing business, that's the way the working capital cycle works, and we do. If you look at any broader time frame, you will see that. So the first half is really about a couple of unique items, unique items that benefited us last year and are now just sort of catching up. So there's three that we'll talk about and you'll see these on my operating cash flow in the earnings release. The largest one is the timing of risk corridor payments. Here's how to think about this. We're accruing less this year on risk corridors than we were last year for all the reasons Joe and I just discussed. But separately, I'm paying down last year's balances. So that's a big swing in OCF, call it a little more than $0.5 billion. Next one is CMS payments. You know it's funny, CMS payments usually come in a couple of days before the end of the quarter or a couple of days after the end of the quarter, and that makes a big difference on the reported cash flow. About 400 of our OCF swing is exactly that, and you'll see that on the operating cash flow statement. And the last one's a little bit unique. We had about $200 million of cash flow benefit year-over-year from California taxes. You might recall that California federal taxpayers got a little bit of a delay on their tax due dates back in 2023. So both, the 2022 final tax payments, as well as the estimated 2023 tax payments were delayed into the second half of the year. This year, we're right back on target. So year-over-year, that's a bad guy. This year, it was a good guy last year. That's $200 million right there. So I probably just walked you through the vast majority of that operating cash flow deficit you are talking about. We're very comfortable in the cash flow characteristics of the business. And again, look over any broader period of time, you'll see a great normalization in that relationship between OCF and net income. On the Medicare risk adjustment, a couple of comments there. Unlike Marketplace, most of that Medicare was a benefit from this year's operations, and gosh, we're just getting a little bit better at it. We've got a bigger business. We've got the bright business, and sure, there's always some prior year benefit. But a lot of this is, we're just getting better at the risk adjustment equation across each of our individual Medicare businesses. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Scott Fidel : Hi, thanks. Actually, just to follow-up, I guess to sort of complete out the operating cash flow discussion. Mark, can you give us what you are expecting for the back half of 2024 or for the full year for CFFO? And then second, I guess main question would be, definitely thought it would be helpful maybe if you just want to segment or bucket the dollar of embedded earnings that you're expecting from Connecticare in terms of what sort of the key drivers of that accretion to get to the dollar bill. Thanks. Mark Keim : Sure. On the second half of OCF, a normal relationship is a little bit ahead of net income. So, think a relationship of 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, something like that. I would expect a more normalized relationship in the second half of the year. Again, looking over the two years in total, so much of that year-over-year comparison was about things unique to last year or unique to this year. Looking at \u201823, \u201824 combined, you'll get a very normal relationship between OCF and net income that'll certainly normalize in the second half of this year. Joseph Zubretsky : And Scott, on the Connecticare acquisition, the business performs okay. It does not perform to Molina target margins. As typical in these situations, we intend to improve the MCRs in both, the marketplace business and the Medicare business, and rationalize the G&A spend. It is not a huge undertaking. As I said, they are underperforming our targets, but not woefully underperforming. We will improve the performance by moving these simply from where they are to Molina targets. Pay per membership, good brand recognition. We bought it at 25% of revenue, half of which is hard capital. And then we unleashed the Molina playbook to get it to our target margins, the dollar of accretion. Great deal for us. Scott Fidel : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the last question this morning comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George Hill : Hey, good morning guys. And thanks for sneaking me in. I hope I have two quick ones here. I guess you talked about the example where you have acuity getting worse and states are cutting rates. Well I guess, talk to us about how confident you'll be that you'll kind of get rate in that percentage of the book going forward. Just increasingly as we're hearing like, we hear about actuarial soundness, but when we talk to some state regulators, we hear actual soundness is kind of with the phrase, \u2018subject to budget.\u2019 So kind of worried about the timing and the mismatch there. And then on the 200 basis points in the risk quarter that we discussed, I guess, can you talk about your confidence in the risk quarter, like the contributions. It'll suck up some utilization in the back half of this year, but I guess, can you talk about like how much was sucked up in Q2 and like how should we think about like the risk quarter \u2013 the decrease in risk quarter contributions in Q2 and kind of how that varies through the back half of the year? Thank you. Mark Keim : Sure. A couple of things there. So you are mentioning the California negative retro rate adjustment. Look, I haven't personally seen one. That's the only one. I don't expect another one, but for the rest of the year, there's not speculation. Those rate increases that Joe and I talked about in the second half of the year, both the normal rate cycle and the off cycle rates, all of those are known and committed, so not a lot of speculation there. On the 200 basis points that you are talking about of historical, you can't really think about corridors on a quarterly basis, because they are an annual fiscal year concept. So you are always accruing to an ultimate, which means you are spreading out any impact across all four quarters, not quarter specific. So when I think about the full year and our fiscal year accounting, we said somewhere around half of the historical 200 is about what we think we're using. That's again a guess, and it will ultimately come down to the full year development of rates, trends, and our medical management. A - Joseph Zubretsky : And George, maybe it's best to give a couple of examples. So we have Texas is a September 1 renewal. Things were running a little hot in Texas. Acuity shift, etc. We had a high \u2013 the market got a high single digit rate increase. That will have impact to the second year, it's known. We have it in draft form. Draft rates never decline. They can go up, but we're very confident in it. Another example is a really interesting one. It actually explains some of the trend inflection we talked about that's very localized, and the rate actions that are taken in Kentucky. Due to the pandemic, the regulators asked the market to suspend UM on outpatient behavioral. We did, as did the market. What happens? Cost goes up. The market then approaches the state, presents the actual data, mid cycle rate increase because the behavioral program was underfunded. So the conversations with our state regulators, our customer are very productive. They are databased, and they are taking very reasonable positions, whether something is program related or whether it's an acuity shift that can be actually supported. George Hill : Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes both the questions session as well as the event itself. Thank you so much for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jeffrey Geyer, Vice President Investor Relations at Molina HealthCare. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Geyer : Good morning and welcome to Molina HealthCare's third quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our third quarter 2024 earnings was distributed after the market closed yesterday and it's available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those of you who listened to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that all of the remarks are made as of today, Thursday, October 24th, 2024, and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. On this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the third quarter 2024 earnings release. During the call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our 2024 guidance, Medicaid redeterminations, expected Medicaid rate adjustments and updates, medical cost initiatives and our projected MCR, our recent RFP awards and pending RFP submissions, our acquisitions and M&A activity, revenue growth related to RFPs and M&A activity, our long-term growth strategy, our 2025 marketplace pricing, and our embedded earnings power and future earnings realization. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our foreign 10-K annual report filed with the SEC, as well as our risk factors listed in our form 10-Q and form 8-K filings with the SEC. After completion of our prepared remarks, we'll open the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe? Joe Zubretsky : Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Today, we will provide you with updates on our reported financial results for the third quarter, highlighted by $6.01 of earnings per share, which was in line with our expectations. An update on our full year 2024 guidance, which we reaffirm at $38 billion of premium revenue and at least $23.50 in earnings per share, and our growth initiatives and strategy for sustaining profitable growth. Let me start with our third quarter performance. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.01, a $9.7 billion of premium revenue. Our 89.2% consolidated MCR was higher than expected as we experienced some medical cost pressure in our Medicaid and Medicare segments. However, we still produced a 4.5% adjusted pre-tax margin or 3.4% after tax, a very strong result. Year to-date, our consolidated MCR is 88.8%, slightly above our long-term target range, and our adjusted pre-tax margin is 4.5%, which is within our long-term target range. Together, these results reflect a well-balanced and well-performing portfolio of businesses. In Medicaid, the business produced a third quarter MCR of 90.5%, above our long-term target range. This result included a premium rate reduction in our California business that was retroactive to the beginning of the year. We are working with the state to understand its methodology and actuarial support for this adjustment, both of which remain unclear. Excluding this retroactive item, the third quarter Medicaid MCR was 90%. The quarter reflects higher than expected medical costs, elevated by the impact of redetermination related to acuity shifts and higher utilization among our continuing population, particularly for LTSS, pharmacy, and behavioral health services. However, this higher trend continued to be partially offset by three dynamics. First, our new store additions continue to improve toward target margins. Second, on-cycle and off-cycle rate adjustments went into effect during the quarter. And finally, our risk corridors continue to act as a financial buffer against elevated medical cost trend. The short-term disparity between rates and medical cost trend may have reached its widest point in the third quarter. We expect this short-term disparity to narrow, starting with known rate updates. In the third quarter, we received five on-cycle rate updates that averaged 4.5%. We also received several positive off-cycle rate adjustments, which is an important indication that many of our states have recognized that certain aspects of their program are underfunded. For the fourth quarter, we received three on-cycle rate updates that averaged 9%. In total, the second half of 2024 now reflects these known rate increases that amount to a benefit of approximately $350 million, or 230 basis points on the Medicaid MCR. This 230 basis point benefit, along with risk corridor protection, is expected to substantially offset the elevated cost trend in the second half of 2024. Looking forward to 2025, the progression of rates and cost trend is not entirely clear. 55% of our Medicaid premium renews on January 1st, and we are encouraged by the draft rates we have seen from several of these states. These draft rates are an important starting point for 2025, and we remain cautiously optimistic while we wait to see how medical cost trend progresses in the fourth quarter and early 2025. Given the confluence of the many MCR dynamics concentrated in the quarter, we are very pleased to be operating at a 90% Medicaid MCR for the full year, nearly 100 basis points above the top end of our long-term range. With the assumption that rates may continue to improve in appropriately captured cost trend in this upcoming rate cycle, there is line of sight to be operating within our long-term MCR target range for 2025. Turning to Medicare, our third quarter MCR was 89.6%, above our long-term target range. The medical cost pressure in the quarter was consistent with the elevated LTSS and pharmacy costs we experienced through the first half of the year, while we also experienced higher outpatient utilization in the third quarter. Our bright business in California performed in line with expectations. In marketplace, the third quarter MCR was 73%. The business continued to perform better than our expectations, even with the higher special enrollment period membership gained from redeterminations this year. Our third quarter adjusted G&A ratio of 6.4% was a very strong result and reflects effective operating discipline, including labor cost management, one-time credits related to vendor contracts, and leveraging our fixed cost base as we grow. Turning now to our guidance for the full year. Our full year premium revenue remains unchanged at approximately $38 billion, or 17% year-over-year growth. We maintain our full year adjusted EPS guidance of at least $23.50, representing 13% year-over-year growth. We expect continued strong performance in our marketplace segment, G&A efficiencies, and higher net investment income to offset the higher MCRs we are experiencing in Medicaid and Medicare. Our 2024 revenue and earnings per share guidance provide a strong foundation for profitable growth in 2025 and beyond, and the building blocks to achieve our long-term growth targets remain intact. Now, some comments on our growth initiatives. Our business is well-positioned to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities in all three segments. In traditional Medicaid, as previously reported, we retained our presence in Florida with a contract to serve approximately 90,000 members in Miami-Dade County. This contract recovery is an important component of our portfolio, given the state of Florida's significant Medicare and marketplace profile. In Georgia, we await the announcement of statewide contract awards. We remain confident in the strength of our proposal and our ability to serve as strong state partners for these populations. We had significant wins in the quarter in our dual-eligible integrated product businesses, which are a major strategic focus for us. In Michigan, we were awarded a contract to provide benefits to the state's highly integrated dual-eligible special needs population in six service regions, including Detroit. This is an increase from our current MMP footprint of two service regions. This win facilitates the transition of our existing MMP members to a high-d product and ensures a new dual-eligible growth opportunity. We project $1 billion of incremental premium revenue by 2027 and have added $0.50 per share to our embedded earnings. The contract, which is effective January 1st, 2026 in select regions, will be implemented statewide in 2027 and continue for seven years. Given our success in this Michigan MMP transition, we are confident about our prospects in both Ohio and Illinois. In Massachusetts, the Commonwealth awarded us a new contract to operate the One Care Under 65 program and retain our position in the Senior Care Options Program for 2026. Incremental revenue is expected to reach nearly $400 million in three years' time, and for this, we have added $0.25 per share to our embedded earnings. Also in Medicare, beginning in 2025, we will no longer offer MAPD products in 13 states, totaling approximately $200 million in annual premium. This adjustment allows us to strategically focus on our dual-eligible populations, where we increased our county footprint by 23% and on our low-income MAPD population in California. Recall the new CMS final rule on integration positions us well as a major Medicaid player. In Marketplace, we are positioned to grow organically in under-penetrated markets, given the stabilized risk profile and margins we've achieved. Our rate filings for 2025 are very competitive and position us to grow in under-penetrated markets. We are confident in our strategy to grow the segment at a rate that allows us to achieve mid-single-digit pre-tax margins. Finally, we continue to expect that our announced acquisition of ConnectiCare will close in the first quarter of 2025. Our ability to grow organically, win new state contracts, and execute M&A are the pillars of our growth strategy, and we fully expect to meet our target of $46 billion of premium revenue in 2026. With our 2024 earnings per share guidance of at least $23.50 reaffirmed, and with our embedded earnings raised to $5.75 per share, we remain on track to deliver long-term profitable growth. Mark will discuss the building blocks of our 2025 outlook in his remarks. In summary, we are pleased with the quarter's results as we continue to power through unprecedented short-term dynamics and just keep executing on the fundamentals. Our businesses remain on solid operational and financial foundations, and are positioned well for long-term profitable growth. We look forward to updating you on the next wave of long-term value creation at our Investor Day event on Friday, November 8th in New York City. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials. Mark? Mark Keim : Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss some additional details in our third quarter performance, the balance sheet, our 2024 guidance, and the building blocks of our 2025 EPS and outlook, beginning with our third quarter results. For the quarter, we reported approximately $10 billion in total revenue and $9.7 billion of premium revenue, with adjusted EPS of $6.01. Our third quarter consolidated MCR of $89.2 was above our expectations, reflecting some pressure we experienced in Medicaid and Medicare during the quarter. In Medicaid, our reported MCR was $90.5. As Joe mentioned, this result includes a 50 basis point increase due to a premium rate reduction in our California business that was retroactive to the beginning of the year. With much of our California revenue in the new store first year of operations stage, corridors were not quite at the target margin levels, so much of the impact of this rate action fell through to our bottom line. We are still working with the state to understand the rationale for this rate adjustment. It's highly unusual for a state to retroactively reduce rates, and all of our other known and expected future rate actions are positive as states address recent medical cost trends. Adjusting for this retroactive item, our reported MCR of $90.5 falls to $90. This was in line with the second quarter and remained elevated versus our expectations, driven primarily by higher than expected medical costs in our legacy Medicaid portfolio. Recall the dynamics of redetermination involve joiners, leavers, and stayers. Redetermination related acuity shifts continued into the third quarter, even as the imbalance of joiners and leavers began to stabilize. We saw a higher utilization among our stayers population, particularly for LTSS, pharmacy, and behavioral health services. Several dynamics served to offset these higher trends in the third quarter and muted the overall impact. First, our new store additions, which represent approximately 20% of Medicaid premium and have a higher than average MCR in their first year, improved during the quarter and remain on track to achieving target margins. Second, we had on cycle and off cycle rate adjustments in 11 states. And finally, due to our strong medical cost management, we started the year deep into risk corridors, which acted as a buffer and created a more muted impact of this acuity shift. Medicaid membership at the end of the third quarter was 4.9 million and in line with the second quarter. Some continuing redeterminations in a few states in July and August were largely offset by the implementation of our New Mexico contract in the quarter. We continue to see reconnects from prior period terminations and expect continuing upside to membership from reconnects in the quarters ahead. In Medicare, our third quarter reported MCR was 89.6. Higher medical costs in the quarter reflected continued higher utilization of LTSS and pharmacy. We also experienced higher outpatient utilization in the third quarter, concentrated in our decent population. Separately, I will note that the prior year risk adjustment true-ups in the second quarter drove a portion of the sequential increase in the MCR. Our bright business in California performed in line with expectations. In Marketplace, our third quarter reported MCR was 73 and better than expected. Special enrollment period membership increased during the quarter, but at a slower rate than the first half of the year. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 6.4 and reflects effective operating discipline, including labor cost management, one-time credits related to vendor contracts and leveraging our fixed cost base as we grow. Turning to the balance sheet, our capital foundation remained strong. In the quarter, we harvested approximately $385 million of subsidiary dividends and our parent company cash balance was approximately $195 million at the end of the quarter. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares. Our full-year guidance now assumes 57.9 million shares outstanding. Debt balances and the debt-to-capital ratio increased slightly in the quarter due to our share repurchases. Debt at the end of the quarter was 1.4 times trailing 12-month EBITDA with our debt-to-cap ratio at about 35%. We continue to have ample cash and capital to fuel our growth initiatives. During the quarter, we also renewed our revolving credit facility for another five years and increased its capacity to 1.25 billion. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter was 48. We remain confident in the strength of our reserves. Our operating cash flow in the first nine months of 2024 was $868 million. This was lower than the prior year, but consistent with our comments last quarter, reflects the timing of risk corridor payments, CMS receipts, and taxes. Recall that earlier this year we made several large corridor settlements related to prior years. Next, a few comments on our fourth quarter and 2024 guidance. As Joe mentioned, we reaffirm our full-year premium revenue guidance of approximately $38 billion and our full-year EPS guidance of at least $23.50. While full-year EPS guidance is unchanged, the performance in the second half of the year changes the components as compared to our previous guidance. EPS guidance has increased by $2.70 from the combined tailwinds of strong performance in marketplace, G&A efficiencies, and higher net investment income, but will be offset by the higher MCRs in Medicaid and Medicare for a net unchanged view of full-year guidance. We now expect full-year 2024 MCR of 88.7% and G&A ratio of 6.8%. Within Medicaid, we expect fourth quarter MCR of 89%, a decrease from 90.5% in the third quarter. The 150 basis point improvement is driven by three items. First, 50 basis points from the third quarter retroactive premium adjustment in California that will not recur. Next, 80 basis points from known on-cycle and off-cycle rate increases and some benefit of our corridor position will offset trend. Finally, continued improvement in new store additions will contribute 20 basis points. We expect full-year Medicaid MCR of approximately 90, up 70 basis points from our prior guidance, reflecting higher cost trend and approximately 10 basis points for the full-year impact of the third quarter retroactive premium adjustments in California. In Medicare, we expect fourth quarter MCR of 90, an increase from 89.6 in the third quarter. This guidance assumes the third quarter utilization persists for the remainder of the year and increases the full-year MCR to 88.3, a 30 basis point increase from our prior guidance. In Marketplace, we expect fourth quarter MCR of 78.1, compared to 73 in the third quarter. This increase reflects the normal marketplace seasonality during the year and the significant SEP growth we experienced year-to-date. We expect full-year marketplace MCR of 74, down 400 basis points from our prior guidance, reflecting strong year-to-date performance. Turning to embedded earnings and the building blocks of our 2025 EPS outlook. New store embedded earnings are now $5.75, with the addition of contract wins in Michigan and Massachusetts. Both contracts are expected to begin in 2026 and achieve target margins in 2027. We expect to harvest a little less than half of our embedded earnings in 2025. The building blocks include those embedded earnings we expect in 2025, the organic growth and margin in our current footprint, our in-flight organic and strategic initiatives, and the year-over-year benefit of share repurchases executed in the third quarter of 2024. We expect some headwinds from declining interest rates next year. We caution that rates have not yet caught up with trend, and our corridor productions are now lower until replenished by the new cycle of actuarially sound rates. While it is not yet clear how the short-term disparity between rates and trends will progress, these known building blocks are an important foundation to our sustaining long-term profitable growth. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we're now ready to take questions. Operator : We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Josh Raskin : Hi, thanks. I'd like to ask my second question first. So the strength in marketplace, does that change your view on the impact of potential rebate positions in 2025, just based on what you've seen in the last two years here? And could you just remind us your views? I think you mentioned sort of that mid-single-digit margin, just sort of how you're titrating additional growth in 2025 versus offsetting rebates versus sort of maintaining that mid-single-digit margin? Joe Zubretsky : Sure, Josh, this will be the second straight year of outperformance in marketplace and in '24 into '25, we did invest that excess margin in our bids and expect to grow the business. And yet here we are again with another year of outperformance and we'll continue to do the same. So yes, we're targeting mid-single-digit pre-tax margins, but the business is positioned to grow really well next year and the year after. Now, with respect to the rebate question, recall it's a three-year test and also recall that an 80% minimum is equivalent mark to what? About a 75% GAAP equivalent, correct? Mark Keim : Right around there. Josh, we're tracking to a 74 in our guidance this year. As Joe mentioned, the 80 nominal that everybody thinks of a minimum MLR is more like a 76-ish. And as Joe mentioned, you can either pay it in a rebate or make it up on volume through pricing and that's the direction we'll take. Josh Raskin : Okay, so you guys are in a rebate position. Your point is you can get that 200 basis point delta for next year. And then just a quick follow-up on the Medicaid MLR. I think it's running full year. It looks like 70 basis points higher than your previous. So, maybe if you could just drill down a little bit more on LTSS, behavioral health and RX and what's running specifically worse? What are those incremental pressures coming from? Joe Zubretsky : We expected in our initial guidance a trend in Medicaid of about 3% and it's landing at about six. It's split sort of equally between redetermination impact and impact of higher utilization of what I call our continuing membership. No one phenomenon is really driving it. It's a blend of GLP-1s and RX, LTSS both skilled nursing facility in patient stays and hours in home service benefits. And then of course the national phenomenon of behavioral services trending upwards as well. Really no one thing and its different in every geography, but those are the trends we're observing. Mark, anything to add? Mark Keim : No, I think that's right versus the initial guidance or expectations for the year. We're up about 300 basis points on trend. Joe mentioned its split between rededicuity and its split between stayers running a little bit hotter, BH, LTSS, pharmacy. We're seeing them in pockets here, pockets there but those are national trends. Josh Raskin : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from J.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice: Hi everybody, I think it's AJ but anyway. If your trend is running at about 6% that would imply the rate updates you need to normalize are probably in that range maybe a little bit higher over the next year. That's quite a bit different as you may know from what at least one of your large peers is saying they need, they're talking about a low-to-mid double digit rate increases. And they've also raised the question about whether state budgets can afford to update in one year what's necessary or whether we might need multiple cycles. I guess I don't know if you can comment on why there might be a difference between what you're seeing and what they're seeing, but I'll throw that out and see if I can get you to confirm the order of magnitude of the rate update you need to normalize and whether you think that's achievable over the next year. Joe Zubretsky : Let me first, AJ, comment on the model of how we've been describing this since redetermination started. We knew there would be an acuity shift without question. It takes time for a state actuary to observe the acuity shift and allow rates to rate for it. There's a gap there. Being 200 basis points deep into the risk corridors would act as a buffer until rates caught up and that's exactly what's happening here. Obviously we're a bit short, but we're operating comfortably at 90% no matter how you cut it, we're operating comfortably at 90%. Now with respect to rates, what gives us encouragement and great comfort are the rate updates we saw in the second half of the year, $345 million of pre-tax benefit to the second half, 230 basis points in the MCR. Some of those rate updates were off cycle, meaning that states truly have recognized that components of their program were underfunded. The on cycle rate adjustments in the third quarter averaged 4.5%. The on cycle rate adjustments in the fourth quarter averaged nearly 9%. Now we've only seen a handful of draft rates for 1-1 when 55% of our revenue renews but we've been encouraged by what we've seen at this early stage. So how it all maps out depends on what cost trend emerges in the fourth quarter as to whether the strength of those 1-1 rates will truly get us back to our target MCR. Mark, anything to add? Mark Keim : Joe, I think that's really well summarized. There's no doubt that there's a little bit of a lag between trend and when states recognize it. But as Joe mentioned, five on cycle, seven off in the third quarter, three more in the fourth quarter, the timing will never be perfect but part of our equation here is those corridors make up that difference until we get to the New Year and the new rate cycle. So I think a combination of the states being fairly responsive and the corridor position, we're confident in our outlook. A.J. Rice: Okay. That's helpful. Just on your utilization trends that you're seeing, and you called out the areas of Medicaid, it sounds like you're seeing a little bit of that in Medicare. Just trying to parse out, are these just the way the market is at this point or you need to get that in your rate updates both for Medicaid or Medicare or is there medical management opportunities for you to push back on some of what you're seeing? Joe Zubretsky : Well, I think it's all relative, right? Because we all get the same rates and we're all observing the same gross trends, supply-driven, demand-driven. We have proven on a sustainable basis that we are managing medical costs effectively. Otherwise, we would not have historically been 200 basis points deep into the corridors on average for the past three or four years. So as rates renew, those corridors replenish and given our expertise in medical management, care management, driving great quality scores, risk adjustment, et cetera, we plan to, and it is our intention to always be operating below whatever state benchmark exists in a minimum MLR or a corridor to always have that financial buffer available to us. Mark Keim : The only thing I'd add, Joe, is when we talk about trend, we talk about net trend. So the benefit of the medical cost management that we do, UMCM, all that, is already in the numbers that we report. I think maybe when you hear higher trend numbers from other folks, they may have different views on how they do medical management. But again, we talk about net trends, net of all the things we do to manage costs. A.J. Rice: Okay. Thanks a lot. Joe Zubretsky : Thank you. Operator : Apologies to you, Mr. Rice, for misspeaking your name. The next question comes from Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. Sarah James : Thank you. Can you help us think about what a clean jumping off point for 3Q is? You guys mentioned a one-time vendor credit. How big was that? I think also an unusual tax item. And was any of the 80 basis points pressure on the core Medicaid MLR out of period? And then just a clarification. Is it -- should we think about it as 80 plus the 200 basis points risk corridors, so really 280 year-over-year? That'd be great. Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : We'd have to parse your question into various pieces. But as I said, we are, no matter whether you pro forma the second quarter to the third, the third quarter to the fourth or the full year, we are comfortably operating Medicaid at 90% MCR. In fact, for the full year embedded in our guidance is an 89.3% MCR on the legacy book. That's only 30 basis points above the top end of the range. So we have a bridge, and Mark will give it to you here in a second, how we get from 90.5 in the third to 89 in the fourth, which would then support our guidance. Mark? Mark Keim : Yes, absolutely. So the jumping off point on the third quarter, we reported a 90.5, but as you know, 50 basis points was that one time I had been in California. So we're jumping off a 90 from a clean basis on a third quarter. When we look at our rates and our trend in our corridors, I'm seeing a pretty significant improvement. I'm targeting an 89 for the fourth quarter. The way I get there off of a 90 is rates. We have three states with known on-cycle rates, which give me 80 bps of good guy for the fourth quarter. I'm going to assume trends another 50 bps in the fourth quarter, and I know I have corridors roughly to offset that. You add a little bit of benefit from our new stores, which continue to give us a 20, 30 bps every quarter as they progress to their targets. That's your trajectory to get from a 90 adjusted to an 89. Now on G&A, you asked also about the jumping off point. We reported a 6.4 in the third quarter. That benefited from some vendor credits, a little bit was retro, but a little bit is sustaining. Just to cut to the chase on that, my full year guidance will be a 6.8 on G&A. I think that gives you the building blocks to model out the rest of the year. Sarah James : Great, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Stephen Baxter : Yes, hi, thanks for the question. I appreciate the color on the bridge to the fourth quarter. So I'm going to follow up a little bit on that. You mentioned some of your factoring and potential for some incremental trend. I guess when you think about the negative impact from acuity shifts that have been driving up, MLR sequentially, rejoiner dynamics presumably contribute into that as well. Is your expectation now given where we are in the cycle that this negative incremental pressure has largely stopped as we enter the third, enter the fourth quarter, or is that factored into your thought process as continuing at least for another quarter or two? Thank you. Mark Keim : So in the third quarter, we had pretty meaningful trend as did everybody, right? And I think there were two dynamics in the third quarter. One, there was a little more carryover from redetermination. One, it's just the weighted average math. Redetermination mostly stopped in the second quarter, but the weighted average math carrying into the third quarter put a little pressure in the third quarter. The other thing is I had a couple of states that continued to do determinations in the third quarter. I had two states in particular that extended into the third quarter. So we saw a little bit more of the joiners, leavers dynamic into the third quarter than I would have otherwise expected. And of course, the leavers having a little bit higher utilization. I don't think either of those are sustaining, which is why I'm suggesting more like a 50 basis point trend in the fourth quarter over the third, kind of coming back to a new normal. Operator : Was there a follow-up, Mr. Baxter? Stephen Baxter : Yes. Well, I guess I'm going to make a follow-up, I appreciate, just a little bit of like what the states, in terms of the rate update process are really seeing here. I mean, like to follow up on a previous question, we've kind of heard from peer companies that there's often a multi-year lag to the claims base needed to reset rates. So in terms of the rate updates being so large today? Is it truing up acuity factors largely because we've seen enrollment drop off more than what had been previously projected, just trying to understand what is making its way into the rates and why, given that the claims experience obviously is still very dynamic? Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : The rate process has not changed. The rate setting process starts with a credible baseline. Every state has a view of where that baseline should lie, whether it's a year prior, two years prior, pre-pandemic trend off the baseline. And acuity shifts, for any reason, are always part of the rating process. The only thing that's different now is that the acuity shift is far more dramatic, given the 92 million enrollees down to 72 million in a short period of time. So nothing's really changed in the rating model process. It works exactly the way it's worked historically. The only thing that's different is the acuity shift is more prominent. And by the way, it's not a secret. I mean, its high profile. Every state knows it, and there's laser focus on it. So the fact that we're getting updates that seem to be capturing it should be no surprise. Operator : The next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to focus on your 2025 comments. First, are you confirming that you believe you could do 13% to 15% next year? And specifically, Mark, you gave just about $3 of that embedded earnings kind of comes in next year, which is a great tailwind. On the other hand, you talked about a bunch of help from investment income and G&A and marketplace that might not reoccur. That is almost a similar number. I think you said it was like $2.70. So just trying to think about those moving parts and whether you still see that when combined with core growth, getting you to that 13 to 15 target or where you expect to be in there? Joe Zubretsky : Well, I think, Justin, it's Joe, I think the items that are easy to get your arms around are the embedded earnings because we have visibility into them. As Mark said, would there be a headwind from that investment income? That's pretty obvious. The unknown is when we talk about growth off the footprint, that's usually pretty easy to predict. But we need to see how medical cost trend emerges in the fourth quarter into the first to then conclude that the 1-1 rates, 55% of our revenue are appropriately capturing it. So normally, we'd be able to give you a really good point estimate in a normal environment that our footprint should produce a buck, a buck 50, two bucks a share. Right now, we're hesitating to do that until we see more in the fourth quarter. Mark, anything to add? Mark Keim : Yes, a couple things. Justin, just to set the table, you mentioned $2.70. That was part of my bridging on 2024 guidance. How versus prior guidance, I'm up now $2.70 on a bunch of good guys and down $2.70 on the trend in Medicaid and Medicare. So that's current year. Let's put that aside. For 2025 guidance, Joe hit it exactly right. With some of the vagaries we have right now on trend and rate, we're optimistic, but we're not ready to lay out specific numbers on that. Now, the biggest component of next year is the embedded earnings. As you know, we're now up to $5.75 on embedded earnings. And I said in my prepared remarks, we expect a little less than half of that to emerge next year. Pressures on net investment income, you got that one absolutely. And you're aware we did a small stock repurchase in the third quarter, which you'd want to factor into your numbers as well. Justin Lake : Okay, great. And then just to follow up on the rates, it sounded like you got some pretty good retro rates in the quarter. You mentioned that headwind from California, retro cut. Was there any tailwind from some of these rates in the third quarter, especially the off cycle rates being also retroactive that we need to consider in that jump off point or were none of those retro? Mark Keim : The rates that we got in the third quarter are obviously a good jumping off point going forward. The retro rates are not only retro, but also imply a new go forward basis. So you can jump off third quarter with confidence. And then Joe mentioned we had three new rates in the fourth quarter, which are factored into my fourth quarter outlook. Justin Lake : Right Mark. But to the extent they are retro, you would have dollars in the quarter that don't belong in the quarter. Just like California doesn't belong in the cut, right? Was there any of that, like any offset to that 50 bps? Mark Keim : Just a little bit, just a little bit. But when I give you my bridge from third quarter to fourth quarter, that's in my net rating increase. Justin Lake : Okay. Thank you. Mark Keim : You bet. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Mok with Barclays. Please go ahead. Andrew Mok : Hi. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the exchanges. Can you help us understand the drivers of the outperformance in the quarter and how would you compare this year's SEP membership to performance of prior years? Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : The SEP membership this year in marketplace has been extraordinary. I think in the second quarter it was 90,000 plus, it leveled off to 60,000 and then 50,000 each of the last three quarters. A normal SEP membership gain in that business is 20,000 to 25,000. So you can see that it benefited by the Medicaid redetermination process without question. Normally that SEP membership comes in with higher acuity and runs higher MCRs. This year the SEP membership came in running higher than the traditional book, but not as high. It's due to a younger demographic, a more healthy demographic, and it didn't put as much pressure on the MCR as it had done historically, likely due to the fact that many of those members came in for Medicaid. So the business is performing well, and I'd rather have excess margin than not, because I can always invest excess margin in growth, which is exactly what we plan to do. Andrew Mok : Got it. And if I could just follow up, can you help us understand how the revenue recognition works for off-cycle rate adjustments? Do you wait for those payments to be received or are you able to recognize those when you have a certain level of assurance and visibility into those payments? Thanks. Mark Keim : Yes, we have a really tight accounting standard on that. We need documented evidence, not just suggestion or conversation. We book on documented evidence. Andrew Mok : Great, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Adam Ron with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Adam Ron : Hey, thanks so much. I have a question about core trend and the difference between what you're seeing on that versus the rate and acuity mismatch. First, has that core trend accelerated throughout the year, such that, 2Q is higher than 1Q, 3Q is higher than 2Q, and you expect 4Q to be higher, and if not, what gives you confidence that it will flow? And then second, if you could just break out the magnitude of how you're seeing core trend versus the acuity rate mismatch and overall how that stacks up? I think one of your competitors said it was roughly a third core trend and two-thirds acuity versus rate. Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : As I said previously, and I'll kick it to Mark, I'll just take Medicaid to keep the conversation simple. We had anticipated a net trend of 3% in our initial guidance. That has increased to 6%, and I guess you could say, yes, it had built during the year. We still have a trend increase going into the fourth. Even off this incredibly high cost baseline, we still, in our forecast, had a slight trend increase into the fourth quarter. The combination of rates, trend, and corridors are the reason we're operating at 90 and not 89. So, it worked exactly the way we had predicted with corridors acting as a buffer until rates caught up. And that is happening. Now, we're still cautious on the 1-1 rates, as I said before, but the model is working exactly as we have predicted. The corridors act as a financial buffer, giving rates time to catch up with trend. Yes, trend did build over the year. Mark Keim : Yes, and I think, Adam, the easiest way for me to think about it, because you get into timing issues quarter to quarter, what came in when, was something retro, on a full-year basis, as we said before, trend is 3% higher than I initially thought in the outlook, just for all the reasons we all know. Rates are 1.5% better than I initially thought. I'm using 1% of my corridors on a full-year basis to offset some of that mismatch, which is largely why full-year guidance went from 89 to 90. The difference in all that math is obviously you've got a couple of California retro items in there, but those are the big items, and on that trend, what we've been very clear about is part of it is the ongoing imbalance of joiners and leavers, and part of it is those stayers running just a little bit hotter than most of us expected. Joe Zubretsky : Yes, and I keep coming back to the legacy book, because the California retro and the new stores create a little bit of obfuscation, but the third quarter legacy book is going to produce an 88.8, the second half is an 89.3 in the full year, legacy book is 89.3. In this incredibly difficult time of a huge shift in the risk pool, we're operating on our legacy book only 30 basis points above the high end of our range, combination of corridor protection, rates catching up to an accelerated trend. Adam Ron : Appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from Ryan Langston with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Ryan Langston : Hi, thank you. You called out higher utilization pharmacy, behavioral LTC. I'm curious if any other service lines might have come in maybe better than you had expected in the 3Q? And then just on the behavioral side, you called out Kentucky last quarter specifically. Is that higher utilization still isolated to that state, or are you now seeing that more maybe broad based on other geographies? Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : I'll answer the second question first and kick the first question to Mark. On behavioral, the reason we cited Kentucky, it was a program change that caused it. There is a suspension of utilization management in Kentucky during the pandemic, which of course caused behavioral costs to go up. We are seeing pockets of trend inflection on behavioral services broad based across the country. In Kentucky, it was more pronounced because of the program change. But the stigma over receiving behavioral services is removed. Providers are open for business. They really suffered in terms of service revenue during the pandemic. And of course, the pandemic created all kinds of behavioral issues in the population. So it is a national trend. The reason we called out Kentucky, it was because of a program change. Mark Keim : And back on the utilization management side, we certainly called attention to some of the challenges. I wouldn't call any specific good guys out. State by state, we're in 21 states. Every state has its own story with some unique items going on here and here. But as a national trend, I wouldn't cite any specific good guys within trend. Ryan Langston : Okay. Thank you. Mark Keim : You bet. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Hall with Baird. Please go ahead. Michael Hall : All right. Thank you. Something I've been thinking about more and questioning is, I understand D-SNP lives have, I think, a six-month grace period in terms of redetermination. So granted, I think most duly eligible lives aren't actually in the job market. But just give how high revenue PMPMs are, even just a few percent change to drive compressor on MLR. So I'm curious to hear what you've seen on D-SNP redeterminations. Is there potential, excuse me, unexpected tail risk on these lives due to the grace period? And just trying to figure out if there's another potential shoe to drop here. Joe Zubretsky : I'm only pausing, Michael, because I'm having difficulty understanding the question. D-SNP lives in our Medicare book and pressure on what aspect of these D-SNP lives are you referring to? Michael Ha : Yes. I guess if there's a six-month grace period on D-SNP lives and redetermination, and could that impact your visibility now? Could you see that come through later on? Or maybe am I not thinking about it correctly, if you give visibility onto it and clarity? Joe Zubretsky : I can only comment on our D-SNP business. As you know, our Medicare business is performing well. A 4.5% pre-tax margin, we targeted six, 5.5% to six, but in this environment, we're pretty pleased with it. Demonstrations are doing well, D-SNP book is doing well, and as I said, we expanded our county footprint by 23%. We're really focusing on the dual eligible D-SNP population, and of course the Michigan win was huge. We have an MMP book that's going to convert to a fully integrated product here in 2026. So I can only comment that we're very bullish on the D-SNP population, we're focusing intensely on it. The final rule passed by CMS gives players with a substantial Medicaid footprint a huge advantage to take advantage of this great growth opportunity, and it's a profitable book to business for us. We have a proven track record of managing high-acuity lives effectively. Michael Hall : Got it. Thank you. If I could follow up, in terms of favorable PYD, it seems like it's been pretty outsized, I think around 700 million this year, if that goes back to normal next year, I think it's about close to 100 bps of just MLR potential headwind into '25. So wondering if you have any color on how or where that could shake out next year, at least directionally, should we be thinking about this as returning to sort of more normal levels in '25? Mark Keim : Well, Michael, thanks for the question, I'd start with what is normal, right? We are a bigger business in '24 than we were in '23, and yes, my PYD is bigger this year than it was last year, but we're a bigger business, we're getting better and better at things like payment integrity. And as you know, when we acquire businesses that also helps us when we look at prior year and prior period development, so I wouldn't say we're necessarily outsized this year, we're a growing business. Now, on a go-forward business, I'm not expecting any headwind from that area, it's part of the way we run our business. Remember, on medical cost management, there are many components to it, CM, UM, network contracting, payment integrity, and making sure that in retrospect, everything's got settled appropriately, avoiding fraud, waste, and abuse, that's a big part of our business. So I see the PYD item as a very continuing part of a business, and I wouldn't factor in anything meaningfully different next year. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead. Scott Fidel : Hi, thanks. Good morning. First question, just thought it might be helpful if you can maybe just sort of sequence us or walk us through on the corridors, where you stood at the beginning of the quarter, and then at the end of the quarter, and then where you're expecting to be, I guess, in terms of remaining cushion at the end of the year. Just trying to understand particularly how much potential, I guess, sort of cushion you'll still have from corridors heading into 2025? Joe Zubretsky : Sure, Scott, it's Joe. I'm going to make a framing comment and kick it to Mark for some color on the numbers, but the first thing, one of the reasons we usually hesitate to talk about corridors either in dollars or in basis points of cushion is you never know that you're going to be using it in a place where you have it. If you have negative trend experience, if it happens in a place where there's no corridor protection, there's zero protection, and if it happens everywhere we do have protection, it's 100% protected. So averages actually can be misleading, but I will tell you in each of the past four years we've been operating with about 200 basis points of protection at every point in time. Mark? Mark Keim : Yes, and let me just run through the usual example that we give just to everyone's level set. If business reports an 88 MLR, in our case an analogy might be we were really running an 86. Again, this is just an example, and we were booking 200 basis points of corridor expense. Now, if during that example year the true underlying medical costs went from an 86 to an 87, you might still report the 88, you just would have used more corridor expense, just booked less corridor expense. When the new rate cycle comes around, if rates are actuarially sound, the rates will have to jump enough to essentially put that corridor position back to where it was, all things being equal. So the 86 underlying medical cost goes to an 87, the new rate trend knocks it back to an 86. Right now that is somewhat analogous to the overall enterprise. I started off the year thinking I had about 200 basis points of corridor expense in my MLR. As you know, over the quarters we've started to use that, and I've shown you that in my bridges, such that I'm thinking full year ultimate, that 200 that I normally have is down to more like 100 basis points within my MLR. Now, Joe talked about how 55% of our revenue reprices on January 1. We're optimistic on what that looks like, as well as the rate increases we got in Q3, Q4. So I'm expecting some extent to replenish that corridor. Now, that's all about the rate cycles, and we're not really ready to get into what's what on that. And the last thing, what Joe made, the points Joe made, is even with that 100 basis points of remaining corridor, it's an imperfect hedge, because it depends on where the medical costs come up and where you have the remaining corridors. So there's only so much comfort you can take in that, but it is a very big part of our equation. And again, just to round it out, 200 originally in my guidance, and I've probably used half of it during the course of the year. Operator : And the last questioner today will be George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. George Hill : Yes, thanks for squeezing me in, guys. Mark, you might have just gotten us, but I guess, so the expectation is you have 100 basis points of the risk corridor to use in the back half of the year. I guess, can you talk about how much you expect to have by the end? And can you talk about how much was used front half versus back half? Mark Keim : Okay. So it's best to think about these on a full year basis, because quarter-to-quarter, it gets a little bit more complicated. On a full year basis, I started off the year expecting 200. Across the year, a little bit in Q2, more in Q3, more in Q4, I expect to have used half of it, which means on a full year basis within my reported MLR, I'm expecting about 100 basis points of corridor expense. And again, for the New Year, it's all about the new rate cycle on what happens on resetting that. George Hill : Okay, that's helpful. And if I could have a quick follow up, could you just comment on how many states do you guys still have a corridor position in? And what percent of lives are on a multi-year repricing basis? Like, we've spoken to some states where they just say, like, our rate cycle's two years or more than two years. So I know we talk about, like, the annual rate cycle, but there are just some states who don't do this annually. Maybe on a percentage of lives, can you talk about what states are on a multi-year cycle versus a single year cycle? Mark Keim : Sure. Just about every one of our states has some form of a corridor, a minimum MLR, or a profit sharing. And that's not news. Many of these things have been around for quite some time. What is important is what the numbers are and how that acts. But you have some form of that in just about every state. And if I understood your question right on the pricing cycle, every state that we have reprices on an annual basis, and some of them commit to on a twice-a-year basis to look at the rates. Most years, that's not necessary, but obviously these days, that's an important fact. George Hill : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question and answer session and Molina HealthCare's third quarter 2024 earnings call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Should you need assistance, please note this event is being recorded. Now I'll turn the conference over to your host today, Jeffrey Geyer. Please go ahead. Good morning, and welcome to Molina Healthcare's fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings call. Joining me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky, and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings was distributed after the market closed yesterday and is available on our investor relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for thirty days. Numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those of you who listen to the rebroadcast, we remind you that all of the remarks are made as of today, Thursday, February 6, 2025, and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. On this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings release. During the call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our 2025 guidance, the estimated amount of our embedded earnings power and future earnings realization, expected Medicaid rate adjustments and updates, our projected NCR, our recent RCIA warrants, our acquisitions and M&A activity, revenue growth related to RFPs and M&A activity. Joe Zubretsky : and our long-term growth strategy. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report filed with the SEC, as well as our risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe? Jeffrey Geyer : Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Today, I will discuss several topics. Joe Zubretsky : Our reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024, our growth initiatives, and related increases to embedded earnings and our full year 2025 premium revenue and earnings guidance. Let me start with our fourth quarter performance. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.05 on $10 billion of premium revenue. Our fourth quarter results and performance metrics did not meet our expectations, but we did demonstrate a continued ability to maintain operating discipline while navigating industry-wide headwinds. Our 90.2% consolidated NCR was higher than expected due to medical cost pressure in our Medicaid and Medicare segments. In Medicaid, our fourth quarter 2024 guidance assumes a moderate increase in trend of an elevated cost baseline from the third quarter. However, the medical cost pressure experienced in the fourth quarter was higher than anticipated, with risk corridors providing no material benefit. Medicare continued to experience higher medical costs consistent with prior quarters, and Marketplace performed very well despite the late-in-year medical cost seasonality we typically experience. For the full year 2024, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $22.65, representing 8.5% year-over-year growth. Jeffrey Geyer : Our full year premium revenue of $38.6 billion Joe Zubretsky : represents 19% year-over-year growth, and our pretax margin of 4.3% was well within our long-term target range. While our fourth quarter performance resulted in our full year results falling below our guidance, we have a solid earnings jump-off point heading into 2025 and continue to be very bullish on the growth opportunities within all of our businesses, as evidenced by our increased embedded earnings. In Medicaid, our flagship business representing nearly 80% of revenue, we reported a 90.3% NCR for the full year, or 89.8% when adjusting for the impact of higher MCRs on new stores and the prior year California retro item. With respect to observed medical cost trend in 2024, it was certainly a tale of two halves. In the first half of the year, medical costs trended slightly higher than our initial expectations, primarily due to the acuity shift caused by redeterminations. However, MCRs remained lower in the first half of the year because the acuity shift impact was moderated by our medical cost management, risk corridor protection, Jeffrey Geyer : and rate increases. Joe Zubretsky : In the second half of the year, we experienced higher than expected utilization among the continuing population. Jeffrey Geyer : The second half rate increases Joe Zubretsky : and risk corridors were not sufficient to completely offset the higher medical cost pressure that continued into the fourth quarter. In Medicare, the full year MCR was 89.1%. The business performed as well as we could have expected, given some of the dynamics the industry has experienced. In Marketplace, the MCR was 75.4% for the full year and significantly outperformed our long-term target range. This was the second consecutive year Marketplace outperformed its long-term target margins. This outperformance allowed us to reinvest excess margin into 2025 pricing to drive higher growth and sustain mid-single-digit pretax margins. Our G&A ratio performance has been excellent at 6.7% for the full year. We continue to have the discipline to harvest fixed cost leverage, manage our internal resources effectively, increase productivity, and negotiate attractive vendor contracts. Turning now to our growth initiatives, 2024 was an extraordinary year for securing future growth on top of the reported 19% premium revenue growth, starting with recent acquisitions. On February 1st, we closed our acquisition of Connecticut from EmblemHealth. In this year, we expect $1.2 billion of revenue, mostly in Marketplace. With respect to new contract wins, in Georgia, the state announced its intent to award it to Medicaid managed care services contract. This was a significant win with an estimated $2 billion in annual premium revenue based on expected market share. We also have significant new contract win Jeffrey Geyer : We Joe Zubretsky : We successfully procured dual contracts that will expand our footprint in Ohio, Michigan, Massachusetts, and Idaho. Jeffrey Geyer : The incremental revenue from these new contracts Joe Zubretsky : is over $3 billion, an increase from the prior estimate of $1.8 billion we had shared at our November Investor Day. 2024 was also a year in which we successfully defended RFPs in key states. We retained traditional Medicaid contracts in our Michigan, Florida, and Wisconsin businesses. These contracts represent over $2 billion of renewed premium revenue. While we are disappointed in the Virginia contract loss, this award is under protest, and the current contract will extend well into 2025. We are very pleased with the execution of our 2024, and in that context, we further note when all of the aforementioned contracts are in force, we are well on our way to meeting our target of $46 billion premium revenue in 2026, and at least $52 billion in 2027. With our current footprint contributing its average annual growth, Jeffrey Geyer : and now fully considering Joe Zubretsky : all of our recent growth successes, the path to achieve these growth milestones is very clear. And most importantly, all of this recent activity has allowed us to increase our embedded earnings to $7.75 for 2026 and beyond, after harvesting $1.50 of embedded earnings in our 2025 guidance. Jeffrey Geyer : Having embedded earnings of at least 20 to 25% Joe Zubretsky : of run rate EPS is an attractive benchmark to support future EPS growth. Now at approximately 30%, we are very well positioned to meet our long-term targets. In short, we are solidly on track to achieve the growth outlook we projected at our recent investor day. Turning now to our 2025 guidance. We project 2025 premium revenue of approximately $42 billion and adjusted earnings per share of at least $24.50, which is approximately 8% year-over-year growth. Highlighted by an 88.7% consolidated NCR and a 4.1% pre-tax margin. Similar to the situation we accounted in 2023, this $24.50 EPS guidance is burdened with $1 of contract implementation costs related to yet another significant future revenue growth cycle we secured this year. These are complex programs, with a new contract in Georgia, and fully integrated dual product launches in at least four states. These are not speculative investments, but investments that have near-term Jeffrey Geyer : and certain realizable value. Joe Zubretsky : Mark will take through the detailed earnings guidance build in a few minutes. But let me offer some high-level segment commentary. First in Medicaid, Medicaid is projected to be nearly back to performing within our target ranges with an 89.9% MCR. For 2025, we project a continuing elevated medical cost trend during the year. Our 2025 Medicaid rates, most of which are known, are expected to be sufficient to capture this elevated trend. Whichever 2024 MCR you observe, Q4 at 90.2, second half at 89.9, full year at 89.8, or our 2025 guidance at 89.9, our flagship business is hovering around the 90% mark, nearly 100 basis points off our long-term NCR target. The business is expected to produce an excellent pretax margin of 4.3%. When the broader market receives the rates, it needs to bring itself back into balance, we expect to be operating well within our long-term ranges, and we believe that will be in the very near future. Next in Medicare, I would characterize 2025 as a year of transition and some early growing pains, Jeffrey Geyer : as the business transforms to serve Joe Zubretsky : the increasingly integrated and high-growth dual eligible population. We expect our 2025 utilization pressure from the second half of 2024 is expected to continue into 2025. Second, recent rates have not kept pace with trend. And finally, while our long-term outlook for Bright's earnings accretion is unchanged, we expect that it will be slightly below breakeven in 2025. Finally, in Marketplace, we are projecting to grow premium at 60% in total, half of which is organic. Two consecutive years of exceeding target margins have allowed us to reinvest several hundred basis points of excess margin into pricing in order to grow. Jeffrey Geyer : Our product is competitively positioned for this year Joe Zubretsky : and we are very pleased with our early enrollment results. We expect the business to produce an MCR in the middle of our target range and a solid pre-tax margin of 6% in 2025 while continuing to sustain mid-single-digit pretax margins over the long term. Our businesses are positioned to produce an earnings per share outlook of $25.50 in 2025. This is a meaningful measure of underlying performance Jeffrey Geyer : and represents 13% growth Joe Zubretsky : on full year 2024 results. When we include the new contract implementation costs of $1, our adjusted EPS guidance for 2025 is at least $24.50 per share. This is a solid foundation off of which to grow and realize the embedded earnings power of the opportunities we have already secured. Turning now to the political and legislative landscape, the facts are Republicans control Congress with a very narrow majority, and have a White House. Two budget reconciliation bills are likely to be passed in 2025. And political parties in the state legislatures and the governor's offices did not change materially in the last cycle, the states will weigh in heavily on any policy changes. Jeffrey Geyer : The question, and it is a question, that has been posed Joe Zubretsky : and remains is whether cuts to Medicaid funding will be part of these legislative packages. Jeffrey Geyer : We continue to believe that any changes to the Medicaid program as we know Joe Zubretsky : be marginal. Neither side of the aisle wants to see an increase in the number of uninsured, Jeffrey Geyer : a reduction in benefits for those relying on government assistance, Joe Zubretsky : or the related impact to providers. While our fourth quarter results fell short of our expectations, I am pleased with our team's ability to manage through the many industry-wide headwinds in all of 2024. Our revenue growth has exceeded our long-term targets, Jeffrey Geyer : We have produced a consolidated pre-tax margin Joe Zubretsky : within our long-term target range Jeffrey Geyer : and Joe Zubretsky : embedded earnings has reached a new high. The 2025 earnings profile is solid and perhaps industry-leading in managed Medicaid. Jeffrey Geyer : All of this allows us to remain very confident Joe Zubretsky : in our ability to achieve the long-term targets that we shared with you at our November Investor Day. Jeffrey Geyer : Finally, I want to thank our eighteen thousand Joe Zubretsky : five hundred dedicated associates who work tirelessly on behalf of our members and our stakeholders. Their day-to-day efforts, particularly in the face of difficulty, danger, and natural disasters, are in a word, heroic. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials. Mark? Jeffrey Geyer : Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss some additional details on our fourth quarter and the full year performance, the balance sheet, and our 2025 guidance. Beginning with our fourth quarter and full year 2024 results, we reported approximately $10.5 billion in total revenue and $10 billion of premium revenue, with adjusted EPS of $5.05. On a consolidated basis, our fourth quarter MCR was 90.2, and our full year MCR was 89.1, reflecting higher than expected medical costs in the second half of the year in both Medicaid and Medicare. In Medicaid, our fourth quarter MCR was 90.2. Consistent with the third quarter, the Medicaid MCR reflected higher utilization, particularly for LTSS, Joe Zubretsky : pharmacy, Jeffrey Geyer : and behavioral health services. We previously expected 50 basis points of trend in the fourth quarter of what we considered to be an inflated baseline in the third quarter. Joe Zubretsky : However, fourth quarter net Jeffrey Geyer : trend was approximately 1.2%, and we saw no material benefit from risk corridors. For the full year, the reported Medicaid MCR was 90.3, which restates to 89.8 when adjusting for the prior year California retro item and the impact of new store businesses. Given the unprecedented challenges of rates and trends in the year, we demonstrated strong operating performance with that MCR just 80 basis points above our long-term range. In Medicare, our fourth quarter MCR was 93.8, and our full year MCR was 89.1, both above our long-term range. Higher medical costs in the quarter reflected continued higher utilization of LTSS in pharmacy, as well as higher outpatient utilization within our DStent population. The fourth quarter also reflects the seasonal impact of CMS annual facility fee schedule increases and the revenue recognition of certain risk adjustment items. As Joe mentioned, we remain confident in our 2025 bids and believe our pricing strategy was conservative enough to protect against higher medical cost trend that occurred in the second half of 2024 and is expected to continue in 2025. In Marketplace, our fourth quarter MCR was 83.3, reflecting normal late-in-year seasonality. Our full year Marketplace MCR was 75.4 and well below our long-term target range for the second consecutive year. This allowed us to reinvest excess margin into pricing to achieve significant growth for 2025. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 6.3, and our full year adjusted G&A ratio was 6.7. This was the second consecutive quarter we benefited from renegotiated vendor contracts and several one-time items. We're very pleased with the disciplined cost management productivity and leverage we continue to demonstrate. Turning to the balance sheet, our capital foundation remains strong. In the quarter, we harvested approximately $327 million of subsidiary dividends. Our parent company cash balance was approximately $445 million at the end of the quarter, a portion of which was used to fund the Connecticut acquisition, which just closed earlier this week. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million shares at a total cost of $500 million. In November, we closed a bond offering of $750 million of senior notes due in 2033. Debt at the end of the quarter was 1.7 times trailing twelve-month EBITDA, with our debt-to-cap ratio at about 41%. We continue to have ample cash and access to capital to fuel our growth initiatives. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter was 48, consistent with the third quarter and well within our normal range. We remain confident in the strength of our reserves. Our operating cash flow for the full year 2024 was $644 million, primarily reflecting the impact of risk corridor payments made in 2024. Recall that earlier this year, we made several large corridor settlements related to prior years. Now some additional details on our 2025 guidance. Beginning with membership, in Medicaid, we expect new membership growth from recent contract wins and growth in our current footprint to add over 100,000 members. We expect 2025 year-end membership of approximately 5 million members. In Medicare, we expect to begin 2025 with approximately 217,000 members based on strong open enrollment in our D SNP product, somewhat offset by our exit from MAPD in thirteen states for 2025. The acquisition of ConnectiCare adds 39,000 members. Combined with organic growth in our Medicare business, we expect to end 2025 with approximately 250,000 Medicare members. Joe Zubretsky : In Marketplace, Jeffrey Geyer : based on very strong open enrollment, we begin 2025 with approximately 546,000 members, representing 35% growth in our legacy business. To that, we add the acquisition of ConnectiCare with approximately 66,000 members. Effectuation rates among renewing members were in line with prior years, while the effectuation rates on our new members are stronger than in recent years. We expect smaller levels of SEP growth throughout the year compared to 2024, and forecast the year to end with approximately 580,000 members, almost 50% growth year over year. Our 2025 premium revenue guidance is approximately $42 billion, representing approximately 9% growth from 2024. Our expected premium revenue growth is comprised of several items : $2.1 billion from growth in our current footprint, Joe Zubretsky : two Jeffrey Geyer : $1.2 billion from the acquisition of ConnectiCare, and $600 million of revenue tied to recent RFP wins. Partially offsetting these growth drivers are minor headwinds due to the annualized impact of last year's Medicaid redeterminations and reduction in our Medicare MAPD footprint. Our 2025 guidance assumes the extension of our Virginia Medicaid contract well into 2025, while we expect the start of Texas Star chip contract to be delayed to 2026. Moving on to earnings guidance, we expect 2025 full-year adjusted earnings of at least $24.50 per share. Our EPS guidance reflects approximately $1.50 for the underlying organic growth in our legacy footprint, the realization of $1.50 of new store embedded earnings, and a $0.90 benefit from lower average share count in 2025. These items are partially offset by approximately $1 due to higher interest expense driven by the bond offering we completed in November, as well as lower net investment income. These components put our earnings outlook at $25.50 a share, an increase of 13% over 2024 full year. When we include the contract implementation cost of $1 for the recent Georgia and Medicare dual contract wins, our adjusted EPS guidance for 2025 is at least $24.50. I will note that these implementation costs are just 1% of the more than $5 billion in revenue we expect to see from the Georgia new contract win and the DUS wins in four states. Turning to our 2025 NCR guidance, we expect consolidated MCR of 88.7. Medicaid MCR at 89.9, 90 basis points above the high end of our long-term range, due to known and estimated rate increases just keeping pace with expected trends. This is almost in line with the 2024 normalized MCR of 89.8, which excludes the impact from new store businesses and the California retro item. So we expect full-year rate increases of 4.5% with 75% of our full-year premium already known, approximately 5%, and the remaining 25% estimated at 2.5%. Our Medicaid NCR guidance includes a trend assumption of approximately 4.5% and no impact from missed corridors as they remain constant over the two-year period. Favorable second-half rates versus our conservative estimates, any off-cycle rate adjustments, and further moderation and trend present upsides to our 2025 guidance. We expect Medicare MCR of 89%. The MCR reflects our conservative approach to 2025 bids and the expectation that utilization experienced in the second half of 2024 will continue into 2025. In Marketplace, we expect MCR of 79%, squarely within our long-term target MCR range of 78 to 80%. Moving on to select P&L guidance metrics, we expect an adjusted G&A ratio of 7%, which reflects 20 basis points of new business implementation costs and 20 basis points due to a higher mix of Marketplace membership, partially offset by leverage and increased scale of our business. Normalizing for these items, our guidance G&A ratio falls to 6.6, again demonstrating continued operating leverage year over year. In other guidance metrics, we expect an effective tax rate of 25.3%, adjusted pretax margin of 4.1%, within our long-term range, weighted average share count of 55.6 million shares, and we expect quarterly earnings to be evenly distributed throughout the year. Turning to embedded earnings, at our recent investor day, we had $6 of new store embedded earnings. To this, we add $1.25 for the Georgia Medicaid RFP win, $1 for our additional dual contract wins in four states, and the contract implementation cost of $1, leaving us with $9.25 from acquisitions and new contracts. Our 2025 guidance includes the realization of $1.50 to yield embedded earnings of approximately $7.75 going into 2026, giving us high confidence in our 13 to 15% long-term growth rate. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we're now ready to take questions. Yes. Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. Any time you would wish to withdraw your question, you may press star then two. And we ask that in consideration of the other, you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. So with those instructions in mind, we will pause momentarily to assemble the roster. And this morning's first question comes from Andrew Mok with Barclays. Andrew Mok : Hi, good morning. At the Investor Day, I think you gave us an illustration of what's needed to deliver on 89% Medicaid MLR in 2025. Can you give us a little bit more color on the components within that between rates Joe Zubretsky : trend, and corridors that came in better or worse than expectations resulting in Medicaid MLR 90 basis points above that. Thanks. Jeffrey Geyer : Sure. I'll Andrew, I'll frame it, and then I'll turn it to Mark. The MLR guide for 2025 in Medicaid is basically flat with 2024. We have good visibility into rates. We're projecting a 4.5% rate increase and a 4.5% trend off the 2024 baseline. That rate increase, 75% of it is known at 5%, 25% of it is estimated at 2.5%, lending to 4.5. On the trend number, we fully considered the second half pressure as we trended into 2025. All the pressures we saw in the second half of the year continue into the fourth quarter we included in our outlook for medical costs in 2025. That puts us only 90 basis points above the high end of our long-term range, which we feel really good that we're maybe a rate action or two, not a rate cycle, but a rate action or two away from being at the top end of our long-term range of 89. Mark, any color? Yeah. I'll just do a quick reconciliation of where Joe Zubretsky : we are now versus what we said at IR Day. Jeffrey Geyer : At IR Day, we were jumping off the second half of the year. Joe Zubretsky : And we wound up 60 basis points higher in the second half of the year for the results of the fourth quarter. For Joe's comment, we also thought that the combination of rates, corridors, and trends would give us about 20 bps. They wound up being pretty much breakeven, so we got about zero out of that. So about 60 basis points worse on the jump-off point. And pretty much didn't get the rate versus trend of benefit of 20 bps that I was looking for at Investor Day. Andrew Mok : Got it. And then in the prepared remarks, I think you said risk corridors didn't provide a material benefit. Can you help us understand how the geographic pressure played out such that there was no corridor benefit in the quarter? But I think you cited about 100 basis points remaining at the third quarter call. Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : It's a matter of geography. As we've always said, we're almost loathed to give a number of how deep we are in corridors because while it is a hedge, it's an imperfect hedge. If you have underperformance, it depends where that underperformance happens, whether you get the benefit of the corridor. In the fourth quarter this year, while we had forecasted, I believe, 50 basis points of trend pressure absorbed by the corridors, it didn't pan out that way. Mark, anything to add? That's exactly right. We're in 21 states. Joe Zubretsky : And the benefit of the corridor is not evenly distributed across 21 states. So what really matters is where does the trend pressure show up versus where is corridor protection remaining. That could either help you significantly or it can leave you no benefit, Andrew Mok : which is more or less what happened in the fourth quarter. Jeffrey Geyer : Thank you. And the next question comes from Steven Baxter with Wells Fargo. Steven Baxter : Hi, thanks. I appreciate the color on Joe Zubretsky : the full year Medicaid MLR and the components impacting it. Was hoping you could give us, you know, also the fourth quarter breakdown if there's any lingering impact from new store, any impact from retros, either positive or negative. And then to the extent maybe there was any negative development in the quarter to potentially spike out in Medicaid. Just trying to understand the jump-off point, you know, a little bit more clearly to think about the achievability of guidance. Thank you. Jeffrey Geyer : The Medicaid MCR in the fourth quarter, it actually was merely a case not to oversimplify it, Joe Zubretsky : of Jeffrey Geyer : fourth quarter dates of service trending at 1.2% versus the forecast of 50 basis points. There was no one-time items. There were no retros anticipated or received. It was from an accounting perspective, very, very clean. Trend outpaced our estimate. Corridor protection provided no benefit. The typical suspects, higher utilization, among the STAIRS population, particularly for LTSS, pharmacy, and PH. BH inpatient was up. And look at on the pharmacy side, it's not only GLP ones that are causing the pressure, but other high-cost Joe Zubretsky : therapies. Jeffrey Geyer : The trend pressure in the fourth quarter was Joe Zubretsky : the same as we experienced in the third quarter and was not muted, benefited, or detrimental by any one-time items or artifacts. Steven Baxter : K. And then just as a follow-up, would you be able to share the ID and R balance at the end of the year just to help us evaluate the reserve picture. Thank you. Joe Zubretsky : Absolutely. On medical claims payable, you might have seen we're at $4.6 billion. The DCP, which is an imperfect measure, but I know why you guys use it, was 48. Just to put that in context, over the last three years, DCP averaged Joe Zubretsky : 49. At the low was 47 one quarter. At the high was 51 one quarter, but averaged 49. The biggest driver of volatility around DCP and IV and R is how fast cash goes out the door. Right? Because the actuaries have a very consistent process of accruing liability. Having said that, cash payments are a little bit lumpy. So we're at 48. That's the same sequentially quarter over quarter, well within the middle of our range. I think that's a good proxy for the IVNR. Steven Baxter : Thank you. Jeffrey Geyer : The next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Hi, thanks. Good morning. Seems like the market MLR was worse in the fourth quarter. I'm not hearing much commentary around that. So maybe what the specific drivers were there relative to what you guys had put up at Investor Day Joe Zubretsky : And then just back on the Medicare Advantage, maybe if you could give us a little bit more of the specifics on the Medicare Advantage pressures in 4Q, you know, especially in the acquired book from Bright and maybe what changes you made in 2025 to give you confidence in the bids. Jeffrey Geyer : I'll turn it to Mark for the Marketplace commentary in Q4. Mark? Joe Zubretsky : Absolutely. Hey, good morning, Josh. Look, nothing more on Marketplace than normal seasonality. As you know, because of deductibles, copays, things like that, Marketplace is fairly seasonal and tends to be running hotter later in the year. Look, we were at 83.3. Maybe it's a little bit higher than we thought too. But on a full-year basis coming in at a 75, we feel pretty good about the year. Just chuck it up to a little seasonal noise. Jeffrey Geyer : And the only thing I'll add to that is the, you know, when you're coming in at 75 for full year. Now have two consecutive years of being able to invest what we call excess margins, margins that came in at 10% pretax, into the growth of the product. We're now one or two priced silver in 50% of our geographies. As Mark said, we ended the year with 400. We're gonna start the year with 600, end the year with 580,000 members. It's a great story. And we believe that given the dampening effect of special enrollment during the year, unlike last year, that it's a very stable book of business, and we have high confidence in the 6% pretax margin and the 79% MCR we're projecting for next year. For 2025. Medicare question mark? Yeah. Absolutely. Joe Zubretsky : We reported a 93.8 on Medicare. Part of that is just the industry-wide trend that everybody's seeing. Joe mentioned the drivers of trend in Medicare. LTSS, both skilled nursing facility and in-home. Variety of pharmaceuticals. And then the inpatient and outpatient both have a number of drivers in them. Again, that's not unique to Molina. I think we're seeing that just about everywhere. Part of the story too, which compounds the MLR is on the revenue side. We wound up adjusting some of our risk adjustment ultimates. The way risk adjustment works is, obviously, you do a lot of provider in-office risk adjustment. We also do a lot of in-home assessments, the combination of those. We adjusted our ultimate and took down some of the revenue a little bit. That's kind of a one-time item. You know, the knock-on question, Josh, which I would expect you to ask is how does that tee you up for next year? And I think look. Rates aren't great for next year. We're pretty conservative on trend based on what we saw in Q3, Q4. So what you're seeing is not a strong move in MR year over year. Just reflecting a lot of that. You'll see us pretty much a little bit over the top end of our range for guidance, but nevertheless, we feel we're pretty conservative on trend just given what we saw in Q3, Q4. Jeffrey Geyer : The only other comment I'd add on Medicare is the Bright business. While we have full confidence in the 1300 basis point turnaround, to get to the full dollar of accretion, we're not gonna be quite at breakeven this year. It'll be slightly lower, which is putting a little bit of pressure on the margins Joe Zubretsky : But at 89% MCR for next year, Jeffrey Geyer : a 2.2% pretax margin on nearly $6 billion of revenue, keys us up nicely to take advantage of the growth aspects of the duals and the integrated products. So we're quite bullish on our prospects here in Medicare. And with the early 2026 rate notice, I think, we're teed up for margin expansion in 2026 and beyond. Josh Raskin : Thank you. Jeffrey Geyer : Thank you. And the next question comes from Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald. Sarah James : Thank you. It sounds like you're assuming 4.5% Joe Zubretsky : cost trends in 25% down from the 6% you were experiencing in 3Q. What was 4Q cost trend and what's driving your assumptions of cost trend lowering in 25? Jeffrey Geyer : Let me do full year over year, and then I'll kick it to Mark. Because it can get quite complicated depending on which period you're comparing. In 2024, in Medicaid, our full our cost trend was 6.5%, half of which was the acuity shift to redetermination and half of which is what we call core utilization, high utilization of the continuing population. Comparing that to the 4.5% trend in 2025, the acuity shift doesn't recur. So we're actually projecting a 4.5% core utilization trend in 2025. Compared to a 3.25% core utilization trend in 2023, is 125 basis points higher. Now depending what period you compare, but we think that is a very clean and clear way of looking at it. We considered every nuance of utilization trend in the third and fourth quarters to inform that trend. Property by property, DRG by DRG, and we're very confident in that projection. Mark, anything to add? I would just repeat that, Joe, because it's a big point. Joe Zubretsky : Last year was 6.5% trend, half of it was directly because of mix of redetermination, so the other half was just hot users, the stairs. So three and a quarter, three I call it, this year, we're projecting 4.5% trend, which is directly comparable to that three and a quarter number last year, so you can see we've got a pretty strong trend baked into our 2025 outlook. Now I think that's prudent based on where we are, but if the second half of last year was the new normal, that's assuming a pretty strong trend above what we've seen in other kinda normal quote, unquote, years. So pretty strong trend at four and a half. And as we've also mentioned, offsetting that trend of four and a half in 2025 is roughly four and a half percent of rates. When we think about rates, we parse known versus estimated. Seventy-five percent of our rates are known for 2025, at five percent. Twenty-five percent, we're still estimating, but we feel conservative at those rates at two and a half percent. So they waited average to four and a half. I know most of them. And I'm pretty conservative of what I'm estimating. But the high-level news for 2025 is four and a half percent trend assumption. Four and a half percent rate mostly known, some assumed. Sarah James : That's helpful. Maybe just one more clarification. Since you know seventy-five percent of the rate and you have a pretty good view of where margins play, does that mean that you could get into your long-term goals for Medicaid margins for the whole of 2025, or would it be more exiting 2025? Jeffrey Geyer : We would need Joe Zubretsky : We conservatively estimated Jeffrey Geyer : the twenty-five percent of rates we don't know at two and a half. And the seventy-five percent we do know came in at five. Is it conservative? Perhaps. So there could be some upside if we get rate increases north of the two and a half that we estimated. By the way, we never forecast retros, and we're our rate advocacy process, which is really robust, advocating for actually sound rates and all of our contracts, could provide some retroactivity in twenty-five on twenty-four, but we never forecast that. That would be additional upside if we achieve that. Jeffrey Geyer : Thank you. And the next question comes from Justin Lake for free search. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. Joe Zubretsky : I'll ask another question on trend just because you guys have done so a good job of kinda laying it out for us at the investor day and today. If I look at the investor day deck, you're saying in the third quarter, sequentially, you had a 2.6% increase in trends. Fourth quarter, now you're saying 1.2. Right? So just annualizing that back half into the first half of next year. But if I'm doing the math in my head correctly, it should be, like, two percent trend, you know, kinda just catch up. As you annualize. So I'm just trying to think, Joe, like, maybe you could talk to us in a similar way that you did as you did at the investor day. And today, like, just like, what are you really expecting for quarterly trend? If you think about those little, you know, kind of green bars, you put at the investor day deck, for trend. What would you, like, I would think they might only be fifty basis points a quarter. To get the four and a half percent because you still gotta annualize the back half of this year. Am I thinking about that incorrectly? Oh, you as I said, once you're answering a question, Jeffrey Geyer : it gets really complicated depending on what period you wanna use. Obviously, if you use just the second half, the four and a half percent trend number is a lower number for 2025 than it is for 2024. To oversimplify the case. I'll turn it to Mark. Right. But we do have a lot of analysis on the quarterly progression of this. Mark? Hey, Justin. Joe Zubretsky : So last year, we mentioned six and a half percent trend across the year. Full year. But at investor day, to your point, we also jumped off a second half of the year view. Just because we said, gee, maybe the second half is the new normal. So let's baseline off that. If you look at our guidance, full year over year, we said four and a half of rates, four and a half percent of trend. If you jump off of second half in the framework like we did at investor day, it would be more like two percent rates, two percent trend. And now that two percent, you can start to think more like in quarterly increments. You're probably closer to your fifty bps a quarter that you're thinking about. Justin Lake : Perfect. Thanks. And then just a couple of quick numbers questions here. You talked about some one-time benefit in SG and A. Can you give us some more color on that? And then Joe, you said you're not, you know, rates away. You said you're rate action away. In one or two places. Can you tell us, like, can you give us any specificity of, like, is that it sounds like it's a couple of states. That you need some rate updates up from? Is that are those larger states? Or are they are smaller states where you need big rates or larger states where you're just waiting? For some true-ups there? Joe Zubretsky : First thing I would say is the two and a half percent Jeffrey Geyer : that we projected on rates that we don't know about is perhaps conservative. But let me frame it this way. The rate action versus cycle comment was merely to reflect we're operating no matter which way you cut this. Second half Q4, full year or 2025 guidance, we're operating a hundred basis points above the high end of our long-term range. A hundred. Based on analysis that we've done, external reports, regulatory filings, we believe that many market participants are operating at two, three, maybe even four hundred basis points above an acceptable NCR range. That might take a rate cycle. But when you're a hundred basis points above the long-term energy range, maybe a rate action too will get you there. That's my point. I don't think this has to cycle through one or two times in order to get there. Ninety basis points is, yeah, it's four bucks a share on thirty-two billion dollars of revenue. So if we can get back to the top end of our range when the market gets the rates it needs to get back into balance, we will comfortably be operating in the high eighties paying into the quarters like we were before all this happened, that's exactly where we wanna be. High eighties and paying into the corridors to provide that two hundred basis points of protection. Jeffrey Geyer : Thank you. The next question comes from A. J. Rice with UBS. A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Joe Zubretsky : First, just wanted to ask about A.J. Rice: quarterly progression across twenty-five, if there's anything you can do to help us Joe Zubretsky : think about that. Obviously, you got the dollar of startup cost. I assume that's more back-end loaded. A.J. Rice: You've got the rate updates, which we've been talking about on Medicaid and Joe Zubretsky : maybe you would have a positive progression there contributing to EPS. A.J. Rice: And then you've got more public exchange business, which is going to exacerbate the fourth quarter, it sounds like. Any way you can give us a little bit of flavor for how you think quarterly? Earnings layout over the course of the year? Jeffrey Geyer : Sure. I'll turn it to Mark. When you have the items appropriately captured that factor into the seasonality projection of the business. Mark, caller. Hey, AJ. Good morning. Yeah. So normally, we're Joe Zubretsky : little bit front-end loaded, with EPS. And what I'm saying this year is we'll be fifty-fifty, very evenly distributed quarter to quarter. So what's different? The first big driver is you've got a specific accounting of where we are on rates within the year quarter to quarter. We talked about how we know seventy-five percent of them, but we also know specifically when they come in. We also have a specific view on that trend number four and a half, how it seasonalizes. So you've got that as one of the bigger drivers. A.J. Rice: Next, you've got just a little bit of carryover from new stores. Joe Zubretsky : Last year. It's not it's not as big a phenomenon as it was last year. We're not gonna call significant attention to it, but you still got a little bit of that going on. So that more or less levels MRR quarter to quarter in the year. Now the other thing that's going on is G&A. I heard your statement, but believe it or not, we're front-end loaded on G&A this year with a lot of the initiatives we have. We have a bunch of go-readies January first of twenty twenty-six. And a lot of the IT spend, a lot of the upfront investment comes in early. Which front ends our G&A. So those things are a little bit different this year. I take your point on more Marketplace, which is typically a little bit back-end loaded on MR, yes. That's true. Like you put our three businesses together, we've got a pretty even outlook on our margins and therefore our EPS. A.J. Rice: Okay. Alright. That's helpful. Then I just wanted to ask, I know Joe Zubretsky : you guys mentioned in the prepared remarks about A.J. Rice: keeping an eye on what's going on in Washington. Obviously, there's a lot of chatter about potential Medicaid reform. Is it a situation where at this point you're having some discussions with the states about how they might respond to some of these scenarios? And maybe relying on history, does it tend to push the states to put more of the people that they have Joe Zubretsky : put in managed Medicaid into managed Medicaid? Does it A.J. Rice: is there enough flexibility in the benefit design that if there's pressure on Joe Zubretsky : Medicaid funding that they tweak benefits and how this A.J. Rice: how does that impact your business? Any thoughts you can give us along those lines? Joe Zubretsky : I can't. I can't give you any answers, but I can give you our thinking. Jeffrey Geyer : And you're absolutely right about the way you're focused on it. Look, the market really focuses on the how. You know, if you come up with a per capita cap scheme, FMA match for reduction FMAP match reduction on expansion, block match, whatever the mechanism is the CBO can score. That's not the issue. The issue is what are you going to reduce in terms of where the money goes? You've got twenty-five million people in Marketplace, ninety-two percent sub twenty million people in expansion, hundred percent subsidized at ninety percent, Joe Zubretsky : In twenty-five million uninsured population, nine and a half percent of the eligible Jeffrey Geyer : Tell me which number you wanna see changed. Neither side of the aisle wants to see more uninsured. It's below ten percent of eligibles for the first time in decades. Reduction in benefits. Reduction in enrollment, reduction in payments to providers, or none of the above. And I either have to, as a state, decrease my education budget or raise taxes. None of those solutions is politically tenable. That's what the focus on. The way to cut a cost is actually actuarially and financially determinable. Where that would go is where the political tension exists. It's either gotta be membership benefits to existing members, membership, reductions of payments to providers, or higher taxes for the citizens of the state. Neither of those approaches is politically tenable. That's why we conclude that any changes to manage Medicaid as we know it today would be marginal. Jeffrey Geyer : Thank you. And the next question comes from Adam Ron with Bank of America. Adam Ron : Hey. Thanks. If I could ask two cleaner questions. Joe Zubretsky : First, I think you mentioned in 4Q, you didn't get a lot of benefit from the risk corridors that you talked about in 2024. So if you could Adam Ron : update your thinking around that and how Joe Zubretsky : if you have any cushion for 2025 on risk corridor still and what it would take to realize them. And then second, if I could just squeeze the second question now, Adam Ron : On Medicare, I think you mentioned MLR would be flat year over year versus 2024, but you grew membership and Q4 was Joe Zubretsky : a little hot in terms of utilization. Adam Ron : Then you have United guiding up MLR on Joe Zubretsky : presumably Medicare. So curious what gives you comfort there. Thanks. Jeffrey Geyer : Touch the first question first, and I'll take it to Mark. On risk corridor, what we're saying is the amount of corridor liability we have year over year is unchanged. Therefore, it's not providing a benefit or a detriment to the P&L. And when we're operating a hundred basis points above our target range, we're not gonna be deep into them, but we are into them in certain places. Now bear in mind, during a year, if you don't have a lot of corridor protection because you're not deep into them, there actually is at least potential for upside. If you outperform your forecast, you'll get to keep a lot of it or some of it. And so if we're projecting if we're looking at upside during the year, and we're not deep into the corridors in many places, and we're in the middle of them, then at least you get some of it to drop through to your bottom line. That's where we are on risk corridors year over year. Mark, you wanna take the Medicare question? Yeah. Absolutely. Joe Zubretsky : So on Medicare, we reported an 89.1 for 2024. Let me walk you through a couple things to help the thinking on that. The first is, recall, we exited MAPD, traditional Medicare Advantage prescription drug, in thirteen states for 2025. While the revenue impact was not meaningful, the MR impact was. So take 40 bps off the 89.1, and normalize the jumping off point to 88.7. Okay. To that, we've got rates like everybody not that great for 2025. Call it two and a half percent for us. And I've got trend a little warmer than that. Now part of that's mitigated by our bid strategy, part of it's mitigated by our medical cost management. But two point seven ish on trend. Which nets you back to 89. So it's a lot about low rates. It's a lot about us, I think, being conservative on trends. And that 40 basis points benefit of jumping off helps us. But I think, no matter who you talk to, next year is a tough year in Medicare. Jeffrey Geyer : Thank you. And the next question comes from Ryan Langston with TD Cowen. Hi. Good morning. This is Christian. Ryan Langston : Could you remind us what your assumptions are on Marketplace membership attrition? Should APT Joe Zubretsky : see? Ryan Langston : But please not be extended? And then following that, is there any reason to expect that the Marketplace members picked up through this year's open enrollment could be perhaps any more or less sensitive to change in ATC. Joe Zubretsky : Thanks. Jeffrey Geyer : We took all the factors into consideration in our Marketplace member projection, whether that's SEP membership during the year, the natural attrition rate, the FTR, all those assumptions factor into a four percent reduction on a monthly basis, four percent reduction in membership throughout the year. Marketing together, Joe Zubretsky : Yeah. I think that's fair. When people talk about the impacts of program integrity changes, the agent of record lock is largely behind us. FTR, everyone's debating that. But we really believe the quality of our membership because we have a lot of renewals. Seventy percent retention rate this year in spite of a huge growth rate on the top line of membership. We have seventy percent retention in our new renewal book. That and the enhanced integrity around agent of record we feel very good about the integrity of our membership. So what we see a little impact of FTR, maybe. But I don't think it's dramatic. And Joe summarized it best. You've got FTR. You've got effectuation. You've got normal attrition. And don't forget, SEP good guys keep coming. You roll all that together. We're modeling about four percent attrition a month. We feel pretty good about it. Jeffrey Geyer : Thank you. And the next question comes from Michael Hall with Baird. Hi. Thank you. Michael Hall : With your MA, MLR, and back half pressure, I want to ask about the risk adjustment screw up first. Like, how much did they actually impact your MLR? And then just trying to understand Joe Zubretsky : the more in mark you provided, great color on the trends. Onto next year. Just what how much with cotton and the bids since you're pairing down your MATV exposure, in thirteen states, conversely increasing your D SNP, it almost feels like you know, your book is now more shifted toward that elevated LTSS application utilization. So I'm just trying to gain overall better comfort in your pricing, your bids, and your margins for next year. Thank you. Joe Zubretsky : Absolutely. So on DSNP, yes, we're increasing our exposure there a little bit. That's offset by the Bright book and now some of the Connecticut book. But remember, these trends in DSNPs that we saw rear up largely in Q3 and Q4, we've been conservative on our outlook for DSNP pricing, and I think a lot of competitors in the market have. Because our competitive positioning among many brokers has not changed. So I think a lot of people are dialing back in that way. We believe our benefit design anticipated a lot of this. Again, we've got guidance going to 89% next year. We think we picked up a lot of this trend. And more importantly, that same book of business has yielded a little bit over two percent pretax. So we think in spite of these headwinds, these are still attractive. And maybe the bigger point, Michael, is these DSNPs will get by, I believe, with 89% MOR, two percent pretax are such a big segue, though, into 2026 we move into the Feidie and Heidi environment, which just becomes a growth engine for us. With significantly more revenue, significantly bigger footprint. So we like 2025 as a jumping-off year into a lot of transition. I think bodes very well for the future. Michael Hall : Got it. Thank you. And just one more Joe Zubretsky : Exchange Marketplace. Yeah. It sounds like you're very confident on still Michael Hall : achieving mid to mid to mid to high tax margins. Forty-four percent does feel pretty strong. And I know you're investing or reinvesting your excess margin. But was that the level of growth you had been expecting heading in Joe Zubretsky : And it sounds like you're starting the year like, six hundred and twelve thousand Michael Hall : tracking down to five eighty, and I think he mentioned four percent reduction monthly. But specifically related to the FTR recheck how much in the ineffectuation rate have you identified and you know, embedded in your guide specifically from, like, now through April or May when those recheck checks finish. Thank you. Joe Zubretsky : So whenever we give you numbers, we give it net of our effectuation and other forms of attrition. So that you don't have to do additional math and hedge it. We believe we've hedged it with our best judgments on all those items. Now I heard you mentioned the forty-four percent statistic. A lot of people are throwing that around. I believe that quarter one versus quarter one a year ago, and that's a little bit of a dangerous growth number. Because what happened last year is SEP was so strong through the year that the Q1 number naturally grew dramatically across the year. So if you really look at jumping off of Q4, because we grew during the year, with all the SEP gains from redetermination, it's a significantly lower growth number Q4 to Q1. It's still a very nice growth number, but it's not forty-four. It's more like half that. Now the good thing is, once again, that's still a lot of growth. But with seventy percent renewal retention, it's a lot of growth, but it's also a lot of continuity with many of the same members. Which as you know from so many perspectives gives us more confidence in our margins. So, yes, a lot of growth, but if you look at all the growth we put on Q2, Q3, Q4, not such a big statement. And a lot of continuity coming into it with a really good renewal rate. Now we have, right now, probably a fluctuation rate in the mid-eighties. We feel really good about that. That's much higher than normal. And I think for two reasons. One, we've got much more renewal retention which means the fluctuation is gonna be higher. But the other thing is, I believe the agent of record luck really created a lot more quality of new membership or not churn membership so that members knew they were being signed up, were very active in the process, you're less likely to have lapses, non-payments, things like that. So I think boding well for this year, both on great effectuation rates but also great renewal retention rates. Jeffrey Geyer : Thank you. And the next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Scott Fidel : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to just actually just follow back up on the last question. Just still on the exchange margin expectations and I'm not sure if I'm missing something, but maybe you could help us with the bridge of you know, you guys talked about around seventy percent of the enrollment being from retention and what we saw know, your rates, you know, in terms of your same-store rates, I think they were sort of flat to down in terms of yield. For twenty-four to twenty-five. So just trying to get to sort of the comfort with the six percent margin. You know, around sort of the I guess the view on trend that you may have on those retained members or you know, anything else around the product design, that would sort of bridge, you know, given pretty minimal, you know, yield, Joe Zubretsky : year over year on those members. Jeffrey Geyer : I'll take it to market in a minute, but we consciously when you're producing ten percent to eleven percent pretax margins two years in a row, one, you gotta remain competitive. And two, if you keep it there, you're gonna run into the three-year minimum MLR. So it makes perfect sense to invest the excess margin and growth. It's a calibration. You try to set your product to be competitively positioned. As I said, we are number one or two silver priced in fifty percent of our geographies. We netted a hundred and thirty thousand members in open enrollment. Had, I think, two hundred fifty thousand ads and a hundred and thirty terms, which gave us a nice jumping-off point. So Joe Zubretsky : we have high confidence in the mid-single-digit margin. Jeffrey Geyer : The membership, as Mark said, being more stable, a higher percentage of it being renewal, means that you know the member, you know their clinical history, which gives you higher confidence in obtaining an appropriate risk score. So the fact that we have more stability in the book, less special enrollment during the year, and consciously invested a double-digit margin into growth makes all the sense in the world, and we believe the strategy is gonna work for 2025. Mark, is there anything to add? Yeah. Hey, Scott. So we're coming off Joe Zubretsky : seventy-five in 2024. M o r. I've got us targeting a seventy-nine for 2025. Which means by definition, we're putting less rate into the market than Trent. That's exactly what's happening. I've got trend a couple hundred basis points above rate. Quite purposeful because as Joe mentioned, there's a minimum MOR out there, and I'd rather invest back into pricing and drive growth than do rebates. So we're seeing nice growth. We're seeing really good price positioning. And it's quite purposeful putting less rate into the market than we anticipate trends. Scott Fidel : Okay. And then Joe Zubretsky : in the follow-up, I was hoping to get just two numbers on your picks on twenty-five. For I don't think we saw investment income in the guys unless I'm mistaken. So I would love to give you the investment income expectation. And then also, how you're thinking about operating cash flow. Scott Fidel : For twenty-five as well. Thanks. Joe Zubretsky : Absolutely. So call it about four hundred million would be my implied investment income number. Within guidance, which, you know, is a little bit lower than we saw in 2024, but I'm sure you'll understand the drivers of that given the Fed's actions in this interest rate environment. So a little bit conservative there on investment income. And on operating cash flow, yeah. You know, I get this question a lot. On a full-year 2024 basis, operating cash flow is down. Versus 2023. That is true. But if you think about it, the vast majority of the explanation is simply the corridors. In 2023, I accrued significant corridors and didn't pay much down in cash. In 2024, we accrued significantly lower corridors. You're all familiar with that story. Yet paid down significant prior year corridors with cash. Therefore, explains the vast majority of my operating cash flow. Now for us, growing company, operating cash flow should always be higher than net income. In which you saw in 2023, it was the ratio was one point four. Last year, operating cash flow was below for the reasons I mentioned. And I think you'll see a swing in that back in 2025. What's more important though Jeffrey Geyer : is cash flow at the parent Joe Zubretsky : And we have a really good history of moving cash from the subsidiaries up to the parent where which is where you can really use it. To be clear, operating cash flow isn't usable when it's in the subs. Our track record of divviting to the parent is very efficient. So I feel very good about the cash flow to the parents that I give you. And our ability to deploy capital. Jeffrey Geyer : Thank you.
