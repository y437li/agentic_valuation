Following a review of the results by Richard Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Andy Cecere, U.S. Bancorp\u2019s Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today approximately at noon EDT through Wednesday, April 23, at 12 :00 o\u2019clock midnight EDT. I will now turn the conference call over to Sean O\u2019Connor, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. Sean O\u2019Connor: Thank you, Tiffany, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Andy Cecere and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp\u2019s first quarter 2014 results and to answer your questions. Richard and Andy will be referencing a slide presentation during our prepared remarks. A copy of this slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today\u2019s call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today\u2019s presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Richard. Richard Davis : Thank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our call. I\u2019ll begin our review of U.S. Bank\u2019s results with a summary of the quarter\u2019s highlights on Page 3 of the presentation. U.S. Bank reported net income of $1.4 billion for the first quarter of 2014 or $0.73 per diluted common share. Total average loans grew year-over-year by 6% and as expected 1.3% or 5.2% annualized on a linked quarter basis. We experienced strong loan growth \u2013 strong growth in total average deposits of 5.1% over the prior year and 0.2% linked quarter. Credit quality remained strong. Total net charge-offs decreased by 21.2% from the prior year and rose modestly on a linked quarter basis as expected due to the unusually high wholesale recoveries in the prior quarter. Non-performing assets excluding covered assets declined linked quarter by 1%. We continue to generate significant capital this quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated for the Basel III fully implemented standardized approach was 9% at March 31. We repurchased 12 million shares of common stock during the first quarter which along with our dividend resulted in a 67% return of earnings to our shareholders in the first quarter. Slide 4 provides you with a 5-quarter history of our performance metrics, and they continue to be among the best in the industry. Return on average assets in the first quarter was 1.56%, and return on average common equity was 14.6%. Moving over to the graph on the right, you can see that this quarter\u2019s net interest margin was 3.35%. Andy will discuss the margin in more detail in just a few minutes. Our efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 52.9%. We continue to manage our operating expenses effectively and in line with revenue trends. We expect that this ratio will remain in a low 50s going forward and as we continue to manage expenses in relation to revenue trends, while continue to invest in and grow our businesses. Turning to Slide 5. The company reported total net revenue in the first quarter of $4.8 billion, a 1.2% decrease from the prior year and 1.5% decrease from the previous quarter. The decline in revenue year-over-year was largely driven by lower mortgage banking revenue while the linked quarter variance reflected normal first quarter seasonality within our business lines. Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 6. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $13 billion or 6% year-over-year and 1.3% linked quarter. Overall, excluding covered loans, a run-off portfolio, average total loans grew by 7.6% year-over-year and 1.7% linked quarter. Once again, the increase in average loans outstanding was supported by strong growth in average total commercial loans, which grew by 8.5% year-over-year and 2.8% over the prior quarter. Total average commercial real estate also increased over the prior quarters, with average loans growing by 7.6% year-over-year and 1.9% linked quarter. Residential real estate loans continue to show strong growth, 14.4% year-over-year and 1.7% over the prior quarter. Within the retail loan category, average credit card loans and auto loans and leases were higher both year-over-year and linked quarter while average home equity lines and loans continue to decline. The rate of decline in this category however has slowed considerably over the past few quarters. We continue to originate and renew new loans and lines for our customers, new originations excluding mortgage production plus new and renewed commitments totaled approximately $35 billion in the first quarter. Total average revolving commercial and commercial real-estate commitments continue to grow at a faster pace than loans increasing year-over-year by 11.7% and 3.4% on a linked quarter basis. Line utilization remains at low levels and was approximately 23% in the first quarter. Total average deposits increased by over $12 billion or 5.1% over the same quarter of last year. On a linked quarter basis, average deposits increased by 0.2% with growth in low cost savings deposits particularly strong on a linked quarter basis. Turning to Slide 7, in credit quality. Total net charge-offs declined 21.2% on a year-over-year basis and rose modestly on a linked quarter basis due to unusually higher wholesale recoveries in the prior quarter. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 0.59% in the first quarter. Non-performing assets excluding covered assets decreased by 1% on a linked quarter basis and 11.6% from the first quarter of 2013. During the first quarter we released $35 million of reserves, equal to the reserve released in the previous quarter and $5 million more than the first quarter of 2013. Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we currently expect net charge-offs and total non-performing assets to remain relatively stable in the second quarter of 2014. Andy will now give you few more details about our first quarter results. Andy Cecere : Thanks Richard. Slide 8 gives you a view of our first quarter 2014 versus comparable time periods. Our diluted EPS was $0.73, was equal to the first quarter of 2013 and $0.03 lower than the previous quarter. The key drivers of the company\u2019s first quarter earnings are summarized on Slide 9. The $31 million or 2.2% decrease in net income year-over-year was principally due to a decrease in mortgage banking revenue partially offset by lower provision for credit losses. Non-interest income was essentially flat year-over-year as the increases in average earning assets was offset by a decrease in net interest margin. The $12.2 billion growth in average earning assets year-over-year included increases in average total loans as well as planned increases in securities portfolio. Offsetting the portion of the growth in these categories was $6.1 billion reduction in average loans held for sale reflecting lower mortgage origination activity versus the same quarter of last year and a $3.8 billion reduction in average other earning assets, primarily due to the reconsolidation of a number of community development entities in the second quarter of 2013. The net interest margin of 3.35% was 13 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2013, primarily due to growth in the investment portfolio and lower rates on loans partially offset by lower rates on deposits and short-term borrowings and a reduction in higher cost long-term debt. Non-interest income declined by $57 million or 2.6% year-over-year, primarily due to lower mortgage banking revenue, which reflected lower origination and sales revenue. Growth in several fee categories partially offset the decline in mortgage banking revenue including growth in retail payments, merchant processing, trust and investment management fees, deposit service charges, commercial products revenue, investment product fees and other income which was driven by higher equity investment revenue. Non-interest expense increased year-over-year by $74 million or 3%, the increase was primarily the result of higher compensation expense and an increase in other expense which was driven by insurance related recoveries in the first quarter of 2013 partially offset by lower tax-advantaged project cost and lower cost related to other real estate loan. Net income was lower on a linked quarter basis by $59 million or 4.1% mainly due to seasonally lower fee revenue partially offset by lower non-interest expense. On a linked quarter basis, net interest income was lower due to the impact of two fewer days and seasonally lower loan fees, partially offset by higher average earning assets. The net interest margin of 3.35% was 5 basis points lower than the fourth quarter, principally due to growth and lower rate investment securities, loan mix and lower loan fees. On a linked quarter basis, non-interest income was lower by $48 million or 2.2%. This unfavorable variance was primarily due to seasonally lower retail payments and deposit service charges as well as lower commercial products revenue. Partially offsetting the decline in these revenue categories was an increase in corporate payments, trust and investment management fees and other income which was driven by higher equity investment and retail leasing revenue. On a linked quarter basis, non-interest expense declined by $138 million or 5.1%, driven by lower professional services costs, costs related to tax-advantaged projects and marketing and business development costs. Turning to Slide 10. Our capital position is strong and continues to grow. Beginning January 1, 2014 the regulatory capital requirements effective for the company follow Basel III subject to certain transition provisions from Basel I over the next four years to full implementation by January 1, 2018. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using Basel III fully implemented standardized approach at March 31, was 9% up from 8.8% at December 31. At 9%, we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. Our tangible book value per share rose to $14.99 at March 31, representing an 13% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 4% increase over the prior quarter. In March, we received the results of our 2014 Comprehensive Capital Assessment Review the CCAR including the Federal Reserve\u2019s non-objection to our capital plan. Subsequently we announced our new one year buyback authorization totaling $2.3 billion, effective April 1, and our intention to recommend to our board of directors a 6.5% increase in our common stock dividend at our June Board Meeting. Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Richard. Richard Davis : Thanks Andy. And to conclude our formal remarks, I turn your attention to Slide 12. Extending the advantage, words from the cover of our annual reports that appropriately describe our strategy for 2014. In this slow growth economy, our prudent risk management, efficient operating platform with industry leading profitability allow us to operate commutation strength. We will continue to manage, invest and innovate to further extend this advantage. Yesterday, I had the privilege of leading our Annual Shareholder Meeting in Kansas City. In addition to conducting the official business of the meeting, I told our shareholders how proud I am of what our 67,000 remarkable employees have accomplished and how engaged they are and helping us to be competing to our success. We remain focused on always producing consistent, predictable and repeatable results for the benefit of our customers, our employees, our communities and our shareholders. That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer questions from the audience. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom of RBC Capital Markets. Jon Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Hey, good morning guys. Richard Davis : Good morning, Jon. Jon Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Richard, can you give us an update on some of your loan growth expectations and maybe touch a little bit on [inaudible] changes in terms of what\u2019s driving some of the commercial growth? Richard Davis : Be happy to. Thanks Jon. First of all, as you see our linked quarter was 1.3% and we have been saying we\u2019re in that range of 1% to 1.5%. Based on our ending period not just our average and based on what we\u2019re seeing, I\u2019ll expect that range to continue at quarter two at the high end. So, we\u2019re actually seeing some slight [inaudible] continued improvement along the way. Now, we\u2019re seeing it across the board, so wholesale as you\u2019ve seen in the last many quarters has been driving the majority of that and that continues, leverage lending in middle market remain mostly active as well as loan growth in the western markets particularly the Western United States for wholesale and then seasonal increases in food, ag and in the retail groups. So, we\u2019re seeing seasonality and continued market share growth which is not going to be stunning but at the high end of 1 to 1.5 that continue to show a trajectory and we think market share improvement.  Commercial real estate, Jon, strong on both coasts as it has been in the past both East and the West as well as Texas particularly in new construction and some investment decisions being made by some of our customers. The most active cities are Seattle, San Francisco, LA and Orange County, so that stays pretty much West Coast focused. This quarter we have strong loan production in small businesses up almost 30% over last year\u2019s first quarter, that\u2019s all types of small business particularly for those under $250,000 and SBA itself was up more than 50% over the last year\u2019s same quarter. So, we\u2019re seeing small business and I think something slightly more than what you might expect to see in seasonality. Residential mortgages, we said is off from its record highs but the portfolio continues to grow. Home equity, while we see that continuing to be the softest spot as we are sliding to get enough acquisition to offset the runoff we had a very strong March, which takes me some good hope in this second quarter particularly as we introduce some new programs and some pricing in order to encourage that behavior in the spring. And then lastly, auto loans and credit cards, they\u2019re both growing. As you know we indicated a number of quarters ago that we\u2019re going to double our auto loan production in the indirect auto loan and lease and we are doing just that, we\u2019re right on track. And to give you an idea, our quarter one production for this last quarter was up 33% from the same time last year and we continue to see our rankings and market share starting to move as we hope that it would. And in credit cards, the year-over-year also stronger, credit up 9%, debit up 6%, and prepaid up over 20%. So, I would say it continues to give me optimism that we can stay on the high end of that range and continue to see that getting stronger. I know last quarter I said we think that second half will be stronger than the first half, we still believe that as well. And I\u2019ll close with one my reasons for that belief is I think the Fed in their current messaging continues to allow people to believe that we\u2019re getting closer and closer to the moment in time when rates will move up. And I think our customers are starting to demonstrate behavior and getting really prepared for that moment and eventually they will use these unused lines of credit, they\u2019ll use their deposits and they\u2019ll start getting more lines on loans to I think accommodate that growth which is probably a few years out but may starting at the last half of 2014. How is that for a brief answer to a quick one? Jon Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : That\u2019s wonderful. I don\u2019t want to hog the time on the call here but just one more thing and maybe it\u2019s related but in terms of the capital plan in the building your capital ratios and the 60% to 80% range, what is the plan for the capital that\u2019s not returned to shareholders? Do you want to continue to build capital on the balance sheet? Is this \u2013 are you just signaling that maybe there is a little bit faster growth coming, there\u2019s more acquisitions coming? Just help us understand whether or not you want capital to build or not and how you plan to utilize the excess? Andy Cecere : Hi, Jon. This is Andy. First, if you think about the fourth quarter to the first quarter, part of the reason that \u2013 two reasons for the increase, number one is our unrealized loss went to an unrealized gain position with our securities portfolio because they\u2019re lower rates and that will change by about $300 million. The second thing is partly offsetting our buybacks in the first quarter was an exceptionally high level of stock exercise, stock option exercises from our employee base, I wouldn\u2019t expect it to continue at that level. So, my expectation Jon, is that this is sort of the highpoint, our normal earning asset growth, loan growth that Richard spoke to as well as our expected closure of the RBS transaction, the branches will drive that down in quarters two and three. And big picture, what will accommodate the reinvestment is our earning asset growth. Bill Parker : The only thing to add Jon we don\u2019t [like] [ph] capital so we\u2019re real careful about that as you know. And in addition to what Andy said we want to continue to have a little powder for acquisition, you saw we did a small [indiscernible] with Ally, Custodian Trust on Monday and we\u2019ll continue to look for particularly payment and trust opportunities and we are still investing a lot I mean, the one thing we\u2019re not doing and it be easy to do in times whenever things are not as sustainable is stop the investment in things like R&D. And our payments business particularly mobile, we\u2019re spending a lot of time and energy and money getting sure that we have the best ideas the next new emerging protocol for customers and we\u2019re not cutting back on those investments in this case because we think it\u2019s going to be important to stay true to that. So, the retained earnings we\u2019ll use for ourselves as well small acquisitions. Jon Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Okay. All right. That helps. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Erika Najarian \u2013 Bank of America : Good morning. Richard Davis : Hi, Erika. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Erika. Erika Najarian \u2013 Bank of America : My first question, Andy, I was wondering if you could give us an update on where you stand with regards to the LCR and how we should think about securities purchases from here? And maybe help us understand how earning assets grows as you\u2019re [growing] [ph] to pace relative to the loan growth expectations that you laid out? Andy Cecere : Right. So, Erika, as we talked about in the last call, we did increase our securities portfolio from $80 billion to $85 billion in quarter one. My expectation is we will grow that to $90 billion in quarter two, so up somewhere similar amount another $5 billion. We\u2019re getting very close in terms of our target here, but we\u2019re \u2013 I\u2019m not going to give you a final number until we get a final role, because the final role has some uncertainty particularly as it relates to the offset on municipal deposits and that can draw our number one way or the other but we\u2019re getting very close but I would expect another $5 billion in quarter two. As it relates to net interest margin, I would expect a decrease that you saw this quarter similar in the second quarter for some of the same reasons. So, that $5 billion increase in securities portfolio will probably drive margin down 3 to 4 basis points and the combination of loan fees and mix will be another couple of basis points. So, I would expect a similar decline in quarter two. However, because we\u2019re growing earning assets, I would expect net interest income to grow in quarter two. Erika Najarian \u2013 Bank of America : And given sort of your comments, I know there is still the swing factor, is the liquidity built in the second half potentially slower than the pace for the first half for the year? Andy Cecere : Again, Erika it will depend on the final role as we hope to get in the summer months, but I wouldn\u2019t expect it to accelerate certainly and it will somewhere around the same level or down. The other thing I would remind you, one of the things we talked about also is that CAA or Checking Account Advance product will start to impact margin because that fee goes to loan fees which is a component of margin, that will start to diminish over the second quarter and then more materially in quarters three and four. Erika Najarian \u2013 Bank of America : Got it. And my second question Richard if I could just ask another one on commercial real estate in particular. We\u2019ve had comments from a large mega-cap bank, some large institutions during the quarter that commercial real estate continues to be a potential bright spot and that the competition is less fervent here than it is for C&I. On Monday, we heard from another regional bank essentially saying that they\u2019re starting to see frothiness in commercial real estate. Perhaps, give us a little bit of your view on this. Bill Parker : Yes, sure. I don\u2019t have any remarkable offers, I would necessarily align with Monday\u2019s commentary. We\u2019ve always been growing commercial real estate, I think this past we\u2019ve done in a very prudent way. We were the ones I think alerting people eight quarters ago about certain markets that we\u2019re getting sloppy as it related to multifamily as you start to intersect that with what would be for our closed property we\u2019re coming back on to the market. So, we\u2019ve been very, very careful not to jump into hard markets that when you predict where there will be once everything is built probably too overbuilt. So, we\u2019ve been careful there. I wouldn\u2019t say that we were less competitive, I would say all of our wholesale businesses are competitive. I would certainly think margin competition and as I said every quarter and I will continue to say because of our cost of funds advantage in our rating and if this will continue to compete on price and we can maybe one of those culprits for why it\u2019s more competitive on the margins but we will not give it out if it\u2019s a great customer. We will also not go for the customer if there is a structural need to diminish what would be a quality underwriting or something like that. So, I guess I would say I don\u2019t see anything remarkable about CRA as it relates to other C&I business Erika, but they\u2019re both competitive and more prepared to compete for them. Erika Najarian \u2013 Bank of America : Got it. And just a last question and maybe this is for Andy. Was there anything unusual to call out on the mortgage banking line, there is a modest quarter-over-quarter increase in given typical seasonality. I think the market would have expected that to be down sequentially. Was there anything to call out there? Andy Cecere : Erika, we thought mortgage revenue was going to be relatively flat to the fourth quarter and that\u2019s what it ended up being. We had a little bit of a benefit on the servicing rights effective evaluation but that has to be with earnings credit rates and so forth. So, I would say no, nothing remarkable and as I look into the second quarter I would expect a slight increase in mortgage revenue principally due to seasonality. Erika Najarian \u2013 Bank of America : Great. Thank you, for taking my questions. Richard Davis : Sure. Thanks Erika. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jill Glaser of Credit Suisse. Richard Davis : Hi, Jill. Andy Cecere : Hi, Jill. Jill Glaser \u2013 Credit Suisse : Hi, good morning. So, could you just provide some color in terms of what you\u2019re seeing in securities of reinvestment yields and [indiscernible] and just your outlook in terms of the margin going forward. And then just overall with your ability to grow [indiscernible] income going forward? Andy Cecere : Right. So, Jill, the \u2013 we\u2019re going to grow securities portfolios I mentioned about $5 billion on a net basis in quarter two. The securities coming on are about 25 to 30 basis points below those that are coming off in a quarter and then we have the $5 billion of growth. So, that combination of growth and the shift in the price are the rate cost us 3 to 4 basis points and that\u2019s the decline we\u2019ll see in the second quarter. That, and then as I mentioned the loan mix coupled with the loan fee is partly due to CA will be another couple of basis points. So, I would expect this to be down 5 or 6 basis points in the second quarter. However, as I mentioned, net interest income should growth because of earning asset growth. Jill Glaser \u2013 Credit Suisse : Okay, great. Thanks. Andy Cecere : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller of FBR. Paul Miller \u2013 FBR: Yes. Thank you, very much. You mentioned on the first question of follow-up, the cities that are the most compelling than that are growing the most, I missed them all, you\u2019re telling too, that was Seattle, Orange County? Richard Davis : Yes, I wouldn\u2019t say it once. I apologize. I said Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Orange County. So, I would write down the specific cost line there. Paul Miller \u2013 FBR: And so, can you add some color what you\u2019re saying in Texas and in the Midwest? Richard Davis : Yes. So, Texas is also the other market that I mentioned. These are markets where you got just underlying growth of populations and consumers, right. So, in Texas, you\u2019re going to find some of the traditional markets building out where the communities are getting large rooms were all continues and Texas has been healthy as you know virtually to the south period in time. The west coast primarily provides for what would be some of the transition to multi-family where we feel that as a safe markets based on the composition of growing and also just continued growth of \u2013 and migration in some of those growth markets where we see that personal and corporate needs for real estate continue to be pretty strong. We haven\u2019t spent a lot of time and energy talking about healthcare and some of the retail lease services because we\u2019re very careful on that area as well because I want to make sure that they\u2019re finding themselves in the right cities and we\u2019re not messing around in that market right now but we are looking in where development follows people. Paul Miller \u2013 FBR: And then, on the \u2013 you did a good job CRA in the competitive nature out there but one of the areas that you\u2019ve really been growing is the credit card and a lot of people showed lower credit card balances in the first quarter but you continue to show good growth in that. Can you add color around that, is that a big push for you guys? Richard Davis : Yes, it is. It is \u2013 it\u2019s a big part of our portfolio, it\u2019s like 7.5% which is one of the reasons why our charge-offs are always [indiscernible] number higher than most of our peers, I don\u2019t think anyone has the portfolio risen important as we do it to our mix and we like it. So, we\u2019re going to continue to grow that. I think you know that we have a FlexPerks program which is \u2013 it was derivative of when we lost the Northwest Airlines of airlines sold them in it. The most remarkable thing I\u2019ll have ever been a part of my career when I\u2019m done here, it continues to provide all kinds of new interest and we continue to get awards for it to get lot of visibility without having to spend lot of time on TV commercials and direct that branding. That brings the branch originations, with 3100 branches we really had not turned out the opportunity for that to be a significant source of really good high quality new cards. So, we have done that in the last six quarters and that\u2019s been a remarkable contributor to the kind of growth we\u2019ve had. And then lastly, Paul to remind you, even in our FlexPerk which I\u2019d mentioned a moment ago, we\u2019ve now introduced a corporate program a FlexPerk Rewards program for corporate cards which continue now to gaining a lot of favor as we realize that lot of these corporate and small business folks are interested in finding a way to retrieve some sort of benefit from using a card and that\u2019s taken amazing success in the early stages. So, I think there is more where that came from as well. But to say, that we\u2019re spending time and energy on credit card is an understatement for me to go back and repeat as part of our R&D cost have been protected under the area of cards not present which will be mobile banking and mobile payments, we\u2019re seeing a lot of energy there too. So, I would expect that to exceed most of our peers going forward in the area we\u2019re spending doing lot of money to make sure we stay ahead of the game. Paul Miller \u2013 FBR: And then one last on the order side, it\u2019s actually an area that you are really done a nice job growing. How is the competitive nature there? How are you\u2019ve been because everybody is focused on that but I think you\u2019ve done the best job out there than anybody. Richard Davis : Thank you. The indirect auto business for us has always been a core capability but as you recall we\u2019ve announced our [indiscernible] impact over a couple of years. We decided that we will go further down in the [indiscernible] so to the \u2013 we call them near prime. But we also realized that we weren\u2019t a big player in used auto. So, I\u2019ll just take you through an example, if you Paul or the F&I guy had the largest Shelby dealer in whatever city, you\u2019ve always knowing that we were one of the best paper then pick for auto loans and leases for new cars. And now we\u2019ve introduced used cars, you feel better about introducing the U.S. Bank\u2019s by paper across spectrum. And then the bonus round as you get more floor planning from that same institution because you\u2019re now wholly committed to them in a number of ways that perhaps you weren\u2019t before. So, for us it\u2019s kind of a two for three folks but we\u2019re also getting a high visibility of those dealers planning interest in taking the rest of our paper. So, we already are taking an open door and pushing it further open. I will say that in the rankings we saw in fourth quarter, we\u2019d moved up 1.5% in share from eighth place to fifth place among banks. And so that does reflect that our early stage efforts just trying to show up and I would expect that to stay in the top five which is one of our stated goals as we really double the value of this business. We\u2019re very careful, I didn\u2019t say subprime using clearly I just said something [indiscernible] below near prime but we\u2019re going to get a lot of that and used autos as well. So, I think that\u2019s the reason you\u2019re seeing a full line kind of a holistic success and I expect this to be one of our big replacement strategies for OB and new normal for mortgage in the next couple of years. Paul Miller \u2013 FBR: Thank you, very much guys. Richard Davis : Thanks, Paul. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Murray of ISI. Richard Davis : Hi, Keith. Keith Murray \u2013 ISI: Thanks. Good morning. Can you just touch on the expense outlook and obviously near term be interested in that but for the longer term when you think about age of compliance that we\u2019re in and compliance cost going up. Over the long-term do you think your efficiency ratio where does it bottom in the 50s versus history? Bill Parker : Yes. So, first of all Keith, I\u2019m glad you asked question if I would have found the way out do myself, so which I\u2019d be known to do. Keep yourselves, thank you. First of all in the near term, let\u2019s talk about I\u2019ll remind the audience how we\u2019ve managed the company. Every single 30 days, every 68 lines of business set with me and Andy and we look at their first performance related to their near term forecast and most of it or rest of whatever year we\u2019re under. So, we create a placer on your call looking around corners. And we thought ourselves on that and as we look around the corners, we continue to measure and manage what it starts out a proper plan continue the year and we adjust it all through the year. And so, as we see any stress on revenue and it could be not so much on volume but it might on margins and on the total income then we\u2019re going to manage the same thing on expenses. So, we manage expenses 30 days at the time and we are watching every nickel and dime and it\u2019s not without surprise to you that we are very, very prudent right now and we\u2019re watching all discretionary costs, we\u2019re measuring it very closely, we\u2019re watching all new hires and we\u2019re being excessively prudent right now because until I see a sustain and a very robust revenue in future, we\u2019re going to be very careful and we\u2019re actually watching our expenses to a level below, we thought that would be when we set the plan six months ago. So, hopefully that gives you all confidence and we\u2019re not to watch that. Secondly, the efficiency ratio, there is nothing more than the result of positive operating leverage and we promise you positive operating leverage this year and we\u2019re going to deliver it. Naively, but that\u2019s the whole part of watching the expenses but that they stay below the revenue growth that we\u2019re of course seeing and predicting. So, you will find as long as we keep to that mandate and our efficiency ratio stays in low 50s because that\u2019s how the math works. We don\u2019t have the goal for our efficiency ratio but because our goal is positive operating leverage and we\u2019re sitting at low 50s, you can grow that but not on the given quarter, but over the course of the year when it staying up to that position as well. If you want to go longer term, Richard Davis here thinks is as rates start to increase as the economy starts to pick up, we become in fact essentially much more profitable and our expenses did not grow at that same speed as our revenue and our efficiency ratio will probably does fall, that it will only be result, there is no target, there is no goal. And I think what you see now is probably one of our least attractive moments in time and the cost of compliance for all intents and purposes, they\u2019re in full burdened and most of what you see now as we continue to look into the future with a new kind of normal for the cost of compliance and audit. Keith Murray \u2013 ISI: Thank you. Bill Parker : Not only excited but [indiscernible] up until. Keith Murray \u2013 ISI: And just going back to LCR for a second. Does it at all change your view on commercial deposits and how you view them going forward? Richard Davis : No, it does impact how we think about different deposits in the company and depending upon the LCR runoff assumption, certain deposits are certain more valuable, we try to reflect that in our pricing, we\u2019ve actually incorporated LCR into our FTP system our Funds Transfer Pricing system. And different deposits have different value and that is a function of LCR and we\u2019re taking that into account. Keith Murray \u2013 ISI: Thanks. And then just last one, I know it\u2019s early stages but any update on reworking the deposit in banks product and what are the steps that you\u2019d have to go through on that? Richard Davis : Yes, we\u2019re working on it. We\u2019re working strictly with our lead regulator the LCC and but we haven\u2019t done a solution yet and as much as we\u2019re all trying to figure out what\u2019s the next step to try. If you follow the real tight balance of the user we lost some 30 some percent of total APR no matter how you calculate it on any given one day, you probably can find a price out but this is going to be the old fashion terms. So, dependent on the willingness of the regulators to allow us to try different combination of new products and new repayment practices. I know they\u2019re working good pace with a number of us trying to find that solution, I\u2019ve made it for the U.S. Bank\u2019s [indiscernible] pilot and tries certain variations on a program to see what kind of loan loss we would have offset against some of the benefits. I do think this industry needs a replacement for folks who would have some form of advanced need on financials before they get their paid but we haven\u2019t start building that yet and with number of us working with the regulators I think it\u2019s in the offering but it won\u2019t be here soon as our CAA products starts to wind down, so we\u2019ll have to do this again and when it does come back it will be at the same level of profitability but be much more of a CRA kind of a program that will be intended to test and find ways to serve more customers as this recovery starts to pick up. Keith Murray \u2013 ISI: Thank you. Richard Davis : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Andy Cecere : Hi, ken. Bryan Batory - Jefferies: Hi, good morning guys. This is Bryan Batory for Ken Usdin. Richard Davis : Hi, Brian. Andy Cecere : Hi, Brian. Bryan Batory - Jefferies: Okay. On the tax rate, it was a little bit lower in the previous guide last quarter. I\u2019m just wondering if there is anything unusual the ramp of the tax line this quarter. And where do you expect the tax rate to run going forward from here? Andy Cecere : It was a little lower Brian, you\u2019re right and part of it is due to a small state settlement we had in the quarter, so the TV effective rate was 28.1%. However, I don\u2019t expect a large variation for the rest of the year and I would expect it to be somewhere around 28.5%, 28.7% for the full year. So, right around this range, little higher but not much. Bryan Batory - Jefferies: Okay, great. And then deposits are continue to grow in year-over-year basis, but the growth was a little bit slower quarter-over-quarter, looking at the averages and period end balances particularly for non-interest bearing. Are we starting to see the very early signs here of customers growing deposit funds to fund working capital needs or CapEx or was there just a seasonality impact on deposits this quarter? Andy Cecere : Brian, it was a more a seasonality impact. We typically have a lower first quarter both because of our corporate trust activities as well as wholesale activities in the first quarter. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s yet decline that their drawing down to deposits for investment, I think it\u2019s more seasonality and I would expect it to increase in the second quarter. Bryan Batory - Jefferies: Okay. And one final question, the other fee income line was little bit higher than trend, I know you guys call out equity investment gains and some leasing items. Any sense for how big, the magnitude of these gains where? Andy Cecere : If anything is greater than $20 million or $25 million, we usually call as reserve base so it was more a function of a number of smaller things and that can be lumpy in that category. But we\u2019re talking about that category when you bring upon item you may have read on Monday that Nuveen was part of the transaction with TIAA-CREF and we have an ownership interest in Nuveen. When it\u2019s offset and done, that will result in a positive in the fourth quarter for us. As it\u2019s typical on asset management transactions there are components of revenue retention the customer retention that will determine the final price, but as we sit today, I would expect that would create a gain of a few cents in the fourth quarter. Richard Davis : Yeah, we\u2019ve always have vested our first American funds almost two years ago. Andy Cecere : 2010. Richard Davis : Yes. And that went to the real estate with an equity position and now this transaction will positively impact us later in the year. Bryan Batory - Jefferies: Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Richard Davis : Yes. Andy Cecere : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Scinicariello of UBS Steve Scinicariello \u2013 UBS: Good morning, everyone. Richard Davis : Hi, Steve. Steve Scinicariello \u2013 UBS: Just a couple of quick questions on the fee income areas, just want to follow up on the commercial products revenue. I know you kind of mentioned you had some lower wholesale transaction activity just kind of curious has that kind of since rebounded or what the outlook be from here? Andy Cecere : Right, Steve. So, it\u2019s a function of a couple of things, one standby letter of credit activity is down and that has been trending down for the past few quarters, I would expect it continue to be flat to down in the second quarter. Second, there is some syndication revenue in that line and that can be lumpy and the first quarter was particularly down, that may come back a little bit in the second quarter. But, generally speaking the commercial products revenue is a function of activity on the wholesale side, first quarter is typically low, it will come back a bit in the second quarter, but I still think showing components like standbys and other credits are going to continue to trend downward. Steve Scinicariello \u2013 UBS: Got you. And then just I know there is seasonality in lot of the card lines, the deposit lines in some other areas, any reason why those wouldn\u2019t bounce back as well or is it just purely seasonal that\u2019s put down this quarter? Andy Cecere : For sure, the payments component is weakest in the first quarter across most of the categories and I would expect that to continue to bounce in the second quarter. Deposit service charge is also lower in the first quarter, but a lot of that is also driven by incidents and activity on the retail side. So all things being equal, you would expect a bit of an increase in the second quarter, but it will depend on customer and retail activity. Steve Scinicariello \u2013 UBS: Perfect. Thank you so much. Andy Cecere : Sure. Richard Davis : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran of Autonomous. Brian Foran \u2013 Autonomous: Hi, good morning. Can you, I guess if you separate your footprint into the cold weather bid, in the warm weather bid, was the trajectory month by month noticeably different into extent the cold weather, part of the footprint was weaker, by the end of March was a kind of back to normal level? Richard Davis : We really didn\u2019t, it sounds so popular to say, but we really didn\u2019t see much, I mean even the Pacific Southwest where you have the more traditional winter and the lack of snow and things wasn\u2019t meaningfully different than Central and Midwest plans that we do banking and so, while there was undoubtedly some diminishment of consumer activity on those really bad snow events, but for ultimately that we\u2019re not counting on whether to be much of a factor and we certainly don\u2019t see a big pent-up catch up and kind of like a catch of the clock, because we don\u2019t see that coming through. Brian Foran \u2013 Autonomous: And then on the payments business, you had a couple of comments that seems more positive. We\u2019ve been through a kind of transition period first with the regulatory changes and with the Department of Defense. I mean, we are at a point now where we hit that turning point and certainly the comps are easier but the growth rate kind of returns back to normal or there are still kind of identifiable headwinds that you see in the near term that would depress results across those four line items? Andy Cecere : Well, Brian, we are seeing the decrease in defense and government spending go down. So, while we\u2019re still down year-over-year, it was down a far lesser amount, it was down may be 5% or 6% and it was offset by increased corporate activity which actually resulted in corporate payment systems revenue being up on a year-over-year basis, which is a positive sign. So, I think we\u2019ve seen the worst of it. I think it will start to stabilize and grow. Brian Foran \u2013 Autonomous: If I could sneak in one last one on the dividend targets long term, you\u2019ve always been very consistent about this, but if you could just remind us, both from your standpoint and a regulatory standpoint, what would have to happen for the environment to look like a 40% dividend payout instead of the 31%. Richard Davis : Yes, this is Richard. We have always kind of reset it some mid-90, 30% to 40% will be a dividend of 30% to 40% in buybacks and we\u2019re relying more on the buyback at this stage. Two things, Brian, one is we have been without the Fed oversight, we\u2019re going to be very prudent and careful to make sure the revenue we do is sustainable under renewed circumstance trust or not. And so a 30% on the lower end of that 30 to 40 per dividend and I believe that in the next year or few years, we will either get permission real comfortable permission we\u2019d have we want in that range but we\u2019ll start to think such a robustly strong 24 month future that will move over that number, because we like to give about 30 but we wouldn\u2019t get above 40. So it\u2019s going to be that slow trip somewhere in the middle. Buybacks in the meantime are a very elegant solutions to allow us to have that kind of permissions as long as the price is right and the financials are right to allow our shareholders to target a good return, we\u2019re giving us that ability turn out and off something given the uncertainty until we see things being more I think sustained. So, we\u2019re not disappointed where we are, all things told we would get there in a nice long methodical way anyway and I think our expectations were probably aligned pretty well with what the Federal permitted to do as we continue to prove ourselves and prove our stress that it to be accurate and other five years in a row. So we\u2019ll get there over time, but we\u2019re not doing a withheld and we don\u2019t really want to send a signal that we are disappointed. Brian Foran \u2013 Autonomous: Appreciate it. Thank you. Richard Davis : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio of KBW. Chris Mutascio \u2013 KBW: Good morning Richard, how are you? Richard Davis : Great. How are you? Chris Mutascio \u2013 KBW: I\u2019m doing well. Thanks. Andy, just a quick question, back on the mortgage side of the house and I\u2019m looking at page 40 and kind of give nice breakdown between the origination loan servicing and some of the inputs on the servicing asset. The one item I was kind of looking at is the decay, you know the other changes and mortgage service and rights fair value, you know that\u2019s been running plus or minus a $100 million, excuse me growing a negative plus or minus $100 million for the last several quarters and this quarter was down into the $80 million range. I\u2019m assuming that decay is less than previous quarters, because prepayments speeds have slowed, is that first of all is that correct? Andy Cecere : Yes, that\u2019s correct. Chris Mutascio \u2013 KBW: And then is that, I guess hard to predict clearly, but if the rates were to stay where they are and it\u2019s up on long term side, how would I look at the decay would it stabilize at a negative $80 million or does it get lower from here? Andy Cecere : It all depends on rates as you just mentioned, because of prepayments but I would expect to reach stable to maybe up a little bit depending upon rates within this level. Chris Mutascio \u2013 KBW: Okay, great. Thank you very much. Andy Cecere : You bet. Richard Davis : Thanks Chris. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom of SunTrust Robinson. Richard Davis : Hey, Eric. Eric Wasserstrom \u2013 SunTrust: Hi, good morning. Just to follow up on a two different issues that had been raised on the call already. The decline in the credit and debit cards revenue that you showed sequentially is a bit more than what some of your peers have demonstrated and I would have guessed that weather effects may have been part of that, but it seems like maybe weather wasn\u2019t such a driver. So I\u2019m just curious about what in your view might have explained that differential versus peers. Andy Cecere : I can\u2019t speak to the peers, but our number on a sequential basis is entirely seasonality if you think about our credit card, retail credit card revenue if you look at a year-over-year we are up over 11% principally driven by increased activity and increased market share gain. So the linked quarter is all seasonality. Eric Wasserstrom \u2013 SunTrust: Got it. And then just to go back to Keith\u2019s question on the payday events for a moment, I believe that you previously guided to us a quarterly impact of around $50 million negative in NII, is that the case and was that evidenced in this period? Andy Cecere : We did have decline across the, as expected I would say so across all other fee categories I would say it was yes it was as expected. So, on the payday lending or at the CAA product the full year numbers about $220 million, the first quarter was a little impact. The second quarter is going to be down about $15 million then it goes almost entirely way in quarters three and four. Richard Davis : That goes about line at the end of May, so we just be at small slow trip down to zero as the year end. Eric Wasserstrom \u2013 SunTrust: Got it. So, sorry Andy just because I was making quickness so that was very little first quarter of 15, second and then sort of failed out by third. Andy Cecere : Right. So, you think about it\u2019s just a huge number, if you think about $200 million it\u2019s sort of 503500. Eric Wasserstrom \u2013 SunTrust: Got it. Great. Thanks so much. Andy Cecere : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo. Andy Cecere : Good morning Matt. Richard Davis : Hi, Matt. Jason Harbes \u2013 Wells Fargo : Hey, good morning guys it\u2019s actually Jason Harbes on Matt. So it looks like you got a pretty nice blues from equity investments and retail leasing revenue and the other fee income category this quarter. Just curious how sustainable do you view that and we guys still expecting overall fee income growth in 2014 in spite of the weaker contribution for mortgage? Andy Cecere : So Jason a couple of things in that other category, there are miscellaneous equity gains that occur that can be lumpy quarter to quarter. So sometimes up, sometimes down, this was a little bit of a positive quarter as we benefit a little bit from those investments. You really don\u2019t know what the next quarters will be until we get the results from the events which we have, so it\u2019s hard to tell exactly, but I wouldn\u2019t expect material changes neither up nor down other than the gain I talked about that we expect in the fourth quarter from the Nuveen transaction, so that\u2019s number one. Number two, in terms of overall fee revenue, we\u2019re going to continue to have the headwind on a year-over-year basis in mortgage banking in quarter two because the decline in mortgage banking didn\u2019t really start last year into quarters three and four. But I would expect fee growth in many of the other categories and I would expect overall fee growth in quarters three and four once we\u2019re passed that mortgage headwind. Jason Harbes \u2013 Wells Fargo : Okay, thanks. And just I guess my follow-up would be on the impact of the affordable housing accounting rule change. Specifically, how we should be thinking about the non-controlling interest line, it looks like that\u2019s a little bit of a different number than we\u2019ve seen historically. Andy Cecere : Yes. And that was a function of change we made in the fourth quarter, I would say the first quarter is back to a normal level across all categories and the first quarter impact versus the fourth quarter was about $35 million lower non-interest expense and $35 million higher taxes, but that\u2019s now in the run rate and what you see in the first quarter now reflects all the accounting change than what we would expect to see in future quarter. So, the only change you\u2019ll see for us is really volume related, no more accounting. Jason Harbes \u2013 Wells Fargo : Okay. Thanks guys. Andy Cecere : Sure. Richard Davis : Thanks Jason. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Dan Werner of Morningstar. Dan Werner \u2013 Morningstar: Good morning. Andy Cecere : Hi Dan. Dan Werner \u2013 Morningstar: Hi. If I\u2019d asked you guys year and a half, two years ago what a normalize net charge-off level was, you would have said around 1% and clearly since then, as the quality has improved and charge-off levels have come down, if I ask you that question now what would you consider normalize charge-off levels both near term and longer term, what kind of answer would I get? Richard Davis : Long-term and let Bill answer but long term is still 1%. Under the mix of the portfolio, it\u2019s hard to remember the old division of day\u2019s right. But if we\u2019re all extending credit at the right level and we are taking the appropriate measured risk, especially with the credit card portfolio which has the level ours is and the kind of business that we will plan to conduct in consumer areas, 1% would be over the long-term. We actually never had 1%, you got since one way or the other. And based on the map of credit measurements and credit quality we could take a number of years to get to the one. And so we are not taking risk today to get there sooner than we should but we are also not trying to diminish what value we get from housing at 59 basis point but Bill [indiscernible]. Bill Parker : Yes. So, Dan we will measure that every quarter and I mean it\u2019s very plus or minus the couple basis point of that 1%. So, that just goes to the consistency of our outlook for the portfolio and how we underwrite. And as Richard said, the 1% is not a target per se. Dan Werner \u2013 Morningstar: Right. Bill Parker : It is a true, the cycle number. So in good times it\u2019s going to be significantly less and then in bad times it\u2019s going to be higher. Bill Parker : Okay. Richard Davis : And we do not going to see it for a while and even with our recovery that has been taken out, charge-offs are very, very moderate at this point and very flattish. So, at this undoubtedly, we \u2013 you know we kind of want all the banks to start going that movement northward as the credit quality becomes important and so does the volume in the more robust nature, people seeking credit in some cases not finding way to pay it back but I don\u2019t think it is just for a while. Dan Werner \u2013 Morningstar: Okay. Thank you. Richard Davis : Thanks. Operator : That was our final question. I would not like to turn the conference back over to Sean O\u2019Connor for any closing remarks. Sean O\u2019Connor: Thank you all for listening today\u2019s call. And if you have any more follow-up questions give me call this afternoon. Thank you. Richard Davis : Thanks, everybody. Andy Cecere : Thanks, everyone. Bill Parker : Hi. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Following the review of the results by Richard Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Cecere, U.S. Bancorp\u2019s Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon at Eastern Daylight Time through Wednesday, July 23, at 12 :00 midnight Eastern Daylight Time. I will now turn the conference call over to Sean O\u2019Connor, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. Sean O\u2019Connor: Thank you, Jackie, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Andy Cecere and Bill Parker, are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp\u2019s second quarter 2014 results and to answer your questions. Richard and Andy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of this slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our Web site at usbank.com. I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today\u2019s call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today\u2019s presentation, in our press release, and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on filed with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Richard. Richard David : Thank you, Sean. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call. I\u2019ll begin our review of U.S. Banc\u2019s results with a summary of the quarter\u2019s highlights on Page 3 of the presentation. U.S. Bancorp reported record income of $1.5 billion for the second quarter of 2014 or $0.78 per diluted common share. Total average loans grew year-over-year by 6.8% and 2% linked quarter. We experienced strong loan growth in total average deposits to 6% over the prior year and 1.9% linked quarter. Credit quality remains strong. Total net charge-offs decreased by 11% from the prior year and rose modestly on a linked quarter basis. Non-performing assets, excluding covered assets, declined compared to both the prior year quarter and on a linked quarter basis. We continue to generate significant capital this quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated for Basel III standardized approach as a fully implemented was 8.9% at June 30. We repurchased 15 million shares of common stock during the second quarter, which along with our dividends, resulted in a 75% return of earnings to our shareholders in the second quarter. Slide four provides you with a five quarter history of our performance metrics, and they continue to be among the best in the industry. Return on average assets in the second quarter was 1.6% and return on average common equity was 15.1%. Moving to the graph on the right. You can see that this quarter\u2019s net interest margin was 3.27%, in line with our guidance. Our efficiency ratio for the second quarter was 53.1%. Excluding the impact of two notable items in the second quarter, our efficiency ratio was 51.3%. We expect this ratio will remain in the low 50s going forward as we continue to manage expenses in relation to revenue trends while continuing to invest-in and grow our businesses. Turning to Slide five; the Company reported total net revenue in the second quarter of $5.2 billion, a 4.9% increase from the prior year. Excluding the impact of this quarter\u2019s Visa sale, total net revenue increased 0.5% from the prior year. The increase is mainly due to the higher net interest income as well as increases in a majority of fee revenue categories, partially offset by a reduction in mortgage banking revenue. Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on Slide six. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $15 billion or 6.8% year-over-year and 2% linked quarter. Overall, excluding covered loans, our run-off portfolio, average total loans grew by 8.3% year-over-year and 2.2% linked quarter. Once again, the increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans, which grew by 12.4% year-over-year and 5.9% over the prior quarter. Total average commercial real-estate also increased over the prior quarters but the average loans growing by 6.9% year-over-year and 1.1% linked quarter. Residential real-estate loans grew 10.5% year-over-year and 0.4% over the prior quarter. Average credit card loans increased 5.9% year-over-year and were flat on a linked quarter basis. Within the other retail loan categories, auto loans and leases were higher, both year-over-year and linked quarter, while average home equity lines and loans continued to decline. The rate of decline in this category, however, has slowed considerably over the past few quarters. Total average revolving commercial and commercial real-estate commitments continue to grow at a fast pace, increasing year-over-year by 12.7% and 3.1% on a linked quarter basis. Line utilization increased slightly and was approximately 24% in the second quarter. Total average deposits increased $15 billion or 6% over the same quarter of last year. On a linked quarter basis, average deposits increased by 1.9% with growth in low cost savings deposits, particularly strong on a linked quarter basis. Turning to Slide seven, and credit quality. Total net charge-offs declined 11% on a year-over-year basis and rose modestly on a linked quarter basis. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 0.58% in the second quarter. Non-performing assets, excluding covered assets, decreased by 1.6% on a linked quarter basis and 8.1% from the second quarter of 2013. During the second quarter, we released $25 million of reserves, $10 million less than the first quarter of 2014 and $5 million less than in the second quarter of 2013. Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we currently expect net charge-offs and total non-performing assets to remain relatively stable in the third quarter of 2014. Andy will now give you a few more details about our second quarter results. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Richard. Slide eight gives you a view of our second quarter 2014 results versus comparable time periods. Our diluted EPS of $0.78 was $0.02 higher than the second quarter of 2013 and $0.05 higher than the previous quarter. The key drivers of the Company\u2019s second quarter earnings are summarized on Slide nine. Second quarter results included two previously disclosed notable items. The Company reached the $200 million settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice to resolve their investigation into the endorsement of mortgage loans under the FHA\u2019s insurance program. Also on the quarter and prior to the settlement, the Company sold 3 million shares of Class B common stock of Visa resulting in a pretax gain of $214 million. Combined, these notable items had no impact to diluted earnings per common share for the second quarter. Excluding these notable items, the Company achieved positive operating leverage, both on the year-over-year and the linked quarter basis. The $11 million or 0.7% increase in net income year-over-year was principally due to an increase in total net revenue and a lower provision for credit losses. Non-interest income was up 2.7% year-over-year as an increase in average earning assets was partially offset by a decrease in the net interest margin. And $24 billion growth in average earning assets year-over-year included increases in average total loans as well as planned increases in the securities portfolio. Offsetting a portion of the growth in these categories was a $4 billion reduction in average loans held for sale, reflecting lower mortgage origination activity versus the same quarter of last year. The net interest margin of 3.27% was 16 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2013, primarily due to growth in the investment portfolio and lower average rates and lower rates on new loans, partially offset by lower rates on deposits and short-term borrowings and a reduction in higher cost long-term debt. Non-interest income increased to $168 million or 7.4% year-over-year, primarily due to an increase in other income due to the Visa sale. Including the Visa sale, increases in the majority of fee revenue categories, partially offset the decline in mortgage banking revenue. We saw growth in retail and corporate payments, merchant processing, trust and investment management fees, deposit service charges, commercial products revenue, and investment product fees. Non-interest expense increased year-over-year by $196 million or 7.7% due to the FHA DOJ settlement. Excluding the settlement, non-interest expense was essentially flat as lower employee benefits expense driven by lower pension cost was offset by higher compensation expense, reflecting the impact of merit increases and higher staffing for risk and compliance activities. Net income, on a linked quarter basis, was $98 million or 7% higher mainly due to an increase in total net revenue. On a linked quarter basis, net interest income increased due to higher average earning assets and an additional day in the quarter, partially offset by lower loan rates. The net interest margin of 3.27% was 8 basis points lower than the first quarter, principally due to the growth in lower rate investment securities and lower rates on new loans, mainly due to higher growth in wholesale as compared to retail loans. On a linked quarter basis, non-interest income was higher by $336 million or 15.9%. This favorable variance was primarily due to the Visa sale, seasonally higher payments revenue and growth in all other fee categories. Higher mortgage banking revenue was principally due to a favorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights net of hedging activities. On a linked quarter basis, non-interest expense increased by $209 million or 8.2% due to the FHA DOJ settlement. Excluding the settlement, non-interest expense was essentially flat. Lower employee benefits expense was offset by higher professional services and marketing and business development expense. Turning to Slide 10, our capital position is strong. Beginning January 1, 2014, the regulatory capital requirements effective for the Company follow Basel III subject to certain transition provisions from Basel I over the next four years to full implementation by January 1, 2018. Basel III includes two comprehensive methodologies for calculating risk weighted assets; a general standardized approach and a more risk sensitive advanced approaches. As of April 1, 2014, the Company exited its parallel run qualification period, resulting in its capital adequacy now being evaluated against which every Basel III methodology is most restrictive. The most restrictive methodology for our Company is the currently the standardized approach. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as if only implemented at June 30th was 8.9%. At 8.9%, we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. Our tangible book value per share rose to $15.26 at June 30th, representing a 13.2% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 1.8% increase over the prior quarter. Turning to slide 11. In June, the Board of Directors declared a 6.5% increase in our common stock dividend. As a result in the second quarter, we returned 75% of our earnings to shareholders. Dividends accounted for 31% of the return to shareholders and the 50 million of stock we repurchased in second quarter accounted for the remaining 44%. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Richard. Richard Davis : Thanks, Andy. To conclude our formal remarks, I\u2019ll turn your attention to slide 12. Again in the second quarter, we focused on extending our advantage, which is our thinking for 2014. Our advantage is real and it extents every one of our businesses. Our prudent risk management, our efficient operating platform and our industry leading profitability allow us to operate from this position of strength. The Chicago area Charter One Bank Franchise acquisition that we completed in late June is just one example of that strength. As we move through the second half of 2014, we\u2019ll continue to look to extend our advantage. Our 67,000 talented and engaged employees remain focused on delivering consistent, predictable and repeatable results for the benefit of our customers, our employees, our community and our shareholders. That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill and I would now be happy to be answer questions from the audience. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning. My first question is the outlook on commercial loan growth for the rest of the year. I think, obviously, your gains on an organic basis continued to be quite impressive and the commentary from the large banks have reported before you, has been quite positive for the year. And I was wondering, Richard, if you could add your commentary in terms of what you are hearing from customers in terms of CapEx for the next six months? Richard Davis : I\u2019d be happy to, Erika. Thank you. First of all, you are right. We\u2019ve had some remarkably consistent and industry-leading growth in average loans. And with the commercial kind of the wholesale banking being up 5.9% linked quarter that would be one of our best quarters we have seen in long-time. I\u2019ll first tell you that we are seeing and particularly in the middle market where we\u2019re really want to see kind of the core growth in the country as we see middle market businesses starting to expand in a more organic basis. Credit structures are firming up at the expensive pricing. I typically tell you we don\u2019t lose on pricing and we don\u2019t because we have a cost advantage but we do see a pricing compression in both in the middle market and the leverage space. But particularly I see that as a good sign of some forms of green shoots in growth. In the larger and investment grade credit structures and pricing remain much more stable. But they are also more driven than they might be organic driven. Loan demands for second quarter were particularly high, and in the second quarter we expect it to moderate slightly but still be at a substantially higher growth rate. In other words that 5.9% will probably moderate to something more between 3% to 5% as we look into the next quarter. Now, our loan growth is strong across the country. There is no regional definition. Retail food and ag continue to be strong and we see some weaknesses coming in oil, gas, energy and utility. So, it\u2019s probably where you had expected to be and are a reflection of loan growth and our forecast I think is in line with what you see and read about in the current economy. Finally, we\u2019re seeing new credit opportunities being driven by refinancing, but also seeing, as I said earlier, organic growth. What\u2019s interesting is people are starting to increase inventory, we think to build for a better economy and a better outlook in quarters three and four. I\u2019d long believe that as the Fed starts to get closer to whether it\u2019s a reality of increased rates and leads to believe that they are eminent and that starts to increase economic activity at the wholesale side as people prepare for a better economy. We also expect increased M&A activity continue. And finally we see companies looking to banks to create alternative avenues of funding as they want to prove to the rating agencies that they have a diversified source of funding. So I think banks might be back in favor again for reasons that make sense but especially as rates continue to be low people don\u2019t want to miss that one they will be closest. So, in total, I will answer even more than you asked, we were at the 2% linked quarter loan growth. We offer you guys kind of a range of 1 to 1.5 and we move around that as the quarter seasons. We are going to bring it back down to that 1.5 as a starting point as the quarter three begin and we\u2019ll start to iterate that as we get further into the quarter. But I think the 2% might be a high quarter for us this year but we\u2019re still expecting to be substantially impressive and somewhere between 1.5 range as we get further along into quarter three. Erika Najarian - Bank of America : Thank you for that. And again I wanted to ask about another area of strength, the year-over-year gains and card balances certainly outperformed even on a core basis still larger competitors. And I am wondering if you can give us sort of a sense of how that correlates with sales volume versus actual balance growth and how much is this taking wallet share away from the larger competitors? Andy Cecere : Erika, this is Andy. I would say it\u2019s the combination of all those things, as market share grow as well as core customer grow. So same-store activities, same-store sales on both the merchant and card side was up about 4.5%, a little strong in Europe than in North America but in North America right around 4%. And if you look at our card fees, both on the linked quarter and year-over-year basis, it\u2019s reflective of the increase in same-store and sales in the customer spend. And then if you look at balances, balances were relatively flat on a linked quarter basis, part of that is seasonality, but you see that growth year-over-year, the level of spend continues to increase, the level of utilization, so to speak, is flat to down a little bit. Erika Najarian \u2013 Bank of America : Got it, and just one last question for you Andy. I was wondering if you could give us an update on where you are with regards to potential or LCR compliance with the proposals and also how much further pressure we should expect on the margin as we think about maybe potentially building the securities book further out for each Q only. Andy Cecere : Sure, Erika. So, in terms, first of all in LCR, we are very close to that number. As you know, we ended this quarter at $90 billion in securities. We will plan to grow it to $95 billion in the third quarter, so $5 billion is more similar to what we saw in the second quarter. And once we get to the end of the third quarter, I\u2019ll let you know, but we\u2019re going to be very, very close as our expectations, the final rule will come out here in the next few months and that will guide us to what our final number is. But we\u2019re very close. In terms of margin, our margin was down 8 basis points in quarter, this second quarter. And there are three components; the first is their securities bill, I just spoke to, which costs us about 3 basis points; the second was the reduction in CAA checking account advance fees, which runs through around these and we\u2019ve talked about that, that cost us about 2 basis points; and then finally the loan mix, most of the growth that occurred this quarter was in the wholesale category. In fact, wholesale overall was up about 4% and retail was relatively flat. Wholesale is a little lower yield and that cost us about 3 basis points. So that is the 8 basis points in quarter two. As we look into quarter three, I would expect the same securities in past, about 3 basis points. I would expect a similar loan mix impact of 2 to 3 basis points. And CAA in quarter three will cause a reduction of about 5 basis points in margin, because our $39 million will go to effectively zero. So you had all that up, it\u2019s 10 to 11 basis points. But importantly, net interest income will still grow in quarter three versus quarter two. Richard Davis : And this is Richard. And importantly, after that CAA, those 39 million going to zero we\u2019re done, so that impact is over. And as Andy said, at this call 90 days to the day we\u2019ll hopefully have both the rules and know where our final liquidity build is and we can either call it done or call it near done and give you final guidance. But for that, all that leaves is the mix and we\u2019re all hopeful that we\u2019ll continue to do well on commercial and that the consumer will start to bid its own place in growth and in that case the margins will firm up. So, we\u2019ll telegraph you all that once those two activities at CAA and liquidity build are over, we think the margin flattens out and is very small movement along with the big reason of mix. Erika Najarian \u2013 Bank of America : Thank you for such complete answers. I appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache from Nomura. Bill Carcache - Nomura: Thanks, good morning. As we look ahead to the period where the Fed I guess excess reserve decreases the Fed [earnings] liquidity from the system. Could you talk a little bit about, presumably in that kind of environment, the strong deposit growth that you\u2019ve been enjoying decreases and perhaps maybe just you could comment, give us color on the packing order for your funding preferences as we look forward to a stronger long growth environment? And then perhaps also comment on whether you see banks having to, some banks having to raise more expensive funding to remain LCR complaint? Andy Cecere : So, Bill, I would say, our focus has been on the core deposit category, you\u2019re seeing good growth in that category across DDA, as well as interest bearing deposits and then it\u2019s across both the retail as well as the wholesale and corporate trust side of the equation. We have a great funding source in our corporate trust business, which represents about 15% of our deposit base, including our DDA balances. So we have a strong core deposit and strong opportunity for continued growth. And that would be our principle preference in terms of growth as we look at increased rates. So secondarily we have ample access to the wholesale markets in terms of debt issuance. And as you know, we have the lowest spreads out there in terms of our opportunity there, so that would be secondary delta deposit growth. And finally, we have a entity called the Money Center, which is short-term balance sheet growth in terms of deposits for wholesale customers, which just offers us another opportunity in wholesale growth. So, those are sort of order of opportunity. I will also tell you that we\u2019re positively bias to increasing rates as you see from our Q and our disclosures, 1.75% or so in terms of 200 basis point parallel shift, and in addition we have about a $100 million in waivers that will come through in fee income to the extent rates go up 75 or 100 basis points. Bill Carcache - Nomura: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you, Andy. I had one, last one for Richard. Richard can you offer some perspective on, you gave some very helpful color in your commentary. But perhaps anything that you\u2019re seeing now that gives you greater confidence in the sustainability of the recovery given some of the stakes that what you see to-date? Richard Davis : Hello Bill. This is more of the Richard Davis the world to see, and it\u2019s consistent. But I\u2019ve always thought that and this recession as we finally come out of it, that it\u2019s going to be the businesses that link first, in other words it\u2019s not consumed further than like it has in many times past because the wealth of that still isn\u2019t present given the housing values and some of the skittish nature of consumers heading down through this recession. So I am seeing more and more the consumerism will be incentivized by price lowering and by new activities and new product innovation by the wholesale sights. And we\u2019re seeing that, that\u2019s why I kind of don\u2019t mind. I don\u2019t like the mix version but I like wholesale growing. It makes sense to me it is growing faster and first in this recession recovery than the consumer. That also aligns with what I think we would all agree that under giant [yelling] we\u2019re seeing more and more while she will talk about how careful she wants to be about increasing rates, we\u2019re taking away some of the time specificity that used to be there, we\u2019re not linking into unemployment rates, we\u2019re not linking it to points and time. But we\u2019re linking it to a sense of how much longer can rates be lower and what kind of levers would it give to Fed and start moving rates up. I think there was announcement have been in our customers view that is coming to an end and that does encourage and incentivize people to take action and make some decisions that they have been sitting on for many, many years. Those are both I think sustainable kind of actions that will provide us with kind of next generation of slow but steady growth back into the consumers and we\u2019re looking for. So businesses lead out based on a belief that things are coming to an end on low rates, consumers follow then we\u2019re back into maybe a different kind of a recovery but one that we\u2019re all I think we all come greatly. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Bryan Batory - Jefferies: My first question is on expenses. So ex the DOJ charge they were pretty flat quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. So just wondering what the outlook is for cost in the back half of the year and if there is an expectation that you\u2019ll continue to drive positive operating leverage? Andy Cecere : Yes we do expect positive operating leverage. If you back out the two notable items this quarter as Richard mentioned in his comments, we did have positive operating leverage both on a linked quarter as well as year-over-year basis. We would expect to have that for the full year and we would expect to have our efficiency ratio continue to be in low 50, just like what you saw this quarter. Bryan Batory - Jefferies: Okay, great. And then next on the discontinuation of the deposit advance product, I think previously you guys had stated that there is not a ton of offsets either with new lending products or fee based products that you can offer. Just wanted to get your updated thoughts there, are there anything you\u2019re looking at today that could offset some of that revenue give-up in the net interest income? Richard Davis : Bryan, I would say, I don\u2019t see it, not in this category we\u2019re going to be looking more to mobile banking and some of the new innovative deposit products to offset that category. But to the extent that we would have to live within some of the new rules that have been created for that kind of a product, it would almost be a breakeven product. And we may still while come out with something, because we want to continue to be good stores of helping people, first time customers and help people that have certainly less means than the average. But at the same time it\u2019s not going to be a money maker. So, I wouldn\u2019t consider it a replacement for any kind of a fee category. I will say that U.S. Bancorp is working on and we\u2019ll probably have a product that will be sufficient to meet a different set of customer needs that we were meeting before. But I think we\u2019ll start turning our attention more to things like mobile banking and mobile payments and some of our payment categories through place where we\u2019ll be kind of forever loss and income benefit from that original checking account advance. So, we\u2019ll seek, it will take a longer to replace than it would have been just a straight up product but I wouldn\u2019t count on it. Bryan Batory - Jefferies: Okay. And the tax rate jumped a bit. Was there anything unusual there? And is the outlook still for 28% going forward? Andy Cecere : Yes nothing unusual 28% to 29% for the full year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets : Just a follow-up on the expense question, Richard or Andy, where are we in terms of the expense environment for U.S. Banc? I know that periodically you have the plan B, which is a more strict approach, based on the revenue environment. But just out of curiosity what is the message internally on expenses? Richard Davis : Look, we are on plan B right now. There is plan C and D but I prefer on plan B. Our employees have been really they trust us and I appreciate that a lot. In other words, we\u2019ve said in the outlook, new plan that we expected last November when we built 2014 was revenue up X and expenses up slightly less than X. And as you all know, I think quarter one was the last quarter we\u2019re not going to see that made up. And so we\u2019ve asked everybody to reduce their expense growth, still to grow but lower level as we expect revenue to grow but at a lower level. We\u2019re in the middle of that now and what that just means is we\u2019re not taking any risk, discretionary expenses and then asked, we\u2019re asking people to watch their nickels and dimes and to keep a close eye on FTE. That\u2019s not sustainable but we also don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to need to be, but we\u2019ll continue to employ until the economy starts to show a little more robust and sustainability. Having said that, I think we\u2019ve mentioned before, the key elements of expense growth are pretty much already in place with the Company; A, our CapEx, which is always the big number. We\u2019ve viewed the last few years to really catch-up from the many years before that. And we said our peak years behind us but we have the amortized cost that will continue further through next few. But we said our peak and that starts to move down over the coming years. We don\u2019t see any kind of a retrace back to a high level. We\u2019ve got the compensation in the FTE but for these acquisitions and new partners we bring on, we\u2019ve got a really nice steady state. Our compensation is at parity with our peers. Our performance plans pay people for performance. We\u2019ve been paying above target for the last few years because performed at that level. So, there is not a big issue there. And then finally on just general operating cost, we have one operating system. We\u2019ve raised that one operating system and we bring in the company, we bring a set of same singular view of operating integrity. So, we don\u2019t have multiple accounting firms, accounting systems and multiple technology systems that we have to integrate. So on one hand, I told you what you all tell me which is you guys don\u2019t have much upside in reducing your expenses because you\u2019re already efficient. And I\u2019ll say that's true and you\u2019re all welcome. We worked hard at that and we\u2019ve protected. And I think by staying in low 50s as we\u2019ve committed, it\u2019s a good indicator to use that we will let revenue be the driver to expenses. But there is nothing substantial that we\u2019re holding back on or which we had the opportunity to spend money on, it\u2019s pretty much as the runway. The last big dog in this hunt is whether or not compliance costs are fully burdened. And I\u2019m not going to be dummying up to say I think that we\u2019re done, but I believe the best in everything I\u2019m looking at we\u2019ve come to a place where our operating expenses aligns with compliance audit and operating integrity is pretty much where it needs to be for a while, separate some surprise and now we\u2019d like to put in place the last couple of quarters. So I don\u2019t see a big jump. Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. That's helpful. And maybe question for Bill Parker just on credit, I know it\u2019s really kind of a non-issue at this point but I remember\u2026 Bill Parker : You want me to talk about credit. I am here. Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets : Well, that\u2019s part of this is that, I remember when you broke through a 100 basis points of charge-offs and that was -- that seem like a big thing and you talked about maybe been a 90 to 100 basis point charge-off bank. Now it seems like we\u2019re bouncing around 60. Is this the trough bill or is this feel like normal where it\u2019s kind of bounce around or whether the puts and takes in terms of a loss outlook? Bill Parker : Well, in terms of the environment we\u2019re in, which is a stable economy, modestly improving economy, yes our outlook for our losses are fairly stable. The one area we still have some room for improvement and based on the decline and delinquencies that we saw this quarter would be in residential mortgage. So, there is still room for improvement there. But for this type of environment that, that 90 to 100 that you mentioned we\u2019d refine that every quarter, right now it\u2019s 96. But that's a through the cycle measure, it looks of good times and the bad times. So right now where we\u2019re at is a comfortable spot for this type of environment. Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. And Bill anything making you nervous or anything where you\u2019re holding the line and saying that we\u2019re not going to do that? Bill Parker : Well, I wouldn\u2019t be doing my job for some of those. But in general, we have not materially changed any of our underwriting standards. The only thing we did coming out of the downturn was do some controlled expansion on our indirect auto portfolio, that's gone well. We\u2019ve had strong originations in that space, but it\u2019s all very high credit quality. Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets : Okay, all right. Thank you. Bill Parker : Thanks Jon. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dan Werner with Morningstar. Dan Werner - Morningstar: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess relative to with credit quality kind of expanding on that, with commercial loan growing and kind of driving the loan growth here and stable credit quality you\u2019re still releasing reserves here. Should we expect that to continue or reverse going forward as loans continue to grow here? Bill Parker : Well, some day, yes. And I can\u2019t tell you the exact infection point. But our reserve release this quarter was $25 million, so very modest less than or about a penny of share. So whether we release a little or start adding a little depending upon the strength of loan and commitment growth, I\u2019d say it\u2019s not that relevant to the earnings potential going forward. But we watch that, we still have little bit of credit improvement to go and so we watch that balance that with our loan and commitment growth. Richard Davis : Yes, Dan, it will be a super easily telegraph very soft turning the corner that if when that happens in the inflection. So, you won\u2019t be surprised by one quarter over the next because it\u2019s a very slow process. And eventually I\u2019d love to be adding to loan losses because the loan growth is so robust and because we should prepare for years forward. So, that to me at the end of the day won\u2019t be a bad outcome, but we\u2019re not there yet. Dan Werner - Morningstar: Okay. And then second question on mortgage revenue, I had in my notes that to expect like between $225 million and $250 million in revenue, is that still consistent or relatively the range that we\u2019re going to see for the rest of the year? Andy Cecere : Yes, I think that's in the range. So, if you look into the third quarter versus the second quarter, this is Andy. We would expect mortgage application volume to increase slightly, typical seasonal increases, but the servicing revenue will down a bit. So I would expect it to be flat to down a bit from this quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Keith Murray with ISI. Keith Murray - ISI: If you could just touch on the fee momentum, it looks like you had pretty broad momentum in fee category this quarter. You\u2019ve obviously just touched on the mortgage outlook. But can you just give a sense of which line items or which categories, ex-seasonality in 2Q, you feel like there is good underlying momentum that could carry through in the back half of \u201814? Andy Cecere : Sure. This is Andy again. So across our payments businesses, we saw growth in all four categories. I would say most of that government pressure that we had seen in corporate card is behind us and that government actually grew this quarter, as well as corporate. So corporate fees are good, merchant processing fees continue to grow, card fees continue to grow. Our trust and investment management is doing very well both on the wealth management side, as well as the corporate trust side. Commercial product fees, which is reflection of corporate and wholesale activity continues to grow, investment management is growing. So we\u2019re actually seeing growth across many categories of our fees. And including deposit service charge, which is more seasonal and based on days, but really I wouldn\u2019t say there are any particular weaknesses and strong growth across all. And I thank all of them are quite leveraged to an economic recovery. So, to the extent the growth accelerates, so I think we\u2019ll see even accelerated the growth. Richard Davis : And I would add to that, Keith, with interest rates and FX volatility solo that\u2019s the area where that line continues to be under some pressure. But as Andy said, it\u2019s very positively extorted into the economy. So the backlog is good and corporate bond fees are on track. So, we\u2019re seeing some of those coming back to some level that make sense as the economy starts to warm up a bit. But that would be there lag rates as we go through the list of key businesses that we watch. Keith Murray - ISI: Thank you. Maybe one for Bill, can you give an update on the sneak review, was any of that in this quarter, I am assuming it\u2019s going to be in the third quarter for you guys, but just any thoughts on the process this year versus past, et cetera. Bill Parker : Yes, I am glad you asked that actually, because usually we do get the results in August, but this year we got them early. So we have processed everything, it\u2019s in our results. Any changes for us were completely immaterial. We had excellent results. We have not seen sort of OCCs that are the regulators industry publication, which give some insights into where they saw stress on really just speaking for our portfolio. But we\u2019re in and done with it and no material impact. Keith Murray - ISI: Okay, thanks. And then last one, seems like GAAP assets were up about 10% year-over-year, the Basel III risk weighted assets were up around 7%, is this just a mix thing meaning more securities, highly rated securities or is there any kind of optimization going on that you guys are focused on? Richard David : It\u2019s exactly what we said. It\u2019s the securities growth at a lower risk weighted asset. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous. Brian Foran \u2013 Autonomous: So on the loan growth, I mean clearly you guys are doing very well. I guess, one of the things I\u2019d scratch my head is when I benchmark you to the large domestic banks and the HA or what\u2019s come out so far in the quarter, clearly the 6.7% year-over-year growth ex-charter one is best-in-class. But then when I benchmark you to the kind of head line numbers for the system, it\u2019s about a line. And it seems like that this can act a clearly there is the small bank trend, which you\u2019ve talked about in the past. And I was hoping you could update us on where you see that level of competition? But then B, there is this kind of new trend of foreign banks really growing quite rapidly at least in the total system data. And I was wondering if you could also offer any thoughts you have there? Is that something that is material and you\u2019re seeing in your markets or is that more happening in the capital markets and leverage lending and not really affecting you? Richard Davis : Yes, sure. This is Richard. So, first of all, I guess, I think there are four categories. I think of that you said the kind of domestic banks, I think that the regional banks like us, I think of community banks, and I think of the foreign banks. And our intelligence, neither the community banks nor the foreign banks, was taking any market share or creating any impairment to our growth. So, I can\u2019t really look at all the data that you\u2019re looking at. On the HA we typically are about half to twice better than those averages as we track it ourselves. So it\u2019s consistent with what we\u2019re seeing. Community banks are -- they\u2019re not as diversified, so they will go down the path on one or two loan product type and we\u2019ll fight a good fight in certain smaller markets. At the end of the day when you\u2019re looking for a customer with a need for more than just one loan or one type of loan, we typically win the day on that. And the foreign banks maybe it\u2019s because we\u2019re more centrally located in the middle of country and even to the West Coast, but they are simply not creating a burden to us that we\u2019ve noticed at this point and they have in the past, so both of those categories have found us in the times before. I think I\u2019ll take it backdoor to the longstanding rationale that we\u2019ve used to take it outside of it, I wonder what they are doing to, that make sense category and that is our funding advantage is just substantial, I mean they\u2019re real. They\u2019re very real and they are very big. And you compare to any of those other three groups from the larger money center banks, to the community banks, to the foreign banks, we view them every time. So thus for this management team getting greedy or sloppy and letting too much of that benefit go away altogether, we\u2019re letting it build itself out. I mean the higher pricing benefits to the highest quality customer, which is why we can have high quality, have growth and have that on a lower risk side and use some of that advantage. So hopefully that makes sense as to why we\u2019re doing. There is no magic here and there is no sustainably risk of this going away unless we were to harm our own ratings. So we\u2019re not planning to do that either. So, hopefully Brian that gives you a little more color. Brian Foran - Autonomous: That does. Thank you. All my other questions have been asked. Thanks. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Nancy Bush - NAB Research : I am express a little bit of concern about the behavior of consumer deposits as rates rise and wondered if you\u2019ve given much thought to the issues if you guys are testing, if you see the need for any new or different products this time around or if you expect things to be pretty sticky? Andy Cecere : Nancy, this is Andy. I do think we\u2019re going to see a decline in deposits overall more than what we had seen historically when rates start to move up and we\u2019ve actually modeled that in our rate sensitivity when we give you our numbers. The best example I think is our DDA levels have gone from about $50 billion to almost $74 billion and I do expect, because there is low opportunity cost of that DDA today as rates move up, we\u2019re going to see some decline there. So, we are modeling it that way. We are preparing for it that way. And we also have a number of consumer products that we\u2019re testing in different markets in terms of a little higher rate to continue to grow core deposits. Richard Davis : Yes, and I\u2019ll add to that Nancy. I said home deposit start to fall because that would be a great indicator that people are using their cash. As you know then they\u2019ll use our -- the line they have been paying for and then they will give a new line. That brings me to utilization a little bit. We are seeing utilization continue to be slowly but surely getting better, slowly is the operative. We are not seeing a huge turn but actually this last quarter was the first increase in our wholesale utilization since 2008, smaller than it might be that\u2019s a pretty big deal and that\u2019s along with the potential of deposits starting to come out. Those would be actually good signs I think of consumers and businesses using their money and then some of our money to kind of fund their growth. But I will say we also have this advantage that we want to remind people of on the core deposit side with our corporate trust business, which has a fair amount of contractual difference and distinction 15% or so of our non-interest bearing comes from that safer category. And no matter what the stress test that we provide will result in, it allows us with a little bit more of a foundation core deposits that at the end again with this corporate trust we don\u2019t talk enough about but provides the distinction and the uniqueness to our portfolio. Nancy Bush - NAB Research : Thanks for pointing that out. Richard, your thoughts about the payments businesses right now, are you seeing any opportunities, are you more or less excited as you see better economic activity to add to the payments portfolio? Richard Davis : Yes, I am really loving it I mean we have it. One of the things I often say to you Nancy directly and the others is, if you like us now you are going to love us all when things get better. But one of the things that we haven\u2019t talk much about is the R&D that we have been spending on payment, mobile payments, not thinking so much as payment which is a space we should be leading in. And there are so many derivatives of what possibly happen and next that people wanting to pay for things and track things and move things. And just about every single prototype we can think of, testing all kinds of different programs and I look forward to the chance to showcase some of those outcomes. It\u2019s our style not to talk about the things we are filing because I want to try them first and while I telegraph that to others and if they don\u2019t work then you will never know and if they do we will brag about it endlessly. But I think payments it\u2019s going to be that next step and I think of my response to the question that Bill or Brian asked, I think it\u2019s going to be the replacement fee opportunity for banks as we get to the more core checking cost and start getting paid for helping people see, track and move their money more naturally and more quickly in this environment. So I like payment for that reason and I like to diversify. Andy, told you government is turning the corner at least stop shrinking, corporate is getting strong as some of these other green shoots we\u2019ve seen in C&I and the consumer, based on credit volume year-over-year, was up 9%, debit was 5% and prepaid, which is our favorite new space which we have created and graded up 22%. So, for us the payments is a good place to be and like the balance sheet if you like it now you are going to love it later but I think it\u2019s entirely it\u2019s actually favorably toward an increasing economy. So, we will cross our fingers. Nancy Bush - NAB Research : And I have to throw in one thing, Richard. I haven\u2019t heard the word darn since the last couple on Cassidy movie I watched. Richard Davis : I haven\u2019t seen one lately and I can\u2019t tell you it came from L.A., so I am not sure where it came from. I think that\u2019s for Bill, Bill would you darn. Jackie, do we have any other? Operator : Not at this time. Richard Davis : All right. Thank you for joining our call. Please call me this afternoon, if you have any other question. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division Operator : Welcome to U.S. Bancorp's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Following a review of the results by Richard Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Cecere, U.S. Bancorp's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon EDT through Wednesday, October 29, at 12 :00 midnight EDT. I will now turn the conference call over to Sean O'Connor, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. Sean O'Connor: Thank you, Tiffany, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Andy Cecere and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's third quarter 2014 results and to answer your questions. Richard and Andy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Richard. Richard K. Davis: Thanks, Sean. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. I'll begin with a review of U.S. Bank's results, with a summary of the quarter's highlights on Page 3 of the presentation. U.S. Bank reported net income of $1.5 billion for the third quarter of 2014 or $0.78 per diluted common share. Total average loans grew 6.3% year-over-year and 1.4% linked quarter. Excluding the impact from the Charter One acquisition we completed in late June, total average loans grew 5.9% year-over-year and 1.1% on a linked quarter basis. In addition, we experienced strong loan -- strong growth in average deposits, and credit quality remains strong. Total net charge-offs decreased by 3.7% on a linked quarter basis. Nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, declined on both the linked quarter and a year-over-year basis. It generates significant capital this quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated for the Basel III standardized approach has been fully implemented. It was 9% at September 30th. We repurchased 16 million shares of common stock during the third quarter, which along with our dividend, resulted in a 78% return of earnings to our shareholders in the third quarter. Slide 4 provides you with a 5-quarter history of our performance metrics, and they continue to be among the best in the industry. Return on average assets in the third quarter was 1.51%, and return on average common equity was 14.5%. Moving over to the graph on the right. You can see that this quarter's net interest margin was 3.16%, in line with our guidance. Our efficiency ratio for the third quarter was 52.4%. We expect this ratio to remain in the low 50s, going forward, as we continue to manage expenses in relation to revenue trends, while continuing to invest in and grow our businesses. Turning to Slide 5. The company reported total net revenue in the third quarter of $5 billion, a 2% increase from the prior year. The increase was due to higher net interest income, as well as higher revenue in most fee businesses, partially offset by a reduction in mortgage banking revenue. Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 6. Average total loans outstanding increased by almost $15 billion or 6.3% year-over-year and 1.4% linked quarter. Adjusting for the Charter One acquisition, total average loans grew 5.9% year-over-year and 1.1% linked quarter. Overall, excluding covered loans, which is a runoff portfolio, average total loans grew by 7.7% year-over-year and 1.7% linked quarter. Again this quarter, the increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans, which grew by 13.6% year-over-year and 3.1% over the prior quarter. Total average commercial real estate also increased over the prior quarters, with an average loans growing by 6.1% year-over-year and 0.8% linked quarter. Residential real estate loans grew 5.8% year-over-year and 0.3% over the prior quarter. Average credit card loans increased 4.9% year-over-year and were up 2.1% on a linked-quarter basis. Total other retail loans grew 3.6% year-over-year and 1.6% over the prior quarter, mainly driven by steady growth in auto loans. Total average revolving commercial and commercial real estate commitments continue to grow at a fast pace, increasing year-over-year by 12.9% and 3.2% on a linked-quarter basis. Line utilization was relatively flat again in the third quarter. Total average deposits increased almost $19 billion or 7.4% over the same quarter of last year and 3.3% over the previous quarter. Excluding the Charter One acquisition, the growth rate remains strong at 5.5% on a year-over-year basis and 1.7% on a linked-quarter basis. Growth in low-cost savings deposits is particularly strong on both a year-over-year and linked-quarter basis. Turning to Slide 7 in credit quality. Total net charge-offs declined 3.7% on a linked-quarter basis and rose modestly on a year-over-year basis due to an unusually high recovery in third quarter of 2013. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 0.55% in the third quarter. Nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, decreased by 6.2% from the third quarter of 2013 and were essentially flat on a linked-quarter basis. During the third quarter, we released $25 million of reserves, equal to the reserve released in the prior quarter and $5 million less than in the third quarter of 2013. Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we currently expect net charge-offs to remain relatively stable in the fourth quarter of 2014. Andy will now give you a few more details about our third quarter results. Andrew Cecere : Thanks, Richard. Slide 8 gives you see a view of our third quarter 2014 results versus comparable time periods. Our diluted EPS of $0.78 was 2.6% higher than the third quarter of 2013 and equal to the prior quarter. The key drivers of the company's third quarter earnings are summarized on Slide 9. The $3 million or 0.2% increase in net income year-over-year was principally due to an increase in total net revenue, driven by increases in both net interest income and fee-based revenue. The company also achieved positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis. Net interest income was up 1.3% year-over-year, as an increase in average earning assets was partially offset by a lower net interest margin, including lower loan fees. The $31.4 billion increase in average earning assets year-over-year included growth in average total loans, as well as planned increases in the securities portfolio. Offsetting a portion of the growth in these categories was a $1.4 billion reduction in average loans held for sale, reflecting lower mortgage origination activity versus the same quarter of last year. The net interest margin of 3.16% was 27 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2013, primarily due to growth in the investment portfolio at lower average rates, lower loan fees and lower rates and new loans, partially offset by lower funding costs. Lower loan fees were due to previously communicated wind down of Checking Account Advance, our short-term, small-dollar deposit advanced product. Noninterest income increased $65 million or 3% year-over-year due to higher revenue in most fee businesses, partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenue. We saw growth in retail and corporate payments, merchant processing, trust and investment management fees, deposit service charges and treasury management fees, commercial products revenue and investment product fees. Noninterest income increased year-over-year by $49 million or 1.9%, primarily due to an increase in compensation expense, reflecting the impact of merit increases, acquisitions and higher staffing for risk and compliance activities. Net income was lower on a linked-quarter basis by $24 million or 1.6%, mainly due to the increase of noninterest expense, partially offset by a decrease in the provision for credit losses. The second quarter of 2014 included 2 previously disclosed notable items impacting non -- other noninterest income and other noninterest expense, that together had no impact to diluted earnings per common share. On a linked-quarter basis, net interest income increased 0.1% due to an increase in average earning assets, mostly offset by a lower net interest margin, including lower loan fees. Net interest margin of 3.16% was, as expected, 11 basis points lower than the second quarter. Principally, due to the growth of lower rate investment securities and lower loan fees due to the Checking Account Advance product wind down. On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest income was lower by $202 million or 8.3%, primarily due to the second quarter Visa stock sale, lower mortgage banking revenue and lower commercial products revenue, partially offset by higher deposit service charges, corporate payments products' revenue and trust and investment management revenue. On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest expense decreased by $139 million or 5% due to the second quarter FHA DOJ settlement in Other expense, partially offset by Charter One merger integration costs and higher mortgage servicing-related costs. Turning to Slide 10, our capital position is strong. Beginning January 1, 2014, the regulatory capital requirement effective for the company followed Basel III, subject to certain transition provisions from Basel I over the next 4 years, to full implementation by January 1, 2018. In addition, beginning with the second quarter of 2014, the advanced approaches portion of Basel III became effective for the company. A common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated, using in the Basel III standardized approach as is fully implemented at September 30, was 9%. At 9%, we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. Our tangible book value per share rose to $15.66 at September 30, representing a 13.3% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 2.6% increase over the prior quarter. I'll now turn the call back to Richard. Richard K. Davis: Thanks, Andy. To conclude our formal remarks, I'll turn your attention to Slide 11. We remain focused on extending our advantage, which is our theme for 2014. Our consistently solid financial performance is a result of our adhering closely to the core fundamentals of controlling expenses, of managing capital prudently, and selectively investing in initiatives that generates steady, long-term growth, and expanding existing customer relationships. That was certainly the case in third quarter, as our disciplined approach produced positive operating leverage. As we head into the final quarter of the year, we remain diligently focused on executing our plan, even with the ongoing economic headwinds, with an emphasis on providing our customers with the trusted products and services to help them build more secure financial futures, backed by the financial strength of U.S. Bank. That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer any questions from the audience. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Paul Miller of FBR Capital Markets. Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division : This is Jessica Ribner in for Paul Miller. We just have one question. It's just taking into account the recent changes announced by the FHFA in terms of the 3% down payment and some reps and warrants clarity, does that change the way that you think about originating down the credit spectrum in the mortgage space? Or how do you guys view that? Richard K. Davis: It really doesn't. This is Richard. It's a good sound bite, but I think the test comes in whether or not there's a private market for investors to pick up these loans with lower or no down payment, and I'm not sure there will be. So we're going to continue to stick with the FHFA, Freddie and Fannie deals that we originate, that we sell off. We'll continue to originate loans that we hold on the balance sheet for our more well-heeled customers. And we'll continue to watch the progress in this space, because we like very much to feel more comfortable making loans with, I'd say, either a lower FICO or with less down payment. But unless we're convinced that the rules are going to be permanent and there's not going to be a look back or a reach back in future times, or that there won't be a market for this, we're simply going to stay on the sidelines in the concerns of both compliance risks and other uncertainties, and we'll just continue to do what we're doing now, which I think is sufficient for the near term. Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division : And what do you -- just a follow-up to that. What do you think would -- what do you think that they would have to say or come out with to make you more comfortable in that space? Because you were talking about a reach back or something like that. Richard K. Davis: Right, right. No, that's a great question, Jessica, and I'm not sure I have the answer to that because I'd have to see it, believe it, and then test it. And so it's going to take a while for me to have a belief that this litigation risk isn't as great as compliance risk, which used to be both less important than credit risk. So when you think about all the risks we have, credit risk, we can manage. We've done that through the whole cycle, and we did it well before. In terms of litigation risk, that's kind of the new uncertainty. And with the statute, I think, of time coming up on us, there may be a softening of some of those look back, reach back. But in where I started, there's a private market out there that's got to say they want to buy these loans without the guarantees and they've got to be willing to take those loans on with those lesser quality customers under the risk that perhaps they won't repay. And that's going to be a market that's going to be tested over time, with the number of players that will have a chance to come in. And once we see that appetite, that will probably be the first evidence we'll be looking for. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald of Sanford Bernstein. John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : Just wondering about the outlook for the net interest margin next quarter. Andy, could you give us some other puts and takes for the margin and what kind of outlook you have for net interest margin and net interest income growth? Andrew Cecere : Sure, John. So if you think about the third quarter versus second, we were down 11 basis points, and that was 3 things. One -- the first is 5 basis points for CAA, and that's done. So that won't repeat in the fourth quarter. The second was about 3 basis points for the securities build, and that will continue on in the fourth quarter. We ended this quarter at about $96.5 billion. We'll end the fourth quarter just over $100 billion. So we'll have additional migration down, because of that 3 to 4 basis points. The third factor was the loan mix. Most of our growth was in wholesale, as opposed to retail, and that was 2 to 3 basis points of pressure. That will continue likely into the fourth quarter also. So all in, down 5 to 7 for the fourth quarter, but I still expect net interest income to grow. And then finally, that pressure on securities build will diminish, will go away beginning in 2015. John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : Okay. You'll be done, you think, by the first quarter? Andrew Cecere : We'll -- our expectation is that we'll end this year at or above 100% on the LCR ratio. So our net securities growth will be more consistent with the overall balance sheet growth, as opposed to building additional to meet the LCR ratio. Richard K. Davis: So John, NIM compression. All that remains for '15 is loan mix and interest rates, in general. But we've really gotten rid of the other variables that have been moving all through this year, taking the number down. John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : Okay. And Richard, could you give us some color on your feelings about loan growth from here, both just kind of the absolute level of growth you're looking for and then the mix factors? Richard K. Davis: I'm feeling pretty good, actually. So let me just -- I should say this to all of you. First, I'm glad to see that you're even on the call. I thought being last, we might not have anybody come to our party. We always announce our earnings... John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : Reporting with 10 other banks this time? Richard K. Davis: Well, I'll tell you what. Who cares about what we have the say now, right? We have always announced earnings on the Wednesday after our Board meeting, and the Board meeting has always been the third Tuesday. For the first time in my years as CEO, my 8 years as a CEO, the -- that created [ph] the fourth Wednesday. And so that's why we're still late in the cycle, I'm talking to all of you a week later. We've amended that with the Board, and we're going to go back to announcing on the third Wednesday. So this will be the last time we have this trailer keeping you from writing your final reports. And so I just want to make that clear. By the same token, though, I have this great visibility and clarity I've never had before and what the other banks have been saying. And so, I'm going to say, we're generally positive about loan growth, and I'm saying that for the following reasons. As Andy indicated, we had the 1.4% linked quarter growth. If you take out the Capital One acquisition, it's 1.1%, and that's right in the range of what we telegraphed. And we're going to telegraph that again for quarter 4. We think we're in that same place, as we are still moving into the early stages of the fourth quarter. We're seeing it across the board, too, John. So, I mean, we're seeing in Wholesale Banking. We're seeing people continue to support capital expenditures, particularly in large ticket leasing and in corporate banking. We're seeing the pipeline across all energy -- industries stronger as the year ages, which is pretty positive. We're also seeing the leverage portion of the market remains pretty fast-growing, but we don't participate much in that and there's a regulatory oversight that's more heavy at this point in time, and so it doesn't affect us near as much. And then a strong market, bond market is still strong. So that does take some of the loan volume away. But overall, we don't see anything less than we've seen in the last couple of quarters. Commercial real estate, still pretty strong. If you look at the West, East Coast and you take kind of the smile down to Texas and you move around, we see it's pretty active across most property-buying areas. We're seeing some investors getting into the central part of the country, Minneapolis, Denver and Phoenix, places like that. Property types are looking good. Apartments, retail, offices, lodging properties, and we're seeing people get lines of credit and using their lines for property acquisitions. And then we're seeing also nice strength in home equity. For the first time, we're actually putting more on the books than are running off, now that we're in that part of the cycle. Auto loans continue to be a strong point for us, and credit cards are growing nicely and are expected to, as you might expect, in the fourth quarter, seasonally get even stronger. So I mean, 1 to 1.5 and probably right around this 1 to 1.2 that we've been at isn't robust, but it's pretty solid. And what we're seeing is nice consistency, and our pipelines would reflect not only what we're hearing anecdotally, but the real facts that we've got some loan growth still well into our future. Having low interest rates isn't great for income, but it's pretty good for lending, and people continue to see that benefit. And we have that cost of funding advantage we've told you about, allow us to lend to the highest quality customers at a preferred price, and we're going to keep doing it. John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : Okay. And a little bit more led by the commercial, which is the loan mix impact on the NIM. Richard K. Davis: Yes, I think it's very much the same. What you'll seen in the last few quarter will be very much the same, dominated by C&I, but started -- consumers starting to vie for its position now. Quarter 4 will be strong consumer with credit card, but will still be heavily mixed toward C&I, which will still put some pressure on NIM. But as we talked, it starts to wane later into the process. John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : Okay. One quickie on the noninterest income. The credit and debit card revenues were a little lighter than expected. You mentioned rewards costs in the write-up. Is that kind of the new cost of business in a reward-centric world here? Is it -- any kind of onetime catch-up in there? Andrew Cecere : This is Andy, John. So 2 things. One is just a number of processing days this year -- this quarter of 2014 versus the third quarter of 2013 caused a couple of percentage points decline. It was 90 days versus 94. So that's just the nuance with the number of business days. And the second thing was the rewards, which is a little bit elevated, but I would expect it to be at this level or slightly downward in the future quarters. But if you think about it, cards, on a core basis x the processing days, was up closer to 5% to 6%. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David George of Baird. David A. George - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Richard, I wanted to dovetail to John's question. It's more a big picture, but it's a very popular macro topic, and that's rates. Wanted to get not so much your views on rates, but more from the perspective of how you're thinking about running the company, allocating capital, making incremental investment, et cetera. Do you run the company any differently if rates stay here longer than people think? And any kind of industry implications that you think that emanate from that, to the extent that macro backdrop persists. Richard K. Davis: Yes, David, that's a great question, and we're still evaluating our final view on what the rates will be, because just a couple of weeks ago, it might well have been a different scenario, right, based on what the prevailing view was, that rates will start moving up in the middle of the year, and now, people are thinking later next year. Here's how we've been running it this year. So it was February 15. I remember the exact date. Exactly the center of quarter 1. And remember, it was a very tough winter quarter for every business. And we decided to adjust our plan, all of 45 days into the year, and we placed a hold on FTE in the company. Let me repeat this, as I told you about this last time, too, that it's -- it's a response to your question. By placing hold on FTE, we didn't put in a hiring freeze. So if you have 881 people in your division, you can have 881 people. And in fact, I'm going to encourage you, now more than ever, to make sure that the 881 best people you could possibly have, because there's no limit on the quality of the people in the organization. But you can't go to 895 and you can't get to 906, until we see a revenue environment that's a little bit stronger. And so but for our compliance and compliance-related activities, where we didn't put any kind of a hold, based on what we think is appropriate regulatory focus, we've been doing that with quite good success. You might imagine one of my challenge is to have the employees of this company feel proud that because they're working harder, is why we're doing well, as opposed to make them wonder why we're doing so well and why am I working so hard. And we were trying to get that conversation organized properly, but I wouldn't hesitate to ask the employees to continue to do that onto the next year, if that's what the environment's going to state, because we really do want to give you guys positive operating leverage to our shareholders on an annual basis, I've always said, not in any 1 given quarter. And the way to do that is to decide what your revenue guardrails will be and then to stay within those, based on your expenses. And with the cost of healthcare and the cost of merit increases, what's left is to make sure you've got enough to not overspend, before you have the revenue. So we won't do more of what we did this year, the longer rates stay low or flat next year. By the same token, the minute we believe they're on their way up, we'll start to release some of those levels of limits and start moving forward more quickly. Let me also clarify, before I hear it my own way, that we're not slowing down on our investments, or our capital expenditures, or some of the longer-term necessary things you need to do to be ready for our future. So we're putting all that into that long-term view of what's most important and prioritizing, so we're still spending money. And as you know, our expenses are still growing, just at a level less than our revenue, and that's how we'll continue to do it. But I will agree that the minute rates start moving up and we see evidence, it gets a lot easier to run a company this long into a recession and a downturn. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : My first question is, Richard, you have always taken advantage of increasing your market share when your peers are challenged. And based on Governor Tarullo's speech, it sounds like some of your larger peers may have to contend with higher buffers on common equity Tier 1. I guess I'm wondering, if that does transpire and you have some of your larger peers operating it 11.5, 12, 12.5, does that -- do you think that presents a further opportunity for U.S. Bank, being that you would be under that G-SIB requirement? Richard K. Davis: I'll tell you, Erika, I think it's just a continuation of the benefits we've experienced, because first of all, you know that even if that occurs, it doesn't have to be overnight. And not unlike us, but most things, as we continue to get healthier, are creating capital. So I don't think that's a real burden for them into getting there. And I don't think it's any different than it's been for the last of couple of years, as we've been a SIFI and they've have been G-SIFIs. But I do think at the end of the day, our ability to be more profitable, be more attractive to shareholders and have a simpler, easier company to understand and invest in, I think that continues to become more and more obvious, and that's why we think we're in a particularly good position, where we are, as the first non-G-SIB, and I think there are advantages, many of which are continuing and some which might get a little stronger. But I don't think that very event changed any near-term outcome, and it just continues to remind us how fortunate we are. Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Got it. And just a follow-up question to that. As we think about long-term capital return prospects for the company, which ratio should we think of as your binding constraint, the standardized CET1 or advanced? Andrew Cecere : Standardized, Erika. So our advanced ratio's 200-plus basis points above our advanced, so our standardized will be our binding constraint and our target is 8%. Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Got it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : So a couple of questions. One, a follow on to that. On the funding side, is there an opportunity here, with the rate environment, to maybe reset, reduce some of the longer-term funding cost that you've got? Andrew Cecere : Yes, Betsy. So when I gave you my expectation for rates into the fourth quarter and stability into next year, it reflects the fact that we have some long-term debt coming due, and that will be refunding or repricing it at a lower rate. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : And you could even take advantage to do more than just what's coming due, or no? Andrew Cecere : I think our focus will be on what is maturing, which is planned over the next 12 months. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And then separately, in the payment space, obviously, you've got a great position, with effectively a closed loop or pretty close to a closed loop. Could you give us an update on how you're thinking about your own digital wallet, as well as broadening out use of tokenization for security-related purposes beyond just payments? Richard K. Davis: Yes. Well, those are different questions. Digital wallet, I think you know we continue to invest in, virtually, every scheme we can find and each partner that we have, many of which we don't announce. It's not our plan to announce things until onset. But I'll just remind you that we are both a leader in mobile banking, but even more so, in mobile payments, because as you said, we have a closed loop capability. We've got all sides of the equation, and we're leveraging that. I might also say that -- it wouldn't surprise you, but we do a lot with customers. We have certain customer groups that we've put together that help us think through the next best ideas. And we gauge the tenor and interest of some customers, both small and large, into what kind of things they may want. A closed loop, as you know, it has to be a large enough critical mass, that there's enough interest in all parties to see the benefits of staying outside of the, we'll call it, the normal freeway. And we still haven't found that combination yet, and I don't know that we will. But we're going to keep looking for it and do our very best to use that digital environment that's advantage to us with that firing business to check it out. As it relates to tokenization, we're very fond of that because not only are we involved in it, but particularly through the clearing house, we're working on a tokenization project for all the 24 largest volume banks in the country. Clearing house, as you know, the half owner of the ACH system, the other half being the Federal Reserve. And so we're working with them on tokenization. And answering a question you didn't ask, tokenization really will solve a number of these issues, which in the interim, look like they're being solved by the chip card or the EMV solution. Those are really just a different alternative to a magnetic stripe. And at the end of the day, this tokenization is going to give us all the protections we're seeking. If you think of the Apple Pay, that's tokenization plus biometrics, which allows for a different kind of protection, and there'll be all kinds of combinations. But look, banks are going to seek whatever it can, we can, to have lower fraud losses, because as you know, most of these hacking circumstances, whether we issue the cards now or later, if there's any losses, the banks take those losses, and there's substantial amounts of money that have been in our run rates for years. And to the extent that we can find a way to make the customer safer, not make them feel burdened by having to become safer, it reduces our fraud on the other side and it creates a safer environment. Tokenization is going to provide a great solve to that, and then cybersecurity also gets an advantage as to higher levels of authentication. So I'll just say, to answer your question, we're at the leading-edge of all those topics, either because of our position in the association or because of our capability being a full-on payments provider, and we're testing all kinds of different scenarios and yet, I have nothing grand enough to announce to you here because we haven't found the holy grail yet on closed loop and we're continuing to watch for it. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. But also on tokenization, just to be clear, you could see the opportunity to use that technology not only in payments, but also in your own internal peer-to-peer or customer access to funds and funds transfer? Richard K. Davis: Yes. And it's probably not tokenization as much as there could be a number of versions of closed loop, more protected interchanges between, let's say, large banks that could do things much more quickly. That's a different answer, as we're talking about a faster payments network and moving away from the 24-hour cycle. And we're announcing, I think, very soon, that we're all going to be working on faster payment cycles. The precursor to that, though, could be bank-to-bank or large entities-to-large entities doing intra-day transfers on a trusted basis, like you would with a friend, and accelerating what would otherwise be the natural and final evolution of the entire payment system from a 24-hour cycle to a real time. That's probably a couple of years away, but following the path of some other places around the globe and following the favor of customers, we're all working on that, and I think that's something that you'll be hearing a lot more about in the next couple of quarters. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Yes, that makes a lot of sense, especially given the Fed white paper that asks for 10 years, which seems way too long. So then last question, just slightly separate topic, but the progress on the near-prime push in auto. Could you give us an update on how you're thinking about that and how that's impacting pretax margin? Richard K. Davis: I'm going to have Bill answer that question. P. W. Parker: It's been successful. It's enabled us to provide a broader spectrum of yes answers in the dealership office. So -- and we've expanded our -- in our presence in the used car market as well. And it's positive on the net -- overall net interest margin on our indirect dealer book. So it's doing well, and it's performing as we expected. Richard K. Davis: In broader context, if we recall, so just being a prime lender to an auto dealer, now that we're doing used auto and some near-prime and the prime, we get a higher shot at getting their floor planning and getting the rest of their business, because now we're in all the categories they want, not just selectively picking prime. So there is another advantage. And I also should say we've been a leasing bank for 61 years, which is back when leasing started. So we've got a long tenure there that, I think, in a less competitive environment for auto leasing, we're going to continue to expand that. And as rates go up, trust me, that's one of the first things you'll see, is people flipping from loans to leases for payment. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Just a question on the expenses, Andy. I heard your comments about that kind of in the other, there seemed to be kind of a plus or minus, some offsetting. So is this the kind of the right base for expenses going forward? And to Richard's comment about staying in the low-50s efficiency ratio, what does that imply for the ability to deliver operating leverages? Is it really just about getting rates up at some point from here? Andrew Cecere : Right, Ken. So in the third quarter, we had a couple of items that are not going to repeat. We had about just under $20 million of conversion-related expenses, principally related to our RBS acquisition, or Charter One acquisition in Chicago. Those will not repeat into the fourth quarter. The third quarter also continues to build our tax amortization for our CDC company, and that will continue to increase in the fourth quarter. That's just seasonal. And in the fourth quarter, typically, it's about $75 million or $80 million higher than the third quarter. So you'll see that, and that, again, comes down in the first quarter. All in though, I do expect positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter and I do expect our efficiency ratio will continue to be in the low-50s. Richard K. Davis: You know what else, Ken, we're not there yet, but I think the -- we're probably at the highest level of total compliance and audit-related cost we're going to have over this cycle. I don't see them coming down right away, so I'm not saying that. But they aren't sustainably this high for the long term. So there will be another advantage and it happen probably sometime next year, where just the run rate and the expenses start to come down a bit, based on some of the focus we've all had and certain categories that we'll settle. And so it's not immediate. But I think it would be improper to believe that our current expense base, related to all that, this very quarter or the ones you've seen in the last couple, are the normal high rate, because they're not going to be that high. Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Understood. Okay, great. And just a second question on just the mortgage business. This quarter you had a huge jump in origination volume, and it looks like the apps are pretty flat and it looks like the MSR hedge came down, as you had forecasted for us a quarter ago. So can you just walk us through the drivers from here on the revenue side in the mortgage business? Andrew Cecere : Right. So in the -- as you mentioned, in the second quarter, we had a gain on servicing that did not repeat in the third quarter. If you stripped that out, we're relatively flat. And, actually, application volume was also relatively flat. Fourth quarter is typically seasonally lower. I would expect that to occur this year, and that will result in revenue being a little lower. I would call somewhere between 5% and 15%, principally, due to seasonality. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Nomura. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division : I had a question on your funding advantage. It hasn't arguably been as much of an advantage as it could be, given the strong deposit growth that we've been seeing across the industry. But I wondered if you thought that my change, particularly if QE is indeed over after this month and deposit growth starts to slow, not necessarily turn negative, just slow. So I guess a 2-part question. First, do you think deposit growth will slow, with the end of QE? And then secondly, would your funding advantage become more valuable in that kind of environment, assuming that loan growth continues? Andrew Cecere : Right. So Bill, we do assume that at end of QE or when rates start to rise, we do assume an outflow of deposits. That's part of our rate sensitivity analysis, and I do think the funding advantage will become more explicit and clear when that occurs. It's there now because we still have some debt on the books and I think that advantage shows itself, but it will show itself more as more debt replaces deposits as rates move up. And importantly, about 15% of our deposits are corporate trust-related, which are less sensitive to rates moving up, so it's more a function of the operating model of the Corporate Trust business. So that helps us retain a core level of, particularly, DDA deposits that will be helpful as rates move up. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division : Great. But I was hoping maybe to follow up on that, Andy. If maybe you could separate for us the rise in rates, which there are some concerns that, that's being pushed farther out in the end of QE, which many believe is still going to happen this month. So if we have that scenario, where maybe we just set the higher rates aside for a second and just look at the impact of QE coming to an end, would that alone be enough to slow industry deposit growth and bring the funding advantage to be more -- play more of an important role? Andrew Cecere : I think what will slow the deposit growth will be a growth in the economy and as business to start to invest more in growth and expansion and such, I think the first place they'll go is their own funds, which are currently in our balance sheet, and I think that will be the principal change. And then secondly, as rates start to move up, the opportunity cost to having money in DDA goes up, and I think you'll start to see a shift out of DDA. But when the economy starts to grow, the first place, before we see loan growth, we'll see deposit declines. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division : Got it. And I wanted to also follow-up on some of your comments about auto. Regulatory intervention has been in focus in auto finance, and I was hoping maybe you could just share any thoughts on the potential for the CFPB to bring nonbank auto finance companies under its oversight and what that could mean for you and the rest of the banking industry, and I guess, particularly to the extent that there are some nonbank lenders who either get pushed out or see the cost of compliance rise. Richard K. Davis: Bill, this is Richard. I think until we see any evidence of the CFPB ring-fencing any activities with the non-banks, we're just going to presume it will stay the way it is. As you can see, it didn't stop us as a banking industry to stay in the business. We're dealing with a little higher level of risk, as it relates to the fair lending rules and things that have been said. But I think we've all gotten better at it and know what the risks are. We still are the best, I think, providers of lending to the auto businesses because of our cost of funding and because we are more traditional banks. I've heard the same thing you've heard, and I appreciate the fact that they're going to get to some of the non-banks. And I do think that if they were, that will be net positive, just because the operating paradigms will be the same for all of us. But it won't change in the near term. It wouldn't change anything we're doing at all. And I don't think, until we see evidence of it for some period of time, like a year or more, many of us are going to adjust any of our thinking, based on that. So it will take a while for them to decide which part of the space they want to get into, what it means to oversee them, what adjustments they may make. And we'll take, I think, such a substantial amount of time, that I wouldn't expect any adjustment for at least a year because it takes that long for something like that to cultivate. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom of RBC Capital Markets. Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Just a few follow-ups. Bill, can you just touch a little bit on auto charge-offs and where -- what's normal for your portfolio? There's a little bit of an uptick. I'm sure it's explainable, but just maybe give us an idea of what's going on there. P. W. Parker: Well, part of that is related to the expansion that we talked about earlier, going into the near-prime space, so some of that's coming to season. And then seasonally, there's usually higher losses in the wintertime and in the summer months. So that's all relatively normal and just most of our book is still -- even though we did expand the low-end, most of the book is still very prime, high prime portfolios. So the level of losses you see this quarter, it'll be pretty stable from there. Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay, good. Andy or Richard, just on the risk and compliance spending, I think that's good news that we're maybe at the peak. But can you give us an idea of the magnitude, maybe year-over-year, in terms of spending and FTEs that you have devoted to risk and compliance? Andrew Cecere : Think about the third quarter versus a year ago, I would say we have somewhere between $30 million and $40 million of additional expense and the run rate related risk and compliance. Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay, all right. But you're thinking that, that is near the peak at this point? Richard K. Davis: Yes. But I also said it stays there for a while. So in the midterm, it goes down. There's a new permanent level. You didn't ask Andy for 3 to 5 years ago, but it would be probably 3x what it was a couple of years ago. And so we're getting to that place now, and we'll just reassign some of the party. Because compliance, as you know, isn't just a unit or division. It's across every part of the business line. So even myself, team and the front lines, all need to have a more of a compliance view or call it the first line of defense, so every employee has to be thinking more appropriately about doing things perfectly the first time, and therefore, there's an extra cost in each incremental FTE. So it's not just a group we bring in, but it's the way of doing business. And we've adding that to everybody's job over the last couple of years. Plus, we've been having outside third parties, and we've added a bulked up staff in certain places to deal with regulatory issues to align with the new higher bar of heightened standards. But once we get that settled, I can see some of that going back down a bit as we get more efficient and, as you know, we're pretty efficient, once we know what the rules are. Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then just one more on capital return. Richard, your, sometimes, quotes get taken out of context, but you're on the record of saying that you think 2015 could take off. I'm wondering if you feel like the capital return and the current range is appropriate for next year. Do you feel like you can potentially return more? Do you feel like you need to retain some more for some maybe greater expected balance sheet growth in 2015? Just walk us through that. Richard K. Davis: Yes, Jon, that's a hard question, right? But I'll tell you, to the extent that we can operate and have now for at least 5 years in this is very low interest rate, slow economy, I think we have proven our ability to withstand a more challenging environment. But we're looking forward to the moment when I think when rates move up, it's less a proxy for the fact that we're poised to do better when rates move up. It means that the economy is doing better, and we get way more benefit out of that. And so for me, it's approximately when the economy starts to turn up. We certainly think we can protect our capital positions, that's for sure, because we know how to manage in an environment like this. But the sooner rates move up, and again, it's a proxy for the economy doing better, the sooner we'll be able to telegraph that we'll be increasing our capital distributions. Until we see that, I'm going to stay in path and just indicate there's a positive bias that as soon as we see economy improve, we're certainly safe on what we have, but we're going to be careful on telegraphing when we can move up until we can see a more sustained revenue environment, which allows us, therefore, to predict a higher level of capital return. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities. Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Just maybe, Andy, a question for you related to expenses next year. Questions have come up on a couple of earlier calls about pension expense. I think you guided, this year, that pension expense will be down about -- will be down a bit from the prior year. And I'm just curious -- I realize we're not at year-end when you set the pension rate and the -- or the discount rate and the pension expense, but how are you thinking about pension expenses affecting your overall expenses in 2015? Andrew Cecere : Sure, Matt. So if you think about '13 and '14, because of the increase in the discount rate, we actually had a lower pension rate expense of about $130 million on an annual basis. If I were going to reset the rate today, I'd lose that $100 million or so, because rates are back to where they were a year ago. But as you said, we won't know that until the end of the year. Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And just a question. Richard, I think you mentioned home equity loans were growing. That's a relatively new trend. Could you give us a little more color on where that demand is coming from? Are there any geographies that are growing faster in that product specifically than you've seen in the past? And I'm just curious about any color you can provide on competition from either larger regional banks or maybe some of the smaller local banks, who are looking to get into that space as well. Richard K. Davis: Yes. So now, let's go back to the beginning. U.S. Bancorp balance sheet doesn't have an oversized home equity portfolio. Never have. And if you look back to just the mortgage business, one of the things we didn't have going into the recession was an overly active sub-prime or near-prime mortgage business either. So we're not feeding off of a lot of runoff. We don't have a lot of deals that are coming due at their 5 or 7-year mark, that might have been originated in the earlier days. So we actually have a pretty core steady book. So for us, it's really simply a matter of the paydowns now are being outpaced by the new originations. And again, you look at the size of our portfolio, it's pretty average. And that's okay because the quality is very high. The application levels are particularly high right now and we are very aggressive in our marketing campaign with an intro rate pricing feature, and that's across the entire 25 states, and that's serving us quite well. I think when I was talking about our pricing advantages, everyone on the call rightfully jumps to Wholesale Banking and thinks about the advantages we have on cost of funds, based on our highest debt ratings, and that transcends into better rates and competitive issues on adjustable rate. But we can do it, too, on things like consumer products, as long as we match-fund it properly. And so we have a very strong new account pipeline going now, and the activation rate is even more impressive. So I'll give you an example. Our 6-month activation rate a year ago was 61%. So we get a line of credit on in 61%, within 6 months later was being used. That's now up to 77%. And so that means that we're finding better customers who really want it and need it and are using it, and increased that with the rate -- fixed rate lock option, which is another feature we've included in our advertising. And we are spending money to talk about it, in both social media and in traditional marketing that, that will be one of our leading products. If you lived in our market, like John does, you'd see the commercials and you'll hear the commercials and you see some of the social media. So we're putting a lot of energy, because we really want that to turn permanently. And we think that, that's one of the best core quality types of loans that you can have. And it's across the whole state, the whole country for us, particularly most notably in the western part, where the balances on markets are growing faster. So home appreciation is related, which totally makes a lot of sense. And I'd say our outlook for quarter 4 is to continue to see some growth in both the originations and the balance sheet. So that's a pretty positive story, off of kind of a slow starting point, but with some permanents around it now, which up until recently, might've been just 1 or 2 months and then a fall backwards, and I think we're on a sustainable growth -- pattern to growth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mustascio of KBW. Christopher M. Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : Andy, I want to -- can you talk a little bit about the merchant acquiring business, the underlying trends? What I'm trying to get at, when I look at acquiring revenue per transaction, that's down about 5% year-over-year, and the acquiring spread is also down about 6% year-over-year. A bigger, a longer trend of deteriorating of those 2 metrics, can you kind of give me some color of what's going on in that business from a kind of a margin and spread perspective? Andrew Cecere : Yes. So the DIA rate this quarter was about 40 basis points, and it is down a little bit from a year ago. Two reasons it's down. Number one is that a little bit of the margin pressure, as you talked about. I think that's beginning to stabilize. But we did see the last 12 months have some pressure on pricing. The second factor is the mix of businesses that we acquire for. So to the extent that where large retailers or airlines in particular, that there's a little thinner spread there. But I would say the decline related to margin pressure is beginning to stabilize. The rest of it will be depending upon the mix of spend in the next 12 months. Operator : Final question comes from the line of Mike Mayo of CLSA. Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division : I had a few follow-up questions. First, what do you estimate to be your deposit data? Andrew Cecere : Yes, mike, this is Andy. It ranges from 5% to 90%, depending upon the deposit product. So it's not just one number. We're very detailed by product, by line. Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division : And on an average? Andrew Cecere : On average, it depends upon the deposit mix we have at any point in time. But if we think about a few years ago where it was, let's say, 20 to 30, it's above that now because of the higher level of DDA and other activities we have. So it's higher than it was in our modeling. Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division : Okay. Richard, you talked about the capital advantage and that gives you a pricing advantage, with higher-quality borrowers. And you said, \"Well, it's not really anything new. It's a continuation.\" But can you somehow quantify that? I mean, you do have required regulatory capital that's significantly below your much larger peers. And I'm just trying to figure out, to what degree does that give you a pricing advantage, which in turn, allows you to gain market share? Andrew Cecere : So Mike, if you think about it, we're assuming our SIFI buffer's about 50 basis points. We don't know that. That's our assumption. That's when we get to our 8%. So if you're a G-SIB that has a 250 buffer, so let's call it 200 basis points more, and you go through the math, we would have about a 30 to 35 basis points advantage to achieve the same return or less than that and get a higher return. So it is not insignificant. It's a pretty significant advantage. Richard K. Davis: And Mike, additionally, which we talked about, when we go in to market, if we have to issue any kind of a debt, we have an advantage to every other bank. And whatever that time period is and however much that raise was, we have that much delta to offer up. And as I said earlier, it could be the wholesale. It could even be the consumer businesses, and there's a net positive. But here's the trick, you only use it on the highest in quality customers, because otherwise, you're starting to dip down into things with loan losses and compliance costs and things you may not really understand. So for us, I'd expect you'll hear on other calls that the pricing competitiveness is still high and pretty peaked. You haven't heard that here because we're either a part of the problem or we choose to use our funding advantage to be more competitive on price, not on underwriting. And for the most part, most of the pricing seems to be pretty stable in the competitive environment as we see it, so we're not feeling disadvantaged by it either. Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division : So you'd go to the table and you're competing to get a large, high-quality corporate client, and you say, \"We'll price this loan 30 basis points less. Give us your business. Or 25 basis points less.\" Is that the conversation? Andrew Cecere : I would say that's the conversation, more for the middle market. In a large client, it's more of a national funding market. And in that example, I think what the outcome is that we have a high return for the same price. Richard K. Davis: That's right. Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division : Isn't that somewhat similar, though, to other regional banks that also have a capital advantage versus the largest peers? Andrew Cecere : Capital, yes. Debt rating, no. Richard K. Davis: It's the 2fer. Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division : And then the last question. Richard, to follow up before, you said 2015 can take off. It's right around the corner. I think there are some quotes and data looks great, and we're all thinking, okay, if Richard Davis is right, this economy is set to take off, and then you look at the 10-year bond, which is saying the opposite. So who's right? Richard Davis or the 10-year bond? Richard K. Davis: Wow. I've never met the 10-year bond. I'm going to go with me. But I'll tell you what. I do think, and I've said this before, too, I think the stock market is a head fake, if people using that as a measure of the quality or the wealth of -- the intention of consumers to start spending and acting. In fact, in some respects, the stronger the stock market, it's because there's nowhere else to put it. So I'm not changing my view that in '15, things turn around quickly and start to take off, because when they do take off, I think it's pretty likely they will be fast. And again, the pipelines that I'm talking about, the customer intentions I'm talking about, that's what we're waiting for : the final decision when rates start to move, which will create this, I think, tsunami effect of people acting quickly. I'm going to stick to what I said before, and I think it's next year. And when it does, it happens fast. I don't have any evidence that says otherwise, and I'm not responding to the vagaries of 2 weeks of either 10-year interest rates or stock market variances. I'm just going to stick with it. Operator : That was our final question. Presenters, do you have any closing remarks? Sean O'Connor: Well, thank you for listening to our call, and please call me this afternoon if you have any further questions. Thanks. Operator : Thank you.

Mike Mayo - CLSA Jessica Ribner - FBR Nancy Bush - NAB Research Operator : Welcome to U.S. Bancorp's Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Following a review of the results by Richard Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Andy Cecere, U.S. Bancorp's Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon Eastern Time through Wednesday, January 28 at midnight Eastern Time. I will now turn the conference call over to Sean O'Connor, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. Sean O'Connor: Thank you, Paula, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Andy Cecere, Bill Parker and Kathy Rogers are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's fourth quarter and full year 2014 results and answer your questions. Richard and Andy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our Web-site at usbank.com. I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Richard. Richard K. Davis: Thank you, Sean. Good morning everybody and thank you for joining our call. I'll begin with a few highlights from U.S. Bank's 2014 full year results on Page 3 of the presentation. U.S. Bank reported record net income of $5.9 billion for the full year of 2014 or $3.08 per diluted common share. We achieved industry leading profitability with the return on average assets of 1.54%, a return on average common equity of 14.7% and an efficiency ratio of 53.2%. Total average loans grew by 6.3% and average deposits grew a strong 6.5% year-over-year. Credit quality continued to improve with an 8.9% decline in net charge offs and 11.2% decrease in non-performing assets. Our capital position ended the year stronger with a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated for the Basel III standardized approach as fully implemented of 9%. In total, we returned $4 billion or 72% of our 2014 earnings to the shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. Turning to Slide 4 and our quarterly highlights, U.S. Bank reported net income of $1.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2014 or $0.79 per diluted common share. Total average loans grew by 5.9% year-over-year and 1% linked-quarter. In addition, we continued to experience strong loan growth, strong growth in average deposits. Credit quality remained strong. Total net charge-offs decreased by 8.3% from the prior quarter while total non-performing assets declined 6% on a linked-quarter basis. We continued to generate significant capital this quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated for the Basel III standardized approach as fully implemented was 9% at December 31. We repurchased 11 million shares of common stock during the fourth quarter which along with our dividend resulted in a 66% return of earnings to our shareholders in the fourth quarter. Slide 5 provides you with a five-quarter history of our performance metrics, and they continue to be among the best in the industry. Return on average assets in the fourth quarter was 1.5% and return on average common equity was 14.4%. Moving over to the graph on the right, you can see that this quarter's net interest margin was 3.14%, and Andy will discuss the margin in more detail in just a few minutes. Our efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 54.3%, lower than the prior year. Excluding the impact of notable items in the fourth quarter, our efficiency ratio was 53.8%. We expect this ratio will remain in the low 50s going forward as we continue to manage expenses in relation to revenue trends while continuing to invest in and grow our businesses. Turning to Slide 6, the Company reported total net revenue in the fourth quarter of $5.2 billion, a 5.7% increase from the prior year. Excluding the impact of this quarter's gain related to an equity investment in Nuveen, total net revenue increased 3.2% from the prior year. The increase was due to higher net interest income as well as higher revenue in most fee businesses. Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 7. Average total loans outstanding increased by almost $14 billion or 5.9% year-over-year and 1% linked quarter. Adjusting for the Charter One acquisition, total average loans grew 5.5% year-over-year. Overall and excluding covered loans, which is a run-up portfolio, average total loans grew by 7.1% year-over-year and 1.2% linked-quarter. Again this quarter the increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans, which grew by 15.5% year-over-year and 2.9% over the prior quarter. Total average commercial real estate loans also grew increasing 4.2% year-over-year and 0.3% linked-quarter. Residential real estate loans grew 2.2% year-over-year and were relatively flat on a linked-quarter basis. Average credit card loans increased 3.6% year-over-year and were up 1.3% on a linked-quarter basis. Total other retail loans grew by 3.6% year-over-year and 0.8% over the prior quarter, mainly driven by steady growth in auto loans. We continue to originate and renew loans and lines for our customers. New originations excluding mortgage production plus new and renewed commitments totaled approximately $53 billion in the fourth quarter. Total average revolving commercial and commercial real estate commitments continued to grow at a fast pace, increasing year-over-year by 13.3% and 3% on a linked-quarter basis. Line utilization was relatively flat in the fourth quarter. Total average deposits increased almost $19 billion or 7.2% over the same quarter of last year and 1.6% over the previous quarter. Excluding the Charter One acquisition, the growth rate remained strong at 5.5% on a year-over-year basis. Growth in low-cost interest checking, money market and savings deposits was particularly strong on a year-over-year basis. Turning to Slide 8 and credit quality, total net charge-offs declined 8.3% on a linked-quarter basis and 1.3% on a year-over-year basis. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 0.50% in the fourth quarter. Nonperforming assets decreased by 6% on a linked-quarter basis and 11.2% from the fourth quarter of 2013. The loss sharing agreement for the commercial and commercial real estate loans acquired from the FDIC, which comprised the majority of the nonperforming covered assets, expired at the end of the fourth quarter of 2014. During the fourth quarter, we released $20 million of reserves, $5 million less than the third quarter of 2014 and $15 million less than the fourth quarter of last year. Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we currently expect the net charge-offs and total nonperforming assets to remain relatively stable in the first quarter of 2015. Andy will now give you a few more details about our fourth quarter results. Andrew Cecere : Thanks, Richard. Slide 9 gives you a view of our fourth quarter 2014 results versus comparable time periods. Our diluted EPS of $0.79 was 3.9% higher than the fourth quarter of 2013 and 1.3% higher than the prior quarter. The key drivers of the Company's fourth quarter earnings are summarized on Slide 10. Fourth quarter results reflected notable items that in combined increased diluted earnings per common share by $0.01. The notable items included $124 million gain related to an equity investment in Nuveen Investments and $88 million of additional expense comprised of $35 million of charitable contributions and $53 million related to recent developments in certain legal matters. The $32 million or 2.2% increase in net income year-over-year was principally due to an increase in total net revenue, driven by increases in net interest income, fee-based revenue and the impact of notable items. The Company also achieved positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis. Net interest income was up 2.4% year-over-year, as an increase in average earning assets was partially offset by lower net interest margin including lower loan fees. The $35 billion increase in average earning assets year-over-year included growth in average total loans as well as planned increases in the securities portfolio. The net interest margin of 3.14% was 26 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2013, primarily due to growth in the investment portfolio at lower average rates, lower loan fees and lower rates of new loans, partially offset by lower funding costs. Lower loan fees were due to the previously communicated wind-down of Checking Account Advance, our short-term, small-dollar deposit advanced product. Noninterest income increased $214 million or 9.9% year-over-year due to higher revenue in most fee businesses and higher other income including the impact of the Nuveen gain. We saw growth in retail and corporate payments, merchant processing, trust and investment management fees, deposit service charges, treasury management fees and investment product fees. Noninterest expense increased year-over-year by $122 million or 4.5%, primarily due to the accruals for legal matters, charitable contributions and an increase in compensation expense reflecting the impact of merit increases, acquisitions and higher staffing for risk and compliance activities. Net income was higher on a linked-quarter basis by $17 million or 1.2%, mainly due to the higher net interest income, the impact of the notable items and a decrease in the provision for credit losses. On a linked-quarter basis, net interest income increased 1.9%, mainly due to an increase in average earning assets, partially offset by lower loan and investment security rates. The net interest margin of 3.14% was 2 basis points lower than the third quarter, principally due to the growth in lower rate investment securities, partially offset by unusually high interest recoveries. These unusually high interest recoveries added approximately 2 basis points to the fourth quarter net interest margin. On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest income was higher by $128 million or 5.7%. This favorable variance was primarily due to higher other income including the impact of the Nuveen gain, partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenue and seasonally lower corporate payments revenue. On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest expense increased by $119 million or 7.3% due to seasonally higher cost related to investments and tax advantage projects, higher professional services and the notable items including the charitable contributions and legal accruals. Turning to Slide 11, our capital position is strong. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as if fully implemented at December 31 was 9.0%. At 9.0%, we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. Our tangible book value per share rose to $15.96 at December 31, representing a 10.8% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 1.9% increase over the prior quarter. Our return on tangible common equity was 20% for the fourth quarter. Also, we are complying with fully implemented U.S. liquidity coverage ratio based on our interpretation of the final rolls. I'll now turn the call back to Richard. Richard K. Davis: Thank you, Andy. I'm very proud of our 2014 results. We reported record net income, maintained our industry-leading performance measures and returned 72% of our earnings to shareholders. These results are directly tied to the hard work and dedication of our employees. In fact last week I had the privilege of leading our 9th Annual All Employee Meeting. There was a pleasure to once again make this annual connection with our employees and to thank them for their contributions and for our success. I'd also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Andy and Kathy. Yesterday we announced that Andy has been promoted to the Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer where he will be responsible for our core lines of business. Andy has demonstrated tremendous leadership as CFO and we are confident in his ability to manage our businesses effectively and execute our customer-focused growth strategy. Kathy Rogers, currently EVP responsible for Business Line Planning & Reporting including the stress test process, will replace Andy as Vice Chairman and CFO. Kathy has been with U.S. Bank for 28 years and has served in a variety of leadership roles within the finance organization. Many of you have already met Kathy and I know she looks forward to meeting the rest of you very soon. So as we head into 2015, we remain focused on extending our exceptional track record or financial performance for the benefit of our customers, our employees, our communities and our shareholders. That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill, Kathy and I would now be happy to answer questions from the audience. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jon Arfstrom of RBC Capital Markets. Jon Arfstrom : Just on the topic of the promotion, I think we're all big Andy supporters, we appreciate the new role for him, but can you maybe share what drove the change and is there anything you are trying to signal or anything that changes with the way the Company is going to be run, and anything change in your role, Richard? Richard K. Davis: My role doesn't change but it is a chance for Andy to demonstrate the same acumen he's had in the financial role by running the revenue business lines, and as we move through this transition I think as the economy starts to get better, I'm quite excited to have him keenly focused on what leverage we can create as the economy picks up. I'll continue to be running the whole Company but focus especially on the support teams and the compliance and the operating integrity that's gotten this Company to this point so far. And it is fairly transparent, it's a chance to give Andy an opportunity to prove that he can run virtually all parts of the Company in the eventual opportunity for him to run it someday. Jon Arfstrom : Good, thank you. And then just a question on 2015 in terms of some of your targets, historically you've had this 4% to 6% loan growth target and I think it kind of changes from quarter to quarter your level of optimism, but are you feeling optimistic and do you feel is that the right range, 4% to 6%, and what does it take to get to the higher end of that? Richard K. Davis: Yes, Jon, actually I'm optimistic. So we've been sitting in that 1% to 1.5% linked-quarter for a while and this quarter you see we were at the lower end of that, but for the year you look back and we are just short of 6% year-over-year loan growth, and we're just projecting a higher number for 2015, slightly higher, in the high 6, low 7. So if we are accurate, and we usually are, then we see that as a small but steady continued improvement in loan growth. Let me take you back to 10 years ago, for those who remember though, we are not going to be dissuaded by people who want to compare us to those who are growing loans faster in a given quarter because we never have been impacted by that, but I could remember 10 years ago being questioned on a call like this for why our loan growth isn't as fast as someone else's, and we're just not managing to that point. We're managing to high-quality loan portfolio. I think our quality of charge-offs and nonperforming assets will prove that. And so, tempting as it might be to tell you guys we're going to move to 1.5% to 2% linked quarter or 8% to 10% year-over-year, the economy doesn't warrant that yet and we're going to continue to take market share on the pricing benefits and the quality benefits we've been using for the last five to seven years, and as the economy slowly improves so will our loan growth but not remarkably, and therefore in a few years you'll be satisfied that we have remarkably high credit quality and a continued stability on what we promised through the entire cycle. So, I think we're optimistic for all the right reasons but at a small incremental level from perhaps 1% higher year-over-year than we did in '13. Jon Arfstrom : Okay. Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : When we met back in November, we talked a little bit about outlook for investing in the business and some of the things you were asking the business unit heads to do, and I guess I'm just wondering if the game plan to grow the business with kind of current headcount is still in place, basically wondering if you're thinking about expanding at this stage to capture more market share or to do the same, to grow the market share with the same\u2026? Richard K. Davis: Got it. I'll repeat it in a different way. What we said was 2014 was the year that we'll continue to keep an eye on any discretionary expenses that would otherwise not be as important given the fact that expenses were going to be challenged and the fact that the economy was slow. 2015, I think like a lot of our peers, we've adopted the Fed's interest-rate scenario which starts to move up in the middle of the year. If that happens, that's awesome. But if it doesn't, we're not entirely related. It's not going to make or break this Company on whether interest rates move up. We're going to control a lot of other things. So the first half of '15, given Fed's interest-rate scenario, it will a lot like all of '14 where we'll continue to invest where we have to, we'll watch the discretionary investments and keep them perhaps, defer them a bit until we can see a stronger economy, we'll add the compliance, operating risk areas, audit areas where we think we continue to need to make sure we're at the right level of support, and then when interest rates hit, we're ready to pop and move on to some of these more discretionary investments. What's really good about it though is we'll continue to grow market share, we'll continue to do well even though there's really no underlying reason for it but the fact that the employees are just better. They work harder, they find more opportunities in each relationship, our employee engagement is at record levels which I think informs employees that are engaged are intensely [indiscernible] where they can do more with whatever assets they are given and they'll continue to do it if they believe the Company's future is strong and that they are part of it. So I'm quite comfortable that in the next six months we can keep doing what we've been doing. If rates move up then we are all glad and we're going to move right on to start adding back, but if they don't this Company still controls a lot of levers and we're not completely relying on whether rates move up and we'll just manage it one month at a time like we do every year and look forward to talking to you when things are better. Betsy Graseck : Okay, so if rates don't go up, there is still the hold the line to the line on headcount expenses? Richard K. Davis: Yes, except for the areas where it's either necessary or the opportunity is too great to pass. There are plenty of things where you can get an ROI in the same calendar year with an investment. I'm taking all those I can. But some of those ROIs are three-year paybacks, four-year paybacks, they're great ideas but they're not necessarily the best investment at a time when you're trying to be prudent against an otherwise difficult backdrop. So we'll hold those off for a while longer. We have so far and it hasn't hurt us permanently and I don't think it will for another six months, even 12 if we had to. Betsy Graseck : Okay, so you can flex if the rate environment changes from the said outlook is the takeaway? Richard K. Davis: You got it. Betsy Graseck : And then just the follow-up is on the auto leasing business, we had some information over the last couple of weeks that [indiscernible] was going in house. I'm wondering how that impacts you. Richard K. Davis: Not much. I mean the headlines are sometimes just that. For us the leasing business is part of our very big indirect auto lending and this is leasing, and for us it's probably 10%, maybe 15% of our leasing business, which is a small fraction of our total lending business. So it's not material in every sense of the word literally and figuratively and we do leasing with virtually every other party as well. So this wasn't a core fundamental pillar of our success in auto leasing. So we're not worried that we can't replace it pretty shortly. Operator : Your next question comes from John McDonald of Bernstein. John McDonald : Richard, I was wondering your kind of high-level thoughts on how you are viewing the revenue to expense relationship unfolding in 2015 given what you laid out for Betsy in terms of your rate outlook, how do you see revenues and expenses kind of in your base case this year and what are the key wildcards? Richard K. Davis: So, John, if you look back on 2014, we grew revenue just a little bit over 1%. This is kind of normalizing for all the noise we had, and expenses were up just a little more than 1%, slightly negative operating leverage. So shame on us, we're disappointed, but it's the way it rolled out. If interest rates move up in the middle of the year consistent with the Fed's recommendation, we will see revenue in the 3% to 4% kind of range and expenses more in the 2% to 3% kind of range. If they don't, then we're going to have to struggle to get really close to positive operating leverage just like we did for '14, and to dwell on Betsy's question, we know exactly how to do that without killing the future, but it will be a lot less enjoyable. We'll have to continue to get it through until we see interest rates giving us the benefit of higher revenue. I just want to say, we are positive, we're extra positive of interest rates growing but based on our trust and payments business particularly, more than most banks, when interest rates move up, for us it's because the proxy of the economy getting better that then triggers all kinds of benefits on our income statement, a lot more than just the spread in the margin. So we kind of see the way we're positioned, we're kind of attuned for interest rates increasing because it's the fundamental reason that the increase is going to benefit some of our fee businesses. But we're going to be positive, we're shooting for positive operating leverage at higher levels of both operating revenue and operating expenses, but to follow Betsy's question and time together, if something less positive occurs we're able to adjust to it and we've got a team that knows how to manage that, they've proven it and we're not going to disappoint you guys. John McDonald : Great. And just a nuance on the rates up scenario and your base case, if the Fed does act in the second half of the year, but we still see long rates low because of global issues, how does that impact the outlook for revenue growth and is that an incremental challenge, and Andy, how do you manage through the balance sheet with long rate so low and does that create pressure on your base case scenario if the 10-year stays low like this? Andrew Cecere : The short answer, John, is no. The long rate is less impactful to us. We're most impactful at the very short end and if you think about the middle then two to three years is where we have a lot of impact. We don't have a lot of assets in our book that are at the 10 year and beyond mark, so that's less impactful. Again the short end is the most impactful to us, both in net interest income as well as fee income because of the way we're using our money funds. John McDonald : Okay. And then just a quick follow up, Andy, what's your outlook for the net interest margin in the first quarter? Andrew Cecere : Sure, John. So if you think about this quarter, third quarter we were 3.16%, this quarter we were 3.14% and frankly it was a little bit better than we expected and what we told you it was going to be. And the reason for that, part of the reason for that is we have usually high interest recoveries this quarter, and I talked about that in my prepared remarks, and that helped margin by about 2 basis points. I would expect that to dissipate going into the first quarter. So you think about our core being at 3.12%, I would expect us to be down a few basis points in the first quarter from that 3.12% for the same reasons we've talked about, which is the loan mix, principally wholesale versus retail, and then the last tail of our securities build. So we sort of had first average part of it in the fourth quarter, we'll pick up the rest of it in the first quarter. And we are done. We ended the quarter at $100 billion, we're over the 100% LCR ratio. So we're done with it but we'll still have a little bit of a lingering impact, so down a few from 3.12% in the first quarter. John McDonald : Okay, something like 3% to 5% or 2% to 4%, just something in that range? Andrew Cecere : Yes. John McDonald : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Bill Carache of Nomura Securities. Bill Carache : So given your loan growth expectations and the NIM commentary that you just provided, can you talk about your ability to grow NII under the different rate environments that you've been discussing? Andrew Cecere : We will grow NII on a year-over-year basis, both the combination of what Richard talked about and what I talked about on rates. So our expectation is net interest income will grow. Now in the first quarter, if you think about it on a linked quarter basis, the first quarter has two fewer days and that costs us just under $40 million. So absent that, we'll be slightly, relatively stable but the first quarter is a little down because of days. Bill Carache : Okay, thank you. I had another question on your payments business. On the issuing side, you guys reported a solid acceleration in payment volume growth this quarter. Can you give us a sense of the interplay between pressure on purchase volume growth from lower gas prices on one hand and increased spending power that the consumer enjoys on the other, does the acceleration that you saw this quarter suggest that the latter dominates the former or is it too early to tell and the acceleration is a function of something else, maybe some color around that? Richard K. Davis: I think the answer is, yes, lots of questions, but latter does it from the former. So here's the deal. We've got this really great opportunity with our corporate payments, not just our retail issuing, to see that and government, we can see pretty much where everything is moving around and we can see directly and very quickly the movement in the, let's say first on the corporate side where corporate T&E is still outpacing, and we're still growing that even with the softness of the fuel prices, so we're still seeing T&E grow which is a pretty good sign that businesses are transferring some of that into other expenses. Consumers are the same. So anything related to energy or gas prices has been coming down but the ticket prices and the number of visits people have made to restaurants, hotels and some of those discretionary things that they would spend money on had absolutely gone up. So, Bill, we've seen at least in 90 days almost a perfect correlation from people still spending the money they're saving on gas through their debit, credit or prepaid cards but they are spending on things that I'm sure that a lot of retailers and the restaurateurs are happy about. So we see that evidence both at the consumer and at the corporate level. Bill Carache : That's really helpful. On the acquiring side, you guys also had nice growth but interestingly that reflected a little bit of deceleration, which is kind of an interesting contrast to the acceleration that we were just talking about on the issuing side. Can you talk about maybe what's driving that? Andrew Cecere : On the merchant acquiring side, part of that is seasonality. So our fourth quarter is typically lower than our third quarter and that goes to mix of business a little bit. If you think about the issuing side, we have a lot of retail. On the acquiring side, we have less retail, more airlines and the like. And you think about when people buy tickets and so forth, this is less so in the fourth quarter. So it's more seasonal, still we're showing good growth year-over-year, same-store sales is just under 5%. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. I'm showing he disconnected. Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Another question on the margin. Beyond the first quarter, want to get your thoughts on the margin progression. Is it fair to assume 2 to 3 bps of quarterly compression mainly on competitive pressures on loan yield, just want to get your thoughts there? Andrew Cecere : So I would describe it as 2 to 3 basis points given flat rates more because of loan mix than competitive pressure, although pressure is a little bit of it, but it's more the mix. Most of our growth is coming on the wholesale side of the equation and the wholesale has about half the yield of retail. So that's what's driving that 2 to 3 basis points more than anything, and again that assumes the rates flat to current levels. Once and if and when rates start to move, we'll start to see a positive rise there. John Pancari : Okay, alright. And then separately on the expense items, just on comp expense and the increase in fourth quarter, was that all performance related, just want to get an idea of what the driver was? Andrew Cecere : In the fourth quarter we have normal activities going on in increases related to risk and compliance positions for the most part, [indiscernible] headcount and [indiscernible] increases. We had some increases in compensation expense related to incentives. But if you peel those two things out, it was relatively stable. Richard K. Davis: And John, it was a full effect of our RPS acquisition in Chicago that had a full quarterly effect in quarter four as well, but there was nothing unusual and it doesn't bode for any significant change in quarter one. John Pancari : Okay, alright. And then lastly just want to ask on credit. You released additional reserves this quarter and wanted to just get your thoughts on where the reserve to loan ratio could bottom out, I mean you're still at a healthy level here, they're around 167 basis points or so. Richard K. Davis: Bill? P.W. Parker: Yes, it's 177 on allowance to loans, all-in allowance. I mean it's really a function of our mix. That's why ours look a little bit higher than some of our peers, so we have a higher percentage of credit cards. So obviously we're comfortable with where it's at. You see we have very, very modest reserve release. I think when that inflects, really gets to the point of what kind of loan and commitment growth we see during the coming year. There is a little bit more room for opportunity in some of the residential and home-equity products but at this point it's going to be more a function of loan and commitment growth going forward. Andrew Cecere : I mean the stability, [indiscernible]. P.W. Parker: Yes, the stability of our credit portfolio right now is the strongest I've ever seen. It's just extremely all the loaners are performing well. Richard K. Davis: And there surely will be an inflection point for all the banking, right, where eventually you have to reserve for loans that you're making and [the future may go bad but] [ph] we're not looking at that inflection point in the near term for our Company, we're simply not, and we haven't been driving much income off of reserve releases, so we don't have much to gather again from that, but eventually we'll end up reserving for as opposed to releasing but we are not there, now we're not there for a little while. John Pancari : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom of Guggenheim. Eric Wasserstrom : I just wanted to follow-up on some of the commentary on fee income growth. I think for the prior year the security gains were about 4% of the noninterest income. So as we think ahead to next year, is the realization of those gains going to be something that continues as kind of a bridge to a better rate environment or were those really just opportunistic and we should really think about growth off of a baseline number of something like 8.8 billion? Andrew Cecere : The latter. So I think the notable items, the gains that we talked about, the Visa gain in the second quarter, the gain from Nuveen here in the fourth quarter are one-time items that are not likely to repeat, so [exempt] [ph] from that base that is excluding that think about loan growth in there. Eric Wasserstrom : Okay. So I think absent those things, the growth rate was about 1% in terms of fee income and it looks like the consensus for next year has about implied 5% growth off of that core number. Is that an achievable level given kind of some of the acceleration that we've talked about or is that maybe a stretch? Andrew Cecere : I think a key factor in '14 was the headwind that we faced in the first half of the year related to the mortgage and if you looked at the mortgage numbers they were down 13%, 14% year-over-year which caused a tremendous headwind in quarters one, two and a little bit in three and you're seeing quarter four we're actually flat for the first time in a long time in mortgage. So I think the removal of that headwind will help us get to the numbers that are higher than we achieved this year. Richard K. Davis: That's a big deal. We should have had the applause because that is a long anticipated moment where we're starting to grow mortgage again on a year-over-year basis. That is a big number, Eric, so if you do the math, you'll see that it's more than enough to accomplish that. Operator : Your next question comes from Richard Bove of Rafferty Capital. Richard Bove : I got to ask as I think 30,000 feet high for a second, when I look at your bank, I can see absolutely nothing wrong. In my view it's about as perfect as a company can get in this industry. And yet when I take a look at Slide 9, I see that on a year-over-year basis the net interest income to common is up 0.6%, I see that the EPS is up 2.7%, and when I take a look at the price of your stock it's up 2.6% last year in a market that's up 11%, and what I'm wondering is, if a bank which is as close to perfection as this one is, can't get its earnings to move up at a faster rate and can't get its stock price to do anything but move up at a rate one quarter that of the market, what will it take to get this thing moving in a direction where the stock is going to equal or outperform the market? Richard K. Davis: This is Richard. Thanks for that observation. I think U.S. Bank moves best when everything is moving one way or another. So the bank was 10 years ago a fairly considerate bank with a sense of all defense, right, we were an efficiency company, no one ever thought about us making revenue, which is save the next dollar, we can merge and acquire companies and squeeze more out of that than anyone else, and that was well-regarded and well-recognized. Then the downturn hits, and that was our first chance to prove, like I said earlier in an answer to John's question, that while we may not look like we are growing as much in the go-go times, we also chose not to take risks and those showed up later when the economy turned and we ended up getting stronger. I know you know this, you've written about this, we became a flight to quality, a place of safety and we played on that. So now here we are in kind of a flat, slow, slow recovery that's almost flat, so we can't prove anything remarkable except to just say we're not going to disappoint, we're not going to surprise, we're not going to get complicated, we're just going to get it out and do a little bit better than everyone else on all the basic tenants. The next opportunity for us to perform is when the rates pick up because the markets picked up and to show that the Bank is repositioned now to be as strong as it ever was when it was on defense and be better than anyone else on offense. So I'm going to hold your question in the rears until we get the chance to show you that when the recovery starts and because of our high credit quality, our amazing pricing benefits that we have based on our debt ratings, that we are going to be able to show you we can be even better. And then I think the multiple comes back, we even spread further from where we are because we're always sitting at this high multiple that people need us to be, remarkable every quarter to prove and protect, but we are looking forward greatly at the time when the world gets better and we can show you just how positioned we are for that, and there's a lot we did in that period of time, in the last five to seven years, to position this Company as innovative, payments focused, trust leader and global. So I'll look forward to that and I'll ask you to ask me the question again when things start to turn, but I think it makes sense that we hold our own position of strength, kind of the yellow flag is out on the racetrack but when the green flag comes out we'll take off first. Richard Bove : Again, I have no questions with [indiscernible], I think the way you run the Bank is superb. My issue I guess is, and we heard it again last night in the State of the Union message, will the government prevent the industry from reaching a level where it can show meaningful profit increases or will it come up with a new liquidity capital ratio supplement to leverage ratios, loss absorbing capital ratios and special [indiscernible] for taking high levels of risk? In other words, as you improve your Company, will the government stay one step ahead of you and prevent you from showing the type of improvement that you're getting in the operation of the Company? Richard K. Davis: I'll tell you I can't answer that because I don't know the answer, but I will say that we're in a closed set of competitors, right, at least as banks go, and we certainly wouldn't trade places with anybody else based on our current position, our size, the fact that we're a domestic city not a global city, the fact that we don't do leverage lending, we don't have high-risk portfolios, and all I'm saying there is, customers, businesses, they're all going to need banks and unless there's a huge alternative I haven't found out there, they're going to need what they need. [It worries me not] [ph] what the government does to impair our profitability, we will be there first amongst few I think at the highest returns and the highest quality to be there to receive those needs from the customers and almost despite \u2013 because I mean look, I mean, Dick, we lost $1.5 billion in the last four years over four or five specific government decisions on how to [indiscernible] income and we still had a record year. So we can do this. It's a lot harder, it's a lot less satisfying and it's a lot less predictable, but I think we've figured out how to do this and what we do is control what you can, be very nimble and ready to adjust to the next opportunity, and I for one can't imagine a scenario that would be any more difficult than what we have now, so I'm looking forward to getting a little bit easier with a little more clarity. But I agree, it's complicated and I can't answer directly to your question because it's what I contemplate at 30,000 feet every day. Operator : Your next question is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Bryan Batory : This is Bryan Batory from Ken's team. Apologies for the mix-up earlier. I was wondering if you could provide a little color just on the starting point for noninterest expenses in the first quarter '15, just particularly thinking about the reset in other expenses, and then also the potential pension expense increase just given where your long-term rates ended 2014? Andrew Cecere : This is Andy. If you think about the fourth quarter, there are two unusual items in total. The first is the total of the notables which is $88 million. The second is our higher CDC or the tax advantage amortization which happens every fourth quarter. That was about $60 million. So if you take out that $150 million or so, I would expect us to be relatively flat to that in the first quarter. Secondly with regards to pension expense, year-over-year we'll see about $100 million increase in pension, of $25 million a quarter, and that is reflected in the numbers I gave you in the first part. Bryan Batory : Okay, great. And then could you provide some color on your outlook for mortgage banking revenues as we head into '15 just given the recent decline in interest rates? Andrew Cecere : Good question, and it's changing every day as rates move a lot. We had a very good week last week. But right now I will tell you that our expectation is relatively stable total revenue fourth quarter into first quarter. So we have some pluses and minuses and that could change as rates move around in the next few weeks and we'll update you if it does, but right now relatively stable. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Mayo of CLSA. Mike Mayo : In terms of your outlook for loan growth, so you're expecting an acceleration you said from 6% closer to 7% range and also your growth in commitments was up 3%, so that's good. On the other hand, you mentioned that the unused lines of your commitments are still bouncing along the bottom I guess unchanged. So once again we're at another quarter where you're expecting better growth yet the 10 year yield is significantly lower. So who's going to win, Richard Davis or the 10 year bond? Richard K. Davis: [Indiscernible] 10 year yield, Mike, [indiscernible] I've been buying them and everything. I mean actually you're playing into one of our thoughts. I haven't included the improvement in utilization at all in our expectation if loan growth goes up. That is an absolute stable starting point. And the way we look at it, wholesale commitments, a lot of banks look at the total retail, we look at wholesale, and that number is at highest point in the mid-30s and today it's sitting at 24%. It's been stuck there for about 18 months. And so to me that is unbelievable upside. As long as we keep adding commitments more than loans, that means that more people have an open to buy with us and that they have an intent to use it, because they're paying for it and so are we by the way, but if they use it, any part of it, even a slightest movement from 24% to 28% or 30%, that's going to be on top of the kind of loan growth we're anticipating. So we're not counting on that to give you the answer, and I do think that while customers look at the 10-year, as Andy said most of them look more at the two to three and that movement is going to be what's going to trigger the decision on whether they want to grab something before it gets too late and whether they'll be glad they prepared themselves with the line of credit that's got an open to buy. That has a lot to do. I think there will be a tsunami effect when there is a period where people are sure that rates are moving up, I think they'll start grabbing the lines they have, they'll start using what they have and they'll be incentivized, be a catalyst for this economy, but until then we're not counting on that as part of our expectations to provide loan growth, we're just doing with our better debt ratings, our better pricing power and our really remarkable employees who've learnt how to tell our story better. Mike Mayo : So just more generally, put your economist hat on, Richard, so the 10-year seeing this much slower growth yet your guidance is for some acceleration in your loan growth. How should we reconcile those two thoughts? Richard K. Davis: On one hand and on the other hand, [indiscernible] harness. Mike, I don't think those are directly correlated right now, and I say that because the Fed and the Fed equivalent across the globe, they've done some behaviors that are certainly not [indiscernible] and they are not things that we all learned in school. To the extent that they are being motivated by I think non-financial, more political activities and more financial data that might be backwards looking not forward-looking, I'm not going to be able to correlate those two for you, and I don't think our customers are sitting there thinking that way either. So the 10-year stays low, sure mortgage will look great and then we go back to this again, but it doesn't inform our customers that the majority of this Bank until we get to two to three and until that starts to bend up, we're going to stay right where we are and if the 10-year informs us, fine, if it doesn't, it's probably going to be a bit of an inflection on the curve, but I'm not managing to the 10, I'm in management of the two or three, and I'm just not that smart. Mike Mayo : And then lastly, you're implying market share gains. You said before that U.S. Bancorp has a 30 to 35 basis point pricing advantage when pricing commercial loans against some of the largest banks. Now that the SISI premium might go even higher for some of the larger banks, could that pricing advantage improve and how are you positioning your Company to potentially benefit? Richard K. Davis: The answer is, yes, because you know the math, you knew the answer when you asked it, and where we're positioned is we have a philosophy that we will give back some portion of that advantage when we're competing against one of the banks that has a different pricing scheme and we'll only do it with the high quality customer. I suppose, because the philosophy is in place, if that spread were to widen, then we give ourselves more room to be more competitive, but it doesn't interest a new philosophy, it's just more of a larger scale for us to use and to give our lending offer the opportunity to price more effectively. So it's a net positive, I'm not counting on it, but if it happens we'll take it gladly and we'll be even more successful. Mike Mayo : How much higher could that go with 30 to 35 basis points today, could it go up another 5, 10, 20, 30? Andrew Cecere : The capital differential is about equivalent. So if you think about your 35 on the side from the perspective of our debt rating, it's an equivalent level on the side about the capital differential from the highest levels. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Miller of FBR. Jessica Ribner : This is Jessica Ribner for Paul. On the mortgage side, what are you guys seeing in terms of the purchase market? As most of your volume coming off the refi side, do you see any recovery there? Andrew Cecere : The third quarter was 70-30 new, and because the rate is coming down a bit, it's closer to 60-40, 62-38. So it's coming down a little bit more high on the refinancing side and we are also starting the year strong that way because of the low rate environment. So I would expect it to be somewhere between that 60% and 70% new. Jessica Ribner : Okay, great. And just in general, what's your institutional view on housing and the recovery, do you think that we have room to go or where do you see mortgage banking? Richard K. Davis: We do, but more than just mortgage, first mortgage, right. So we're already seeing it now on our home equity, we're growing nicely in home equity. Thanks for asking, Richard. Yes, we're actually growing almost three times the market with our home equity right now and we're doing that because we're seeing a lot of people invest in property improvement kind of monies into their homes and not doing debt consolidation, entirely they're doing it for their properties, and these are in some of the states where they are the hardest hit, where the pricings have come, [indiscernible] come back nicely. So mortgage in general has got a really nice I think outlook because people without houses now feel that they are no longer under water and they're willing to invest in them, people without houses that are now above water are willing to use it as collateral for something else, I think small business, and housing prices slowly but surely are recovering. I think there is a social question we ought to ask ourselves is how many 18 year olds who five years ago their mother or father lost their job or their house are going to want a house in the American Dream category three years from now when they're 25. Don't know that answer but I know that the housing stock is not at all overbuilt for the number of people who either need to get back out of their parents' basements or get an upgrade in the house that they live in and we think it's a good business for us, we're staying in it, we want to be in the top five from here to forever and we're investing accordingly to make sure that we're great at originating loans and servicing them as well. Operator : Your next question comes from Nancy Bush of NAB Research. Nancy Bush : Congratulations, Andy, well deserved. Richard, there was a debate sort of brewing out in the wake of fourth quarter earnings which I think have not been particularly wonderful particularly for the largest banks about whether the industry can continue to cut costs without 'going from cutting fat to cutting muscle', and I'd like to get your view on that, and secondly just from the perspective of your Company, I think you go through this exercise every month of where you are in terms of expenses, how do you make sure that you're not cutting muscle? I'd just like to get what you guys do and what you see for the industry generally. Richard K. Davis: A great question, as usual. Here are a couple of thoughts. I do think \u2013 let's talk about the efficiency ratio, it's what everybody looks at, it's a fraction, right, it's a quotient. So one of the reasons I think we can do well is because our revenue grows. I mean there is a very basic fact, like you all know, that if you grow revenues faster than expenses, your efficiency ratio comes down. That's a fact. Banks are usually two parts revenue to one part expense. So it's important if I were to spend $100 million, my team has got to get $200 million in revenue just to keep it to 50% efficiency ratio. So those are some of the foundational points. So number one, if you grow revenue, you can impact your efficiency ratio and still grow expenses because it's not like it's [Pioneer] [ph] where you can't grow expenses, and we've been able to do that but not at the levels we want. I do think the argument at the largest bank level is partly due to revenue. I think banks could do better with their revenue but to the extent that that gets slightly impaired by certain actions, they've got to watch their expenses. And honestly I don't know why are banks in the 60% efficiency. It doesn't make sense to me because if you watch every dollar, there's plenty of money that is not necessarily shareholder friendly that's been spent and you can put a discipline in place where the employees own it first before you're telling them what to do. So in other words we've never brought in an outside party to look at our Company and tell us how to run it or tell us how to cut expenses, where you impose on employees some oversight if they didn't do themselves, because number one, it's intrusive, number two it's really unnerving because if I have to cut 10 people out of a room of a 100, the rest 90 don't know if they're safe or they're in the next group to fall. So I think that is another reason for us to be thoughtful, is that banks need to watch their expenses very, very carefully, and I'm now going to answer out the other side of my mouth that in the last five years it didn't caused banks to be amazingly disciplined in knowing where their money is being spent. I haven't got an answer for why as I thought there would be a ton of banks in the low 50s with this at this point in time. I actually don't know why there isn't. As it relates to U.S. Bank, we do meet every single month, every capital expenditure at U.S. Bank, get ready for this, over $100,000 has to come through a committee and that's a capital expenditure that includes particularly properties, leases or any kind of technology improvement. That's a very low number. We look at about a dozen items every month and the whole team is the managing committee. And so if somebody in commercial real estate needs a special new program that's going to cost them $100 million, I got to look at the rest of 13 people and say, are you willing to add $200 million in revenue over the next three years to offset this, and guess what, when the vote is taken by the group, sometimes it's no. But we all know that we've got to be able to return our investments in a fairly short time. So in closing, if we could do an ROI in everything in less than one year, it gets approved here every minute. If it takes two years, it gets contemplated given the circumstances. If it's finally more than three years, we're very, very careful and thoughtful about it. So I know that we are not improving every single thing that lead to revenue improving three to four years from now, I know we're not. I also know we're improving everything that has the highest value in the next couple of years and the minute the world gets better, I've got a list from most important to least important that will go right back into the coffers, we will improve them immediately and the shelf is full of the next best ideas so that we don't linger and lose any time to get back to spending money. So I didn't answer your question very well but it's the discipline, knowing what you're doing, put in the hands of the employees where they control their fate, give them a forecast to show them what the decision is going to mean so they can make that decision on their own or collectively as leaders and they'll always make the right one and then they don't feel like they're being told how to run the place and they feel like you respect them for the qualities of their leadership, that we do. So that's my long answer to your question. Nancy Bush : So I guess I interpret that as you're saying, yes, there is still lots of fat in the banking industry that can be cut? Richard K. Davis: Yes, I am saying that. Why didn't I just say that? Why do I talk so much, Nancy, what's wrong with me? Yes, that's what I meant. Nancy Bush : Okay. Secondly if I'm reading the news correctly, the Supreme Court just refused to hear a case about swipe fees. Am I reading that correctly? Richard K. Davis: That's right. Nancy Bush : And does that mean that this issue will now go away or do you think that the retailers are going to come back with some other new slant on this? Richard K. Davis: I think in terms of a lifecycle, it goes away for all of us on this phone. It could go back, come back in a few years and has another 10 to 15 year lifecycle, but in this half-generation, I think by all accounts, exclamation point, this one is dead. Nancy Bush : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session of today's call. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing remarks. Sean O'Connor: Thank you for listening to our call this morning and please contact me this afternoon if you have any follow-up questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes your conference. You may now disconnect.",

Following a review of the results by Richard Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Kathy Rogers, U.S. Bancorp's Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon Eastern Standard Time through Wednesday, April 22 at 12 :00 midnight Eastern Standard Time. I will now turn the conference call over to Sean O'Connor, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. Sean O'Connor: Thank you, Kalia, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Kathy Rogers, Andy Cecere, and Bill Parker are here with me today. Richard and Kathy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Richard. Richard Davis : Thank you, Sean, and good morning everyone. It's great to be here and to talk about U.S. Bancorp. I want to begin our review with the results of the summary of the quarterly highlights on Page 3 of the presentation. U.S. Bank reported net income of $1.4 billion for the first quarter of 2015 or $0.76 per diluted common share, a 4.1% year-over-year. Total average loans grew 5.1% year-over-year and 0.8% linked-quarter excluding the impact of the reclassification of certain municipal loans to securities at the end of the fourth quarter. In addition, we continue to experience strong loan growth and total average deposits. Strong growth in total average deposits of 8.1% over the prior year, and 1.1% linked-quarter. The strongest first quarter deposit growth we've seen in several years. Credit quality remains strong. Total net charge-offs decreased by 18.2% from the prior year and declined 9.4% from the prior quarter. Total nonperforming assets declined compared to both the prior year by quarter and on a linked-quarter basis. We continue to generate significant capital this quarter. Our common tier one capital ratio estimated for the Basel III standardized approach as fully implemented was 9.2% at March 31. We repurchased 12 million shares of common stocks during the first quarter which along with our dividend resulted in a 70% return of earnings to our shareholders in the first quarter. Slide 4 provides you with a five-quarter history of our performance metrics, and they continue to be among the best in the industry. Return on average assets in the first quarter was 1.44% and return on average common equity was 14.1%. Moving over to the graph on the right, you can see that this quarter's net interest margin was 3.08%. Kathy will discuss the margin in more detail in just a few minutes. Our efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 54.3% equal to the prior quarter. We expect this ratio to decline and remain in the low 50s going forward as we continue to manage expenses in relation to revenue trends while continuing to invest in and grow our businesses. Turning to Slide 5, the Company reported total net revenue in the first quarter of $4.9 billion, a 1.9% increase from the prior year. The increase was due to the higher net interest income as well as higher revenue in most fee businesses partially offset by lower loan fees due to the previously discussed wind-down of Checking Account Advance. Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 6. Average total loans outstanding increased by $12 billion or 5.1% year-over-year and 0.8% linked-quarter excluding the impact of reclassification of certain municipal loans to securities at the end of the fourth quarter. Average total loans grew by 0.6% linked-quarter on a reported basis. Again this quarter, the increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans, which grew by 15.1% year-over-year and 2.4% over the prior quarter. Residential real estate loans were relatively flat year-over-year and declined modestly on a linked-quarter basis. Average credit card loans increased 2.4% year-over-year and were seasonally lower on a linked-quarter basis. Total other retail loans grew 3.5% year-over-year and 0.4% over the prior quarter, mainly driven by steady growth in auto loans. We continue to originate and renew loans and lines for our customers. New originations excluding mortgage production plus new and renewed commitments totaled approximately $38 billion in the first quarter. Total average revolving commercial and commercial real estate commitments continue to grow at a fast pace, increasing year-over-year by 11.7% and 1.9% on a linked-quarter basis. Line utilization was relatively flat in the first quarter. Total average deposits increased almost $21 billion or 8.1% over the same quarter of last year and 1.1% over the previous quarter. Excluding the Charter One acquisition, the growth rate remained strong at 6.4% on a year-over-year basis. Growth in low-cost interest checking, money market and savings deposits was particularly strong on a year-over-year basis. Turning to Slide 7 and credit quality. Total net charge-offs declined 9.4% on a linked-quarter basis and 18.2% on a year-over-year basis. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 0.46% in the first quarter. Nonperforming assets decreased by 6.2% on a linked-quarter basis and 15.2% from the first quarter of last year. During the first quarter, we released $15 million of reserves, $5 million less than the fourth quarter of 2014 and $20 million less than the first quarter of 2014. Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we currently expect the total nonperforming assets to remain relatively stable in the second quarter of 2015. While we expect the level of net charge-offs to increase modestly in the second quarter mainly due to lower expected recoveries. Kathy will now give you a few more details of our first quarter results. Kathy Rogers : Thanks Richard. I\u2019ll turn you to Slide 8. This gives you a view of our first quarter 2015 results versus comparable time periods. Our diluted EPS of $0.76 was 4.1% higher than the first quarter of 2014 and 3.8% lower than the prior quarter. The key drivers of the Company's first quarter earnings are summarized on Slide 9. The $34 million or 2.4% increase in income year-over-year was principally due to an increase in total net revenue, driven by increases in net interest income, and fee-based revenue and a decline in the provision for credit losses partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense. Net interest income was up 1.7% year-over-year, as an increase in average earning assets was partially offset by a lower net interest margin including lower loan fees. Approximately $50 million of the reduction in loan fees was due to the previously discussed wind-down of our Checking Account Advance, our short-term small-dollar deposit advanced product. The $34.6 million increase in average earning assets year-over-year included growth in average total loans as well as planned increases in the securities portfolio. Also at the end of the first quarter approximately $3 billion of student loans were transferred from the loan portfolio to loans held for sale. The net interest margin of 3.08% was 27 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2014. This is primarily due to the growth in the investment portfolio at lower average rates as well as lower reinvestment rates on investment security. Lower loan fees and lower rates on new loans and the change in loan portfolio mix which is partially offset by lower funding cost. Noninterest income increased $46 million or 2.2% year-over-year due to higher revenue in most fee businesses. We saw growth in retail payments, trust and investment management fees, deposit service charges, treasury management fees, investment product fees, mortgage banking and other income which was driven by higher equity investment gains. Merchant processing revenue were relatively flat on a year-over-year basis was negatively impacted by foreign currency rate changes. Excluding this impact, merchant processing fees grew approximately 5.5% on a year-over-year basis. Noninterest expense income increased year-over-year by $121 million or 4.8%. The increase is primarily the result of higher compensation and benefits expense and higher other expense. The increase in compensation expense is primarily the result of the impact of merit increases, acquisitions, higher staffing for risk and compliance activities and the variable costs related to higher mortgage production volumes increased benefits expenses due to higher pension costs of about $25 million for the quarter. Other expense is higher primarily due to mortgage servicing related activities. On a linked-quarter basis, net income was lower by $57 million or 3.8% mainly due to lower net interest income and seasonally lower fee based revenue partially offset by a decrease in noninterest expense. Net interest income was lower due to the impact of two fewer days in the quarter and a lower net interest margin. The net interest margin of 3.08% was 6 basis points lower than the fourth quarter. The 6 basis points decline includes approximately 2 basis points related to the unusually high interest recoveries in the fourth quarter which as you recall we discussed at the earnings call in January. Higher interest recoveries continued in the first quarter benefiting net interest income by approximately 1 basis point. The remaining decline in net interest income was principally due to growth in lower rate investment securities and lower reinvestment rates, lower rates on new loans and a change in the loan portfolio mix, along with the impact of higher cash balances at the Federal Reserve as a result of continued deposit growth, which as Richard mentioned was exceptionally strong in the first quarter. On a linked quarter basis, noninterest income was lower by $216 million or 9.1%. This variance is principally due to seasonally lower fee revenue in the fourth quarter 2014 gain. On a linked quarter basis, noninterest expense decreased by $139 million or 5.0%. The decrease is due to seasonally lower costs related to investments in tax advantage projects, the impact of the notable fourth quarter 2014 charitable contribution and legal accruals and lower marketing and business development expenses. Professional services also declined due to seasonally lower expend in many of our businesses. Partially offsetting these reductions were higher compensation and benefits expense due to increased pension costs, seasonally higher payroll taxes and increases in variable compensation related to higher mortgage volumes. Turning now to slide 10, our capital position is strong. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as is fully implemented at March 31 was 9.2%. At 9.2%, we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. Our tangible book value per share rose to $16.50 at March 31, representing a 10.1% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 3.4% increase over the prior quarter. Our return on tangible common equity was 19% for the first quarter. In March we received the results of the 2015 comprehensive capital assessment and review or the CCAR including the Federal Reserve's non-objection to our capital plan. Subsequently we announced our new five quarter buyback authorization totaling approximately $3 billion effective April 1, and our intension to recommend to our board of directors the 4.1% increase in our common stock dividend beginning with the second quarter dividend payable in July. I will now turn the call back to Richard. Richard Davis : Thanks Kathy. Turning to slide 12, you'll see the cover of our 2014 Annual report and you've seen the power of potential. At U.S. Bank we stand at the intersection of people and potential each and every day and we're privileged to serve as the caveats for all of our customers whether consumer, small business, wholesale or institutional to assist them by providing the financial tools and resources they need to achieve their full potential. This positions us well for growth as our customers seek a strong banking partner to help them as they pursue their goals. Next week we will be holding our Annual Shareholder Meeting in Louisville, Kentucky. I look forward to telling our shareholders of how proud I am of what we've accomplished and of the 67,000 remarkable and engaged employees that have contributed to our success. We remain focused on producing consistent, predictable and repeatable financial results for the benefit of our shareholders. That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Kathy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom of RBC Capital Markets. Jon Arfstrom : Thanks, good morning guys, good morning Kathy. Richard, maybe start with this -- just your view on the state of the economy. You talked a little bit about your position for growth when the economy gains momentum. Curious, are you still as optimistic as you've been in previous quarters? Do you feel like the economy is gaining momentum? And then maybe update us on your loan growth outlook? Richard Davis : Yes, I will, thanks Jon. I remain very optimistic for the economy and for the great citizens of America, a little less optimistic for the bankers until the interest rates start to move up. So if you think about it, consumer confidence continues to move up and particularly small business. Even corporate confidence continues to move up, but part of that confidence is found in their ability to operate more effectively during their day with more money in the bank, more of a reserve and their lines that they've got a back stop of equity in their homes and the belief that right now they don\u2019t need to be indebted. So for bankers that might not be as positive as for consumers and for businesses, but it does reveal itself as people husband in cash and feel but better about their situation they did a few years ago. As rates start to move up, I'm still convinced of two things. One will be that when there is a real sense that's about to happen there will be a tsunami effect, particularly on the corporate and wholesale side that people want to lock down low rates before they finally get stuck having missed that opportunity. And I think consumers will move from those who have here to who have been saving looking for some money, now they'll start making some real money in their savings accounts and their endowments and their long term trust and I do expect people to start using their lines of credit again feeling the strength of an economy and a higher wage that will come with it. So I'm super optimistic about how things are moving. They are slow but steady, but they'll continue to move forward. But I do think until rates move up it continues to impinge the ability for banks to be particularly as financially successful as they will be when things get better. As it relates to loan growth we were at 0.8% this year if you adjust for a little bit of noise and that's outside of our normal range of 1 to 1.5% on a linked quarter basis which is about 5% to 6% annualized number. We're looking to get back into that 1 to 1.5% in quarter two as we look into this 15 days into the second quarter. I'm also hopeful that as the year ages we'll see those increases a little higher to the ranges we were used to at the 1.5% to 2%. So I'm starting to stick with our hope that we can get in the 6% range for loan growth on a year-over-year basis by year's end. But for now the 0.8% for me is a little disappointing because I really want to stay in that 1 to 1.5% range, but for you as an investor make it certain that we're not going to stretch on any kind of credit quality in order to accomplish those numbers until which time it is more natural and the customers that we serve have the need for their loans. So, I'm quite optimistic and yet a little bit hesitant until rates start to move. Jon Arfstrom : Okay, good. That's helpful. And then just maybe a quick one for Bill. I know it's a small number, but the incremental provision in energy, can you maybe just give us an update of what you did and what your expectations are and maybe size the exposure for us? P.W. Parker: Sure, so the energy loans are about 1.2 times of our total loans and the part of that portfolio that is most directly impacted by the lower oil prices is the E&P portfolio. It is roughly two thirds of that. We have now run through that entire book with the new pricings back reflecting the much lower forecast obviously on oil. And we have adjusted the ratings accordingly on that book and we did take an incremental reserve at the end of the year we've adjusted that now that we accomplished this on a loan by loan basis. It all adds up to something that's really not that material in terms of our $4 plus billion loan reserve, but it's all baked in now and we've done all the analysis and we update that pricing back at least two times a year. So if we need to do it again we will. Jon Arfstrom : Good that's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley Q - Betsy Graseck Hi, good morning. How are you doing? A couple of questions. One is just on investing in your people in an environment where rates are low and the loan growth is solid, but not accelerating too much. I am just asking the question with regard to how you are considering allocating resources to drive top-line growth. And is there opportunity to pull back maybe on some of the non-client facing related areas to be able to put more feet on the Street? Richard Davis : On personnel I wish, but no. We're not going to be able to slow down our incremental adds for first, second and third line of defense as we call it, but some plans in audit, that's just a new world and even if thought we had everything right I'd still keep that one there double triple check that we are still doing things well. So, that has been the only place we've increased our FTE since I told you I think many times last year that in the middle of February of 2014. So that's now 14 months ago, we asked the employees but for those in the compliance areas to stay at their FTE level for all intents and purposes and to manage at a higher expected performance per person. So that's not hiring freeze because there is a lot of turnover and when people do have 964 FTE in your group you can still have 964, but it does encourage you to manage the bottom performers out more swiftly and to increase the quality of the 964 people that work for you and that's where we are Betsy. I'm not going to do a reduction in force. We've hung on here for eight years and done quite well. Our engagement I believe to be at the highest level it has ever been and I believe that the employees are deeply engaged. They'll perform remarkably well for customers and shareholders will get their benefits. So I don\u2019t want to mess with that formula, but I am asking everyone here to work harder, I'm working harder and we are asking everyone to appreciate the fact that protecting all of our current positions by performance is really the way to manage through these difficult times. So that as the backdrop you'll see that our operating leverage was as you know negative for quarter one, both on a linked quarter and year-over-year basis. And as we put the plan together, we as I said always seek positive operating leverage. And our plan for 2015 is for the year to be slightly positive. I will say however, that hinged the original expectation that interest rates will start moving up at midyear and based on our stress test and the prevailing views of economists a couple of months ago, if that doesn't happen in June then it is going to put some stress on our ability to be positively operating leverage. I will tell you this though, in almost any circumstance quarter one at 54.3% operating leverage will be our highest quarter or in this case our least attractive quarter of the four and I think you'll see that as the quarters age, we'll get smarter and better at managing our expenses as revenue starts to move up. But it's anything else I'll just close by saying I'm on a lag basis, I've got to see revenue move up sustainably and consistently for long enough before we start to increase any expenses. In the meantime we will delivery with the same people working as hard as they do to deliver a little bit more each time and will manage the quality of our FTEs at the highest level at this point where I think we're selling attractive employer and we can get some really good people from different places to accompany those who are here. Betsy Graseck : And so if there is a push out in the rate hike you counter that with employee? Richard Davis : Yes I do and again being very clear that could put a pressure on our full year positive operating leverage, it could make it slightly negative and slightly positive because we were counting on that. But it is not enough of a difference and it doesn\u2019t change. I don\u2019t think you always trust in the way we manage the company to cause me to want to start laying people off for doing something more draconian because it is not an if, it is a win for different interest rates and when that happens I will be very glad we have the quality of people we have ready to jump on whatever opportunities come along. Betsy Graseck : Sure okay, and then just separately you did have a change in the management of the Payments business recently. Richard Davis : We did. Betsy Graseck : I just want to understand if there is any change in direction of the organization that we can expect? Richard Davis : So let me turn that over to the Chief Operating Officer. Andy is going to give you an update there. Andy Cecere : Good morning Betsy. No, there is no change in our strategy. We have a good place in terms of market share and capabilities and our platform and merchants, expansion outside of the U.S., all those things are going well and we continue in that focus. Our card issuing is doing also very well, we're growing in regard to the activity our branch activity is also increasing. And finally our corporate card is doing well. So I don\u2019t see any change in direction. Corporate card was impacted this quarter by a lower fuel price, which impacts our fleet business and that was one of the big anchors this quarter in terms of our year-over-year growth. The other phenomenon that we did see this quarter was corporate spend and payables is down, which again probably reflects to what Richard spoke to, which is just a general careful attitude in terms of large companies and payables for corporate spend was perhaps 1% up where in a normal period it would be up 5% to 6%. Richard Davis : I will just add too. Pam Joseph is staying all the way through June 30, so she and Shailesh Kotwal will have, almost four months of overlap, which we are going to take every day of because Pam\u2019s done a remarkable job. Shailesh was attracted to us in a number of ways, and not least to which is his international experience. And we\u2019ll continue to follow as Pam started this march across the pond to increase the exposure we have in the European markets and eventually looking at other places in the world for our merchant acquiring. But he is going to be a perfect transition and the two of them have already established I think a great report to carry on with second quarter. And we\u2019ll make sure you all get a chance to meet him in future meetings because I think you\u2019ll want to hear him directly and get a chance to understand his thoughts. Betsy Graseck : Appreciate that. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Just want to ask a little bit more around loan growth, just want to see if you can give us a little bit more color on trends in the first quarter, particularly around Commercial Real Estate, as I know it was particularly weak in the quarter, and what may have impacted that. And then secondarily, how do you get back to that 1% to 1.5% range that you indicated for next quarter? Is it just the snapback in something that was abnormally weak this quarter? Thanks. Richard Davis : Thanks John. I'll start and then Andy add some color. First of all, one of the way is out of the point into 1% to 1.5% is getting out of quarter one. So that\u2019s how we\u2019ve done already in April it\u2019s part of that we\u2019re seasonally affected company particularly such a heavy Midwest influence, which include some of the weather. So that helps a lot, that's part of it. Commercial real estate was actually pretty strong for us so I\u2019m not sure what numbers you are looking at, but I\u2019ll give you the trend in commercial real estate is very consistent we call this mild but it\u2019s East and the West Coast and Texas. And that\u2019s where most of the activity for growth is coming for at least our customers. The development activity per se is in the bigger cities West Coast, Seattle, San Francisco, LA Orange County and you got Miami, Boston, New York. So in the places you would expect and a couple of years ago on this call John, I indicated that we had done a study of total on housing availability once and when people moved out of their parents basements and when the housing stock of foreclosures came back into the normal course. And there were couple of markets that we actually stayed away from for a while, I think that they might be over built. We're not seeing that right now it seems that things are settling the cognizant floor to recover people have been more thoughtful about building in the right places. So I\u2019m not that concerned about that I was a couple of years ago. And then finally construction lending is highest for apartment, office space, and some lodging properties, which continue to find their way into popup all across the country as people start traveling again. So for me I think commercial real estate continue to be a strong point for us. Our quality is remarkably high, because we only deal with the very large national customers for the most part and we\u2019re going to stick to that approach as it served us well. And then I\u2019ll just close by saying our loan growth continues to be really strong in commercial and wholesale, which you\u2019ve seen before the 15.1% year-over-year growth. Our commitments are even higher so that bodes well for one and when people start using those commitment. That will start to have a nice increase and anytime that happens that\u2019s going to be too far, because we\u2019ll start talking future quarters about loan growth being remarkably higher than anything in the last few years and part of all just be line usage. So those of us who are collecting customers which lines that they\u2019re not using are still doing a good job of developing a future core outstanding once and when people draw and then. So Andy why don\u2019t you bring some color around [indiscernible]. Andy Cecere : So to your point commercial wholesale real estate was very strong, commercial corporate up 15%, real estate up 6% year-over-year. The area that is not growing is rapidly is our real estate residential real estate, which is relatively flat. And what\u2019s going to drive that growth is going to be our home equity increases. We do see increases in pipeline line of credit, home equity line of credit and in residential real estate. And I think as you go throughout the year, we\u2019ll see an increase in that category, which will help the overall loan growth numbers. John Pancari : Okay, I guess I was looking at the Commercial Real Estate GAAP line item on the consolidated balance sheet going from 42.8 to 42.4. That was primarily what I was calling out in terms of it appeared to pull back a little bit. Kathy Rogers : That might be - John that might be as are you looking at the end of period versus the average growth? John Pancari : Yes. Kathy Rogers : Yes. And I think that at any given day you might have a little bit of fluctuations in what pay downs and new loans coming on. So we really focus on average loan growth. John Pancari : Okay. Richard Davis : So let's get up for John, John got the longest pause we've ever have. We are never stopped our bank, so John congratulations and it\u2019s been something for that. John Pancari : I figured I would let it sit just to see. Richard Davis : It\u2019s like forever transcript so read you may reply. John Pancari : Right, adds a little suspense to the call, you know. Okay, and then lastly, just back to energy. I know it's a small piece of your book, but just want to clarify something. Did you quantify the size of the reserve or size of the provision that you took? And then what is the size of your energy reserve as of today as a percentage of loans? Richard Davis : Yes. We haven\u2019t disclosed that. I mean as I said, I mean the total loan book is about $3.3 billion and about 60% of that is the E&P portfolio, which is the area most directly impacted. Andy Cecere : Exploration and production. Richard Davis : Yes, exploration and production. So all re-rated, it\u2019s - the impact is in the numbers, but no we have not disclosed the actual dollar amount. Andy Cecere : It's not material John but certainly sufficient for the regulators. John Pancari : Got it, okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers of Sandler O'Neill. Scott Siefers : Just had a question on the margin and just sort of future directions there. I think all the big pressure seems pretty much behind you with concession of the deposit advance product and then you are pretty much all set with liquidity build for LCR. So at this point I imagine it's just normal spread compression, maybe to the tune of 3 or 4 basis points a quarter. Is that a fair way to think about margin erosion as we stay in this kind of sustained low rate environment? Kathy Rogers : Yes, Scott, I\u2019ll take that. Here is what I would say, as we look out into quarter two I think you are absolutely right that we\u2019ll continue to see margin erosion related to the mix of our growth. So we're more heavily weighted right now on wholesale versus retail so I\u2019d expect that to come down 2 to 3 basis points. We also, as we think about our investment portfolio, while we\u2019re done with the build, we still have run off in that portfolio of about $2 billion a month, which is now coming on at lower rate. So the reinvestment aspect of that is also worth a couple basis points and then as we talked about earlier our deposits are really strong. And while that is positive from a net interest income standpoint, I do think that that potentially has the possibility of having a negative impact on our margin as we look out into the next quarter of a basis point or so. Scott Siefers : Okay. So maybe somewhere in mid sort of mid-single digits per quarter kind of compression range? Andy Cecere : That's about right. We\u2019re seeing something a little new, because we didn\u2019t expect as rates keep staying flat as long as they have we actually do out this reinvestment risk I mean stuff we put out anyone in the last seven years some of that much left in seven year tenures coming due and it\u2019s coming in lower than it was before. So when rates move about just so many things start to get better and things that we're about to be tough stop being tough and never mind when rates move up we have this wonderful benefit from some of the trust businesses that we have always been paying out to what\u2019s to our negative waivers. So it\u2019s just so many things we\u2019ll start to improve, but I would say there\u2019s another basis point or two of added risk with rate staying a little longer on this reinvestment that we haven\u2019t talked about in addition to the mix. So Scott, it\u2019s but it\u2019s exactly we telegraph before. Scott Siefers : Yes, okay. All right. That sounds good. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Erika Najarian : Good morning. My question is probably top of mind for most investors in that it seems like some of the assumptions even from three months ago on rates for most banks on normalizing interest rates have been pushed out. And we are sort of at the level of provision and charge-offs where even if you stay pristine you can have volatility in any one quarter. I guess the question here, Richard, is: what is your view in terms of the timing of when normalized rates could converge relative to normalized credit, knowing that it's the normalized credit that is likely under your control or that you have a better viewpoint on? Richard Davis : Yeah, again and I agree that will being you said. Investors do want to know, we all do and I\u2019ll say, we use to prevailing view of the general economic forecast, which I think we all agreed particularly a few months ago we're starting in June one of four interest rate increases June, July, September, December and I think we\u2019re now getting a telegraph to this could start later its more like September and less frequent may be two times instead of four. What's most important is that starts off, I can tell that\u2019s really more important than the, the number of times that it occurs and I think that starting point as I referenced few minutes ago will be little bit of a tsunami effect of people spending and taking uses of credit and taking credit lines and walking down interest rates, for so for me there will be a little bit of blip, they feel number of cash per clients is may be the same store I think in the wholesale side. I will say they\u2019ve also telegraphed, the way it works for bankers that people were use their deposits first to invest in their life, then they use the line of credit, they have established whether they have anything else turning around it call it a house or call it a wholesale line of credit then they\u2019ll extend more credit, so it does have to go through those steps like like Maslow's hierarchy. So banks have to have deposits -- should see deposits flow and deposits go down and lot of you have been asking as about our stress testing and volatility of deposits out running out. Second then lines of credit will go up and the new lines from loans will be formed. So even when it starts Erika, it will take a little bit of time but once it starts we can see a better predictability around it because we haven\u2019t be able to show you guys what we used to do, seven, eight years ago when rates moved, we haven\u2019t pretty high correlation of behaviors would occur and what kind of margins impacts it would be. So for me, I think we\u2019re going to say that as the economy gets stronger, what kind of that interlude work stronger for everybody else but banks don\u2019t have particularly have this an important need in the minds of consumers and businesses as it starts to get very strong in rates move up because its stronger, we\u2019ll start getting a lot of benefits on the income statement and the balance sheet will start to move from deposits over the loan and that will start to get a much more predictability, which I think it\u2019s a probably a year away. But I\u2019m of the mind, we\u2019ve even out all stores I still think rates were move sometime in \u201915 and net effected sales were have a pretty stunning impact and then - steady rate put the what happens on the back side, that will be positive under any circumstances and was just move from one side of the balance sheet to be other all giving us net inertest income which is what you all want. Erika Najarian : And what about on the credit side? Given the underwriting standards have remained quite tight and the economy on both corporate and consumer remains healthy, are we -- is it a longer path to normalized charge-offs even though the provisions could be volatile from here? Richard Davis : Yes, it\u2019s a very long path, like multi year path, if you think about were 46 basis points and we\u2019ve declared all of you from a bottom up basis that over the cycle, we thought we would be had about 95 basis points, so we\u2019re now actually under half of that and over the cycle as, you never actually had you just pass through at on your way to either the next recession, the next recovery but I will tell you, its many, may years until we get to that number because it takes that long to get the loans on the books, takes that long to have them stress unless there is a money \u2013 event. And then it takes a long time for our results to be used in order to accommodate that so, you will see interest rates move, up probably three to five years before you will see the kind of credit quality that would be impacted by what would be some maintain either for underwriting decisions or aggressive, underwriting decisions either when we\u2019re not going to make but I think you will see the credit quality would be better than average for many years and will be the least thing what we talking about in the next couple. Erika Najarian : Got it. And just one last question. You continue to do well in the CCAR process. Are you confident that at least for the banks that are not considered SIFIs by the Fed that the CCAR process from here will be steady state? I'm sure there is going to be the transition to advance, but less stringent or less change for non-SIFIs in the US? Richard Davis : So do you mean, do I think that the non-SIFI\u2019s will get relief from where they are or that they won\u2019t be brought under these structure? Erika Najarian : Not necessarily relief, but more so less incremental negative change in the tests looking forward. Richard Davis : I mean we do believe that there will be a distinction, I don\u2019t know where the lines going to be SIFI, non-SIFI, it doesn't matter to us, because we are SIFI, we think we are we, finally not to be do SIFI but will be a SIFI. And so according to that, I think that will be plenty of the regional banks and smaller banks that will not be brought into that same kind of a routine which is where we planned for all the way and not something we\u2019re going to see as a disadvantage. On the other hand, I do think we can play our advantages to not being a do SIFI as it relates to normally the oversight the additional capital requirements and some of the expectations that have been placed on them. So we're going to call this sweet spot and based on our own preparation, we have been working on, the SIFI and the CCAR process, it's well ensconced here , there is no reason to not want to keep it up and frankly I feel better now I know the we passed all the SIFI test and if I would ever require another bank, I would be more attractive to them if they gone to the same rigger because it improves half of my due diligence. So I'm actually supporter of it and knowing that we are in it anyway, we're going to make the best of it. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hey, everybody. Good morning. One big picture question, just following up on that normalization effect. Given that -- and the structural changes to the balance sheet given LCR and some of these intersecting points between that path to growth and rates, do you still see a path that long-term 1.6-1.9 ROA is achievable? And is there anything that has happened over the last couple of years that would prevent the company from getting back to that point as you look further ahead? Richard Davis : I'm quite bullish that is not a problem, we will get there because the income will be so much higher. The ROE well for ever be lower for all banks based on the requirements that have been placed in this new world for higher capital and that's the e part of the equation. But the ROE is really a function, just how much money we can make and the quality which we do and that is no one is really taken that from us as long as consumers and business needs banks and use us and I have ever reason things that 1.6 to 1.9 ranges quite still reasonable and I think for our ROE, the 16 to 19 lower not there yet will also find its way through our normal standards and I think also think it will be at the high end of the peer group. So we\u2019re sticking with those numbers, they are not evidential the day but I think at a year or more two you will see them again very quickly. Ken Usdin : Okay, got you. And then on a short-term question, just on mortgage banking, can you talk a little bit about the drivers of the really strong gain on sale margins and whether they are sustainable? And then also, if you have it, just the mix purchase refi in both the volume and the apps? Kathy Rogers : This is Kathy, well I will go ahead and start with the - just the mix of the volume. So, as, in quarter four, we were kind of in that purchases versus refi kind of 70 percent purchase, 30 percent refi. We did as rate started coming down, we did see a shift of that into the first quarter probably in that more closure to that 55, 44 so we did see a little bit of a pick up and the refis, we look out, we still see volumes increasing, we would expect to see seasonal impacts related to second quarter people , should go out or probably will be out buying and we would think, that we would start to see a little bit of shift back to purchase versus refi markets. And I think if we think about the rates, as you know kind of our margins have been up on a linked quarter basis about 10 basis points year-over-year about 28 basis points and I would think that has we look to quarter two, we would expect to see that trend be slightly increasing margins. Ken Usdin : Okay, great. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald of Sanford Bernstein. John McDonald : Hi, good morning, Richard. Question on the CCAR. You've been a leader in payout and cap returns for the last couple years. That said, the magnitude of your requested increase in dividends and buybacks this year was a little less than the Street was expecting and relative to peer increases. Did you look at the results and kind of feel like, wow, I left some money on the table or we were conservative here, particularly on the dividend payout? Maybe just some thoughts on what you were thinking as you went through the request and kind of how you felt when you looked afterwards? Richard Davis : Yeah, that\u2019s a really fair question. I had no regrets after I read everybody\u2019s but I did studied hard as you would expect we would, let me put this way and just in my just be\u2013 philosophy but until interest rates start to move again and we have a higher sense of control over the final outcomes that we provide you guys. It didn\u2019t seem reasonable to me and had nothing to do with the fact that we should increase our dividend above that 30%, 31% level, until which time we had more control. So you\u2019ll never hear on this call that we\u2019re going to wave our ability to create outcomes because something else is changing our future like interest rates. We has to manage to it but it does take away our ability to be certain that we have control over the bottom line and this whole discussion today about when interest rates move, its torture for us but at the same time, I haven\u2019t stretch so hard that I have to worry that something doesn\u2019t go like we hope to, - that the company is now over expending or that I miss my opportunity to work with the fact to exceed that 30%. Another way to say it is, I\u2019m prepared to as effect from more than 30% on dividends, what I feel that we got to control over the profit we put together in October and like in the old days, it\u2019s highly deliverable in the next year solely based on our execution not on somebody\u2019s else decision on when the rights move. So, that\u2019s where you are seeing as a company that is conservative to control its own destiny and not wanted to send signals and tell that we can confirm it. I would not have asked for more than 30%, 31% and in terms of buy backs that will probably be the other place you\u2019ll see us extending ourselves a little further because we do have control over that, we can shut them up if we need to. And so at the end of the day you probably will see our buybacks go up a little more than our dividend request double and I think as soon as we get that confident that we have the control of the entire company like we want you\u2019re going to see us to be a little more aggressive. But for now, I\u2019m satisfied with where we are and actually quite pleased with how this has moved out nice and slow and predictable, repeatable. I think our shareholders at least can count on a steady state return and that\u2019s what I promise them. John McDonald : Okay, thanks. That's very clear and fair. On that point about the controllable/non-controllable, you mentioned that you've got the plan for a modest positive operating leverage, but it could get tough if you don't get the midyear rate hike. What is the debate that you have there? It sounds like you don't want to cut too much and cut into muscle. Do you have some kind of break the glass program to use? This is going to be longer than we thought? Is there room on deposit funding costs or other expenses even though you are already pretty lean where you can pull and try to get this balance right? Richard Davis : That is the dilemma, right, broken glass. And so we've never invited a third party to come and tell us how to watch our expenses. We have never created a special campaign and named it tell people that they are going to lose their job and stop with that. We are not going to do that and I am not. Maybe it is the effect of being in this for eight years but what I like to do is have gone through this whole recession and not have had to do that because I just can\u2019t describe to you the impact of execution when the employees trust the company and trust that they are going to be safe. It\u2019s just its remarkable. So I rather have 67,000 people here who feel really good about their job and the company that has their back through the tough times that has 69,500 we're at any time 2,500 wonder if they are going to lose their job and the other 67,000 wonder if they are the next. So, I can\u2019t explain that very well as a CEO, its almost, we will have somebody to try to write a book on it but that\u2019s really important to me and this team into this board. If you told me interest rates are going to be flat for the next three years, I believe that to be the case, we do have the broken glass scenario. It would be reduction in force. It would be a very aggressive but thoughtful, precise reduction in people and in expenses and things that honestly you would know would impair the near term and long term but you would have to do it to get to the other side. I\u2019m hardly convinced after this eight years of recession that we're going to get interest rates to move again. I do believe it\u2019s worth hanging on. So, I will give you my Richard Davis dorky way of thinking about it. Remember in high school, the bar hang, the bar hang was a test we have to take for the President's Fitness Award. The bar hang was 90 seconds on the bar and if you remembered it all, the last 10 seconds were a torture. But they were equal to the exact same value as the first ten second which were nothing. And I feel like we are here at the last 10 seconds and this company is going to hang on longer than anybody and it is torture but I want to do it for the right reasons because in two years and four years and six years, you guys are all going to be asking how we are doing in a positive environment with a great economy and I want to harken back to times like this and say, we gave up a 10 year to a near term profit in order to be able to say to you here in the future that we are amazing company doing as well in great times as we did in the tough time. So that is the discussion around the table and I am holding up for your advice not to do any reduction in force so that we can have a great future while watching every penny which you know we have done for years that we do have expected extended this point in time. It\u2019s tough. John McDonald : All right, well, keep hanging and thank you. Richard Davis : Well thank you. Good one. I should have violins in the back too - John McDonald : Better than pull ups. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo of CLSA. Mike Mayo : Hi. How much did the low tax rate help this quarter? Kathy Rogers : Mike, that helped us this quarter by about a penny. Mike Mayo : Okay, so I guess versus consensus you would have been a penny short or maybe there are some offsets to that. But if you were a penny short, then what are some of the risks that you are not taking that might have held back your earnings? Richard, you just mentioned the bar hang and 67,000 people who will be more productive over the next 5 to 10 years because they don't have to worry about a strategy of the day. But in addition to that, what else are you doing that might hold back earnings now for the benefit of the future? Richard Davis : To tell people, people because I\u2019ve got all the other expenses quite well aligned, our compliance cost are still at the high point but they\u2019re not getting higher because we manage that and we\u2019re moving through the momentary stages of some of these creation of the compliance groups, the order functions and even the first-line defense in the lines of business. There is no expenses that we\u2019re not watching and haven\u2019t and there is really no other activity but FTE paying people fairly and compensating them well.  So Mike that\u2019s and following John\u2019s question they are perfect back to back, it would be simply around sitting on the table and say we cut people and we simply don\u2019t want to do that. So that\u2019s all we\u2019re doing is asking them to work harder, your decision is whether or not we\u2019ve got enough of a good culture here that our people will work harder, they will sustain it and they will do better than others and that\u2019s good enough and otherwise you can challenge the fact that I either should be taking a reduction of \u2013 or that should be adding a bunch of people and taking hits from you guys for having really negative operating leverage and I\u2019m not doing that either, it is kind of right down the middle. But we\u2019re not withholding on anything else that would cause us to be unable to deliver on everything we said we would in tough and especially in good times. Mike Mayo : I guess I am stuck on that last 10 seconds of the 90-second bar hang. And sometimes, especially as you get older, I am finding this out, it makes sense just to let go, so --. Richard Davis : This is funny because last night I told my wife, what I was going to say if this came up at some \u2013 talking to this stupid bar hang, what you will think and she smiled and she turned around and she said and just a record tell them you actually hung on for two minutes. So the fact is this company can hang on past the 90 seconds, we can. We are not all actually ready to roll. But it\u2019s tough always I was trying to say not that we are about to follow, it just gets really tough and as long as you know that it\u2019s the gut that carries you through the stuff and the best companies and our business are going to be the ones who have the will and the ability and the trust to get through it. I\u2019m just convinced it again the book on the right but it\u2019s that degree spirit of a company acting like a person that believes anything is possible and delivering it with the certain level of pride. But I\u2018ve got nothing more to show you forward. Mike Mayo : Last follow-up on this Richard Davis versus the 10 year bond? Richard Davis : Yes. I thought that. I stop a minute, it\u2019s down 25 basis points since we last talked, it has fallen below two but go ahead ask your question? Mike Mayo : Well no, just the quarterly update. Seems like you're feeling better about the economy, but we are still waiting for it. Is -- what -- how -- do you feel better than last quarter about the economy, or are we just all still waiting here? Richard Davis : John\u2019s question is very beginning exactly I feel better about the economy, I did 90 days ago, I can see that it\u2019s not better for banking in the near term. It is that simple and when rates move up, I am going to love the economy and I\u2019m going to love the Fed, I am going to love our future. But right now I think the economy is really that strong, record stock market performance, Europe is coming back, we have got customers \u2013 cash all over the place, they have got money in their pocket because fuel prices are down and they don\u2019t need bankers much as they are going to need us. So we just want to keep them all, it is happy customers and we will be there when they are ready but right now we are probably on the low end of their need to get through the day priorities and for that it\u2019s not correlated, a great strong economy and improving economy is not necessary good for banks until rates start to kick in. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Paul Miller of FBR. Paul Miller : Hey, can you talk a little bit about -- because you've got some of the best, I think, mobile apps out there and how -- and everybody is seeing mobile banking really pick up especially with the new accounts. How do you see the mobile banking, online banking in your branch system work together? Richard Davis : I will go first and have Andy jump in, you know I were really good in mobile banking is because we\u2019re great in mobile payments and I take into out much that matters and I actually wouldn\u2019t know if I had a bank that didn\u2019t have this large payments, I would just, I would know what I don\u2019t know. We have a thing called the grove, grove down in Atlanta where we have our payments group it is hundreds of people is that they are going to do nothing but work on merchants and consumer paradigms and modules on how to change the way they move money around. And it\u2019s a ton of customer who is up for lot of money we spend and by the way I haven\u2019t taken that out all of our forecast but because we have merchants who work with us to create better mobile apps, the net transfers backwards to mobile banking because mobile banking is just kind of a mini app to people moving money intrabank and between them and merchants and the merchants are really the smart ones that had a good stuff and sold and stuff moved about. So that is one of the reasons we\u2019re so good at it and because we have people in house that are focused on something even greater than that. And I\u2019m kind of excited to showcase that particularly high at our next investor meeting little over a year from now. So that is one of the reasons we do well, it relates to the branch staying there or the benefactors of that and Andy you might carry on. Andy Cecere : In addition to why Richard said, I would mention that the other key aspect of this is making sure the branch is working together with the mobile payments and mobile banking side of the equation. So they\u2019re working as one, so the seamless delivery of transactions and products and the ability to buy or sell looking at it from the perspective of a customer and if they start something on mobile, want to finish it the branch or vice versa that we\u2019re all in sync in terms of the process from a customer\u2019s perspective. And Paul I appreciate bring it up because most of you guys live on East Coast and bank on East Coast and you actually don\u2019t get to experience us so there is not a branch down the street that I can send you to or you don\u2019t just walk, buy and see whatever our current collateral is but if you all want to come online and take a look at it, it\u2019s really, really good stuff and it would be our pleasure to have you experience us through a more mobile approach than just perhaps the old brick and mortar. Paul Miller : Well, I know we've seen when somebody comes up with a really cool mobile app, it's copied very quickly. But one of the things that you have that I have not seen anybody else have is the automatic bill pay app. Is that just because you work with the merchants so close you are able to develop it? Do you think other people will be able to develop that same product? Andy Cecere : I think it gets back to what Richard talked about which is our R&D and looking at different aspects of what we can do on a mobile app and what we can do in a branch and what people can do at home and then doing in ATM and trying to make everything as convenient as possible and as a cross channel as possible as we can. Paul Miller : Okay guys. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Nomura. Bill Carcache : Good morning. Thank you. Richard, I had a follow-up on your comments about rate increases and positive operating leverage. To the extent that the frequency and magnitude of rate increases came in lower than what the market currently expects, do you have a sense for how much of an increase you would need to see to achieve operating leverage? Maybe if you could just give us a sense of whether you have kind of run through the math and what that breakpoint is? Richard Davis : Yes I\u2019m pretty transparent, we expect it to increase starting in June, June, July, September, December 25 each, if that doesn\u2019t happen you can back into our math and do a pretty quick calc and that flows down and moves pay to September and only one in December which is now the prevailing view that will put pressure on our positive operating leverage. I have no idea what the next nine months of this year going to be, they will be very, very tough will be very close to flat or even slightly negative and that would be where I get back around the table like John and Mike talked and sit down the group and say does that enough of the reason for us to carry favor with the investment community to try to be positive from one year which you may or may not remember in order to do something draconian or do I take my lumpsum, have you guys little disappointed but understand why we had a slight negative operating leverage to live to fight next year when things will be highly positive. I will probably go to the latter but I will promise you - conversation and every time there is an adjustment we will see the impacts and decide whether or not it\u2019s worthy of taking a near term or longer term view. Bill Carcache : Understood. That's very clear. Thank you. If we look at your loan growth -- on a separate topic -- on a year-over-year basis to take out seasonality, the growth in residential mortgage in particular has been decelerating for about nine quarters and turned negative this quarter. And I think we are kind of -- by looking at it year-over-year, we would strip out seasonality. So I'm not sure like some of the comments about weather and stuff would really play a role. I was hoping maybe you could talk a little more specifically about your outlook there and address how you are thinking about that deceleration and what gives you confidence going forward in the resumption of growth in that area in particular. Andy Cecere : Bill this is Andy, the principal reason for that decline is our smart refinance product that is a branch originated high quality refinance product that has been shrinking because refinance volumes were coming down throughout the year as rates were not moving down as rapidly. The pipeline for that right now is little stronger because of what we saw in the first quarter, so I think you will start to see a little bit of an uptick certainly done a downtick in that category in the future quarter and then the other wildcard in the overall category is home equity loans as I mentioned in the retail category which we\u2019re seeing strong growth and strong pipelines. Bill Carcache : Excellent thanks very much and I appreciate it. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush of NAB Research. Nancy Bush : Good morning. Sorry I came into the call late. Another of your competitors' call ran way over, but --. Andy Cecere : No matter what you say I am going to say we already answered it. Nancy Bush : No you are not going to get away with that. Andy Cecere : All right, I will try. Nancy Bush : Yes, one of your competitors just did a material purchase of CRE loans from GE Capital and it looks like GE Capital is going to be the gift that keeps on giving. So I am wondering if you have any appetite for that or if you are looking in other places for portfolios of loans? Andy Cecere : Yes and yes. More than I have in the past because if I can\u2019t deploy it in normal course, then I have got deposits, I honestly love and tell that but don\u2019t know what to do as the answer is yes to both. GE is way too early to know until they get out some RFPs and take a look at what pieces particularly leasing would be of interest to us as we look at our big equipment financing business that we have here in the company and there are other portfolios that we would be interested in defending that could be credit card portfolios, it could be high quality auto portfolios but it\u2019s got to be something that we do already. It has got to be underwritten qualities that we would do ourselves and if we do something of any size, we are going to spend more time and due-diligence will be a nightmare for whoever it is because we want to due diligence likely underwrite it ourselves and if we can\u2019t get that level of comfort. I will pass all day long because I really don\u2019t need to introduce anybody else\u2019s problems into our otherwise high credit quality but my appetite is definitely higher based on the lack of alternatives on how to deploy both the deposit growth we have and capital that we are starting out to build. Nancy Bush : And given the portfolios that you may be seeing right now, is the pricing attractive? We're still scratching our heads over that. Andy Cecere : That\u2019s a good question in fact as we put our student loan portfolio out for sale, they are attractive to us because there is a market out to the people who want to pay a premium it seems for something that we have less value for. So I do think that it\u2019s going to be the expensive proposition if you don\u2019t get it the right way and if you don\u2019t due diligence and underwrite it properly for potential risk as we all think the world we have today is a good proxy for how loans will perform. So I think, I think it\u2019s going to be rough tough to find something you like at the right value and that\u2019s why we won\u2019t overpay either and that is one of the reasons we are attracted at this moment to put our portfolios, student loans out for sale because there seems to be a fairly robust level of interest and premium out there that will take. So it may just come down the fact that will look but we won\u2019t like the pricing will step away anyway. Nancy Bush : Yes, and just a final note on that. It looks like the deal that Wells Fargo did was something of a joint venture with Blackstone. Are you seeing other private equity pools or whatever out there that you might want to do some kind of similar transaction with? Andy Cecere : I don\u2019t know their deal but no we don\u2019t like partners. We are not great good partner. We want to own it, we want to control it, and with third party particularly, third party in every way now in banking has become an intensely added risk. It is like more than a two. So anything we do with the third party we have to operate it though we have full control, we have to have information that allows us to have full control and then if you don\u2019t have full control even if you have all the information, it is a whole lot less rewarding when something happens you are not absolutely able to predict. So for us probably not. Nancy Bush : Okay. Thank you. Andy Cecere : Thanks Nancy and by the way we have not answered that question. Operator : There are no further questions. Richard Davis : Perfect thanks, operator. Sean O'Connor: Thanks for joining our call this morning. And if you have any follow-up questions please contact me this afternoon. Thank you. Richard Davis : Thanks everybody. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Following a review of the results by Richard Davis, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathy Rogers, U.S. Bancorp's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today approximately noon, Eastern Daylight Time through Wednesday, July 22 at 12 AM midnight, Eastern Daylight Time. I will now turn the conference call over to Sean O'Connor, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. Sean O'Connor - Senior Vice President and Director of Investor Relations : Thank you, Kalea, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Kathy Rogers, Andy Cecere and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's second quarter 2015 results and answer your questions. Richard and Kathy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page two of today's presentation, in our press release, and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Richard. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Sean. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I will begin with our review with U.S. Bank's results as a summary of the quarter's highlights are available on page three of the presentation. U.S. Bank reported net income of $1.5 billion for the second quarter of 2015, or a record $0.80 per diluted common share, a 2.6% increase year-over-year. Total average loans grew 4% year-over-year and 0.7% linked quarter, excluding student loans, which were reclassified to held for sale at the end of the first quarter. In addition, we continue to experience strong growth in total average deposits of 8.9% over the prior year and 2.6% linked quarter. Net new DDA account growth was especially strong this quarter, growing 4% annualized. Credit quality remains strong. Total net charge-offs decreased by 15.2% from the prior year and increased modestly from the previous quarter. The increase from the previous quarter is a result of lower recoveries. Total non-performing assets declined compared to both the prior year quarter and on a linked quarter basis. We continue to generate significant capital this quarter. Our common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the Basel III standardized approach as if fully implemented was 9.2% at June 30. I'm also pleased that we were able to return 76% of our earnings to shareholders in the second quarter through a combination of our dividend and the repurchase of 14 million shares of common stock. Slide four provides you with a five quarter history of our performance metrics. And they continue to be among the best in the industry. Return on average assets in the second quarter was 1.46%. Our return on average common equity was 14.3%. Moving over to the graph on the right, you can see that this quarter's net interest margin was 3.03%. Kathy will discuss the margin in more detail in a few minutes. Our efficiency ratio for the second quarter was 53.2%, lower than the prior quarter. We expect this ratio to remain in the low-50%s going forward as we continue to manage expenses in relation to revenue trends driven by the economic environment while continuing to invest in and grow our business. Turning to slide five, the company reported total net revenue in the second quarter of $5 billion, a 2.8% decline from the prior year. Excluding the prior year notable item, total net revenue increased 1.4%. The increase was due to the higher net interest income as well as strong growth in trust and investment management fees, merchant processing services and higher credit and debit card revenue, partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenue. I'm particularly pleased with the improving trends in our payments business, especially our merchant and credit card businesses, which Kathy will discuss in later detail. Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on slide six. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $9 billion or 4% year-over-year and 0.7% linked quarter, excluding student loans which were reclassified to held-for-sale at the end of the first quarter. Again this quarter, the increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans, which grew by 11% year-over-year and 2.1% over the prior quarter. Total average revolving commercial and commercial real estate commitments continue to grow at a fast pace, increasing year-over-year by 10.5% and 2% on a linked quarter basis. Line utilization was relatively flat in the second quarter. Residential mortgages declined 1.4% year-over-year and 0.6% on a linked quarter basis. Average credit card loans increased 1.3% year-over-year and were seasonally lower on a linked quarter basis. Total other retail loans grew 5.7% year-over-year and 1.7% over the prior quarter excluding student loans. The increase was mainly driven by steady growth in auto loans and continued positive momentum in the home equity loans, which grew 4.1% year-over-year. We expect average linked quarter loan growth to be back in the 1% to 1.5% range in the third quarter. Total average deposits increased $23 billion or 8.9% over the same quarter of last year and 2.6% over the previous quarter. Growth in low-cost interest checking, money market and savings deposits was particularly strong on a year-over-year basis. Turning to slide seven and credit quality, total net charge-offs declined 15.2% on a year-over-year basis and increased 6.1% from the previous quarter. The linked quarter increase resulted from lower recoveries. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 48 basis points in the second quarter. Non-performing assets decreased by 7% on a linked quarter basis and 18.8% from the second quarter of 2014. During the second quarter, we released $15 million of reserves, equal to the prior quarter, and $10 million less than the second quarter of 2014. Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we currently expect the level of net charge-offs and total non-performing assets to remain relatively stable in the third quarter of 2015. Kathy will now give you a few more details about our second quarter results. Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Richard. Slide eight gives you a view of our second quarter 2015 results versus comparable time periods. Our diluted EPS of $0.80 was 2.6% higher than the second quarter of 2014 and 5.3% higher than the prior quarter. The second quarter of 2014 included two previously disclosed notable items impacting other non-interest income and other non-interest expense that together had no impact on diluted EPS. The $12 million or 0.8% decrease in net income year-over-year was principally due to a reduction in net interest income related to the previously discussed wind-down of our checking account advance product that ended in the second quarter 2014, lower mortgage banking revenue primarily due to an unfavorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights net of hedging activities, and an expected increase in non-interest expense excluding the prior year notable items. Partially offsetting these variances was a decline in the provision for credit losses. On a linked quarter basis, net income was higher by $52 million or 3.6% mainly due to increases in fee-based revenue. Turning to slide nine, net interest income increased year-over-year by $26 million or 0.9%. The increase was a result of growth in average earning assets of 9.1%, partially offset by lower net interest margin including lower loan fees. Approximately $40 million of the reduction in loan fees was due to the checking account advance product wind-down. The net interest margin of 3.03% was 24 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2014. The decline was primarily due to growth in the investment portfolio at lower average rates, as well as lower reinvestment rates on investment securities, lower loan fees due to the checking account advance product wind-down, lower rates on new loans and a change in loan portfolio mix, partially offset by lower funding costs. Net interest income was higher linked quarter principally due to an additional day in the current quarter relative to the prior quarter with higher average earning assets, offset by a lower net interest margin. The net interest margin of 3.03% was 5 basis points lower than the first quarter. The reduction in the net interest margin was principally due to continued change in loan portfolio mix, the impact of higher cash balances as a result of continued deposit growth along with growth in lower rate investment securities and lower investment portfolio reinvestment rates. We expect that the net interest margin will be relatively stable in the third quarter. Slide 10 highlights non-interest income, which declined $172 million or 7.0% year-over-year. Excluding the second quarter 2014 notable item, non-interest income increased year-over-year. We saw strong growth in trust and investment management fees and merchant processing services as well as higher credit and debit card revenue. As Richard mentioned, we are pleased with the improving growth trends in our merchant and retail card businesses. Merchant processing revenue, while up 2.9%, was negatively impacted by foreign currency rate changes. Excluding this impact, merchant processing fees grew approximately 7.6% on a year-over-year basis. This growth compared to approximately 5% year-over-year in the first quarter. Retail credit and debit card fees grew 2.7% on a year-over-year basis compared to 0.8% year-over-year in the first quarter. Credit and debit card volumes grew 7% in the second quarter. Retail credit and debit card fees continued to be negatively impacted on a year-over-year basis by the cost of rewards that were increasing in 2014. As we previously mentioned, we would expect this negative impact to dissipate in the second half of the year. Partially offsetting these favorable variances was a $47 million decrease in mortgage banking revenue primarily due to an unfavorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights, net of hedging activities, which more than offset higher origination and sales revenue earned from the 34% increase in application volume. On a linked quarter basis, non-interest income was higher by $118 million or 5.5% principally due to seasonally higher fee revenue, and credit and debit card revenue, merchant processing services, and deposit service charges in addition to higher trust and investment management fees. Moving to slide 11, non-interest expense decreased year-over-year by $71 million or 2.6%. Excluding the second quarter 2014 notable item, non-interest income increased 5.1% year-over-year. The increase was mainly due to higher compensation expense reflecting the impact of merit increases, acquisitions, and higher staffing for risk and compliance activities and increased employee benefit expense mainly due to higher pension costs. On a linked quarter basis, non-interest income (sic) [non-interest expense] increased by $17 million or 0.6%. The increase is primarily due to increases in professional services due to mortgage servicing and compliance related matters, marketing and business development due to the timing of various marketing programs and compensation expense, principally reflecting the impact of merit increases. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in employee benefits expense, primarily resulting from the seasonally lower payroll taxes, and a decrease in other expenses mostly due to insurance-related recoveries. Prudent expense management remains a priority for our company. For example, our decision to hold FTE flat except for compliance needs in place since the beginning of 2014 remains in place today. We also continue to manage other discretionary expenses where appropriate, while continuing to make investments in businesses and products that will yield a high level of return. This philosophy is and has been a strength in how we manage our company and this focus will continue going forward. Turning to slide 12, our capital position remains strong. Our common equity tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as if fully implemented at June 30 was 9.2%. At 9.2%, we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. Our tangible book value per share rose to $16.79 at June 30, representing a 10% increase over the same quarter of last year, and a 1.8% increase over the prior quarter. Our return on tangible common equity was 20% for the second quarter. Turning to slide 13. In June, the board of directors declared a 4.1% increase in our common stock dividend. As a result, in the second quarter, we returned 76% of our earnings to shareholders. Dividends accounted for 32% of the return to shareholders, and the 14 million shares of stock we repurchased in the second quarter accounted for the remaining 44%. I will now turn the call back to Richard. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Kathy. I'm very proud of our second quarter results. We delivered solid financial performance in a challenging operating environment for financial institutions. We continued to achieve industry-leading performance measures. Because of the overall strength and consistency of our results, we returned 76% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks in the second quarter. As we move to the second half of 2015, I'm confident we will continue to deliver solid financial results. We'll continue to take the appropriate and effective actions including tighter expense management to ensure that we are meeting our value creation objectives for our customers and for our shareholders. That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Kathy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer your questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom of RBC Capital Markets. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Jon. Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Hey, Jon. Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Just a question on your last comment, Richard, you used the term tighter on expense management. Does that mean you're a little less optimistic on the revenue outlook or is it just basically a similar approach? Has anything changed? Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, yeah, I'm actually more optimistic on the revenue for the second half because things have turned the corner and I think you'll see, with NIM flattening out, with loan growth now, as I'm committing to well, at the 1% or higher because I can see already see that for quarter three, and the knowledge that our mortgages business is \u2013 the balance sheet is growing again, I think we are feeling quite good about revenue. What I'm still waiting for is the interest rate impact that would occur if the Fed increases rates. So if they don't, we're going to continue to put \u2013 keep in place this FTE hold we've had now for, as Kathy said, a year-and-a-half. That's worth, by the way, thousands of FTE that we haven't added and therefore we haven't had to talk about reducing either. And then all the discretionary things that we continue to do to keep ourselves at the efficiency level you come to expect. So revenues actually got a nice trajectory in the second half. Expenses will come down as we watch our nickels and dimes, but I will tell you the cost of compliance has erased a lot of the benefits I would otherwise hope to have gotten a year-and-a-half ago when we started this as we've continued to add the compliance personnel, audit personnel, and not just in those areas but in the front line where we have that same compliance responsibility that's gone up substantially. But expenses we'll continue to watch, Jon, like I promised. And I've always said that if we have to be more draconian, we will, but the FTE hold and watching our vacancies and things has served us pretty well so far. Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Good. And then I guess one of the items you singled out in growth was the corporate business, and that seems to have been driving the growth. Talk to us a little bit about what's going on there; is this large corporate driving it? Or is it broader based? Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, it's way broader based. So in fact, much as I like the 2.1% linked quarter in C&I, that's one of our lowest quarters in the last six quarters and I'm actually kind of satisfied with that because we're now getting competing growth from the retail consumer side, which is what we've been long waiting for and that's why, one of our reasons we can say that the margin will start to flatten out because the mix will start to be balanced. So commercial business, the bond markets are driving balance reductions, because people are driving to the bond market, and so to still get 2.1% linked quarter means we're doing real business for real customers that have other needs that aren't just M&A related. We also see that more opportunity for us in the fee business given our involvement in that M&A market on the capital market side, which we didn't have, as you know, a few years ago. So that's a kind of twofer for us; if we can't get it in loan growth, we'll get it in fees. Syndication loan market is really strong. If you notice, we were in the top four on the investment grade league table this quarter. It's our first time we've broken into the top four, so we're seeing that as a business for us that's starting to pay dividends that we invested in a few years ago. So C&I is strong. Commercial real estate, that's not as strong. That's more flat for us; it was last quarter and it's going to be just slightly up in quarter three. We're okay with that because I've told you before, we see that as a market that can get overheated in the micro-market, so we're very careful in particular in where we do business. The coasts are doing the best based on the growth that's present and I think where some of the job growth, say, Atlanta, Denver, is driving new interest in office space and things like that. Construction is primarily apartments and office, not so much retail yet, but we are seeing a lot of that construction on the smaller end being done by cash, which is fine because we've been long saying that the first step towards a bank's balance sheet improvement is cash moving out of here to be used for growth, then lines of credit being used for growth, then new lines and loans being brought onto the balance sheet; and we're still in that first phase from what I can see. And then finally, Jon, bringing a little more color on loans altogether, the consumer side is doing quite nicely. Our auto loans are up 10% over the first quarter, and that's on a backdrop of a very strong auto market, as you have seen now, the projections continue to be very strong. And then our home equity, as I mentioned in my comments, are also strong. That's up 4.1%. And interestingly enough, these accounts are now coming at larger line sizes; people are using their home equity for home improvement and home repairs, some debt consolidation, but mostly improving the property. And they're using the balances now more than they did even a year ago. So we're starting to see some nick uptick. And you know we don't have that home equity bubble at the bank here that a lot of companies do, so we're not trying to offset that runoff. And then maybe lastly, because we brought it up last quarter, we did see some improvement in our balance sheet on the mortgage side. As you'll recall, on the jumbo mortgages, we agreed to become a little more market competitive on price. And in the last month of the second quarter, we saw the balance sheet starting to grow again and we hope that that will pursue itself into quarter three. It has a lot to do with what rates do, but our purchase to refi right now is 70/30 in the mortgage business. And if we can continue to get back to where that mortgage balance sheet is growing, at least slightly, that helps our total loan growth get back into that 1% to 1.5% range. Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Good. Then you're saying you already have some visibility for a bit better growth in Q3? Okay. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We do. And a lot of that is \u2013 or I wouldn't be so strong in predicating that for you. Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thank you. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Scott. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Good Morning, guys. Let's see, Richard or Kathy, I was hoping you could add a little to your response on the expense side in Jon's question there a second ago. Richard, are you suggesting that we're kind of at a high watermark for expense? I believe you said expenses would come down. I guess I'm just curious without doing something more draconian, where are they going to come down from? And just as we look out in the third quarter, I guess, you have between the \u2013 I think there was a vender reimbursement and then the insurance recovery about a cumulative $35 million or so of headwind, so where does that come out of and what's sort of that near-term outlook on that cost side? Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. So I'm going to call it more flattish. It's going to be close to what you see now, if anything \u2013 it's not coming down, so let's put it that way. But I don't see any material increases either. What's happening here is the cost of compliance is at its high watermark. As you know, we are a part of that mortgage foreclosure activity that we've extended and that's going to continue to cost us and we will continue to add compliance and audit in virtually every part of the company. So that's in there. Things that will come down to offset those headwinds are continued discretionary expense control that we just never talk about here. I mean we don't have a name for it. We don't bring people to tell us how to do it. We've got a real heavy tight rein right now on discretionary expenses, marketing, travel, things that are less necessary. And from FTE being flat for a year and a half and still doing quite well to taking things like vacancies, extending vacancies, moving those up and being very prudent about how we manage the quality of our people. So I may have mentioned last time that we're also getting a pretty thorough review of our low performing employees in the company. Since FTE needs to be flat, you have your right to use your FTE but you better have the best you can. So I am encouraging people to improve the bottom performers and trade them out and get the best quality staff we can as this recovery is about to hit us. So we can keep all that in general check. With revenue moving up, that's going to help our efficiency for sure. But I don't want to leave with fact we're going to take expenses down but I think they're at a place that you can watch for and a slightly potential increase over the next couple of quarters only because of the cost of compliance if I can't out run it with vacancies. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay. And that's perfect. Thank you. And then maybe if I could switch gears for just a second, could you maybe expand upon the thoughts you had in your prepared remarks just in the payments businesses, just trying to distinguish how much of the better performance this quarter was the typical seasonal boost versus what I kind of interpret it as sort of a more \u2013 kind of more constructive commentary about how those businesses are going just... Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. You heard it right. I'm going to give Kathy the detail, but I want to say, last quarter, the payments businesses weren't that robust. In part, by the way, it was the FX which is hard to describe. It sounds like an excuse, but in other companies, it's a real impact and then it affects us in this one category. But under a line, we saw everything get much stronger and we really like the second half for payments as we get into the second quarter's look back now as it's improved from quarter one. But, Kathy, bring some color to that. Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. I think, as Richard said, we were very pleased with what we saw in our momentum in the payments businesses. If you think about our merchant processing, I'll start there, I think that's one of our better stories right now. In the first quarter, if you take out the impact of FX, we grew about 5%. As we look into second quarter, that number grew to about 7.5%. Same-store sales were kind of in that in the North American market in about that 5.5% range. And I think that \u2013 so we are seeing some additional growth there that we think will continue as we look forward. Our credit and debit card fees were also, we saw momentum there. We've been talking about the fact that rewards costs have been a headwind for us and that was absolutely true. In the first quarter, as you recall, we had a year-over-year growth of 0.9%. This year, you will see that growth increasing. So that headwind is diminishing and as we get into the later quarters, I would expect to even see more improvement as that continues to diminish in the second half of the year. So we are very pleased with the momentum there and would expect to see some good signs of this as we look out into future quarters. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay. That's perfect. Thank you, guys, for the color. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Your next question is from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, John. Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Hey, John. John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC : Good morning. Just on the margin. Wanted to see if you can give us a little bit of color on how you're thinking about the margin in coming quarters. Just given the competition on the loan front, could you still see similar mid-single digit compression over the next several quarters? Is that the best way to think about it? Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : John, I'm going to say I think we're starting to see the margin stabilize and I think that's coming from a couple of different reasons. As Richard mentioned earlier, we are starting to see a pickup in our loan growth on the retail side and that's going to help. As you recall, we've been calling out an impact of several basis points on a linked quarter basis related to the mix of our growth. So as retail starts to pick up, that's going to help us. Additionally, what we are seeing is that as loans and securities run off and we're replacing them with new, that spread between what's running off and coming on is starting to get a little closer together, so \u2013 or getting smaller. So that's going to help us as well. So I think, as I look out into the third quarter, I'm going to call that our net interest margin is going to be relatively stable. John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC : Right. I guess, what I should \u2013 the way I should have asked it is how do you define relatively stable? Because I think you had alluded to some emerging stability in the past, but we still saw mid-single digit compression. So... Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Actually \u2013 okay, so, John, we actually never did say we're stable. We were super transparent and always said it would be 3 basis points to 5 basis points or 3 basis points to 6 basis points, and we did mention it by 1 basis point. So stable to us is give or take 1 basis point, maybe 2 basis points, either direction. But right now, we're forecasting this thing to be flat and we could be surprised. But we'll have a chance later in the quarter to update you guys. We tell you exactly what we see as soon as we see it, and we are extremely transparent and clear, so stable means stable. John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Good. Good. All right. And then separately in terms of the deposit side, if you could just give us a little bit of color with what you are seeing there. I mean it was exceptionally strong and surpassed our estimates, particularly around some of the interest-bearing stuff? Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Hi, John, you're absolutely right. It was higher than we saw in quarter two and I will tell you it's just continued growth across all business lines. I can't call out any particular business that had higher growth than the other. We had \u2013 we just continue to see strong growth in our wholesale, our consumer and our trust businesses. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : It's a great problem, right? And we're not sending deposits out. We're also not rationalizing the number of branches we have. We're just rationalizing what we do in them. So that's probably keeping a lot of deposits, the core stuff. But we all know, in a few quarters or years, that's going to be the gas in the engine for making loans. And so we're going to be pleased with loan growth, deposit growth, even if we're not sure what we can do with it yet. And we'll continue to see that as a sign of more customers, net DDA was as high as it has been in years. We have a lot of new business coming in from our corporate trust, which you know, is a very important part of, 15% of our core deposit. So, it's a good news thing and as much as we are a little surprised ourselves, we're not going to do anything to send it back (28:12). John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Then, Richard, my last thing I just wanted to ask you about was about your updated thoughts on capital deployment, particularly your view of M&A opportunities here as you're looking at opportunities to put your capital to work? Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Sure. We've got this \u2013 we've indicated an interest in the GE Capital, or part of their portfolio and we are in the due diligence with that. So we will keep finding an interest in asset purchases. We're continuing to find payment portfolios that we look at. We like the merchant acquiring space where you've either seen us getting new partners in the domestic, or more even often, you've seen us do it in the international side where we can find a partner and extend into another country and kind of plug-and-play like we do with our payments platform. And then corporate trust, we just had our board meeting a couple weeks ago and we highlighted our European trust business, which is also fund servicing and corporate trust, and they are both quite robust. The market continues to be very receiving of a new player in us being there, and we see a lot of growth opportunities. And that can be both organic and M&A, John. So that's where you're going to see us. Not whole bank transactions \u2013 what you've seen in the last few years is what you'll see in the next couple. And I think that as the tail falls off of what I'll call the statute of limitations of inheriting somebody else's problems from the early years of the recession, as that falls off in a couple of years, we'll probably be back into the game of buying whole companies or looking at whole banks. But for now, that just doesn't suit our appetite. John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC : All right. Thanks for taking the questions. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller of FBR. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Paul. Thomas LeTrent - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Good morning, guys. This is actually Thomas on behalf of Paul. Richard, you talked a little bit about how you've been participating more in the jumbo market lately, I guess, in particular on pricing. What's giving you the confidence to take that leap? And obviously that's helped your consumer growth. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Let's have Andy respond to that, he's got the mortgage business under his leadership. Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer : Good morning, Thomas. You know it's about our customers. So our customers are choosing to go longer in terms of their mortgage product given the low rate and the fixed rate and the 30-year. So they're financing out of either what they have today or variable floating into longer jumbo. We want to serve our customers' needs so we're putting those in our books. They're not coming out as loss, they're just coming out a little thinner spread than what would be historic, but given our low cost of capital as well as our low funding costs, they're still profitable for us. Thomas LeTrent - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Okay. Great. And then I guess one more question sort of on the loan growth, loan growth seems like it's picking up for you guys. Does that mean that more of the reinvestment of sort of the excess deposit growth which has been mentioned was very strong last quarter will go towards the loan side rather than securities? Or can we still expect some investment securities growth as well? Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. I think at this point, what you'll see is, as loans start to increase, that will really help offset the deposit increase, so I think you'll see that. There might be some modest investment security just based on the balance sheet positioning and so forth, but it's really going to be used by deposits \u2013 or loans. The deposit growth will be used by loans. Thomas LeTrent - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Okay. Great. Thank you, guys. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Thomas. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Erika. Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Hi, Erika. Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning. Richard, we asked your peers yesterday what they thought about deposit repricing as we hopefully enter a higher interest rate environment. One said that the deposit betas will be much higher because regulation has given us now classifications of good deposits and bad deposits, while your other peers seem to be more optimistic on deposit beta given that we're coming from zero. What's your view in terms of both the pace and magnitude of pass-through, if we do see the Fed raise rates this year? Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, my \u2013 I'll probably be right in the middle and that's not like me, I like to take a position. But I'll tell you my answer's just a little different. We \u2013 God, we all want this deposit beta to go up because we want that money to be used in some form of growth in the American economy. I mean it really is at record high levels and it's not sustainable. And it has nothing to do with the banks keeping them or losing them, it has everything to do with consumers and businesses using it. So my hope is that there is a early beta take when rates start to move up not because of rates being higher and the cost changing but because that informs the fact that people are now investing and consumers are consuming, so I'm all for that. I do think that marginal beta on companies has a lot to do with what kind of level of relationship they've created with their customers, whereby if people are double banking, triple banking, the core relationship stays with the bank that's established themselves as the core partner. And I also think customers that have established themselves as feeling that they were treated well during this period, especially corporate customers, and felt that the company protected their deposits here, let them stay on the balance sheet if necessary or work them into some money center alternative, I think we'll get credit for the way we handled that over the course of the more challenging times when deposits were less attractive. So I'm going to say the beta is going to be \u2013 I hope it's an early, a bit of an early and abrupt start because people are using it, and then I think that the marginal beta starts to determine the quality of banking relationships you have. And I have to remind you because of our corporate trust, we will have at least 15% of our core deposits are in a different category as much as they're contractual, and they don't have the ability to move at the vagaries of rates or even consumerism, so I think we'll have a slightly better beta no matter what, and probably better than you guys have modeled, given that that's a pretty substantial amount of money as we continue to grow corporate trust. Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : That's a great point. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks for highlighting that. And just, Kathy, as a follow up to Thomas' question, does that mean that your earning asset growth is going to now match your loan growth? Over the past several quarters, it's outpaced your loan growth. And I guess a follow up question to that is could you give us a sense on where you are towards the LCR standard for January 2016? Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Well, let me start with the LCR first. And I will tell you that, at the end of last year, we had met that ratio. So we were fully compliant with LCR at the end of 2014. I will tell you one other aspect of our earning asset growth in addition to investment securities that's held for sale particularly around our mortgage environment, so I think that as you think about total earning asset growth, I think that it will more closely approximate loans going forward, but you'll have to take into account the held for sale activity as \u2013 depending on what the mortgage market does. Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Thank you so much. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Erika. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Bill Carcache of Nomura. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Bill. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Good morning. I had a follow-up question on cards. I've heard a lot of your comments on payments, particularly a lot of items affecting the fee income line, but I was hoping more \u2013 to focus a little bit more on the spread. And it looks like you've been seeing a pretty consistent reduction in year-over-year credit card loan growth over the last several quarters to most recently 1.3% this past quarter. That's a little bit slower relative to the rest of the industry. I was hoping you could just talk a little bit about what \u2013 give a little color around what's driving that and what you anticipate going forward. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Let's have Andy give you a brief color on that. Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer : Sure, Bill. On a quarterly basis, it's down principally due to seasonality, so that is not uncommon from quarter one to quarter two to be down; on a year-over-year basis, it's about 2%. Part of the factor that is impacting that is auto sales, and spend is up closer to 5%, 5.5%. People are paying down more of their balances with perhaps some of the excess they're getting from the fuel side of the equation, so we're seeing pay it down rates being higher, revolve rates being lower, even though sales are up. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And so just looking at the average loans on slide 15 that shows the year-over-year growth, so really we can tell from second quarter 2014 till now that growth rate has been downward. So as we look forward from here, would you expect that kind of similar trajectory or would that pick up a little bit? Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Well, I think, on a linked quarter basis, we would start to think that we're \u2013 we do feel confident we'll be back into that 1% to 1.5% range. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. And then my last question is more on kind of broadly the upcoming interchange rate reductions in Europe, in particular, the capping of debit and credit interchange at 20 basis points and 30 basis points respectively. Can you discuss whether Elavon offers pass-through or bundled pricing to its merchant partners in Europe? Just trying to kind of understand the extent to which you might be able to benefit from the upcoming interchange rate reductions in Europe. Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer : I think for the most part, that interchange impact will not impact Elavon in Europe, so it will \u2013 our rate of revenue will not be impacted by that change. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer : Sure. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Bill. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Ken. Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Hi, Ken. Kenneth Michael Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Hi, guys. First question just on credit, it looks like you had a little lower recovery this quarter, which I would think would be expected at this point, most of the underlying metrics continue to look excellent in terms of delinquencies, NPAs, et cetera. How much room is there do you think just for charge-offs to still decline from here? I know reserve release is pretty much done, but it just looks like the underlying credit still looks quite good. P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman and Chief Risk Officer : Yeah. This is Bill. I think the one area is still in the residential space, so there is still continued improvement there. It's already getting low so the dollars aren't going to be huge at this point. But as you pointed out, the rest of the movement comes through recoveries generally on the wholesale side. Those are sporadic, sometimes they're very strong in one quarter. This quarter, they were a little lighter. Further away we get from the downturn, the fewer of those higher recovery levels we'll have. So I'd say, in general, we're at a good spot and I see a little more improvement on residential mortgage. Kenneth Michael Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Great. Got it. Thanks, Bill. And then secondly, just on \u2013 a question on the mortgage business, obviously, we had a pretty good second quarter and you had a big pump in originations. Just maybe just your general thoughts on the state of your \u2013 the housing market, the mortgage business and the outlook for production there? Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Yes. So as you stated, we had a really good quarter from a year-over-year basis. We grew our app volume about 35%. As we look forward into quarter three, I do think that we'll probably see a decline in our refi balances. So I would expect as we look into quarter three, on a linked quarter basis, our application volumes will be probably down a little bit. I would say from a fee standpoint, we may be \u2013 our fee income might be modestly lower than what it is this quarter, but it's very early in the quarter. It's going to depend a lot on what we see in the rate \u2013 with the rate market and the appetite for purchases. So we'll give you a little bit of \u2013 more heads up on that as we go further into the quarter. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Ken. This is Richard. The applications up 34% in quarter two will show through in quarter three as bookings in some measure so quarter three has a lot to do with paying off quarter two. Quarter three, I think, will be a tale of interesting to watch because we will see what happens as rates start to move or the threat of rates start to move and more on the psychology of the consumer behavior. But I thought you'd find this interesting. I was, a couple of weeks ago, in California with our homebuilder business. They were there for our national conference and we had a large gathering. And I asked them, what interest rate level in terms of a mortgage rate would cause them to worry about the impact of future homebuilding? And they all were comfortable that 200 basis points doesn't move anybody's needle on either the affordability or the belief that they could still get into a home that they want. And that's a pretty nice range of safety for a while because I don't think any of us think rates whenever they do move up are going to move 200 basis points real quick. So that provides me a little confidence that the purchase market by those who actually build and live off of it is feeling pretty strong and they're not typically worried at this stage of rates moving up if they don't move more than 200 basis points. Refi is just typically what you see in the vagaries of whether people still haven't refi'd yet or whether they have a reason to take advantage of a rate they didn't heretofore. So we will learn more. I think this quarter three will tell a big story and probably a month from now, we'll have a really good sense of what the mortgage business looks like, but it's a little early now. Kenneth Michael Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Understood. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio of KBW. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Chris. Chris M. Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hey, Richard. How are you? Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good. Chris M. Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Kathy, how are you this morning? Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Good. Chris M. Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Richard, I just want to \u2013 just, all of my questions I think have been answered, but I do want to just make sure I do a double-check on your thought process on expenses in third quarter. When you talk about flat, I know we've talked about a lot of this beating a dead horse earlier on the call, but the reported expenses of roughly $2.68 billion, it seems to me there is a couple things that you benefited from in the quarter whether it was insurance recovery or reimbursement from a business partnership. When you say flat, is it flat, are you thinking flattish with the reported number of $2.68 billion or should I gross that up for some of the benefits you had in the quarter? And if it is flat, are you thinking it is flat with the reported number, where do you get the offsets from? Is it lower marketing expenses? Is it lower professional services fees that could get you back to that level? Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Chris. I'm really glad for the question because I didn't know it wasn't clear so thank you. It's not taking advantage of the one-time benefits. It's the core. Chris M. Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And so the things that we manage we're going to stick pretty flat to that but you won't get the benefits each quarter unless something comes out of nowhere that we're happy with. So on a reported basis, it will go up slightly. As it does though, it will go up less than it would have if we weren't continuing to put this kibosh on the cost of FTE and the cost of discretionary expenses like marketing and travel and entertainment. So, yeah, it's a good question. It will go up in the second half but it's not material and as much as we're not counting on the other benefits to accrue and if they do, we'll take them and celebrate that. Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer : The other thing that I'd mention, Richard, is the normal seasonality to our tax amortization \u2013 our tax credit business, which again is reflected in our tax rate all year but goes up through the year just normal seasonality and that's probably $30 million to $40 million (43:04). Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : (43:05) the second half. So as Andy is talking about the CDC and so we have expenses up above the line, but we get all the benefits on the taxes below. And if you look at one line item, that's a great reminder that that will be \u2013 you should isolate that and take a look at it. In prior years, it will be just the same as it's been in prior. Chris M. Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Right. So absent the tax issue, which I fully understand, it's more of a \u2013 it should gross up at least to some degree, second quarter expenses from a run rate perspective because of some of the benefits you had? Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That's correct. Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : That's right. Chris M. Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Exactly right. (43:33) Chris M. Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thank you so much, Richard. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Perfect. Thanks, Chris. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker of Compass Point. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Kevin. Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Hey, Kevin. Kevin James Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading LLC : Hey. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on some of the mortgage comments. Are you seeing an increasing amount of demand from consumers or at least incrementally regarding cash out refis or potentially a willingness to increase home equity lines in order to take advantage of higher equity and higher home prices? Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Definitely the latter, right? So as I said, home equity is up 4% and it's \u2013 people are doing mostly home improvement. When I was a young banker in California 30 years ago, we used to call it a PIP, a property improvement and we used to give credit back \u2013 half the credit to the equity or the line itself, because we thought they're improving the collateral as they went. We don't do that anymore but that was the old days when people really used their house to live in it and to keep it for a longer-term and not improve it to flip it. And I think we've got psychology where people are going to live in their houses now and own them as an asset to live in with the hope that they will have some increasing value, use it when they can but not to do it in order to flip it. Debt consolidation for the first time, Kevin, is starting to show up again in home equity, which I guess, it makes sense later in the cycle as people want to reset one more time, but they are much more prudent than they were before. And because the quality of loans we do, we don't do debt consolidation home equity for people who are desperate. They're simply being more efficient in the way they handle their cash flow. Andy might talk to... Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. And somewhat consistent with what we are seeing in housing prices. The average line that we booked in the second quarter was up 7% versus a year ago, and the average balance of our home equity account is up over 10%. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So they are using it. In terms of cash out purchase, not seeing any evidence of that that's materially different than prior quarters. Those with cash are putting it into the house, those without it are still taking the opportunity to refi most of it and some of it with government programs. Kevin James Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading LLC : You see that as a source of growth for you in particular, or the industry in general? Or do you feel like it's going to be something that's going to be lackluster for the next couple of years still? Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I don't know about the industry. I mean, were \u2013 I know this is an outlier for a lot of us. Two reasons. One is because we've been working first position second mortgages for a long, long time. It's been a product we've had for some reason hasn't been matched by most folks. And then I think I mentioned in my comments we also don't have that bubble that we're trying to out-run. If you look at our balance sheet, we don't have a history of being a huge home equity lender at a disparate level. So we don't have a lot to have to refi or rebook. So in this case, we're going to get the benefit of net growth from our activities and our product. So I think we'll be an outlier in a positive way. P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman and Chief Risk Officer : I mean our origination volume on home equity which is primarily all out of our branches has grown substantially over the last few quarters. I mean, we look back a few years ago, we barely do $1 billion, and this past year, we did \u2013 or this past quarter, we did $2 billion. So... Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. It's really... P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman and Chief Risk Officer : It has been a nice steady growth for us and the performance has always been good. So... Kevin James Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading LLC : Yes. You've definitely been an outlier. Thanks for taking my questions. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Thanks, Kevin. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo of CLSA. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Mike. Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : Hey. How are you doing? I got on the call a little late. Hopefully, this wasn't asked, I got the tail end of it. So your 22% annualized fee growth for the quarter, what is a more normal rate as we look ahead? I mean, strong fee quarter obviously, but 22% annualized, there is some items there, where would you guide us? Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Well, first of all... Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, first of all, the question was already asked, and it was a fantastic answer and I'm sorry, you missed it. But we'll be happy to repeat it for you, Mike. Actually, it wasn't asked, so we're happy to answer it. Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Here's what I'd say, Mike. You have to remember, recall, for us, the second quarter is seasonally high because of our payment business and just some deposit service charges. So, I wouldn't think to annualize that quarter. I would look more at it on a year-over-year basis and I would say that we did see \u2013 we saw momentum in our payments businesses. I think that's going to continue. We had strong growth in our trust and investment management fees and I think that we would expect that to continue as well. So I would look at it a little bit more on a year-over-year basis and assume that we'll continue to add some momentum there. Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : And as far as acquisitions, where do you guys stand? The sale from GE or maybe bank acquisitions. Has your appetite changed? Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : It hasn't changed and I did answer that one earlier. GE, we are in due diligence for one part of their portfolio \u2013 who knows? We don't have to have anything here to make it to tomorrow, so we'll just be prudent and take a look at it. We like \u2013 as I said earlier, we like acquisitions of payment companies, we like trust companies, we like overseas a lot because it seems to be an interesting market worth looking further out. Not interested in full bank transactions at this stage and what you have seen in the last few years is what you will see for the next couple. Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : And then lastly, my question, Richard Davis versus the 10-year. Maybe, Richard, you're winning the recent round. I'm not sure. But what's the check on you're feeling about the growth of the U.S. economy? Are we stepping out, or is it kind of same as it's been? Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I think it's same as it has been, which is still slow but steady progress, right? So it's not going backwards. There's no inertia to jump it forward. My long philosophy is the minute it's known that rates are moving up whether they have to move or not, it starts to create a catalyst for people to take the action that they have heretofore been holding off on. And my hope is frankly that the consumer blinks first and starts consuming as they should and that incentivizes businesses to start investing and growing and that kind of cycle starts up again. So I'm still optimistic that we're making progress and everything's going in the right direction and I think I'm hopeful that the Fed sees it the same way and if they do, then rates start to move up. We benefit from the balance sheet being only half of our company's balance sheet, so we'll benefit just as much from the fee businesses as it relates to a stronger economy, so I'm optimistic. Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : Great. Thank you. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Vivek. Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Hi, Vivek. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Thanks. A couple of questions. You had very strong growth in auto loans, just wanted to understand if you could give me how much of that is prime versus non-prime? Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer : It is all prime, Vivek. We started a little initiative about a year-and-a-half ago to pursue the subprime, but the volume and the opportunity there was not sufficient, so we're no \u2013 we're completely a prime shop. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. So if that's the case, how is the yield on that retail loans staying flat quarter-over-quarter, Andy, because prime is seeing a lot more competition from what we're hearing from everybody? Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. Leasing is strong, lending is more pressured; and the net of the two is flattish. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And does the leasing also show up in retail leasing? Or does that show up in the auto lending line? Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer : Shows up in the leasing line. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Because that seems to have been down year-over-year and linked quarter. Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. And I'm just talking about on an absolute basis, if we think about spreads and profitability, when we book that next lease that's still quite profitable. The next loan, prime auto loans is probably one of the most competitive dynamic \u2013 loan categories on the balance sheet today. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Yeah. Because I can see the auto was up 5% linked quarter, that's a very strong number. Secondly, you'd \u2013 Kathy mentioned about trust and wealth management being up sharply. As I look at it, it's up $23 million year-over-year. Over half of that growth is in corporate trust fees. How much of that has come from that cleanup call stuff that The Wall Street Journal highlighted a few weeks ago? Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer : The cleanup call is immaterial, Vivek. And it's actually in a different... Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : It's out of... Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer : ...in a different line. So it's not even that number at all. That is because our corporate trust business is doing well, we continue to be number one market share across all three categories : muni, corporate and structured; doing well both domestically as well as our small footprint in Europe which is growing. So that is just strong business growth and taking share. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Got it. Okay. Glad to hear that that's immaterial. I just sort of wondered why bother to do it then? Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer : Well, it's part of the structured business and the way we \u2013 and the way the documents are compiled. So it's a normal process. Many banks do it. It's not unusual and it's \u2013 we've been doing it because it is part of the document. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. All right. And lastly, you're obviously expanding on the investment banking side. I noticed that you even did a preferred stock deal where you were a co-lead underwriter. What point are you going to start breaking out IBCs from commercial products? Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We \u2013 it hasn't been material enough so we haven't, but given your question, we'll look into that. I mean if that's valuable to you all, given that we're continuing to make progress and our momentum has been really good here, we'll make that a to-do for ourselves. Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, we will. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Thanks, Vivek. Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer : Thanks. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko of SIG. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Jack. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hey. Good morning. Richard, in your prepared comments, you mentioned higher mortgage servicing regulatory expenses, it sounded incremental. Is that the correct interpretation, I guess? And then second, would these expenses be, I guess, sort of, one time to, sort of, ratchet up to a new standard? Or given your 70/30 purchase focus, is this sort of \u2013 could it be the new norm around servicing? Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Good question. So it's not incremental, it's just longer than I wanted. So in my mind, I wanted this thing to be done and gone and the consent order continues. So kind of the rush to the end, right, to the finish line. So we're going to continue to spend probably between now and the end of the year at the levels you've seen. There's no relief on that at all. As it relates to the cost of servicing, though, it's an important decision each bank has to make. The cost of servicing is remarkably higher now than it ever was. And to take you back a couple of quarters, I think I reminded you all that that's one of the things it does is it inspires you to stay at a higher quality of customer. So if I have a customer at a FICO level that there's a risk that we may have some form of a modification before their mortgage is through its life, I'm probably not going to do it anymore because the cost of handling that customer in the modification period and phase is expensive and it's rife with compliance risk and mistakes. So I'm just going to go a little higher than that and make sure that all customers we bank, at least going in, are not likely to have any concerns so the servicing cost to the bank are standard operating servicing as customers pay as agreed. When you start getting into that lesser quality customer, the cost of servicing goes way up, and we've been feeling that because we've been dealing with all these issues we've had to go back and remedy, but we're not going to do it going forward. So it's at least the rest of this year, Jack, we're going to have those costs and then my hope is that they'll start seeing some relief into the future years as mortgage servicing. We are sticking with it. We love the business. We're going to stay in the top five as a mortgage originator and a mortgage servicer, but for now those costs are just longer than I had hoped and they're at least the rest of this year. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. Great. And then as a follow-up, the student loan, the move, the re-class, does that get you out of student loans or is there more potentially to come as sort of a headwind to the top line growth numbers as you de-emphasize that business? Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No, it's all out. So we haven't sold it, it's still out looking \u2013 we're looking at the bids and things, so it's still held for sale because we don't have an answer, but with our intent is to get entirely out of both the government and the private student loan category and take that off of our things to worry about. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Operator : There are no further audio questions. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Great. Thank you, operator. Sean O'Connor - Senior Vice President and Director of Investor Relations : Thank you for listening to our second quarter results. And please call me this afternoon, if you have any follow-up questions. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, everybody. Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Following a review of the results by Richard Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathy Rogers, U.S. Bancorp\u2019s Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon, Eastern Daylight Time through Wednesday, October 22nd at 12 midnight, Eastern Daylight Time. I will now turn the conference call over to Sean O\u2019Connor, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. Sean O\u2019Connor: Thank you, Melisa, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Kathy Rogers, Andy Cecere and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp\u2019s third quarter 2015 results and answer your questions. Richard and Kathy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today\u2019s call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page two of today\u2019s presentation in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Richard. Richard Davis : Thank you, Sean, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our call. I will begin our review of U.S. Bank\u2019s results with a summary of the quarter\u2019s highlights on page three of the presentation. U.S. Bancorp reported net income of $1.5 billion for the third quarter of 2015, a record $0.81 per diluted common share, a 3.8% increase year-over-year. I was particularly pleased this quarter by the continued momentum in our payments business, specifically our retail card and merchant processing services, the stabilization of our net interest margin and a returnable linked quarter loan growth to our typical range of 1% to 1.5%. During the quarter, we returned our student loan portfolio from held-for-sale to held-for-investment. Subsequent to recognizing a market adjustment on the portfolio, related to disruption in student loan market. Excluding these student loan balances, total average loans grew 1.3% on a linked quarter basis. In addition, we continued to experience strong growth in total average deposits, which included consumer net new account growth of 3.1%. Credit quality continues to remain strong. Total net charge-offs and total non-performing assets both declined on a year-over-year basis and on a linked quarter basis. And finally, our capital position remains solid. We continue to generate significant capital this quarter and were able to return 80% of our earnings to shareholders in the third quarter, through a combination of our dividend and repurchase of 16 million shares of common stock. Slide four provides you with a five-quarter history of our performance metrics, and they remain among the best in the industry. Return on average assets in the third quarter was 1.44%, and return on average common equity was 14.1%. Moving over to the graph on the right, you can see that this quarter\u2019s net interest margin of 3.04% was essentially flat with the previous quarter margin of 3.03% as expected. This reversed a declining trend in linked quarter margin that has occurred over the past several quarters and which is principally driven by a shift in the mix of our loan portfolio. Our efficiency ratio for the third quarter was 53.9%. We expect this ratio to remain in the low 50s going forward as we continue to manage expenses in a challenging economic environment. During the third quarter, we expanded our prudent FTE management focus and introduced a renewed emphasis on other discretionary spending. We anticipate our efforts related to these initiatives will begin to reflect positive momentum as we move through quarter four and into 2016. While we anticipate our non-interest expense will be higher on a year-over-year basis in quarter four, we expect the increase will be lower than the year-over-year increase reported in the last several quarters as a result of our actions we\u2019re taking to reduce discretionary spending using technology to reduce certain traditional expenses and focusing our spending on more productive activities. This is being accomplished through FTE actions as well as programs that will reduce travel cost by effectively using video and teleconferencing, increasing our use of airfare and hotel discounts and eliminating most discretionary travel. We\u2019re also expanding the use of electronic communications internally and with our customers to reduce spending in printing and postage. Additionally, we began to evaluate professional service and contract labor arrangement and we expect to see improved efficiencies as resources are more appropriately allocated. We\u2019ll continue to leverage this efficiency effort to drive further opportunities for more prudent and efficient spending as we move through 2016. While prudent expense management remains a priority for our Company, we also continue to focus on revenue growth, which includes investing in businesses and products that will yield a high level of return. This philosophy is and has been a strength on how we manage our Company and this focus will continue going forward. Moving onto slide five, I want to highlight some notable impacts to our earnings. The third quarter of 2015 included several previously disclosed unrelated items that combine relatively neutral to earnings. Specifically the Company recognized a gain from the sale of Visa Class B common stock of approximately $135 million. This was partially offset by a $58 million market valuation adjustment to write down the value of our student loan portfolio that was previously held for sale. The quarter also included approximately $60 million of elevated expenses due to the mortgage related compliance and the company-wide talent upgrade. Turning to slide six, the Company reported total net revenue in the third quarter of $5.1 billion, a 1.6% increase from the prior year excluding the impact of this quarter\u2019s recent sale and the student loan market adjustments. The revenue momentum we are seeing is primarily due to our growing balance sheet and growth in a number of our fee related businesses, including payments. Kathy will now give a few more details about our third quarter results. Kathy Rogers : Thanks Richard. Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on slide seven. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $9 billion or 3.8% year-over-year and 1.3% linked quarter excluding student loan. Again this quarter, the increase in average loans outstanding on a year-over-year basis was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans of 9.5%. Total average revolving commercial and commercial real estate commitment continued to grow at a fast pace, increasing year-over-year by 8.9%; line utilization remained similar to the previous quarter. On a linked quarter basis, consumer loans have begun to grow at a pace stronger than wholesale loans driven by growth in our residential mortgage portfolio and continued strength in our home equity and auto lending businesses. This mix of loan growth is a key factor in the stabilization of our net interest margin. Residential mortgages were relatively flat year-over-year and increased 1.4% on a linked quarter basis, reversing a declining trend recognized over the previous quarter. Averaged credit card loans increased 1.1% year-over-year and were up 1.9% on a linked quarter basis. Total other retail loans grew 5.6% year-over-year and 1.9% over the prior quarter excluding the student loans. The increase was mainly driven by steady growth in auto loans and continued positive momentum in home equity loans which grew 0.8% linked quarter. We would expect loan growth to continue in a 1% to 1.5% range in quarter four. Total average deposits increased almost $19 billion to 6.9% over the same quarter of last year and 1.4% over the previous quarter. Growth to non-interest bearing and low-cost interest checking, money market and saving deposits was particularly strong on a year-over-year basis, offsetting the run-off of maturing large dollar time deposit. Turning to slide eight and credit quality, total net charge-offs declined 1.4% on a linked quarter basis and 13.1% on a year-over-year basis. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 46 basis points in the third quarter. Non-performing assets decreased by 0.6% on a linked quarter basis and 18.5% from the third quarter of 2014. During the third quarter, we released $10 million of reserves compared to $25 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $15 million in the second quarter of 2015. Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we currently expect total non-performing assets to remain relatively stable in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the level of net charge-offs to increase modestly in the fourth quarter of 2015, principally due to the expectation of a lower level of recoveries. Slide nine gives a view of our third quarter 2015 results versus comparable time period. As mentioned, our diluted EPS of $0.81 was 3.8% higher than the third quarter of 2014 and 1.3% higher than the prior quarter. The $18 million or 1.2% increase in net income year-over-year was principally due to higher net interest income and non-interest income offset by higher non-interest expense. On a linked quarter basis, net income was higher by $6 million or 0.4%, mainly due to increases in net interest income and non-interest income, partially offset by higher non-interest expense. Turning to slide 10, net interest income increased year-over-year by $73 million or 2.7%. The increase was a result of growth in average earning assets of 6.6% partially offset by a lower net interest margin. The net interest margin of 3.04% was 12 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2014. The decline was principally due to a change in loan portfolio mix as well as growth in the investment portfolio at lower average rate and lower reinvestment rates on investment securities. Net interest income increased $51 million on a linked quarter basis, primarily due to higher average total loans and an additional day in the quarter. The net interest margin of 3.04% was 1 basis-point higher than the second quarter. The increase in net interest margin was principally due to growth in earning assets including a shift in loan mix weighted more to consumer loans and continued deposit growth partially offset by an increase in lower rate investment securities along with lower reinvestment portfolio rates. We currently expect that the net interest margin will be relatively stable in the fourth quarter. Slide 11 highlights non-interest income which increased $84 million or 3.7% year-over-year. The year-over-year increase in non-interest income was primarily due to the third quarter 2015 Visa gain of approximately $135 million partially offset by the $58 million student loan market value adjustment. The remaining increase in non-interest income was principally due to higher commercial products revenue, trust and investment management fees, credit and debit card revenues, and merchant processing services. Partially offsetting these favorable variances was $36 million decrease in mortgage banking revenue primarily due to an unfavorable change in evaluation of mortgage servicing rights, net of hedging activity. Momentum in our payments business was reflected in our third quarter results. Credit and debit card fees grew 7.2% on a year-over-year basis, principally driven by higher volume compared to 2.7% growth year-over-year in the second quarter. We would expect that credit card fees in quarter four will continue to grow in line with volume. Merchant processing revenue increased 3.4% year-over-year, 8.5% excluding the impact of foreign currency rate changes. This increase compares to year-over-year growth of 7.6% in quarter two. The growth was driven by higher transaction volume, account growth and equipment sales to merchants related to new chip card technology requirement. We would expect that quarter four year-over-year growth in merchant fees will be modestly lower than the growth recognized in quarter three as equipment sales related to the new chip card technology requirements will begin to slow. On a linked quarter basis, non-interest income was higher by $54 million or 2.4% principally due to higher other income in commercial product revenue as well as seasonally higher corporate payment products revenue and deposit service charges partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenue. We currently expect mortgage fees to be down 5% to 15% on a linked quarter basis in quarter four due to typical seasonality. It is very early in the quarter and we\u2019ll update guidance as the quarter progresses. The other income increase was due to higher equity gains including the Visa gain offset by student loan, market adjustment and lower trading gain. Moving to slide 12, non-interest expense increased year-over-year by $161 million or 6.2%. The increase was mainly due to higher compensation expense, reflecting the impact of merit increases and higher staffing for risk and compliance activity, higher employee benefits expense mainly due to higher pension costs and higher marketing and business development expense. On a linked quarter basis, non-interest expense increased by $93 million or 3.5%. As expected linked quarter expense increased due to the seasonal lift in tax credit amortization included in other expense, and an increase in expense related to the quarter two partner reimbursements that did not repeat in quarter three which are principally reflected in printing and supplies expense. The remaining increase was primarily due to increases in other expense related to mortgage servicing and talent upgrade costs and compensation expense principally reflecting the impact of an additional day in the quarter and increases in variable compensation. As we look to quarter four, we do expect an increase in linked non-interest expense as seasonally higher tax credit amortization will be partially offset by a reduction in expense related to the elevated mortgage servicing and talent upgrade costs that were included in quarter three expense. The normal seasonal increase in tax credit amortization expense is expected to be in a range of $65 million to $75 million, slightly higher than trends observed in the same period of last year. Turning to slide 13, as Richard mentioned, our capital position remains strong. We returned 80% of our earnings to shareholders; dividends accounted for 32% while stock repurchases accounted for the remaining 48%. Our common equity tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as is fully implemented at September 30th was 9.2%. At 9.2%, we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. Our intangible book value per share rose to $17.20 at September 30th, representing the 9.8% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 2.4% increase over the prior quarter. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Richard. Richard Davis : Thank you, Kathy. I\u2019m very proud of our third quarter results. We reported a record EPS, maintained our industry leading performance measures and reported a 19% return on tangible common equity in the quarter. We\u2019re operating from a position of strength as we grow revenue, as we manage expenses, as we seek to exceed customer expectations, and as we create value for our shareholders in the demanding marketplace. As we head into the final quarter of the year, we remain focused on delivering consistent, predictable and repeatable financial results for the benefit of our customers, our employees, our communities and our shareholders. That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Kathy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Jon Arfstrom : Richard, just a question for you; just take your temperature on loan growth and how are you feeling about the outlook. You\u2019re right down the middle this quarter, just wonder there is anything out there that makes you any more or less optimistic as you look to Q4 and to 2016 in terms of loan grow? Richard Davis : I would say just more of the same which is not pessimistic but it\u2019s not uber optimistic either. I mean we\u2019re seeing a nice transition to consumers getting more steady in their spending patterns. I think we\u2019ll see a nice seasonal lift in credit cards in the fourth quarter. Auto loans as you know remain strong. Our Bank has been benefited by a strong home equity growth of portfolio and not having some other run-offs that other portfolios have had. So, you will continue to see I think all cylinders on consumer growth. And that will be a nice challenge to probably an equal growth we\u2019ll continue to see in C&I and CRE as well as small business. So, what you saw this quarter is probably the optimal work here for a while which is a nice 1% to 1.5% linked quarter probably even on both commercial and wholesale which gives us a nice blend for the margin. I would say the competitiveness on the rates are pretty steady and we\u2019re not seeing an undue amount of pressure except in the middle market C&I space, everything else seems to be managing itself pretty well. The one area that we\u2019re not growing right now is CRE. I certainly mentioned this time we talked that it\u2019s an area that we think has some undue risk in it; it\u2019s a pretty overheated market in not just certain locations but tenures and the terms and the recourse non-recourse decisions that some banks are making and we\u2019re not going to participate in that. So don\u2019t be disappointed if you don\u2019t see commercial real estate grow a great deal. We\u2019ll probably hold our own and keep our market share but that\u2019s an area we\u2019re going to keep particularly close eye on. And then finally areas of real opportunity, the small business category still looks good especially under the $350,000 level. Real small businesses feeling that they\u2019ve got some real value now or some real cash flow either from their own personal circumstances or from their own business. And we\u2019re starting to see a higher percentage of take up on that, both SPA and traditional small business. And I think our market share continues to reflect the growth in the last couple of quarter. So, a lot more of the same, the catalyst I think is I\u2019ve said before will be the real movement in interest rates. The first mover impact which I think will trigger quite an impact on these C&I and the larger company space for the one and not miss the opportunity to get lock in rates before they start moving up at no matter what speed but until then it\u2019s just kind of more what you\u2019re seeing. We\u2019ll get it out in the marketplace with prime only quality loans at a pricing advantage that I think we continue to be able to benefit from. Jon Arfstrom : And then just a follow-up on what you just said, this is the first time we\u2019ve seen loan yields relatively flat and earning assets yields relatively flat. How are you feeling about just pricing in the competitive environment? Richard Davis : Andy, why don\u2019t you give him that? Andy Cecere : I think as Richard mentioned, in the large corporate space, I would say pricing is relatively stable; middle market can be aggressive because fewer competitors can make a difference there. And the other area on the retail side of the equation is auto lending, continues to be fairly competitive in terms of pricing. Other than those categories relatively stable. Operator : Thanks. We have John McDonald with Bernstein. John McDonald : Just wondering on the expense side, Richard, is there any way to size the potential opportunity from the increased focus on the non-FTE expense? Richard Davis : Yes. You got the question too. Listen, first of all, we\u2019re going to be very careful on not heading where we shouldn\u2019t. And I am not -- we\u2019re still a long-term company, so we\u2019re not going to make big mistakes here and over manage this. But I will tell you that this discretionary addition to our otherwise prudent FTE impacts is going to start showing itself for the first time in quarter four and we\u2019re going to get that a range of $10 million to $15 million benefit that we wouldn\u2019t have had if we\u2019ve not started this effort. 2016, we\u2019re in the middle of the planning process; so it will obviously be more than that but it\u2019s going to be thoughtful. And I think you all know that we\u2019re giving you our efforts to get back to positive operating leverage on an annual basis. Then as you look into plan next year, that\u2019s our goal is to make it a positive operating leverage. But at the same token, I don\u2019t want to starve the future and find out that we over manage something and got this company back to really where it was 10 years ago where we were just investing. So, we\u2019re going to be thoughtful about it but it\u2019s got real impact but not huge in quarter four. And then we\u2019ll have a better idea to give you since later this quarter as we look to 2016 and see what kind of impacts the cumulative facts of all that can be. But I assure you, we\u2019re going to continue invest in places we need to and where the ROI is good. I don\u2019t see an expense; I\u2019ve seen investment and we\u2019ll continue to be thoughtful on that distinction. John McDonald : So, don\u2019t want to box you into a corner to really on next year, but just want to kind of get sense of your conviction level on the ability to deliver the positive operating leverage without rates. Back in September at the conference you kind of said, hey, now I don\u2019t care. Is it something you feel like pretty good about being able to deliver or really going to depend a lot on the environment still? Richard Davis : What I said was I care less, not I don\u2019t care, I do care. The fact is that we\u2019re going to put into our plan an expectation for very, very nominal number and size of rate increases which much less we\u2019ve had in the years past, so nominal that it\u2019s very small that to the extent that that occurs and in case nothing happens, we will struggle to get positive operating leverage. To the extent that anything happens, we\u2019re going to build a plan to give it very close to that, so that we can approximate revenue growth and expense growth to be somewhere near the same where revenue slightly outpaces it. And there is a reasonable amount of increases or sooner than later, then we\u2019ll have much bigger opportunity to provide much more positive operating leverage. But we\u2019re building it to be right at the line so that we can deliver back to what we committed, start growing the Bank that way again and then any benefits we get will be a bonus. But do we need one or two, John, over the next 15 months but we don\u2019t need much more than that; we don\u2019t need them all right now and they don\u2019t need to be big. John McDonald : And then just on the idea of if rates stay low, revenue environment stays challenging, does the idea of bank acquisitions get more attractive for you Richard? And can you just elaborate what you said about kind of statute of limitations and kind of legal risks as a barrier to you are doing deals? Richard Davis : Good memory. I told you that I think the statute in our head kind of ends in \u201817. So I don\u2019t think \u201816 is going to be a year where you\u2019ll see us jumping into big bank deals or big branch deals. But we do love the non-capital, the business of fees and trust. And you saw recent acquisition we made of the Auto Club card portfolio, there are more where that came from John and those are very attractive deals; they are bolt-on; they\u2019re low capital. But for the provision, you need to put in front of them. And the small conversion task is a good way to grow the balance sheet and we\u2019ll continue to see opportunities there. So, I think \u201816 looks like the tail end of the last four, five years and then \u201817 probably becomes the time we\u2019ll start looking at more traditional bank deals. And frankly, we don\u2019t really feel we need them right now. Our deposit growth is steady; our customer growth patterns are steady; our relationships are getting deeper and we\u2019ve always said wanted double down where we are; more than grow where we aren\u2019t. And so far that\u2019s working for us. And I don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re starved at all by not being able to do that. John McDonald : Are there other things that you need to get to that in terms of before you can do deals in terms of regulatory check list and things like that? Richard Davis : I don\u2019t think we -- we don\u2019t think there is an environment where that\u2019s going to necessarily impair our interest. I think we have to watch for the trailing risk that I mentioned before especially inheriting it from that you didn\u2019t you create yourself and you also want to spend time making sure that everything you have in your houses in good order, but I don\u2019t see anything new on the horizon or any new information that would change our appetite. Operator : We have Paul Miller with FBR. Paul Miller : Where are you at on -- I know on acquisitions and what do you see out there; are things loosening up a little bit or some of the improvement -- and what type of size you think you can go after at this point? Richard Davis : Paul, I don\u2019t know that they are any more attractive than they have been in the last few years. I think there are certain boards sitting around boardrooms saying at smaller sizes are we going to make it at this level, can we afford with our scale to be profitable; that might change a little bit. But we\u2019re not seeing an intensely different environment that we\u2019ve seen in the last eight quarters, not more players, not higher quality players, not more desperate players. And our attraction, our interest is low. So maybe that\u2019s because we\u2019re saying we\u2019re not interested, we\u2019re not getting a lot of bites. But we\u2019re not denying anything that we think is too good to pass. And I actually don\u2019t think -- I am not attracted to other banks right now. I just for all the reasons you mentioned -- I mentioned to you before, this year positioning in this moment in time. It\u2019s enough to carry your entire balance sheet across the goal line when interest rates are low and deposits don\u2019t have value, but they are going to be valuable one day again and you\u2019re going to be glad you have all of those deposit gather in place. We have 3,186 right now; that\u2019s probably quite enough for us. I am just not -- we\u2019re not seeing an attraction on our part and no one is coming out for us with a different or better story. Paul Miller : Are you seeing any communities or some of the small areas struggling with the low oil prices especially in some of this -- some areas you\u2019re in with the -- couldn\u2019t get it out, the frac, I couldn\u2019t get it out? Richard Davis : There are markets that we have business like Lewiston and Williston and those parts of the Dakotas, which is like the old gold rush; things start slowing down, the town moves downstream. We don\u2019t do much business there anyway; we didn\u2019t set up any locations; we didn\u2019t create infrastructure because we didn\u2019t think it was sustainable. And for the most part becoming mostly a Midwest and West Coast company, we\u2019re outside of the Texas Panhandle and down of the Gulf Coast. And so that\u2019s for a few customers that might have some tension tertiary impacts to energy, we really don\u2019t have anything at our gun sites and none of our communities are struggling in that category either based on the consumer or the small business. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Just following up on the fee side, just want to ask you guys to remind us, you\u2019re getting towards better comps on a year-over-year basis in some of these fee areas. Can you kind of walk us through in addition to mortgage in the fourth quarter to be mindful of what are the plus and minus seasonalities and where are you seeing kind of better comps versus still some challenges to face on the fee side? Andy Cecere : Hi Ken, this is Andy. In the fourth quarter, I would expect to see continued strength in our merchant processing a little lower on a linked quarter basis because as Kathy mentioned, we have very strong equipment sales in the third quarter that will continue at a lower level in the fourth quarter. But the year-over-year comps will continue to be very favorable. Card is always positive in the fourth quarter. Corporate Payments is down a little bit because the third quarter is the big quarter for that one. Trust is going to be dependent a little bit upon the markets, so there is the market impact to that, the S&P market impacts fees overall. And then mortgage fees I would expect to be modestly down in the fourth quarter. Typical seasonality in the fourth quarter is down 5% to 15%. Ken Usdin : So, when I think about all of that, is it kind of just naturally just going to be a little bit tougher for fee growth just given those couple of normal fourth quarter seasonalities plus mortgage? Andy Cecere : I think if you take out the couple of unusual items that we had this quarter, the Visa gain and the student loan impact, I would expect moderate growth on a linked quarter basis. Ken Usdin : And then secondly in terms of the ability to kind of hold the margin flattish from here, are we now done with kind of investment portfolio build? I know a lot of it will still be dependent on deposit growth which continues to be pretty good, but what are you doing as far as the rate environment and investment portfolio builds and mix? Kathy Rogers : This is Kathy. So, as you know from an investment portfolio perspective, we are at our LCR coverage ratio. So, any activity that you\u2019ll see in our investment portfolio along with sales will be in line with balance sheet. So I don\u2019t expect a significant amount there. We will continue to see some impact from the reinvestment rate through; however as some of those securities pay down and we reinvest, that will come on at a bit lower spread than what we had before. Although that mitigated a bit for us in third quarter, we\u2019ll take our eyes on fourth quarter in the rate environment. So I think really what causes us to think about stable margin as we go into fourth quarter, this continued mix of our loan portfolio. So, as the consumer loans are -- and we expect them to continue to be a bigger piece of the growth on a linked quarterly basis, that will guide us to stable margins as we look into quarter four. Operator : The next question is from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Bill Carcache : Richard, I had a high level strategic question for you on Elavon. Clearly, it\u2019s a very high return generating business that contributes nicely to your profitability, but there are number of publicly traded merchant acquirers out there trading in around 25 times or so on forward earnings and that\u2019s arguably not a valuation that Elavon is getting inside of USB. And we\u2019ve gotten some questions from investors who\u2019ve been wondering whether there is an opportunity there for you guys to unlock some value by spinning it off, particularly with what we\u2019ve seen from some other banks who have spun out their acquiring businesses and they\u2019re actually doing quite well today and we\u2019ve got some other IPOs happening now. And just kind of with all of that as a backdrop, can you speak to how you think about that? Richard Davis : First of all Bill, this has actually come up before; I think it\u2019s maybe five or six years ago in the earlier stages of my CEO time. And as it turns out, we just have to go back around and describe not only the merits of having that kind of business in a bank but connected to the bank. So first of all, we\u2019re an acquirer but we\u2019re also an issuer and with that combination comes a remarkable benefit that an acquirer alone doesn\u2019t have. And so we can do the testing, we can do the modeling; we\u2019ve talked about close loops before. Everything we want to pilot or understand about consumer and merchant behavior is we can test both sides of that and there is an amazing amount of value to that that I would strongly want to connect to. The second piece is we do a lot of that business for our own customers. So instead of having to outsource an acquiring position to our retailers or our small merchant, we actually provide that service to them directly. I think still some banks provide insurance and they do it directly to their customers; we do the merchant acquiring. And maybe as importantly, we do this for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of smaller banks across the nation. And the smaller bank, if I were a smaller bank and I used to work at one, I would trust the capabilities and the -- I\u2019ll call the regulatory understanding of the environment another bank more than the non-bank. So we get a lot of benefits by being a bank doing business for other banks with white label and private label that we call it there merchant servicing. But with it comes an amazing flow of new business and highly retained customers by being a bank to other banks. So all that is probably not unlocked as you said but it\u2019s certainly a part and parcel of the why we think this business is great, why we want to keep growing it. It has international feeling too, so I\u2019ve got a nice natural hedge now with all the business we do in Europe and in Central and South America. There is no reason that can\u2019t continue to grow as long as the economic social impacts are understood. And so the volatility of the foreign exchange, we have no other risk because it\u2019s a 24-hour settlement. So, it\u2019s a great business. We love it. The cost of entry for other banks is quite prohibitive. So, I want to stick with it; stay with it; grow with it. But if I were to dis-couple from the bank, it would become more germane to a standalone merchant acquirer that has none of the benefits I just described. Bill Carcache : If I may separately, can you share any thoughts on where the non-operating deposits at some of the larger banks have been deemphasizing or going? And are you guys actively doing anything to either keep those away or perhaps could you potentially see value in them? Andy Cecere : Our deposit base is principally operating. We have been very good about managing the core there. We don\u2019t have some of those non-operating more fluctuating higher volatility deposits. So that has not been an issue for us, so we have not been turning any away. We\u2019ve been working with our customers. And again for the most part ours are operating in core. Bill Carcache : And is the deposit growth that you guys have been seeing just kind of a result or are you guys actively kind of managing that growth? It kind of stands out because your deposit growth still is exceeding your loan growth and we\u2019re actually seeing that at the system level that that\u2019s no longer the case; loan growth has now started to exceed deposit growth. I am just wondering if that was something that you guys were actively trying to drive. Kathy Rogers : No, we\u2019re really -- we\u2019re not actively managing any kind of deposit growth or as Andy said, we\u2019re not looking at getting out of any deposits either on our books. So really what you see in our deposit growth is what -- just the core growth that we\u2019re seeing from our consumer -- our customer base. And I will say that really is across all the categories in our wholesale and our consumer. And keep in mind that we do have that strong base of deposits within our corporate trust area. So, we do see deposit growth really across the Company and it\u2019s really just a reflection of what our customers are doing. Richard Davis : We\u2019re all going to have to get ready for this moment when deposits start to flow out of banks and we should celebrate it. You\u2019re all going to want to measure the beta and who loses the most and what\u2019s the retention factor, we\u2019ll all be prepared for that. But we really do want to see customers use their deposits; they\u2019re back up to a savings level now that hasn\u2019t been seen in 12 years. That\u2019s great for America but now we want them to use that. And all the field pricing for the most part benefits seem to have gone into savings in some form of either paying down debt or saving it in the bank, which great, which is great, but we all do want to see that start to move because as we\u2019ve said before, the first canary in the mind is deposits go down; secondly lines of credit that are already extended but not used get used and then eventually a loans of loan start to happen. That\u2019s how the cycle reverses itself. We\u2019re still not there and honestly I will be the first to cheer when deposits start to flow out because consumerism starts and because the economy is really back up and running. Bill Carcache : Do you see Richard, a scenario where that competition for deposits could potentially intensify perhaps even before the Fed raises rates or is it kind of a function of the Fed having to raise rates first? Richard Davis : Yes, it\u2019s going to be definitely not before, not even at that moment; it will be later when either somebody has decided, they miss guided themselves in this quieter period and got rid of their deposit gathering options and need to go out and price up for it or there will be a bank or two to that wants to get clever and creative and try to get the market movement and do these laddering programs and these guarantees and things that we never did before and wouldn\u2019t recommend in the future. But those kinds of behaviors I think you\u2019ll see but they won\u2019t happen now and they won\u2019t happen even at the point of great increase. They will happen when people start to realize deposit start to matter again and they\u2019ll have to decide to get hungry for an avenue they might have closed off. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : On the margin, got your guidance for fourth quarter for stable; on 2016, just want to see if you can give us a little bit of color there. Do you expect that the margins should hold relatively stable through \u201816 as well or do you think pricing competition can still have a bit of effect on that? Kathy Rogers : John, we\u2019re guiding into the fourth quarter and I would be hesitant to guide out past that. But what I would say is if we continue -- the loan mix of our portfolio growth with consumer growing a little bit higher at higher spreads and we see on the wholesale, I think that coupled with just our reinvestment rate impact on securities is kind of starting to narrow a bit. There is similar or those things continue as we move into 2016, I would think that we would have similar type expectations. But at this point we\u2019re looking quarter-to-quarter and as we said probably stable into quarter four. John Pancari : And then separately, just wanted to get your updated thoughts for -- or the updated strategy around mortgage banking basically through the standpoint of how much you plan to still push production there and then your retention strategy versus originate to sell. Andy Cecere : So, if it\u2019s a qualifying mortgage Freddie or Fannie, we will sell that. It is a better financial decision from our perspective to originate and sell those mortgages. If it is a jumble or non sellable mortgage, we\u2019ll put down on the balance sheet; we\u2019ve been a little bit more aggressive with that particularly with our own customers have talked about that. So, that would be our expectation. We\u2019ve gone from about 21st in terms of size to fifth or sixth and I would expect us to continue to be in that range. Our particular emphasis is to put more branch distribution as a focus in terms of our core growth. And that is something that we continue to drive and are successful and increasing. So, I expect to see us grow aftermarket grabs little bit above the market particularly focused on branch and if it\u2019s sellable, we will sell it. John Pancari : Last question is just around the reserve, edged a little bit lower this quarter by a few bps. Do you think all things equal that should still see that reserve to loan ration edge lower over the next couple of quarters as well? Richard Davis : Bill, do you want to take that? Bill Parker : Sure, I can take that. So, we\u2019re getting to the point where our reserve release has been de minimis really and we have to weigh the balance of continued improving loan quality versus loan growth. So, we\u2019re looking at a point now where we -- we\u2019re probably flattened out to seeing some increases in the wholesale area and the one area where there is still some potential for credit opportunity, reserve opportunities in residential mortgage. But we\u2019re just about at that point where those -- that mix is flattening out and I expect that will eventually have to provide for loan growth. Operator : The next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Hi, couple of questions for you folks. Firstly, the equipment sales in merchant processing that you were talking about, how much of that is due to the new EMV adoption by merchants and when does that get done? Andy Cecere : Vivek, this is Andy. So the acceleration, the increase is principally due to that EMV. We always sell equipments in any particular quarter, it\u2019s higher in this quarter and last quarter, I would expect it to continue at least for quarter or two, perhaps not at the levels we saw in the third quarter, but it is principally due to that acceleration because merchants are buying chip enabled terminals. Vivek Juneja : That\u2019s what I thought that it probably accelerated. And the card portfolio you acquired from Auto Club, what was that was in this quarter and how much were the receivables on that Andy? Andy Cecere : It was $525 million right at the end of the quarter. So, no impact in quarter three; you\u2019ll see that impact in quarter four. Vivek Juneja : 525 million? Richard Davis : The portfolio looks exactly like our portfolio. I mean from charge-offs to revolve, average spend; it\u2019s right down the fairway and it\u2019s a complete continuation of the kind of service that we provide that quality of customer. Vivek Juneja : Is it like a private label type portfolio Richard or is it just a regular or co-branded or is it going to be more -- given that it says Auto Club; I would think or is this some kind of affinity type? Richard Davis : It\u2019s an Auto Club branded card that is with our support and backing. So it\u2019s on our balance sheet, our processing but Auto Club has the rewards that go along with it. Vivek Juneja : One last thing, consumer banking, if I look at the efficiency ratio that has risen all throughout the last year. Can you talk a little bit about what -- any plans to bring that down or change the direction of that? Andy Cecere : So Vivek, consumer banking is the most impacted business line by the low rate environment in terms of their earnings as we sit today. So, they have a lot of deposits. Those deposits on a relative basis are below the typical spreads and value that we have on a long-term basis. And that impact is what\u2019s driving their efficiency ratio. So as rates start to move, you will see that business line more than any other start to improve in terms of efficiency ratio. Richard Davis : That\u2019s why we could be wrong but at least we\u2019re going to have the luxury of deciding later. But branch closures look very attractive now because they\u2019re not only not very profitable, they\u2019re actually going in the wrong direction as this long interest rate stays low and deposit values are much less than they will be in the future. But there will be a time when rates go back up. I know you and I are old enough to remember and deposits will be the governor on how many loans you can make. And that\u2019s the benefit we\u2019re always going to have on these interlopers who are coming in with these great lending ideas. They don\u2019t have the deposits and we shouldn\u2019t give up the one thing we have which is deposits which will be the key driver. So for us, we have been rationalizing our branch system a lot. We don\u2019t look for headlines on it. We\u2019ve been retooling what happens in the branches all the things that you would expect us to do and closing where they\u2019re necessary and opening with they\u2019re necessary. But we\u2019re by and large a believer in the branch network. We think it\u2019s the best core deposits; it\u2019s best quality customers we get from a branch referred loan or credit line. And yet right now, it\u2019d be a bad time to evaluate their value because at this point at the end of a long recession, they\u2019re not very attractive. Operator : The next question is from Chris Mutascio with KBW. Chris Mutascio : I hate to do this to you. I was on another conference call that was running at the same time. Would you remind me hashing just briefly your opening comments about expenses and the kind of initiatives you\u2019re looking through? Richard Davis : I think I\u2019ll just repeat it for everybody. What we\u2019ve been doing for a year now is watching our FTE assets and be very prudent about where we add them. We\u2019ve recently gone through a rationalization program where our lower performers that were not performing just not the highest level given the importance of an FTE, we\u2019ve now used a company program to do a talent upgrade and effectively use people out of the company. And on top of that, in the last quarter, we added this discretionary expense review which is the other half of the expense categories and started looking at where we don\u2019t need to be spending money at this point in time until rates move. And that\u2019s some we gave some color around. I said that in the quarter four it will be a $10 million to $15 million net benefit that we wouldn\u2019t have had if we hadn\u2019t taken that extra action. For 2016, it will obviously be more than that but we\u2019re not ready to size it because I am also not going to necessarily give you guys a sense that all expenses stop because we\u2019re just reallocating the right things and in some cases we\u2019re going to be investing in places we have been in the past. So too early to rate for \u201816 but definitely net positive and our goal is to get to the positive operating leverage at the minimum annual level starting next year. Chris Mutascio : I appreciate that and I do apologize for having to rehash that. My one follow-up, Kathy specific to fourth quarter, did you say that expenses will be up over third quarter, and if so was that up from the reported number of about 2.77 billion? Kathy Rogers : Yes, I would say it\u2019s up from a reported number and that\u2019s principally driven as we said by the fact that our tax credit amortization expense is -- quarter four is our seasonally highest increase related tax credit amortization expense. And we said that that would probably go up in the range of about 65 million to 75 million, similar to what we saw in previous trends. And then you could expect to see that increase being partially offset by some of the elevated costs that we\u2019ve caught out here in quarter three. Operator : And your final question is from Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Nancy Bush : Richard, a couple; I can\u2019t remember if it was last quarter or the quarter before, you were sort of the last bank CEO to kind of throw in the towel and say that the economy was getting better, definitively better. Do you want to repeal that now? Richard Davis : No, I don\u2019t remember being that strong. But I would say it\u2019s not getting worse. I know I said that before. Undeniably it\u2019s not getting worse. I mean things aren\u2019t going backwards; people aren\u2019t going in the direction of not investing; people aren\u2019t afraid to buy cars; people aren\u2019t afraid to use their credit line. I think for a more political discussion, there is the haves and have-nots right in the barbell of who is participating who is not as greater than it used to be. But being a prime only lender and being at a pretty high quality on the line of customers, we\u2019re not impacted mostly by that and we\u2019re feeling a small, slow, steady almost monotonous and I\u2019ll call tortuously flow improvement over the course of time. I do believe Nancy, I\u2019ve always believed it, I could be totally wrong and happy to be if I am but when the first rate moves, a real move, not a thought of it, not a predilection of it, not a guess of it; I do think that the corporate America starts to move quickly and they\u2019ll start to take advantage first because they have most to gain. And then I think they\u2019ll start to create some incentive -- create consumerism and I think we\u2019re off to the races. I think for the first time business will drive out of the slow recovery than consumers. And I\u2019ll call it recovery because it\u2019s not a recession; it still feels slow and very measured. So I\u2019m not writing home about it. Without interest rates moving, you just keep seeing us all doing a little more of what we were doing before, managing to the needs of customers who do have the wherewithal and do have the motives, still want to keep growing and benefiting in their lives but plenty of people aren\u2019t playing yet and the savers are getting killed. Nancy Bush : And a couple quarters before that you had said that you had a long list projects that you wanted to do and that you would start doing them as quickly as the interest rate environment turned but that you were being very cautious on taking on new projects in light of the expense control that was necessary. So, are there any of those projects that are on that list that need to get done, no matter what the interest rate environment is, particularly if this rate environment is going to go on longer than anybody had anticipated? Richard Davis : Yes, there is two answers to that. One is mobile transitions to banking channels. We\u2019re sending money on that. We\u2019ve talked about our growth; our hundreds of people in Atlanta that work on those topics. I haven\u2019t starved that one bit because that is the changing environment wherein we have to be a leader on that; we\u2019re expected and we have to invest. So that\u2019s a good ROI in the long-term; it\u2019s not a near-term ROI. The other one Nancy is we\u2019re spending money on compliance. What I\u2019ve learned -- if you\u2019ve heard my speech, it\u2019s like we\u2019ve gone from baggage handlers to pilots, same company. Baggage handlers every once in a while make a mistake and up until now it\u2019s okay, no one loses their lives but pilot from the same company can\u2019t crash a plane. I\u2019d had to move all of our employees from baggage handlers to pilots. So, we\u2019re still in that transition. So, regulators have required that of us as well. So I\u2019m spending money on either back office or more often than not technology to replace some of the error ridden places where human interaction creates an outcome that is not acceptable anymore. And that investment\u2019s worth it, not because it\u2019s a better product necessarily but because it\u2019s a better compliance outcome, the safer way to earn when you don\u2019t have the potential of penalties and fines and risks. So those are two things that have not been touched. Other things would be the more attractive ways to just increase the capabilities we do in the back office that no one really sees but it\u2019s just more elegant; less involvement where people have to touch customers where customers can self serve. All those things are -- some of those are nice to have; where they are not required, we\u2019re holding back on those. And those would be the things we\u2019ll add back the minute we start seeing revenue growth. Operator : I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Sean O\u2019Connor for closing remarks. Sean O\u2019Connor: Thank you for listening to our review of third quarter results. And please contact me this afternoon if you have any follow-up questions. Thanks. Richard Davis : Thanks, everybody. Kathy Rogers : Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Following the review of the results by Richard Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathy Rogers, U.S. Bancorp\u2019s Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon, Eastern through Friday, January 22nd at 12 Midnight, Eastern Time. I will now turn the conference call over to Bob Kleiber of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. Bob Kleiber : Thank you, Maria, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Kathy Rogers, Andy Cecere and Bill Parker are joining me today to review U.S. Bancorp\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2015 results and to answer your questions. Richard and Kathy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules, are available on our Web site at usbank.com. I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today\u2019s call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today\u2019s presentation, in our press release, and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Richard. Richard Davis : Thank you, Bob. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I will begin our report with a few highlights from U.S. Banc\u2019s 2015 full year results on Page 3 of the presentation. U.S. Bancorp reported record net income of $5.9 billion or $3.16 per diluted common share. We achieved industry-leading profitability with the return on average assets of 1.44%, a return on average common equity of 14%, and an efficiency ratio of 53.8% for the year. Total average loans grew by 4.1% adjusted for student loans and average deposits grew a strong 7.7% year-over-year. Credit quality continue to improve with the 12.1% of decline in net charge-offs and a 15.8% decrease in non-performing assets. Our capital position remains strong and we returned $4 billion or 72% of our earnings to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks during 2015. Turning to Slide 4 and our quarterly highlights, U.S. Banc reported record revenue of $5.2 billion and net income of $1.5 billion or $0.80 per diluted common share, an increase of 1.3% year-over-year. The fourth quarter of 2015 included a gain from the sale of an HSA account deposit portfolio with diluted earnings per share up by $0.1. I am very pleased this quarter with the momentum in our linked quarter loan growth, the continued strength of our payments business and the improvement in our operating leverage. Total average loans grew 1.7% linked quarter adjusted for student loans, which exceeded the high-end of our 1% to 1.5% range. In addition, we continue to see strong growth in average deposits which included consumer net new account growth of 3.2%. Credit quality continued to remain strong. Total net charge-offs and non-performing assets declined on a year-over-year basis and non-performing assets declined on a linked quarter basis as well. Slide 5 provides you with the five quarter history of our performance metrics and they remain among the best in the industry. Moving to the graph on the right, you can see that this quarter\u2019s net interest margin of 3.06% was relatively stable as expected, improving 2 basis points from the third quarter. This was primarily driven by a higher loan growth which reduced the amount of cash balances. Our efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 53.9%. We expect this ratio to remain in the low 50s going forward as we continue to see the results of our expanded efficiency effort that we introduced last year, which includes prudent FTE management and a renewed emphasis on other discretionary spending. As I said earlier, I am particularly pleased that we were able to achieve positive operating leverage for the quarter which reverses a trend of negative leverage over the past several quarters. I believe this positions us well as we move into 2016. While prudent expense management remains a priority for our company, we also continue to focus on revenue growth and innovation, which means investing in those businesses and products that will provide strong returns. During the quarter, we announced a new agreement with Fidelity Investments. U.S. Banc is now the exclusive issuer of the Fidelity Investments\u2019 rewards card program. As part of this arrangement which closed at the end of 2015, we purchased the existing card portfolio of $1.6 billion. This follows the announcement from last October about our card issuing partnership with the Auto Club Trust and the purchase of an existing $500 million portfolio. These agreements exemplify the strength of our payments business model and a continued commitment to strategic growth for our Company. Turning to Slide 6, the company reported record net revenue in the fourth quarter of $5.2 billion, a 0.8% increase from the prior year which included core revenue growth and a gain on the sales of the HSA deposit portfolio, partially offset by the Nuveen gain recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014. The revenue momentum we are seeing is primarily due to our growing balance sheet and growth in the number of our fee based businesses including our payments and trust businesses. Kathy will now give you a few more details about our fourth quarter results. Kathy Rogers : Thanks Richard. The average loan and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 7. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $10 billion or 4.2% year-over-year and 1.7% linked quarter adjusted for student loans. As you may recall we moved our student loan portfolio to held-for-sale in the first quarter of 2015 and subsequently retuned it to held-for-investment during the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, the increase in average loans outstanding on a year-over-year basis was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans of 9% and 2.5% linked quarter. The strongest linked growth I've seen in 2015. Line utilization however remained relatively consistent with the previous quarter and flat year-over-year. Consumer loans again showed positive momentums lead by credit card and auto loans. Average auto credit cards increased 4.7% year-over-year and 5% on a linked quarter basis, which included the acquisition of approximately $500 million Auto Club portfolio at the end of quarter three. Auto loan growth remains strong up 13% year-over-year and 2% linked quarter. Residential mortgages grew 2.1% year-over-year reversing a declining trend over the last several quarters and rose 2.2% on a linked quarter basis. We currently expect total average linked quarter loan growth to be in the 1% to 1.5% range in quarter one. Total average deposits increased $19 billion or 6.9% over the same quarter of last year and 1.7% on a linked quarter basis. Growth in non-interest bearing and low interest checking, money market and saving deposits remained strong on a year-over-year basis, and continue to more than offset the run-off of maturing larger dollar time deposits. Turning to Slide 8 and credit quality, total net charge-offs declined 1% on a year-over-year basis and increased 4.5% on a linked quarter basis primarily due to lower recoveries. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 47 basis points in the fourth quarter, a slight increase over the third quarter. Non-performing assets decreased by 2.8% on a linked quarter basis and 15.8% over the fourth quarter of 2014. The fourth quarter provision for credit losses was equal to net charge-offs which compares to a release of reserves of $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $10 million in the third quarter of 2015. As we move into 2016, we would expect that reserves will begin to build the support loan growth. Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we currently expect net charge-offs and total non-performing assets to remain relatively stable in the first quarter of 2016. Slide 9 gives a view of our fourth quarter and full year of 2015 results versus comparable time periods. As I mentioned, our diluted EPS of $0.80 includes $0.01 related to net impact of the sale of our HSA deposit portfolio partially offset by accruals related to the legal and compliance matters. Fourth quarter net income decreased 12 million or 0.8% year-over-year, this is principally due to a higher provision for credit losses, increase in net interest income primarily driven by growth in earnings assets, lower non-interest income impacted by the 2014 Nuveen gain, partially offset by increases in payments related revenue, trust and investment management fees and the HSA deposit sale gain. On a linked quarter basis, net income was lower by $13 million or 0.9% mainly due to predicted seasonal increase in non-interest expense and an increase in the provision for credit losses partially offset by higher net revenue primarily due to loan growth. Turning to Slide 10, net interest income increased year-over-year by $72 million or 2.6%. The increase was the result of growth in average earning assets of 5.1% partially offset by a lower net interest margin. The net interest margin of 3.06% was 8 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2014. The decline was primarily due to a change in loan portfolio mix, as well as the growth in the investment portfolio at lower average rates and lower reinvestment rates. Net interest income increased $50 million on a linked quarter basis, primarily due to higher average total loans. The net interest margin of 3.06% was 2 basis points higher than the third quarter. The increase in the net interest margin was principally due to higher loan growth which resulted in lower cash balances. We currently expect that the net interest margin will be relatively stable in the first quarter. Slide 11 highlights non-interest income which decreased $30 million or 1.3% year-over-year. The year-over-year decrease in non-interest income was primarily due to the impact of the 2014 Nuveen gain partially offset by fee revenue growth and the HSA deposit share gain. Higher credit and debit card revenue, trust and investment management fees and merchant processing services were partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenue primarily due to an unfavorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights net of hedging activities. Momentum in our payment businesses was reflected in our fourth quarter results. Credit and debit card fees grew 8.1% on a year-over-year basis, principally driven by higher volumes which were up 6% compared to 5.3% in quarter three. Merchant processing revenue increased 2.3% year-over-year, and approximately 6.5% excluding the impact of foreign currency rate changes. The growth was driven by higher transaction volumes, account growth and equipment sales to merchants related to new chip card technology requirements. These equipment sales were modestly lower than the amount recognized in quarter three as expected. On a linked quarter basis, non-interest income was higher by $14 million or 0.6% principally due to seasonally higher credit and debit card revenue and the HSA deposit sale gain partially offset by lower corporate payment product revenue reflecting the seasonally higher quarter three government related transaction volume. Mortgage banking revenue was also lower as expected primarily due to seasonally lower origination revenue. We would expect that fee revenue in quarter one will be seasonally lower on a linked quarter basis. Moving to Slide 12, non-interest expense was essentially flat year-over-year. Higher compensation expense which reflected the impact of merit increases and higher staffing for risk and compliance activity, along with higher employee benefit expense driven by pension cost were largely offset by lower marketing and business development expenses, principally due to charitable contributions recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014 and lower other expense reflecting a net year-over-year impact of legal accruals. On a linked quarter basis, non-interest expense increased $34 million or 1.2% as predicted reflecting seasonally higher costs related to investments and tax advantage projects and accruals related to legal and compliance matters, partially offset by the favorable impact of reduced mortgage related compliance and talent upgrade costs which were elevated in quarter three and declined as expected in quarter four. Compensation expense declined reflecting the impact of expense management initiatives and declines in variable compensation. Employee benefits expense also declined driven by lower payroll tax expense and healthcare costs. We would expect expenses to be relatively stable in quarter one compared quarter four, seasonally higher benefits expense will be offset by seasonally lower tax credit amortization and the impact of the credit card portfolio acquisition. Turning to Slide 13, as Richard mentioned our capital position remains strong. We returned 61% of our earnings to shareholders during the quarter. Dividends accounted for 32% while stock repurchases accounted for the remaining 29%. For the full year, we returned 72% of our earnings to shareholders and we expect to remain in our 60% to 80% range going forward. Our common equity tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as is fully implemented at December 31st was 9.1% which is well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. Our intangible book value per share rose to 17.44 at December 31st representing a 9.3% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 1.4% increase over the prior quarter. I will now turn the call back to Richard. Richard Davis : Thanks, Kathy. I\u2019m proud of our fourth quarter and full year results. We reported record full year net income and record revenue for the quarter. We remained industry leading performance measures and reported a $0.19 return on tangible common equity in the quarter. We delivered on our promise to work toward positive operating leverage with the efforts that we've made through our efficiency program. And we continue to make strategic investments in our businesses and focus on innovation for the benefit of our customers. As we look at 2016 we start the year from a position of strength as we continue to build revenue momentum, thoughtfully manage expenses, work diligently to exceed customer expectations and to create value for our shareholders in a competitive marketplace. We remain focused on delivering consistent, predictable, and repeatable financial results for the benefit of our customers, our employees, our communities and our shareholders. That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Kathy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer your questions. Bob Kleiber : Maria we can go ahead now and open for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom of RBC Capital Markets. Jon Arfstrom : Richard, maybe a question for you on just winding and your overall move, obviously pretty negatives some of the global macro stuff that we're seeing but at the same time you've held your growth guidance, your typical growth trends you are actually come in a bit ahead of that. So, maybe if you could just step back and give us a bit of the state of the union of winding and how you're feeling about the economy and I guess I'm also curious in terms what you're seeing from the consumer in terms of their all time loan demand there? Richard Davis : First of all, I have predicted that question, I was thinking of it this morning, but a club with American bank, we do primarily business in the domestic United States and we're very much a consumer small business payments kind of a company, so just by what is going on in the backdrop around the world with the China re-evaluation and what's happening in oil and some of those areas which we\u2019re not immune to balances and process, we're not seeing the majority of that on our books or by our customers. So, we're actually seeing a continued steady, I'll say slow but steady improvement every quarter and our customers are reflecting that across the board from the large corporate customers, who are still doing robust M&A transactions to restructuring the portfolio, all the way down to the small businesses which continue to grow for us double-digits based on their interest and setting themselves up for our better consumer wide recovery and just general people who are using banks for their retail services. So, I am quite optimistic against that negative backdrop and I know we won\u2019t be immune to all of that. But based on our geography, based on our mix of business, based on our history, and based on our appetite for risk I think we\u2019re actually fairly immune from most of those issues at this stage, and yet we trespassed for the worst scenarios that would of course affect us. So I would say the across the board from a lending perspective that same range you see in the 1% and 1.5% we\u2019re predicting again for this quarter already off to a really nice start and we\u2019re not seeing any disruption neither from the 25 basis point increase which we knew would be more symbolic and actually not yet from the impacts of the stock market of the China re-evaluation. So at this point we\u2019re remaining optimistic and have cautious and careful way. Jon Arfstrom : And then is Bill Parker there? Richard Davis : Bill is here, here you go. Bill Parker : Yes hi John. Jon Arfstrom : Hey Bill. Anything to add in terms of from a credit perspective and the cash you talked about the reserve releases are over and you\u2019ve all been very transparent on that. But anything from a credit perspective that\u2019s making you a bit more nervous so that is a change maybe compared to a quarter or two ago? Bill Parker : Yes Jon first I\u2019d direct you to the dependency slide and you can look through those. And if you look at of the portfolios if you see sort of year-over-year delinquency patterns are either stable or better than last year. So, overall, very strong of course the one exception is energy and some of the metals and mining related credit. We do have that small energy portfolio of 1.2% of our total loans. So I\u2019d just say we have seen some downgrades there and we\u2019ve been building our allocated reserves for that all year long. But we built that at low 30s price of oil. So we feel like we\u2019re good for now but we\u2019ll see where oil settles down, but either way that\u2019s not going to have a material impact on kind of the overall go forward credit performance. Jon Arfstrom : And in terms of the way we see things just the assumptions should be maybe go right pass back up in terms of the provision over charge offs just building for loan growth. Is that how we should approach it? Bill Parker : Yes, exactly, yes. Richard Davis : I would still jump in there Jon it is the old fashioned days where you\u2019re supposed to provide for the next new loan right and I think we\u2019re at that inflection point. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll start moving up very quickly because we\u2019re settling here at that turning point of no provision. But we don\u2019t see anything in the near-term that\u2019s going to harm that and I want to pick up on energy and metals and mining. We do stress test our portfolios routinely and not just for those particular categories but tangent effects it might have on other parts of our customers and portfolios and in certain geographies. And as Bill mentioned we\u2019ve increased the reserve levels for both of those categories and continue to have the room and the expectation if we need to do more we can. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Erika Najarian : When we last spoke Richard I think you were fairly optimistic about your prospects for 2016, and I think we talked about the concept of USB being a maximized franchise. As we think about building revenue momentum, slow but steady into 2016, could you give us sort of what the top-three drivers are in terms of what could drive year-over-year of improvement in revenue outside of, of course? And any more increases on the short-end? Richard Davis : Yes, sure I will, actually I asked her more than the question, as I think I also mentioned when you and I have the fire side chat, I might add without the fireplace. You\u2019re talking about what kind of assumptions we would in our plan, and we actually expected to have two rate increases from the last time I talked to you. We hope for one in December, we expect a one in June. And that is really the amount of the risk we have placed into our plan this year so when we\u2019re halfway with one of them at least at this point if it's fixed. So that alone does actually help us. So we\u2019re not relying on that to the very point you made. The most important thing that happened to us is just a continued improve recovering economy where people feel they can consume, people feel they don\u2019t have to save quite as much and that they\u2019ve got a higher backstop and either in their own statements account or in their home equity or in their own debt positions where they can start spending money and feel more comfortable about it, that\u2019s going to be huge for us. That\u2019s way more important than any interest rate because as I said earlier, we\u2019re a consumer middle market wholesale bank and those sort of things that matter the most. But I want to say the things that we could, our shoulder against to watch for improvement this year one will the continued success we\u2019re having in relationship management with our customers. I think I\u2019ve said this before but we\u2019re developing a much smarter technology around who our customers are, what they expect, what they\u2019re likely next needs are, particularly around the mobile banking aspect. And so we\u2019re investing a great deal of our money and time. And in this whole efficiency program you never heard me take anything away from our investment and innovation and entrepreneurship and we\u2019re not because I do believe that\u2019s going to be the next big idea. So having a payments business and a bank connected together we have the best of both roles because we can touch virtually any paradigm buyer, seller and moving money back and forth. So that\u2019s our number one we\u2019re going to lean on the bank and the payments business that\u2019s coming together. Number two the corporate trust business, that\u2019s been remarkably good for us doesn\u2019t get a lot of visibility it\u2019s actually confusing to a lot of people, but we\u2019re not only domestically quite large and capable but when you start looking at who that\u2019s starting to build over across the pound over in Europe with both our front administration and our new class of corporate trust we\u2019re going to expect a lot from those two businesses as well in 2016. And finally I'll say the next chapter in our wholesale bank becoming we've moved out of the audition stage and we\u2019re now bonafide one of the important banks to deal with the large Fortune 100 companies and you think from an M&A deal to our first pallet lead on the deal to just moving money on a very sophisticated way. We are continuing to see momentum there I'm quite proud of what the wholesale commercial bank has done we are celebrating Dick Payne\u2019s retirement this quarter and we are also celebrating the addition of two new leaders coming up from within the company to run the wholesale bank and the capital markets and I expect a lot from the two of them and they've got the capability and energy to pick up where Dick has left us which is a really good starting point. So I would say those three things Erika to answer your question. Erika Najarian : Thank you for that. And just a follow-up on the question on credit oil and gas and metals and mining aside charge off level for the industry have been abnormally low and I guess maybe Bill if you don\u2019t mind jumping in could you remind us what you think given the risk portfolio embedded U.S. Bank right now. What would you think is your normal charge off rate and how long does it take to get there? Bill Parker : So again when we talk about normalized we call that through the cycle rate and that a rate that we've talked about before this between 95 and 100 basis points but you don\u2019t really get there you just go through it when you are going into a recession or you are in a recession. So in times where there is stable employment as running right now the rate you see for us is sort of the what would be a normal rate in this kind of economic environment but that over the cycle rate is something that we calculate every quarter and it remains between 95 and 100 basis points it really has not materially changed for us for many-many years. Erika Najarian : Understood, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. John McDonald : Richard I guess I was kind of wondering how should we track the progress of your new emphasis on the non FTE expense control this year where should we look at to kind of see how you are doing from the external metrics and then what kind of confidence level do you have and the ability to deliver a positive operating leverage this year in the environment that you are planning for? Richard Davis : First of all you can measure all of our expenses quarter-to-quarter and I think you know we are as transparent as silathane so we\u2019re going to tell you exactly any moving parts and then you can model what's left but you will see the benefits in this quarter and will you see them in the next this two current year of both the FTE watch hold placement we have had on adding people unless we needed them and the non the more discretionary expenses. I will tell you however and we are also going to tell you about along the way how we are going to spend money on things that we think are quite important I will start bringing more visibility to our innovation budget and the kind of money we are spending to be at the front-end of some of the those new ideas and we\u2019re going to be introducing a very significant branding and reputation campaign in 2016 which impacts some of that savings will go toward because I want to keep investing I just want to put in the more of the right places. So no watch for existing number but watch for the moving parts and I will give you the visibility of that so that you can make that assessment over the course of time. John McDonald : In terms of what you are expecting for kind of revenue expense growth this year Richard and? Richard Davis : Well done, I forgot [Multiple Speakers] yes we are, we, no one quarter is going to be a positive operating leverage in this environment but we are still planning this year our plan say positive operating as if for 2016 I will also remind all of you that quarter one is our weakest quarter so it\u2019s not the one I'm going to be able to showcase and show off as our strongest quarter because this is seasonally lower for us, but it will I think a better first quarter than you have seen than the lot but it is certainly is going to be on its way to a positive operating leverage if we don\u2019t get at least that second of two rate increases that will put a challenge on that ability so I'm not going to make any guarantees but I'm more concerned less about the rate itself and the fact that rates moving up will continue to reflect that the Fed believes the economy is stronger what we care most about is just strong economy, the metrics and the arithmetic of the 25 basis points is far or less important so we will get to watch it as we go and I'll keep you as clearly outlined on how we think that's going. John McDonald : Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on the loan growth, what got better this quarter it gets you into that 1.7% growth and what are the assumptions underlie the outlook for the 1% to 1.5% range going forward is it more of a consumer pickup driving that and do you assume as the United slows a bit here going forward? Andy Cecere : Hi, John, this is Andy. I would corporate continues with the strong as you saw year-over-year growth about 9% and strong on a linked quarter basis I think what's turned a little bit more positive is the consumer side of the equation our two fronts our mortgage activity on balance sheet that jumbles principally continues to be strong and home equity for the first time in a whiles we\u2019re seeing growth in that category and as we dig into that a little bit further I understand what that's about we are seeing consumers taking home equity and using it for home equity so using it to improve their homes, furnishings and things of that sort so those two categories are strengthening and finally card spend and card balances are also growing so I do think we see continued strength on wholesale with increasing strength on consumer. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Kathy, if I could just follow-up on the 1Q expense outlook I think you said stable linked quarter, are there any one time expenses related to that Fidelity Card deal because I think you normally have some seasonality on the way down on expenses on one tier? Kathy Rogers : Yes let me talk about that, there's a couple of things that are going on with that, because you're right, we normally would see a first quarter decline in expenses but I'll answer your first question and add some more light, so yes, we would expect to see some onetime expenses related to the Fidelity card deal that will come through in the first quarter and then just the overall operating expenses related to that will increase as we move through the year starting in the first quarter. Additionally, if you think about first quarter expense, we usually have the seasonally lower first quarter of course our tax credit expense in fourth quarter was lower than we normally would have seen and that's really due to a mix of where that's recorded so you also saw that our tax rate was a bit higher. So, that benefit that we get on a linked quarter basis for tax credit is going to be lower than what you'd have seen in the past and that coupled with the Fidelity card business shows to be relatively stable. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then a bigger picture Richard for you, maybe you can comment on your ability and appetite on the acquisition side of things, I think you guys talked about in the third quarter 10-Q, some things around to know your customer and obviously there's some price resetting occurring right now as we speak, so maybe you could update it for the current environment and how you can re-apply your net if at all? Richard Davis : Yes. So the answer I'll give you Matt, first and foremost is what you see we've done is what we want to do more up, so you saw these two fairly large portfolios in the card business that we continue to be attracted toward, these are picking up portfolios that already have momentum, the picking up portfolios and we're finding more and more people interested in allowing us to take a look at that. So, I hope there'll be more of those. We've talked before about our merchant acquiring business and the -- where we've cobbled that together over the last now 15 years is to find a partner, work with him on a JV kind of a basis with their rent to own sense and there's more of that in Europe that we're continuing to look at and hopefully opportunities in that regard as well. And then finally the more classic kind of opportunities, I talk about innovation and there maybe some small businesses of small companies from small garage, deal that we might find where we want to bring the capability in house and not outsource it and if those come along at the right price at the right moment, we'll also not hesitate there. As it relates to full bank in acquisitions and interests, our interests remains exactly what it was, we don\u2019t have a high interest and there's no one knocking on our door and yet at the same time it's a good thing because given the consent order that we entered into in October we wouldn't be allowed to do a full bank acquisition until we're through and of half that considerable on which we're moving swiftly along and actually have been predicting that we can move that as swiftly as anyone ever has. So, we're well aware that at the point in time we want to buy someone we want to be past that point and our goal is to be there but now it's not inhibiting anything that we would otherwise want to do and I think portfolios and merchant acquirer will be the two places you should watch the most. Matt O'Connor: And what so fast as someone else's gone through a consent order? Richard Davis : You actually don\u2019t know because I am not exactly should roll us into one but I know that there is in our case we've talked with our OCC which is the lead regulator here, and made it clear to them that our goals to satisfy the aspects of the consent order that would otherwise preclude us from being able to buy things and make that our number one area, they've made that clearly well that they understand that's our goal and I don't believe you have to be all out to be all done, you just need to be accomplishing the things that are most concerned to them as it relates to branch related, know your customer thing. So, we're going to approach on that basis. And the OCC has also been on record saying how one of their goals this year is to move more swiftly with the closure of open issues and we're going to hopefully be one of the first to prove that and we'll work through that swiftly and we've been working on it actually for quite some time and have lined everything up now to move out of that as soon as they give us permission as we prove our sustainability. So, it's not impairing us now I mean well, if we're not out of that in a year or two but it's not in the harms-way at this point now. Matt O'Connor: I mean I could just squeeze in one more here, I guess the point I'm getting at is -- you've been more conservative while pre-crisis, during the crisis, post-crisis, and I'm trying to get sense of if the mentality is let\u2019s see if some of our conservatism and capital and deposit base to look for opportunities out there, I mean my guess some sellers maybe interested at a much lower price than before, there's some assets in the capital markets that are being significantly re-priced, you could probably gain a lot of share on energy if you wanted to now, so I'm just trying to get a sense if like is that the mentality or is it just [Multiple Speakers]. Richard Davis : We've been together the whole time, so, what you know about us is we kind of set a monster in place which is we will never do anything that doesn't look sustainable and repeatable, and it sounds corny but we've done it long enough it's real. And you think about opportunities that come along if it is a portfolio and it's priced perfectly and it's within the scheme of our risk tolerance absolutely we're all over it. Many of them that will come to us at a slightly disadvantaged risk perspective and if we don't convince ourselves to make it up in volume or to buy it now and change our original mantra we'll take the hit from you guys for not having that acquisition but we will take the benefit years later or months later and we don\u2019t have a problem. So, what I'd say, our conservatism is every bit exactly what it was before and during the downturn and we're not tinted by anything right now that would otherwise cause us to change that thinking and that could disappoint a few people that slow and steady it kind of wins the race, so we\u2019re going to stay in that boat. Operator : Our next question comes from the line Scott Siefers of Sandler O'Neill. Scott Siefers : Let\u2019s see first one is sort of a piggy back question did you guys quantify the specific size of both the extra taking and then the legal and compliance accruals? And if not, I mean could you please? Kathy Rogers : Yes. Richard Davis : I mean it is our job to do. We have the best to know it out so I could [Multiple Speakers] either away so it is not... Kathy Rogers : So thank you very much. Richard Davis : I am calling you for the money. Kathy Rogers : Yes. So the, Scott yes so the gain on the HSA sale is right in that $50 million range and I would suggest you think about half of that were related to the regulatory and legal accruals. Scott Siefers : And then just so I am certain the guidance for fees and expenses in the first quarter is off the reported numbers out, am I right? Kathy Rogers : That\u2019s right. Scott Siefers : So thank you for that and then second question either for you Kathy or Richard just as it relates to margin. Even though you guys characterized as relatively stable it was still up which I consider a good thing. Just curious in your mind what it would take whether it\u2019s how much more rate increases, how many more rate increases I should say, or an increased pace of the increases until sort of the buyers get a little more optimistic, in other words at what point do we more visibly see the margins starting to expand? Kathy Rogers : Yes. I think there is a couple of things I do think we need a couple of more rate increases to see a material change in our margin. I think that was as important Scott is that we have to we\u2019ve been talking a lot about this pricing pressure on some of the different portfolios. And I think we need to see that start to stabilize a little bit. But certainly as we think about where we are today and if you think about where our margin improved from last quarter. We did have some nice growth in our loan portfolio which allowed us to essentially fund out some cash for that allowed us to go forward. So as if we move forward I think the mix of our business interest rates increasing will certainly help in some of that price pressure easing will certainly be in potential list. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Just back on that on the margin comment just to clarify that, so basically if you don\u2019t see any incremental rate hikes, if you don\u2019t get that June hike, is it fair to assume that you expect a relatively stable margin through all 2016 or could you see degradation? Kathy Rogers : I think it\u2019s going to come, and I would suggest that it would probably I would say it start with relatively stable. But I think some of the caveats for that would be really around some of the mix of our portfolio and then of our loan growth and then also as you know in our securities portfolio we have about $2 billion run off, so to the extent where those reinvestment rates falls could potentially impact the margin. And then also I would tell you we\u2019re keeping our eyes very close on the long term rates and what\u2019s happening on the long term rates. So I think all of those together would impact it, but with no rate increase I would say we\u2019re probably in a little bit of a steady state here. John Pancari : And then back to the M&A topic, Richard I heard when you said about interest and M&A. If you did not have the consent order in place, what would be your appetite around larger whole bank deals? I know you used to say you had no interest in the holding company transactions, and shying away from large deals. But is that appetite steadily changing given the disruption and the opportunity maybe to capitalize on valuations et cetera? Richard Davis : No, you can all exaggerate on no. But the reason I said I am on record for a quite while John saying that from our own experiences of the statute I am going to call it a statute limitations it\u2019s not legal by any means was that you can still pick up a company and you can still be placed in harms away for dealing with any of their potential problems involving their own. And I think it\u2019s all the way back to 2007. When you think of \u201907 that is in your window on when things start to roll off in terms of statute and we\u2019re already seeing things continue to come to and people try to get under the wire. I\u2019ve always said 2017 will be the first time we want to look at where our appetite for bringing on a risk into our company as we simply couldn\u2019t do diligence for and couldn\u2019t possibly imagine that at least elegantly have lined up with our current moment where we can\u2019t do it anyway but we don\u2019t want to anyway, and I wouldn\u2019t be interested. The pricing doesn\u2019t change you can\u2019t get a good enough deals if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting. And I could be wrong but I feel very strongly about that and have for a long time and I would say that as the moments clear let\u2019s say a year or more from now our ability is there, our appetite will be higher, the moment and time I think will be safer and all those things will line up and then we could be very much involved and engaged in that. But the reason we\u2019re most importantly of less interested is we don\u2019t really need it, I mean much of is attractive to have the wallpaper behind me and somebody else shaking hands it's really not necessary for this company and we are in every business line that we\u2019re in that we want, we\u2019re not in anything, we don\u2019t want to be in if we do we sell it like the HSA deposit business. And we don\u2019t covered anything we don\u2019t have, we just want to be better at what we\u2019re doing and do it better deeper wherever we are. That would be attractive to me but it\u2019s not going to be a headline on kind of the deal at least as long as I am around, this never has been, it\u2019s just going to be a steady state kind of an approach. But I would hope that all those stars would line up, so our options are better in a year or two from now. John Pancari : And then if I could just throw in one more on the loan growth side on the residential mortgage front can you just I know you indicated that growth could remain around where it is I think you implied that and so you still have the appetite to continue to add to that portfolio regardless of what the longer end of the curve is doing here? Richard Davis : Yes. We continue to add residential mortgages principally jumbo prime mortgages home equity as I said is the other category that's growing and balance credit cards. Those are areas that can, the slope is upward the area continues to be strong as auto lending and as Kathy mentioned a little bit the challenge on the loan lending as well behind this great, spreads are challenged but given our cost of funds we are still very profitable but not as profitable as they were a year ago. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Miller of FBR. Paul Miller : On the mortgage banking side, we know we had the new disclosures in the CFEP trade, but it looks like your mortgage banking was in line with what we expected. Can you talk about how you managed to do the trade? It looks like it wasn't that big of a deal for you guys? Richard Davis : Yes Paul. So we had a significant team of folks who are focused it is growing effort and we were able to automate much of the process we had about 40 major conversion to do that last weekend in fact so it was a little bit of a backlog that occurred because just natural process of the new disclosures new requirements costs more time but it wasn\u2019t usually impactful and as you said our results were pretty much in line with what we expected we might have a little bit of a pickup in the first quarter from that lag but we are principally automated in that and very good shape. Paul Miller : And then on the other side, because you do have a pretty good pulse on the consumers out there, do you see a big pickup in purchases? We had a very strong purchase market, probably the strongest we've had in seven years in 2015. Do you see that continue in 2016? Richard Davis : So the year started as you know all about that so the year started in about 50-50 purchase versus refinance ended the year about two thirds one third and sort of the normal environment is 75-25 and that's what we expect as to go into 2016 about 75% of the volume being new money and 25% refinancings. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Nomura. Bill Carcache : On your Fidelity co-brand win, it seems like that's a product that's going to give you exposure to national spend from a fairly affluent customer base. Should we conclude that you guys are seeking to become more of a national player in card? It certainly seems like you're expanding beyond -- well beyond your footprint? Andy Cecere : While we already are a national player in card so this was just adding in that what we\u2019re seeking is always a good portfolio with good customers and this is a great example it is a high quality portfolio it offers us a great opportunity for growth and our customers service levels with this portfolio I think is what's going to make the difference so it's a continuation now we\u2019re doing that will be also the same with the Auto Club portfolio. So as Richard mentioned I think those are focus areas for us have been and will continue to be. Richard Davis : Hey Bill, it's Richard. I don\u2019t know how long you have followed us but many-many years ago one of our biggest moment in time was when we had lost the WorldPerks card from Northwest airlines and it went to American Express were in Delta by Northwest and we came up with the FlexPerks card which I am going to say this now when I retire would be one of the top three things I think we ever did really-really well here and is very national. In fact when I talk to you guys if auto were to go down to $10 to $15 and would shut at the thought but if I had to talk to you about where the tangent risk would be we would be talking about the unemployment issues in those areas affected mostly by oil and the energy and our very own customers you may be surprised have a lot of people in parts that we don\u2019t have branches that have that credit card and like it a lot so it will be our own victim of success here but it's been quite national for five-six years and Andy is right we just want to be more perceived at that and we are not going to hesitate to take national forward growth just like we worked commercial real estate or wholesale banking if we want book for branches to be considered a national player and everything else. Bill Carcache : If I could ask one more on a different topic, there are some banks who many would put into the quality bucket who have significant excess liquidity parked at the Fed. And there are others that use their excess liquidity to restructure the right-hand side of their balance sheets and therefore don't have that liquidity available today. Obviously everyone regards you guys as being in that kind of high-quality camp, but you don't appear to have as much excess liquidity that you're holding at the Fed. Can you remind us of why that is? Kathy Rogers : Yes. We look at our liquidity as you know we have got 9.1% on our common equity tier one ratio that's about 110 basis points above our target of 8%. And if you think about it we\u2019re holding that excess rate between our target and where we\u2019re actually performing because we haven\u2019t been able to really reinvest or grow our loan balances as much as we would want so if we can get back into that 6% plus the balance sheet growth and so forth I think that you will see our capital to be right in line with kind of our real target. Richard Davis : And it is exactly right Kathy and I would add actually the one of the reasons we don\u2019t access liquidity on the balance sheet is because we were building our securities portfolio to adjust the LCR exactly the right time at the time the deposits were growing faster than loans and we used the excess to build securities so we are very balanced and we sit in that situation today so we are not lying at the Fed in an any material way you are right. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo of CLSA. Mike Mayo : Well, I'll repeat the same question as in the past Richard Davis versus the 10-year. And the 10-year has been winning recently, and here you are talking about faster loan growth, which seems to be that you should be winning over the 10-year as far as what the 10-year is saying about growth. On the other hand, you are seeing what's going on in the market. So my question is, is the economy getting better or worse? What's your conviction level and confidence? And also, as the capital markets, at least in certain areas of the capital markets, liquidity is less plentiful. Is that an opportunity for you to step in and lend even more? Because you said the expansion in loan growth is on the consumer side and on the wholesale side it's the same. But is this an opportunity for you to step in and borrow where some of the nonbanks might be retreating -- I'm sorry, a chance for you to lend more where some of the nonbanks are retreating? Richard Davis : Let's start first on just general lending appetite, as a junior lender years ago there's still a steady state paradigm that you only make along based on abilities, stability and willingness and the willingness is a low part, people are able to take loans, they're more stable than they had been and other than 8 years but they're just not willing so we can't create willing and we're not going to create willing and those are the most willing are the ones that are too eager, and we don't want them so, that's impart why you're going to see our loan growth I think be steady but not robust because we're going to reflect whatever the economy sets, I also do think our market share has grown a lot and you've all the data to prove it. So, we're getting first look from a lot of customers that maybe in a decade before didn\u2019t think of us as much. On the capital market side I think you'll also find answers yes we can step in and now be a lender of support for those who have the other alternatives and want to use it in more traditional balance sheet approach to growing their business and as I've said earlier we're no longer auditioning, We're well ensconced now one of the top two or three banks in most large companies\u2019 portfolio or the place they would have called for the opportunity and that comes from our debt ratings Mike. I mean if you're a C suite person at a fortune anything or one of the largest private companies, you really do value our ratings and you value the top notch level that we have and that means more to you than sometimes pricing which we also offer. So, I think in many cased we'll get more than our fare share of the capital markets where there's an interest in using that as an alternative to traditional financing and we set ourselves up perfectly to be early call and a chance to deliver and you might add to any of those since you run them. Bill Parker : I think that's right, and I think the point that you made which is the market share point of the equation and I saw that growth perhaps is a little higher than what the average and most of that's coming from taking market share and that's certainly driving the wholesale side of the equation and it comes back to that ratings discussion that you discussed. Mike Mayo : On that last point, as you see private equity firms back away from some energy companies and you see some loan funds that have gotten burnt back away, is that an opportunity for you to step in and lend more to say oil and gas companies? And I'm sorry I got on the call a couple minutes late. Did you indicate what are you reserves against oil and gas loans? Richard Davis : Yes I will jump in first of all, nothing you said changes our appetite for risk, we're not going to change it no matter how attractive things look and you targeted that part earlier. As Bill talked earlier, our energy portfolio is only 1.2% of the company, we've added reserves to at this particular quarter, we're at 5.4% reserves against the energy portfolio for our company which I think will prevail to be a reasonable place at this point in time with oil at $29, $30, I also said we've plenty of room and appetite and willingness to move those new reserves higher up if we need to and we're watching as we stress test, the heck out of those things. But as it relates to taking alternatives, we want to be a capital markets alternative to more traditional lending but having to do with the risk profile that's unique and different than it is today, it doesn\u2019t matter what it is we're not going to do it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja of JP Morgan. Vivek Juneja : A couple of questions, just trying to get a sense of what you are seeing in the marketplace, C&I loans, your yields were flat, LIBOR was up through the quarter. Can you talk a little bit about -- we're not seeing any impact of that -- why? And then yields are fairly low at 286 or something like that I believe, so -- or no, 268 actually? Andy Cecere : This is Andy so the corporate spreads are a function of two things, one is where our growth is coming is more from the high quality side of the portfolio so a little bit less on the highly levered things like that that are falling off and some of the leasing portfolio and we're seeing high quality corporate growth which is a little thinner strategy all right. The second is some of the growth that you're seeing is also short term in terms of the tenure which is causing -- it is a little bit of a thinner spread perhaps our linkage to a bond deal that's short term in nature related to an M&A transaction, so it is a little thinner again and what is typically on the books, but again high quality, still profitable but just a little different mix. Vivek Juneja : Secondly, on the NIM side, going back to the comments you and Kathy and the others made, you've got a very healthy amount of noninterest deposits, even though I know it's only 25 basis points. I'm presuming -- are you firstly, are you passing -- have you begun passing anything on at all to any of your customers? And secondly, given that shouldn't we -- what's offsetting the NIM benefit from all of your low cost deposit base? Kathy Rogers : Yes. So at this point, we are passing we're seeing some interest rate increases particularly around our wholesale side. We haven\u2019t seen a whole lot of movement right now on the consumer side and I think that\u2019s pretty true across the industry. So that is as we look into quarter one that the fact that those re-pricings are starting but starting a little bit maybe lower than what we would have potentially modelled I think is basically benefiting us. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush of NAB Research. Nancy Bush : Richard, several quarters ago I asked you about projects that you might be investing in, if you saw better revenue trends. I think you said at that time you had a whole list of projects that you wanted to dive into when things looked a little better. Are we at that point yet? Do you still have that list, or have you started to implement some of these investments? Richard Davis : I remember saying that, and first of all what we didn\u2019t do is with our efficiency program we didn\u2019t stop as I said earlier our innovation and our investment in our technology. So one thing is that I would have put back first was something I never took out. The other one I think I mentioned was wealth management and the ultrahigh net worth and building more locations, physical locations, people to come in visit. We currently have six I\u2019d love to move that to a much higher level. It's going to be a long investment lead so I\u2019ve got to be thoughtful I do it if I could right now. But the investment we did so long and until I see a more robust economy with interest rate increases I would be putting too much ahead of that and put ourselves on harms-way. So those would be the two that I would mention, I meant when I mentioned it to you and one of them we\u2019re still doing the other one we\u2019ve got on the place where they\u2019re ready to roll in to. Nancy Bush : Yes, and could you just give us -- Andy, this might be a question for you -- you mentioned the auto business. What's your outlook for this year? You're coming off such a strong year. Can you just sort of give us some color on that segment? Andy Cecere : I would expect the growth to be similar with what we saw off 2015, more focused on the lending side versus the leasing side and with it principally trying auto on the lending side. So, to stress this situation what might have been 110, 120 basis points is maybe down to 100 or right around that area, a lot of that\u2019s because of the aggressive nature of the manufacturers. But I think on a growth prospect a very -- prospects for \u201916 are going to be very similar to what you saw in \u201915. Nancy Bush : Are you picking up market share there? Is that part of your growth picture? Andy Cecere : Yes. We are both with dealers as well as certain manufacturers that we\u2019re trying to partner with in different ways a little bit on the lending side but also on the leasing side. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio of KBW. Chris Mutascio : A lot of my questions have been asked and answered. A couple nitpicky things I guess. Kathy, can you refresh my memory, who did you sell the HSA deposit portfolio to? Kathy Rogers : That was Optum Bank. Chris Mutascio : I am sorry, to who? Kathy Rogers : Optum Bank. Chris Mutascio : And then, and Richard, I appreciate you calling out the gain in HSA and maybe the possible offset in terms of the expenses in the quarter to get more of a run rate. And I hope you don't think I'm beating you up too much, but should I really back out the expenses in the quarter tied to legal and compliance since first quarter your level expense is supposed to be similar to the reported level in fourth quarter? Kathy Rogers : There is going to be a lot of moving parts of this and we\u2019re very early in the quarter. But I think that if you go with the guidance of just relatively stable because I think you will -- that\u2019s what we\u2019re thinking of as we look out into the first quarter. Richard Davis : I am going to give you something you don\u2019t know which is why you called. This year we\u2019re going to look back on 2015 and we\u2019re not going to payout 100% of our bonus pool. This is my 10th year as CEO and that\u2019d the first year we didn\u2019t and I am okay with that because we live and die by the sword and our guys are amazingly competent and capable. And when we have great years we pay them out handsomely over 100% of target and when we don\u2019t we don\u2019t. And so what that means to you is the accrual goes back to 100% in first quarter because you expect to make your plan. And so that\u2019s a fairly interesting delta I am not going to slide it for you exactly but that would be something that I would have told you more next quarter but I might as well change that because you are struggling to think it through why we would otherwise want to stay stable that is another fairly meaningful part of it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom of Guggenheim. Eric Wasserstrom : Just one final question on expenses, which has been discussed at great length, but I just want to understand how -- what is actually funding these growth initiatives. Is it strictly the benefit of the top-line growth that's occurring in some measure? Or is it coming from efficiency savings that continue to be gained in other places? Richard Davis : Well, in terms of you are speaking innovation particularly we just have that in the run rate for about seven or eight years it\u2019s just something that would be easy to slowdown and that\u2019s the part of descending that we didn\u2019t. I can\u2019t underestimate enough when you have a acquiring payments business not just in issuing you get to work with the merchant not the commercial customer the merchant the one who sells stuff and then you get to bring your consumers in and we pilot and test all kinds of relationships and partnerships and we learn best practices, consumer preferences, merchant progresses and some of the stuff never makes it to the street because it\u2019s really a bad idea but it looked good. So that we don\u2019t want to slowdown that's been in the run rate for Eric for as many years as I could remember so there is no new increased cost and as I said earlier things like our large brand reputation campaign we are going to launch this year will cost money we haven\u2019t have the run rate so it is going to come impart from the efficiency program some we will give it back to the shareholders some we will keep for ourselves and investment in things people always wanted to do so that's kind of the way to think about it. Eric Wasserstrom : Okay. And you've given I think very clear guidance about the first quarter, but has anything that's occurred in terms of portfolio acquisitions or other kinds of dynamics further disrupt what would be the typical quarterly cadence in terms of expense seasonality? Richard Davis : That is all. You are right to ask that in fact I think in this quarter we are going to go back at our next opportunity to show and remind people how steady our fourth quarters are and how -- which quarter is strongest which one is weakest and how the linked quarters move and I am only saying that because it's a really it's so consistent you can set your watch by it and it is a probably a good way to go back and look. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Credit quality for you guys has been good and you continue to expect that it's going to remain very good, but the world is obviously starting to worry about bigger other things. So you guys don't have to worry so much about energy, but Rich, I'm just wondering -- I don't know if Bill's there -- but back in all of your industries and your subgroups, what are you starting to watch for? What, if anything, are you concerned could go the wrong way? We're certainly not seeing it in NPAs, delinquencies, et cetera, across the Company. So can you just tell us your underlying comfort in terms of how things are going and what you will be watchful of? Richard Davis : I will have Bill answer that but I do want to call out what a good question that was because dealing with our Board of Directors we haven\u2019t really focused on credit in many years and I'm putting it right back at the front runner because I want to start watching trends and we are going to watch competitors and we\u2019re going to watch different buckets and tranches and we are going to learn a lot all of us by what's about to happen if we start learning about these small moves now don\u2019t look very big that they can be quite tell-tell of what is going to happen so you ask more questions like that because that's going I think give us a chance to I'll talk about risk profile and likely future losses but Bill why don\u2019t you answer the question and what's your -- more or so a word about after energy and precious metals. Bill Parker : Yes I mean really it is the impacted areas in the country that we would look most closely at so if you think about the Dakota there is not a lot of people or infrastructure out there other than what's in the oil and gas but if you get to a state like Texas and the Houston area where it is a fairly energy dependent economy so you really look at a kind of newly unemployed trend and that's a thing that's going to generate potential delinquencies in the consumer portfolios and then that just has a ripple effect in terms of lower demand for small business both etcetera so we would focus very closely on watching the economies around the kind of the energy belt areas in the United States we do have as Richard said earlier we\u2019re national and for real state national and our own card so we have been watching carefully we have not seen any impact yet even though we would be seeing 50,000 oil workers have lost their jobs in the last year or so but it really has not shown up and I feel bad but those are the kinds of things that we want every day. Ken Usdin : Okay, and one follow-up just you guys talk a lot about the strength in the payments businesses and then we still have that offsetting potential benefit from the energy subsidy that's not quite coming through. So in terms of just payments growth and underlying, can you just talk about do you envision the energy subsidy starting to get spent? Or do you think that's just an ongoing drag in certain parts of the businesses and we're not quite seeing it offset to the positive in other? Andy Cecere : This is Andy so I wouldn\u2019t say that the energy subsidy is being spent into a large degree so we are seeing steady growth in our card growth as you saw is very good we had a very good Christmas season the holiday season if you compare our contrasted our master card numbers would show up from Black Friday through Christmas Eve would say of 7.9% growth that was just over 10% growth which is better than it was last year but it's not substantially better so we are good and steady but we are not seeing all the dollars saved on the energy side moving to spend on the consumer side. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy of Stephens. Terry McEvoy : I was wondering if you could just talk about the headwinds to credit and debit card revenue in 2016 just from lower equipment sales that kind of were up in Q3. You mentioned they were down a bit in Q4. And then maybe just as a follow-on, that same question on revenue given lower gas prices and what that does to the fleet vehicle card at Elavon? Richard Davis : Right so actually the spend activity on merchant terminals peak in the third quarter came down about 1% or 2% in the fourth quarter and I would expect it to be fairly level going into 2016. There is still a number of merchants who have been purchasing terminals that we would expect to steady state without occurring but the headwinds so to speak as you described it was about a 1.5% to 2% in the fourth quarter but I don\u2019t expect there is a lot of further headwind going into 2016. Terry McEvoy : And then just a quick question for Kathy, the tax rates kind of jumped around. Could you give us a little insight into full-year 2016 for the tax rate? Kathy Rogers : Yes, you're right, the tax rate did rise in the fourth quarter and that was principally due to the fact that we had some mix change in our tax credit business so as I look out into 2016 I'd put that rate in the kind of in that 28% to 29% range and as I've said today we're probably right in the middle of that range. Operator : This concludes our Q&A portion for today's call. I will now turn the call back over to management for any additional or closing remarks. Richard Davis : Thank you for listening to this review of our fourth quarter 2015 and full year 2015 results. Please contact us if you have any follow-up questions. Have a good day. Bill Parker : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP Operator : Good morning and welcome to U.S. Bancorp's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Following a review of the results by Richard Davis, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Kathy Rogers, U.S. Bancorp's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon Eastern Time through Wednesday, April 27th at 12 midnight. I would now turn the conference over to Jen Thompson of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. Jennifer Ann Thompson - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Melissa and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Kathy Rogers, Andy Cecere and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's first quarter results and to answer your questions. Richard and Kathy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release, and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Richard. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Jen and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. I'll begin a review of the U.S. Bank's results with a summary of the quarter's highlights on slide 3 of the presentation. U.S. Bancorp reported net income of $1.4 billion for the first quarter of 2016, or $0.76 per diluted common share. As a reminder, at the end of 2015, we announced that U.S. Bank became the exclusive issuer of the Fidelity Investments Rewards Card program and as part of that arrangement we purchased the existing card portfolio of $1.6 billion which is reflected in the company's average loan growth for the quarter. I'm very pleased with our first quarter results. Once again, we delivered industry-leading profitability. Our average loan growth exceeded the high end of our 1% to 1.5% range and the payments business remained strong. Total average loans grew 1.6% on a linked quarter basis and 5.2% year over year, adjusted for the retail card acquisition. Total average deposit growth remained strong, growing 6.3% over the previous year, which included consumer net new account growth of 3.2%. We were affected by a broader market condition, most notably related to the energy sector. While our energy portfolio is a relatively small portion of our company's overall loan portfolio at 1.3% of total loans, the deterioration in this sector has impacted certain credit metrics. This has resulted in a recognition of additional reserves of $15 million higher than charge-offs during the first quarter. I'd like to highlight that excluding the energy portfolio, credit quality for the company remained strong, which was reflected by our stable charge-off rates. Net charge-offs as a percentage of total average loans were 48 basis points, up one basis point from the prior quarter. Additionally, the company saw improvement in nonperforming assets, excluding the energy portfolio. Although the company's total nonperforming assets increased 12.9% over the prior quarter, nonperforming assets, excluding the energy portfolio improved 4.1%, reflecting the improvements particularly in our retail portfolios. For instance, residential mortgages continue to benefit from improving real estate values, which has helped to partially offset the increase in the energy loan reserve. Slide 4 provides you with a five-quarter history of our profitability metrics, which continue to be among the best in the industry. Moving to the graph on the right, this quarter's net interest margin of 3.06% was unchanged from the prior quarter as expected. The benefit we recognized from the increase in short-term rates was offset by the continued shift in our loan portfolio mix. Our efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 54.6%, relatively stable from a year ago and up from the fourth quarter as expected due to the seasonality of our businesses. We expect our efficiency ratio to remain in the low-50s going forward as we continue to balance decisions about operating costs with investments in our franchise. We remain focused on our efficiency efforts as they provide opportunity to invest in our businesses and in technology to meet our customers' needs. For example, during the first quarter, we launched real-time person-to-person payments on the clearXchange network and we continue to invest in enhancements in our mobile banking application. We were pleased to be named as \"Mobile Leader\" by Corporate Insight in March, which acknowledges our commitment to being a leader in the rapidly changing landscape of banking technology. Turning to slide 5. The company reported total revenue of $5 billion in the first quarter, a $131 million or 2.7% increase from the prior year. The revenue growth we are seeing is primarily being driven by core loan growth, as well as strength in a number of our fee-based businesses, including our payments business. Kathy will now provide you with more details about the first quarter results. Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Richard. Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on slide 6. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $12 billion, or 5.2%, compared with the first quarter of 2015 and grew 1.6% on a linked quarter basis, both adjusted for the retail card acquisition. In the first quarter, the increase in average loans outstanding on a year-over-year basis was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans of 10.2%. Consumer loans again showed positive momentum, led by credit card growth of 13.6% year-over-year, which included the retail card acquisition. Residential mortgage loan growth was also strong, increasing $2.8 billion, or 5.4%, year-over-year, and finally, the momentum in our home equity portfolio continued, resulted in a year-over-year increase of $471 million, or 3%. On a linked quarter basis, our core loan growth of 1.6%, excluding the card acquisition, was again driven by total commercial loan growth of $3 billion, or 3.5%, the strongest linked quarter growth for the previous five quarters, and growth in residential mortgages of $1.2 billion, or 2.3%. We currently expect linked quarter average loan growth to approximate 1.5% in the second quarter. Total average deposits increased $17 billion, or 6.3%, compared with the first quarter of 2015 and were up modestly on a linked quarter basis. The linked quarter growth in the first quarter of every year is affected by seasonal factors, notably in our Corporate Trust business line. On a year-over-year basis, the trend continues to show strong growth in non-interest bearing deposits and low cost interest checking. Money market and savings deposits also remained strong year-over-year, more than offsetting the run-off in higher cost time deposits. Let me now turn to slide 7. As Richard mentioned, challenges in the energy sector affected some of our credit metrics in the first quarter. However, credit quality in the core portfolio, excluding energy, remained stable. First quarter net charge-offs increased $36 million, or 12.9%, compared with the prior year. Net charge-offs were $10 million, or 3.3% higher than the fourth quarter. Net charge-offs as a percent of average loans were 48 basis points in the first quarter, up one basis point compared with the fourth quarter. Compared with a year ago, non-performing assets increased 1.4%. On a linked quarter basis, non-performing assets increased by 12.9%. The increases were entirely (7:55-7:57) energy-related credits. Excluding energy-related loans, non-performing assets decreased 4.1% on a linked quarter basis. Turning to slide 8, let me now provide some additional color around our energy exposure. At the end of the first quarter, approximately $3.4 billion of our commercial loans were to customers in energy-related businesses. Energy-related loans are 1.3% of our total loans. Our energy loan commitments were $11.9 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2016, down slightly on both a year-over-year and linked quarter basis. During the quarter, we recognized $138 million of reserves related to the energy portfolio, and the reserve for energy loan now stands at 9.1% of outstanding balances at the end of the first quarter of 2016. This compares with a 5.4% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015. Finally, approximately 43% of our energy commitments, and 17% of our outstanding energy loans, are to investment grade companies. Given the underlying mix in quality of the overall portfolio, we currently expect linked quarter net charge-offs and total provision expense to be relatively stable in the second quarter of 2016. Slide 9 gives you a view of our first quarter results versus comparable periods. First quarter net income decreased by $45 million, or 3.1%, on a year-over-year basis. Improvement in operating income was offset by higher loan loss provision and higher income taxes. The higher tax rate was primarily due to the resolution of certain tax matters that benefited tax expense in the first quarter of 2015. On a linked quarter basis, net income declined by $90 million, or 6.1%, mainly due to seasonality in some of our businesses, an increase in the provision for credit loss due to energy, and the impact of the previously reported fourth quarter 2015 gain on the sale of the Health Savings Account deposit portfolio. Turning to slide 10, net interest income increased by $136 million, or 4.9% on a year-over-year basis. Strong average earning asset growth was offset by the impact of a two basis point decline in net interest margin to 3.06%. The modest year-over-year decline in margin percentage primarily reflected the impact of higher short-term rates, offset by loan mix shift and lower reinvestment rates in the security portfolio. Net interest income increased by $17 million, or 0.6% on a linked quarter basis. Growth in average earning assets and the impact of higher short-term rates were partially offset by the impact of fewer days in the quarter. We currently expect net interest margin in the second quarter to be relatively stable, and linked quarter net interest income to increase modestly. Slide 11 highlights non-interest income, which decreased $5 million, or 0.2% year-over-year. The year-over-year decrease in non-interest income was primarily due to lower mortgage banking revenue, partially offset by higher payments revenue and higher trust and investment management fees. Continued strength in the payment business is reflected in our results. Credit and debit card revenue grew by $25 million, or 10.4%, reflecting higher transaction volumes, including the acquired portfolio. Sales volumes, excluding the impact of the credit card portfolio acquisition, were up 6.4% year-over-year, an improvement from the 6% year-over-year growth delivered in the fourth quarter. Merchant processing services revenue increased by $14 million, or 3.9%. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency rate changes, year-over-year merchant processing services revenue growth would have been approximately 6.4%. The growth was driven by higher transaction volumes, account growth, and equipment sales to merchants related to new chip and card technology requirements. Equipment sales related to chip card technology continue to trend modestly lower versus growth reported in prior periods. On a linked quarter basis, non-interest income was lower by $191 million, or 8.2%, principally due to seasonally lower fee-based revenues along with the impact of the fourth quarter HSA deposit sale. As expected, our payment fees and deposit service charges declined due to seasonality in those businesses. Mortgage banking revenues also declined as expected, principally due to lower rates impacting the valuation of our mortgage servicing rights. We expect linked quarter mortgage fees to increase 10 to 20% based on seasonally higher application volumes. Moving to slide 12, non-interest expense was $84 million or 3.2% higher on a year-over-year basis. Higher compensation expense, primarily driven by merit increases and higher compliance and acquisition costs were partially offset by lower pension expense and an insurance recovery recognized during the quarter. On a linked quarter basis, non-interest expense decreased by $60 million, or 2.1%. Seasonally lower costs related to investments in tax-advantaged projects and lower professional services expenses along with the insurance recovery were partially offset by seasonally higher benefits expense and higher variable compensation. The variable compensation expense includes costs related to an all-employee grant that was issued in the first quarter. We expect linked quarter expenses to increase in quarter two, driven by expected seasonality and higher expenses related to our brand positioning that was launched in the first quarter. Additionally, we expect professional services related to compliance to peak in the second quarter and then modestly decline, as costs related to our residential mortgage default consent order conclude. Our efficiency ratio is expected to decline slightly in the second quarter. Turning to slide 13, as Richard mentioned, our capital position remains strong and in the first quarter, we returned 80% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. We expect to remain in our 60% to 80% range going forward. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as fully implemented at March 31st was 9.2%, which is well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. Our tangible book value per share rose to 17.94 at March 31st, representing an 8.7% increase over the same quarter of last year, and a 2.9% increase over the prior quarter. I will now turn the call back to Richard. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Kathy. I'm very proud of our first quarter results. We maintained our industry-leading performance measures and we reported an 18% return on tangible common equity in the quarter. We continue to operate from a position of strength as we grow our revenue and manage expenses, while strategically investing in our businesses to create value for our shareholders. While not immune to the broader economic and market conditions, including the continued low rate environment and the weakness in the energy sector, we are confident in our ability to manage through these challenges, to win market share, and continue to deliver consistent, predictable, and repeatable financial results for the benefit of our customers, our employees, and our shareholders. That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Kathy, Bill, and I would now be happy to answer your questions. Operator : Your first question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning. I had two questions. One was on the real-time payments that you launched this past quarter. Richard, we have been talking quite a bit over the past several conference calls around the efforts underway to drive real-time payments. And you promised and delivered on the expectation this year that we would have something big come. Could you give us a sense as to how you expect to utilize this product, how you expect to deliver real-time payments, not only to consumers but also to corporates as we work through what ACH is going to be doing and also what clearXchange is driving for you? Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, Betsy. Yeah, the clearXchange and the EWS (16:04) partnership which you've read about with some of the large banks has been a important step to get us into a combined effort so that we can all work on something that banks have controlled for years, which is the payments network and the ACH system. So we're making progress. And I think as an industry, you'd be proud that we haven't lost our position. We haven't given it up and we are not going to sit idly by while nonbanks come in and take over the position. So the first couple of products you saw, some from us, are \u2013 is just a peek into the future. I will tell you that the appetite for the consumers is higher than for business on some of these higher value products because they are eager to change and try new things and businesses are more cautious and more careful and think blockchain, moving from ledger to eventually payments and things like that. So we are pleased with what we see. The issue I want to bring before you though and our investors is, whether you get paid for this? And there's already a bit of a discord between us and the other bank that came out with one of the real-time payments P2P where we are charging for it and they are not. And so the issue we have to ask ourselves is, will consumers and eventually businesses pay for a circumstance that they don't have value for today? Will they pay it for a time? (17:22) Amazon member and you will pay for Prime to have certain privileges and speed. They'll do it there, so we are hoping they will do it here in the payments world. We have to make sure that the business of banking doesn't become a utility in the minds of the consumers where they expect everything to come without a value price to it. And we are hoping that we'll be able to help set the standard for that. But that's my hope. And then there'll be plenty more opportunities to hear what consumers and the businesses want delivered to them. And frankly, I think we'll surprise them. But it's been so long, this whole paradigm of overnight settlement, closed on weekends and all of that. I think they will be quite pleased to see some of the progress we are making. I'd like to ask Andy to give a little more color on it since he's overseeing all of our performance in real-time payments and helping coordinate our own banks' position on that. Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer : Thanks, Richard. Betsy, I'd add two facts. One is, the current P2P is principally consumer-to-consumer and it's principally on a mobile device. And what you'll see as we continue through this year is that more and more banks will be added to that network, so would be able to continue real-time exchange with other additional banks. Secondly, on the wholesale or business-to-business side of the equation, you will see more of that activity come later this year as we continue to develop other capabilities beyond consumer and, again, I expect that to be later this year. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: On the payment question with NACHA moving to same-day settlement in October for push transactions, does that reduce the risk that you take as an institution and have an impact on the fees you are charging? Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No, it doesn't. It's all part of this larger consortium of getting everybody aligned properly. The ACH is owned in part by the clearing house and in part by the Fed. NACHA is one of the partners that we all deal with. And I am happy to report, we are all working and playing well together so that we don't create confusion or what I will call price disintermediation on what would otherwise be something we want to keep simple for the customer. So add NACHA to the stable of partners that we are working with in getting this, I think, right in the minds of both the consumers and what investors would want us to do. Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer : And what that does is essentially add an additional window. So it's not really real-time per se, but it's an additional window during the day. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just wondering if there is also a benefit to you from this product in terms of account acquisition and expense management, more real-time pay over the mobile, less check, less cash? Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer : Certainly there is a lower expense from that and I think the principal reason we are doing is though is from a customer experience standpoint. So, customers who have the need to have a real-time exchange for whatever reason would have that capability on their phone and again, we are one of the first to introduce that. So that's what it's about; it's how the customer is interacting with the bank and with other individuals. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I do think there will be an advantage to the banks that go first and there will be a window, like anything else where you can attract other customers who don't know that their bank will ever have it. This will become ubiquitous over time, which, at the end of the day is okay as long as the industry finds the right value proposition and gets paid for it. And to go back to your question, to add a little business to business on here, where Andy mentioned on NACHA. Give yourself an example of, you are a state of whatever, and in the middle of the day, you realize you made a mistake on one of your payrolls to your state employees and you need to remedy that before tomorrow morning. There is opportunities now to get in the middle of the payment system and do something midday. But I think that should have a cost to it, because that's a convenience that was otherwise not present for value of services added. So I think we will find some, both competitive benefits and some financial benefits, but it has a lot to do with how the industry performs in the next, probably three to four quarters as we start rolling things out. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Operator : Your next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Matt. Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. Can you talk a bit about how far along you are in some of the system spend and related investments you are making, and then weave that into kind of maybe the longer term outlook for expenses? You gave us some visibility on 2Q, but as we think about the back half of the year and just maybe get towards the end of the ramp in that spend, how that plays out. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I will go first. System spend, if you mean technology and operations, that's steady state. If you take a ten-year view \u2013 my ten years at least, the first five were higher than what I will say is the run rate, because we were trying to catch up, and you know that story, and we did that. And now we are back to a steady state. I'd say the next few years, there won't be a significant difference in depreciated costs, capital expenditures. They are higher than they used to be, because we need to stay at that level. But we've also never cheated the innovation and technology piece in any of those years to have to either catch up or to either ramp down. So our expenses are going to move more likely on the cost of personnel attached with compliance-related activities, which we said will peak in this quarter that we are in. And it's (22:19) rely on just the fact that we are going to continue to have to pay up for making sure that employees have the proper level of compensation. Think of all the minimum wage issues that are out there and issues like that. So that's going to drive a big part of our expenses. Technology will be at the run rate it is now and it's going to be very thoughtful, but we're going to continue to apply the efficiency we get in one side of it to the opportunity for innovation costs on the other. But I don't think we will add it as a save in the future. Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer : Yeah, and I would add, our area of focus is in three principal areas. Number one is customer relationship management. So, better information about our customers, both across the retail as well as the wholesale platform. Second is customer capability. So, increasing what a customer can do, not only within a branch, but on their mobile device, as well as on the Internet. And finally, data; data overall. Just using data better in the company for the benefit of the bank as well as the customer. Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I guess as we roll out beyond 2Q, just I mean, how meaningful is getting the peak and compliance costs behind you? And what I'm getting at is, obviously, you are extremely efficient, industry-leading, but we are in such a low revenue growth environment, 3% expense growth just makes it tough to consistently grow earnings. So trying to get a sense of, how much more you can do on the expense and efficiency side, from already it's a turning point (23:39). Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I got it. Let's go back and do a quick fact set (23:42). We are two parts revenue, one part expenses, is our recipe; that's good. So when revenue does move, it's got a two-fer on expenses. We only expect one more interest rate increase in the second half of the year in order for us to accomplish what we pretty much telegraphed to all of you. And if it doesn't, it won't be Armageddon, but it would be something we hope to get. In response to that, expenses, the compliance costs are something that we don't like, because they are related to expectations that we didn't have for ourselves. So if there's a consent order, it means you have been deficit in some way. One of the ways to fix that is to bring in both third parties and to bulk up your staffing. And then you come back down to a more normalized level. I will say, our compliance costs and FTE have really nearly tripled in the last five years. We did that review for our board just yesterday. And I would have said probably two-thirds of that would have been present anyway, consent orders or not. So it's not like, just an order peaks you out and you never come back down. But there is a run rate impact. So as we finish the mortgage consent order, this quarter wraps up and its completion, and then we move into now the AML/BSA consent order that we are moving through, that's where I think we are peaking out. This is the overlap quarter. But coming down, Matt, we are talking tens of millions of dollars; we are not talking hundreds of millions of dollars. We're talking hundreds of FTE, not thousands of FTE. It's really more a settling kind of a moment. Probably more germane to that is, as long as we can grow our loans at I think the kind of level we have been, high quality loans \u2013 I can say that twice; high quality loans, because that's an issue now, and we can outrun that even if margin stays flat. And with that two-to-one on expenses, we can grow expenses and grow revenue and still have positive operating leverage, and we are still shooting for it for 2016, and we can still make money. The challenge I have is whether I want to dispense any of those efficiency saves back into the bank, or whether I want to steal them away and put them to the bottom line, and we are doing both. And so, you will hear in Kathy's comments that we're going to continue to move forward with our reputation and brand strategy and advertising plan, which will cost us probably another $20 million to $25 million in the next quarter. And we're going to stick with it, and we're going to get this thing done and get our story out there as we think it deserves to be told. And that's just a small fraction of the money we've saved on our efficiency program. And while I'm not going to give you a final number, two years ago in February \u2013 so was that \u2013 26 months ago, we put on the FTE freeze on things that were less important and required. A year ago, we put on the all other watchful eye on other expenses, and that has saved tens and tens and tens of millions of dollars in our annual run rate, most of which we are putting back to you to keep our efficiency where it is, but some of which we're putting back into the company. But as to your original question, we can grow both, and we are thoughtful about it, but we expect that the cost of expenses will be measured more by FTE and the necessary jobs that have to be accomplished, and we will. Anything else certainly isn't going to be technology. Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thank you very much. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Operator : Your next question is from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Matt. Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Hi, Matt. Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, Richard. Thanks for taking my question. First of all, in terms of your guidance on the provision, Kathy, I noted that you think that that's going to be relatively stable quarter-over-quarter. But if I do a little bit of simple math, it looks like, outside of the energy portfolio, you released reserves last quarter, whereas you clearly added reserves in the energy portfolio. First of all, is that correct? And second of all, if we are correct on that, how do you think about the energy portfolio reserving going forward? Is this something where you are just going to sort of cover losses and maintain reserves where they are, or possibly add to reserves going forward? P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman & Chief Risk Officer : Hi, Matt. This is Bill Parker. I'll take that. You're correct. Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, Bill. P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman & Chief Risk Officer : We did have continued improvement, particularly in our residential mortgage portfolio, so that did, in part, offset some of the increase to the energy reserves. You can see, we did build the energy reserves to 9.1% of our outstanding loans. We had a pretty conservative price stack that we used during the quarter. So we feel like we have got, embedded in those reserves, what we will need for the future quarters. So, that's where we get that stable outlook. Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, that's helpful, Bill, thanks very much. And then, if I can, just on the expenses, a little ticky-tack question. Have you disclosed the amount of the proceeds from the insurance recovery? Because we would, I think, deem that as sort of a one-off or non-core, but just curious if you provided that? Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Yeah, Matt, what I would say, we didn't disclose it. It's really not material to the numbers. Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then just, finally from me, we noted a higher money market savings rate this quarter versus the fourth quarter. Can you provide some color on what was going on there? Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. I think a lot of where you see in the money market account are going to be some of our deposits with some of our corporate customers. So as our short-term rates started to increase, we did see a little bit of pricing increase on the commercial side or the wholesale side. I will say that from a consumer side of the house, we have really seen no changes in our overall deposit pricing. Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Your next question is from Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Jon. Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Hi, Jon. Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, good morning, everyone. A question on your loan growth guidance. High end of the range, you obviously did pretty well this quarter. And with the flat margin, it actually suggests maybe a little better revenue environment. But can you just give us an idea of the drivers that are putting you at the high end of that range? And then maybe, Bill, if you could comment on what you expect on energy draws. Do you expect energy loan balances to kind of up, down, sideways? Thanks. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Jon, first of all, we telegraphed to you guys 1.5% for quarter two, which, read between the lines, we have moved up the bottom, right? So we already know what quarter two is starting to look like, and it's feeling pretty robust. And it's very much the same things have you seen. Commercial is still strong and growing at that same clip, particularly M&A transactions or balance restructurings by corporate customers. We have got nice growth in home equity. I know that's a very rare thing, but we continue to grow our home equity portfolio I think against the comps to the other banks. Auto continues to grow. Credit card continues to grow. So we are on all cylinders on loans. Mortgages particularly are growing nicely as they \u2013 they didn't a year ago. So we are feeling good across the board. And I would say, what you have seen in the last four quarters is \u2013 would be a lot of what you see in the next quarter or two. So we are telegraphing strong. We also said that net interest income will be up slightly or modestly because we do expect a stable margin, increasing balance sheet. That gives you a slight positive. Margin is too early to know and we have to watch and see all the moving parts, so 'stable' just means it's close to where it is now, but we don't know yet at this point which direction or flat it will be. But we do think net interest income will be strong enough based on the loan growth to at least accomplish a positive linked quarter. As \u2013 energy, I'll turn it over to Bill. P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman & Chief Risk Officer : Yeah, and so on the energy portfolio, we did have a small number of borrowers that did draw during the first quarter. So our loan balances there were up couple hundred million. You can see that our commitments declined. We expected the commitments to continue to decline as we go through the borrowing base re-determinations. Wouldn't surprise me if there were another handful of borrowers that did draw during the quarter, but I can say we've also had a lot of success in \u2013 with other borrowers in restructuring the loans and \u2013 where they have been able to provide additional collateral. So overall, little up \u2013 probably a little more on the loans and then the commitments will continue to come down. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And we have also done the re-determination. P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman & Chief Risk Officer : Yes, we are about 40% of the way through the borrowing base Spring re-determination so \u2013 and so far that's going pretty well and allows us to feel comfortable about the stable outlook. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. And (32:16) 40% doesn't hurt. One more thing, Jon, I should have added. I didn't talk about commercial real estate. That's flat for us. It's been flat for us. We are different there too. A lot of the banks are growing that a lot. I said in the prior calls that we want to be very watchful on commercial real estate and we are being \u2013 we could be wrong. We could be missing some of the market growth. There's some pockets of good strength and we are in them. We've got our customers who are certainly going to grow the balance sheet, but not by a lot because we are protecting what we have and probably being more careful and not getting into some of the areas and things we don't really understand at this point in time. So add that to your thinking. While loans will still grow, commercial estate would be flattish, protecting the good customers we have. Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Good. That's very helpful. And then Bill, to clarify, you don't expect another \u2013 if oil stays here, you don't expect another big step-up in energy reserves. Is that the right way to interpret what you said in the last question? P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman & Chief Risk Officer : Correct. Yes. Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks for the help. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Jon. Operator : Your next question is from Paul Miller with FBR. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Paul. Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Yeah, guys, thank you very much. On the energy side, are you seeing any of the areas where those energy credits are going bad; you seeing any deterioration in any of your CRE products or loans? P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman & Chief Risk Officer : Yeah, we look at a couple of our markets that are energy dependent, the ones that we're most focused on are Denver and Houston. Denver, there's been little to no impact. It's not that energy dependent anymore. Houston of course is. We do have commercial real estate down there. We also do home building in the state of Texas. So we are watching that carefully. We have seen stress in the office market. That's obviously slowed in Houston. We do have four properties that we are watching, but it's not a material amount. We underwrite to our sponsors, our client base, as opposed to the area that they are in. So we feel that we have good secondary support on all the credits that we have in Houston. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And, Paul, we look at secondary and tertiary impacts on particularly those markets, the Gulf Coast and things where we have auto loans, we might have credit cards and things and we see absolutely no impact at all at this early stage of the game. So no one who lives or works down there that has our cars our cards are showing any stress. Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: And then a follow-up question just on the mortgage side. Are you seeing any big pickup in the purchase market? Are we seeing some indications that the purchase market finally is starting to get some life? On any of your applications for the second quarter, are you seeing any pickup in that? Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer : Yeah, the mortgage application on the purchase side was up about 12%. And as you know, the refinancings are down, so that's what's causing the overall decline. And I would expect to continue to increase in the second quarter, principally due to the seasonality in that 10% to 20% range. Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Hey, guys. Thank you very much. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks Paul. Operator : Your next question is from John Pancari with Evercore. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, John. John Pancari - Evercore ISI : Good morning. On the C&I loan yield, looks like it was up 11 basis points in the quarter. I just want to get a little bit of color on the drivers of that. I know the Fed hike is certainly part of it. And then, if it's sustainable at that level and what your outlook would be. Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Yes, thanks, John. I am going to say, it's really all driven by the Fed hike \u2013 the increase in the short term. As you know, where we see the increase in \u2013 due to loan rates is going to be in our wholesale portfolio and we get all of that typically in the first \u2013 first 90-day is a little bit more front-loaded. I would not \u2013 unless we see another increase in short-term rates, I would not see that list continuing into second quarter. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We might also just add, we have benefited by deposits not going up quite as much as we thought they would. Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : That's right. John Pancari - Evercore ISI : Okay. Got it. And then on the payments side of the business, wanted to get just your updated thoughts on how we should think about the growth rates in those businesses. Particularly the merchant processing business, up about 4% year-over-year. What's a good growth rate we can assume for that one? And then the same thing around the credit and debit card businesses. Just want to get an idea of what you think in terms of a growth possibility for the year. Thanks. Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer : So, merchant \u2013 let me start \u2013 this is Andy. Let me start with Merchant. Merchant was up, as you said about 4%; adjusted for FX, about 6.5% and that is \u2013 the principal driver of that growth is going to be same store sales. And same store sales was down a little bit in North America versus Europe for sure maybe about 2% versus 2.5% or so over the last few quarters. So the consumer was a little bit more cautious in the first quarter, spend was a little bit down, but I would expect to continue to have, even at that level's growth in the range \u2013 adjusted again for FX in that 5% to 6% range on a go-forward basis per merchant. On the card side of equation that was a little higher because of the purchase of the Fidelity acquisition that we talked about. If you adjust that out, we are talking at about 6%, 6.5%. And I would expect growth again in that range. That's also going to be driven by same store sales and then what's happening so to speak with what customers are doing. We are seeing modest growth there, but nothing substantial, neither up nor down in that category. And then finally, you didn't ask but I will just give you the corporate payment side of the equation. Two big moving pieces there. The first is on the government side of the equation, which is actually down almost 6%, 5.7% on a year-over-year basis. That's principally due to defense spending going down. Now, on the flip side of the equation, corporate spend was actually up a bit, almost the exact same amount, 5.7%. And interesting, we are seeing there, while companies continue to be very conservative as it relates to T&E spend, payable spend is actually starting to increase, which is a positive sign. John Pancari - Evercore ISI : All right, Andy. Thank you. That's helpful. And one last thing on energy, what was the percentage borrowing base reduction so far that you have seen in the Spring re-determinations that have been completed? P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman & Chief Risk Officer : The values came down about 20% to 25% and that translates into commitment reductions in our E&P portfolio of about 10% to 15% Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, the 40% re-determination's been accomplished. 75% of the companies had a reduction, 25% did not. So they are not all being reduced, but that takes you down to the numbers that Bill gave you. John Pancari - Evercore ISI : Got it. Thank you. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yep. Operator : Your next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Mike. Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : Hey. This goes in the category of 'no good deed goes unpunished'. Your efficiency ratio remains really good at 54.6%, but it's just not clear how it gets better from where it is. And I would point out, as you know, it's the worst it's been in the last five quarters. You guided higher for expenses in the second quarter. And when I look at the 54.6%, five years ago, it was 51%. So it has drifted up and I hear you, tech, compliance, regulation. So how do you move that lower? And that's my segue into, why not pursue acquisitions, and what is your appetite and when would you be able to pursue those acquisitions? Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Well, thanks Debbie Downer for that. You are right; 54% is higher than we have been in a long time. I know you know this, but I'll say it again; we don't set a target; it's a result, because we keep watching our revenue and our expenses and always try to grow revenue over expenses when possible. The 300 basis points in the last few years is not only \u2013 not surprising, but I think it's actually much better than it could have been, given the fact that with a 0% interest rate increase up until last quarter and with a very slow, steady, almost not recovering economy, we obviously have been taking market share of high quality customers and been able to offset some of that margin compression. So I'm actually pretty pleased with it, but I do think \u2013 we said it's going to be coming down slightly next quarter, so we are telegraphing to you all that this will be our high-water mark for the year. It also was the high-water mark last year. I think it is always the high-water mark as quarter one is by far our weakest quarter. It will come down on that basis. But Mike, when \u2013 two things have to happen, and I don't know which is more valuable. One is that the economy just need to get stronger and we got to be doing old-fashioned lending for people who want to grow and acquire organic kind of things that we haven't done in a long time in this industry. That will be huge. The second thing will be that we enjoy interest rate increases or a steeper yield curve. They are also both quite important, right? Because interest rates not moving up will harm some of the projections for the industry, but make sure you guys are watching the slope of the curve too, right? As the high end came up \u2013 the moment \u2013 the short end came up, the long end came down. And that has the same kind of impact on interest income that you would see on lack of rate movement. So, nothing has gone in our industry's favor in the last five years to improve an efficiency ratio. So we are holding on for dear life with this effort, that we think we can outrun expense growth by revenue. But I do think that the 54.6% is a high-water mark for us. And we are \u2013 we're not loving it, but we are also \u2013 by the same token, I'm not trying to patronize you guys, give you guys a 52% by suffocating the company and not investing and then living later on to explain myself, two years from now, why we didn't invest and why we didn't make the decisions we should have. So, I like the way you asked the question; there is a possibility for it to get better. In terms of M&A, we are always interested, particularly in the payments and trust business. You are reminded that, with the AML consent order, we are disallowed from looking at whole bank transactions, and again, it's okay right now, because we haven't found one we wish we could have had, and there's nothing we have lost that we would have otherwise sought. But we want to move through that order as soon as we can so we can get back to the permissions, which I think will be starting next year. And I have said this many times before, where kind of the statute of any oldest limitations should be away and gone from any acquisition, such that when you buy somebody, you know what you are buying and you don't buy old problems that you couldn't have possibly detected in due diligence. So we are still hungry for that. It is not going to make or break this company, because we are not going to change who we are or the mix of business, but we are always on the lookout for very good opportunities, the fidelity of the (42:40) portfolio, the Auto Club portfolio, you will see more of those, and hopefully more merchant portfolios, particularly overseas. Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : As a follow-up, on looking at whole bank deals, so you can't even look. I mean, could you \u2013 when do you think you'd be able to look at whole bank deals, and what sort of merger criteria do you have in terms of IRR or accretion, dilution? I know you haven't done a big bank deal in a while, but it seems like you are a more efficient bank, makes sense to buy a less efficient bank. That's the way the industry is supposed to evolve. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That's the old fashioned way of doing it. And not just for expenses, but for revenue, right? I would say, first of all, we have \u2013 there's a firm prohibition on buying a holding company while you have an AML consent order. You saw us buy branches before and you've seen us take on portfolios, those are the rules that are a little less clear, and we haven't found anything to test it. So, again, we are not being thwarted at the gate here. But what you would want to do is, once we get through the consent order, we will be back into the market and looking at those opportunities. But I got to tell you, the reason I haven't signed anything we like is because this company isn't thirsting for any unfinished business. There is not a market we're in that we don't want to be in, and there is not a market we are dying to get in that we are not. I would actually rather double down where we are. And the fact of the matter is, I'm still very concerned, for all kinds of reasons, that to pick up any full company, even if I could, I probably wouldn't right now, because I still think there's a lingering impact of attorneys generals and SECs and all kinds of other actions that are still yet to be levied on some of the smaller banks as we move down through that cycle, and I don't want to be holding one of them when we get there. But I'd tell you, as soon as the AML thing gets cleared and our regulators are quite clear that we want to clear whatever parts of that particular order would allow us back into bank transactions, we are making that job one, so that we have all the alternatives available to us as soon as possible. Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : And do you think you can clear that by the end of this year? Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I don't know when that's going to clear, because they take a long time. That's why I bifurcated and said we are seeking permissions to get the part of it that would allow us back into the M&A, full M&A business, to be accomplished first, and as long as the regulators will allow that, then we can bifurcate the full exit (44:51) by getting to the pieces that matter the most. And that's what we are working on, and as you would expect, the regulators haven't given us a timetable, and I wouldn't be dumb enough to guess at this stage, but that's what we are working on. Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : Thank you. Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer : Yes. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Your next question is from Jack Micenko with SIG. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Jack. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hey, good morning. Richard, you guys have been a leader in the payment space for a long time, and obviously very focused on competing against the non-banks. I'm curious what your thoughts are personally and then broadly, U.S. Bank's strategy, around the peer-to-peer side. Obviously, a lot of investor tension in that space. There's some structural differences for sure. We have seen some banks partner, we have seen some banks buy loans. Give us your thoughts on how that evolves, and how you see U.S. Bank fitting in. Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer : Jack, this is Andy. Hey. You are absolutely right. It's a topic of a lot of focus for our company. What I would say is, we are very comfortable with our underwriting process and use of our balance sheet. I think where some of the \u2013 Vintac (45:55) and other companies have done a good job is the customer interaction, customer convenience and access. And so, if there's a partnership, that's where we would focus, is on that end of the equation, not the underwriting end. And we are actually looking at different opportunities there in experimentation, in terms of improving the customer experience, which I think they have done a pretty good job on. But we are very comfortable with our underwriting. It's proven through cycles, and we're going to stick with that. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Great. Thank you. Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer : Yes. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Jack. Operator : Your next question is from Richard Bove with Rafferty Capital Markets. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Dick. Dick X. Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets LLC : Good morning. I would like to explore for a second your relationship with the Minneapolis Fed. I mean, I'm guessing that you are a member, and that you probably provide about 50% of the revenue of that Federal Reserve Bank. And that Bank has published formulas, I guess, which would suggest that you are too big to fail, and that your bank should be broken up. And I'm wondering, number one, what your interaction is with that bank. Number two, did you have any say in the selection of the President of that bank? And most importantly, number three, does it become an embarrassment for the Minneapolis Fed if you acquire anything or if you grow, forcing them to make some sort of statement against U.S. Bancorp in order to maintain the purity of their message, which could cause some problem for you guys? I mean, if you wouldn't mind just exploring the idea with us. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I would be happy to. Thanks for the question. First of all, our relationship is quite good. We are, by far, their most important client, and we're, I think, more than half the entire Ninth District. As you all probably know, but I will remind you that the hiring of the President is left to a layman board, particularly, local leaders who have parameters, of course. But they do bring in people that have \u2013 in some cases, they are not economists, and Neel Kashkari certainly fits that bill. But he comes in with a zeal and a need to want to open the question again on too-big-to-fail. I have met with him. I knew him in the TARP program. As you recall, we were the last big bank to take TARP. I didn't want to. We were the first bank to pay it back. I'm glad we did. I had long conversations with him over that period of time. And as soon as he showed up, Dick, here in the first of the year, Andy and I went to meet with him to introduce ourselves in his new role, and we had a very good conversation. And I believe \u2013 and I can say that the Fed here and we have a working relationship that couldn't be better than it is anywhere else. So that as a backdrop, I don't think he's coming in with his gunsights on U.S. Bank. In fact, I'm sure he's not. We have not \u2013 he's not invited any banks to his symposiums yet. He hasn't indicated yet when that will be, but I know we will have that opportunity. You might guess, I have private conversations with him routinely and with his team, so I'm not feeling left out of being able to offer my thoughts on some of his considerations. But at the end of the day, I'm going to take him to his word. But he's \u2013 while he has a bent towards investigating too big to fail, he is going to collect a lot of good data, and I think he's going to be balanced in his final decision. He's committed publicly to have a recommendation to the Fed by year's end, on what he thinks could be done to improve the safety and soundness of banks. At these early stages, he's focused on capital, he's focused on size. But I think he'll have to spend the rest of the year bringing in all kinds of different parties to speak, including Bernanke, who is coming May 16, at his second symposium. So I'm not feeling that he's set himself up yet to suggest that U.S. Bank is in his gunsights. I don't think any actions we take would be either harmful to him, nor I think affected by his opinion. As you know, the local Fed has a lot of jurisdiction over its banks, but a great deal of things like the stress test and the horizontal incentive compensation (49:35) rules and things are also managed at the Washington level, along with the locals. So our relationship with Washington, which is quite good, and local, is important to me, and I want to make sure that we are all operating in transparency. So, at this point, I appreciate his approach. I welcome people coming with ideas. I'm certainly sharing my thoughts when I have the opportunity. It would be inappropriate, I think, for me to take a public position and argue the merits of going out and collecting more feedback, and there probably are some \u2013 number of pundits that do believe that banks need to continue to be safer and more sound. I think we have accomplished an amazing level of success there, and I think a bank our size is exactly the kind of size that most people can get their arms around. I can get my arms around this one, and I'm going to continue to proffer that this is the perfect sized bank. Kind of the Goldilocks of banks. But I'm welcoming his new ideas and his energy, but I'm not short on having the opportunity to share my thoughts with him. Just simply not in a public forum. Dick X. Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets LLC : Okay, thank you very much. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Operator : Your next question is from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Vivek. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks for taking my questions. Hi. Can you hear me? Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, go ahead. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes, you can. A couple of questions. First, a simple one. What's the percentage of criticized loans for energy? You gave commitments. Can you give loans also, please? P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman & Chief Risk Officer : Yeah, I do have that with me. So, when I \u2013 you ask your other question and I'll get back to it, okay? Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Second question is on the credit card charge volume. As I look at \u2013 you had obviously very good increase in volumes from the Fidelity acquisition, but when you look at fees, the growth was much lesser (51:20). So, clearly, a sharp drop in pricing. Can you talk a little bit about how you came up with a pricing on the Fidelity deal? Because it seems like your average fee rate is down pretty sharply year-over-year when you look at that. Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer : The Fidelity portfolio, Vivek, is a higher quality portfolio. It is a lower charge-off rate portfolio. A higher spend portfolio, and a little lower rate portfolio, as you said. But it's very profitable overall, and we are very comfortable with the pricing that's there. The only thing I'd say on pricing is, the impact has also been impacted by gasoline prices as they come down, and you will see a little bit of a reduction there. But the Fidelity portfolio is actually a very good portfolio for the bank, overall. Higher quality, a little bit restructure than what we had in the quarter. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks, Andy. Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer : Sure. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And, Bill, do you have a number? P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman & Chief Risk Officer : Yeah. 52%. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Can you talk a little bit about that? That's pretty high, given that you have been a pretty cautious lender, and you'd been small in that portfolio. Can you talk about why you are at one of the highest levels? P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman & Chief Risk Officer : I can, because core to how we rate those loans is our price deck. And our price deck, we feel is \u2013 we like it. It's conservative. That's the way we like to do things. So our price deck right now is at $30 throughout 2016, and it slowly goes up over the next five years to $44. So, I think if you look at any of the futures markets, you will see that that's a fairly conservative outlay. And that is how we risk weight our loans. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Okay. Thank you. P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman & Chief Risk Officer : Yeah. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Vivek. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Mahmood Reza with Omega Advisors. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Mahmood. Mahmood Reza - Omega Advisors, Inc.: Hey there. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one going back to the student loan portfolio, which I think, last year we went held for sale in Q1 and then back to held for investment in Q3. There were sort of a few transactions and it seems like that market has thawed in the first quarter. And I would be curious to get your view if you think it's sort of thawed enough to get you interested in testing the waters again. And as a follow-up, does sort of the move from held for sale to available for sale and back to held for sale last year in the span of three quarters limit your ability to sell the portfolio again this year? Thank you. Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Thank you, Mahmood. We said last year when we moved that portfolio back into our held for investment that we were going to stick with that. We are not really looking at any opportunities to move on that again. So I would expect, going forward, that you'll just continue to see that in our loan portfolio. Mahmood Reza - Omega Advisors, Inc.: Okay, thank you. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks. Operator : Your final question comes from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Marty. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : Hey. I wanted to ask about the seasonality. If you take out mortgage, which you gave us some good insight into what you thought was going to happen there. But you have strong seasonality from first \u2013 second quarters in a lot of the processing businesses. Typically, that's in the 6% to 7% uptick. Just wanted to see if \u2013 is that kind of the same progression you are looking for this year. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Yes. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : Perfect. And then... Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Oh, sorry... Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : ...that comes through loud and clear. That then is, if you look at the efficiencies improving, even with the uptick and some expenses, you really will set, after you have kind of had to work through a couple of years of relatively flat earnings, this will be a nice step-up, which you typically get seasonally. So, I just would expect to see that, and was wondering if that's kind of in line if you bring it all together. Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, I will say that. So if we \u2013 I will go back to the efficiency questions that have been asked. I do think that's exactly right. So we are going to have an increase in our fee \u2013 or on our revenues from a seasonality standpoint. But I think as importantly as our loan growth continues to pick up at the higher end of the range, that's going to add additional revenue and the fact that our margin has stabilized is really \u2013 is helping us from an overall standpoint of being comfortable thinking about the efficiency ratio, declining a little bit as we move into the second quarter. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : Perfect. Thanks. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Marty. Operator : And there are no further questions. Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Well, thank you, everybody, for joining our call and we appreciate your attention and support of our company. And if you have any questions, please let us know or call Jen Thompson at Investor Relations. Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer : Thank you. P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman & Chief Risk Officer : Thank you. Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer : Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Following a review of the results by Richard Davis, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Kathy Rogers, U.S. Bancorp\u2019s Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon Eastern Daylight time through Friday July 22nd, and 12 midnight Eastern Daylight Time. I will now turn the conference over to Jen Thompson, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. Jennifer Ann Thompson : Thank you, Mellissa. And good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard David, Kathy Rogers, Andy Cecere, Terry Dolan and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp\u2019s second quarter results and to answer your questions. Richard and Kathy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbanc.com. I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today\u2019s call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking statements are described on page two of today\u2019s presentation and our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Richard. Richard K. Davis: Thanks, Jen and good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call. I\u2019ll begin our review of U.S. Bank\u2019s results with the summary of reported highlights on slide three of the presentation. I\u2019m pleased to report that U.S. Bank reported record net income of $1.5 billion for the second quarter of 2016 or $0.83 per diluted common share.  The second quarter results include several notable items that together increased earnings per share by $0.01. These notable items include $180 million of equity investment income, primarily the result of our membership in Visa Europe, which was recently sold to Visa Incorporated. Additionally we recognized $110 million in accruals related to legal and regulatory matters and the $40 million charitable contribution. I\u2019m very pleased with our second quarter results where we once again delivered industry leading profitability and posted record results for revenue, net income and earnings per share on both a reported as well as a core basis. Record revenues were driven by growth in average linked quarter loans of 1.6% as expected and continued strength in our fee businesses. While we saw a reduction in our linked quarter net interest margin as expected, we did report modest linked quarter growth in net interest income and strong growth in net interest income on a year-over-year basis. Total average deposit growth also remained strong at 7.6% versus the previous year, and included net income growth -- net new income account growth of 2.8%. Credit quality was stable for the second quarter as expected. The net charge-off ratio was unchanged at 48 basis points compared to the previous quarter and the previous year. And we recognized a modest improvement in non-performing assets, which was driven mainly by improvements in the energy credits.  Slide five provides you with a five quarter history of our profitability metrics, which continue to be among the best in the industry. Moving to the graph on the right, you will see that this quarter\u2019s net interest margin was 3.02%, 4 basis points lower than the prior quarter, which was in line with our expectations. The industry continues to face headwinds from low interest rate environment and the flatter yield curve, which became more pronounced at the end of the second quarter and continues as we begin the third quarter.  The lower long-term rates will have an impact on our second half results, if the rates remain at these low historic levels. We would that given the current yield curve and expectations that the short-term rates will remain flat for the near-team, that the interest margin -- net interest margin will decline on a linked basis in the range of 3 to 4 basis points. However, we also expect net interest income to increase on a linked quarter basis, principally driven by an increase in earning assets. Expenses excluding the notable items increase 3.4% at the bottom end of our expected range. And our efficiency ratio improved to 54% versus 54.6% in the prior fiscal quarter. As projected, quarter two expenses included a linked quarter increase in marketing expense related to the investment in our brand advertising, and also reflect the expected peak in our compliance related costs.  As we look out to the second half of the year, we\u2019d expect expenses to grow, however, the rate of growth will be lower than the 3.4% linked quarter growth reported in the second quarter.  Turning to slide six, the company reported record net revenue of $5.4 million in the second quarter. Excluding the Visa Europe sales, revenue increased $226 million or 4.5% from the prior year. Our revenue growth was primarily driven by core loan growth, as well as strength in a number of our fee based businesses, including our payments, mortgage and wealth management businesses. We also saw strong results from our capital markets business, as we were well positioned to provide product and services to customers as they navigated through the recent market volatility. Kathy will now provide you with more details about our second quarter results. Kathy Rogers : Thanks, Richard. Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on slide seven. Average total loans outstanding grew 1.6% on a linked quarter basis and increased by over $20 billion or 8.1% compared with the second quarter of 2015. Excluding the recent retail card portfolio acquisition and student loans that were carried in the held for sale in the second quarter of 2015 loans grew by 6.5% compared to the prior year. In the second quarter, the year-over-year increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans of 10.7% and improved residential mortgage loan growth of 8.6%. Other consumer loans continue to show positive momentum, led by credit card growth of 14.3%, which included the retail card acquisition. Finally, home equity loan growth continued reflecting the year-over-year increase of 2.7%. On a linked quarter basis, our core loan growth of 1.6% meeting our expectation, and was driven by total commercial loan growth of $2.3 billion or 2.6%, and growth in residential mortgages of $1.3 billion, or 2.4%. We currently project linked quarter average loan growth in quarter three to be similar to the growth reported in prior quarters. Total average deposits increased $22 billion or 7.6% compared with the second quarter of 2015, and were up 3.9% on a linked quarter basis. On a year-over-year basis, the trend continues to reflect strong growth of 9.5% in our low cost deposits, which includes our non-interest bearing and low cost interest checking deposits and more than offset the run-off in higher cost time deposits. Turning to Slide eight, as Richard mentioned, credit quality remain relatively stable in the second quarter. Second quarter net charge-off increased $21 million or 7.1% compared with the prior year, and reflected a modest increase of $2 million or 0.6% on a linked quarter basis. Net charge-offs as a percent of average loans were 48 basis points in the second quarter, unchanged from the prior quarter and the prior year. Compared with a year ago non-performing asset increased $95 million or 6% mostly due to the down grade that occurred in prior quarter due to recent energy credits. Linked quarter non-performing assets improved 3% or $47 million driven mainly from improvements in our energy credits. Slide nine provides an update of our energy exposure. At the end of the second quarter $3 billion of our commercial loans and $11.3 billion of our commitments were to customers in the energy portfolio, which was down from the previous quarter. The decline was primarily driven by the completion of our spring borrowing base redetermination on reserve-based loans within our energy portfolio. During the second quarter criticized commitments within this portfolio decreased $509 million while nonperforming loans decreased $54 million principally driven by pay down. Finally credit reserve associated with the energy portfolio declined by $45 million, reflective of reduced loans which resulted in an 8.8% credit reserve for our energy portfolio compared to 9.1% in the previous quarter. Given the underlying mix in quality of the overall portfolio we expect linked net charge-off and total provision expense to be relatively stable in the third quarter of 2016. Slide 10 gives you a view of our second quarter results versus comparable period. Second quarter net income excluding notable items increased by $17 million or 1.1% on a year-over-year basis. Higher operating income was partially offset by higher provision expense. On a linked quarter basis net income excluding notable items decreased by $114 million or 8.2% mainly due to the seasonality in certain fee businesses partially offset by higher non-interest expense related to expected increases in compliance cost and marketing expense. The marketing expense represents our brand advertising. Turning to slide 11, net interest income increased by $126 million or 4.5% on a year-over-year basis. Strong average earning asset growth was slightly offset by the impact of a 1 basis point decline in net interest margin to 3.02%. The modest year-over-year decline in net interest margin primarily reflected the impact of higher short-term rate offset by lower reinvestment rates in the security portfolio. Net interest income increased by $8 million or 0.3% on a linked quarter basis. Strong growth in average loans was offset by a 4 basis point reduction in net interest margin. The decline in the margin was principally due to the loan portfolio mix as well as lower average rates on the investment securities portfolio, which is principally due to flatter yield curves. Slide 12 highlights non-interest income, which increase $100 million or 4.4% year-over-year excluding the Visa Europe sale. The year-over-year increase in non-interest income was primarily due to increase in payments revenue, trust and investment management fees, mortgage banking fees and commercial product fees, which is mainly due to the increased capital market fee -- which was mainly due to increased capital market fees resulting from the recent market volatility. Credit and debit card fees grew by $30 million or 11.3%, reflecting higher transaction volumes including acquired portfolios. Corporate payment products revenue grew 1.7% reversing a negative growth trend recognized during the previous year and this was driven mostly by market share gains resulting from prior year investments made within our middle market, virtual payment and commercial freight platforms. Merchant processing services increased 2.0% year-over-year or 3% excluding the impact of current foreign currency rate changes. Commercial products revenue increased $24 million or 11.2%, driven by higher bond underwriting fees and other capital market activities as our customers responded to the recent volatilities. On a linked quarter basis non-interest excluding the Visa Europe sale increased $223 million or 10.4% principally due to seasonally higher fees within our payments mortgage banking and desposit service charge fee category. Credit and debit card fees increased $30 million or 11.3% and merchant processing fees increased $30 million or 8.0% primarily due to seasonally higher transaction volumes. Commercial product fees increased $41 million or 21%, mortgage banking fees increased $51 million or 27%, which was inline with our previous guidance of 20% to 30%. Growth in mortgage banking revenues primarily reflected seasonally higher production volumes. We currently expect linked quarter mortgage fees to increase 20% to 30% again in quarter three. Moving to slide 13, non-interest expense excluding notable items increased $160 million or 6% on a year-over-year basis; higher compensation expense mostly due to the impact of merit increases and variable compensation. Higher professional service expense principally related to compliance activity and higher marketing and business development expense related to the investment in our brand advertising were partially offset by lower employee benefit expense. On a linked quarter basis, non-interest expense excluding notable items increased by $93 million or 3.4%. Linked quarter expense growth was driven by higher marketing and business development cost again reflective of the investment in brand advertising. Higher professional service fees -- expenses principally due to compliance and an increase in compensation expense mostly due to merit increases. These increased costs were partially offset by seasonally lower employee benefit expense. As Richard mentioned, we expect expenses to grow in the second half of the year however at a lower rate of growth versus the 3.4% excluding notable items that we\u2019ve reported for the second quarter. Our current expectation is for linked expenses to increase 2.5% to 3% in the third quarter, but so let me provide some additional detail. We anticipate that the FDIC search charge assessment for larger banks will begin in the third quarter which will increase our expenses by approximately $20 million. Additionally, expenses related to our tax credit business are seasonally higher as we move into third quarter. These two items account for more than half of the expected quarterly expense growth. In the second quarter, preferred dividend totaled $80 million, which compared with $51 million in the first quarter of 2016. The linked quarter increase is reflected of recent preferred stock issuances with a semi-annual dividend payment that will repeat again in quarter four.  Turning to slide 14, our capital position remains strong and in the second quarter we returned 77% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buyback. On June 29th, we announced that Federal Reserve did not object to our capital plan. As a result, we announced the $2.6 billion stock buyback program that commenced on July 1st and announced an expected increase in our third quarter common dividend of 9.8%. We would expect to remain in our targeted payout range of 60% to 80% going forward. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as if fully implemented at June 30 was 9.3% which is well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirements. Our tangible book value per share rose to $18.46 at June 30th, representing 10% increase over the same quarter of last year and 3% over the prior quarter. I will now turn the call back to Richard. Richard K. Davis: Thanks, Kathy. I am proud of our record second quarter results. We maintained our industry leading performance measures and we reported an 18.7% return on tangible common equity in the quarter. Our industry continues to face challenges from the low interest rate environment. However we remain confident that we\u2019ll continue to grow revenue and prudently manage expenses while strategically investing in our business to create value for our shareholders.  That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Kathy, Terry, Bill and I will now be happy to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John McDonald with Bernstein. Richard K. Davis: Hi, John. John McDonald : Hi, good morning guys. Richard I was hoping if you could provide a little bit color on loan growth. What\u2019s gotten better and what\u2019s keeping you the confidence the expected trend to continue? It sounds like you might expect more of the same maybe little bit more color there. Richard K. Davis: Sure happy to do it. And we\u2019re expecting more of the same pretty much what we\u2019ve seen for the last two quarters. I\u2019ll have Andy to give a little color on the detail as he oversees all of those revenue businesses. But I will say it continues to be a theme of repetitive quarter-after-quarter. Where on the wholesale side, you\u2019re seeing increased capital markets activity that in fact move up and trigger loan repayments and lower line utilization and M&A related activity. So on the wholesale side, we\u2019re not still not seeing the kind of organic growth we\u2019d like to see, but we are pleased as we said in our comments that we have a fully capable capital markets business in order to take the benefit of what would otherwise be some activities we didn\u2019t use to have in the company when customers moved outside of the lending market and into the capital markets. On the consumer side we\u2019re seeing all areas moving slowly, but surely and nicely, favorably from autos to RVs to credit card to home equity. And then we particularly have good story to tell in the mortgage business as we continue to be a bigger player in that area. So it\u2019s a lot of the same John, but everything has got generally positive slightly positive bias, but a lot of the opportunity that wholesale market is yet to be the kind of organic growth that we all want to see that gets evidenced in a more healthy and robust economic environment. Andy, do you want to add some color there? Andrew J. Cecere: Richard, I\u2019d add in that. So we did see record revenue in our commercial products groups and you saw that our credit fixed income, or FX or municipal products all were up at record levels, somewhere between 40% and 50% on a year-over-year basis, and again, that\u2019s reflective of a tremendous bond issuance that was occurring here in the second quarter. We did continue to see strength in auto lending as well as residential mortgages again principally due to the rise in the jump [Inaudible] and commercial real estate also grew a bit this quarter also, which is a little bit of a reversal of the trend. John McDonald : And maybe Bill can follow-up. You had good credit results this quarter, I think the outlook was for a relatively stable, I was just wondering, if you might need to build some reserves, if the loan growth remains healthy here? P. W. Parker: Well, I mean, we\u2019ve started that. So we are adding, we\u2019re done with the days of releasing and we are adding to our reserve. So we are mindful of that. As I said for quite a period, there is still probably room in the existing portfolios, specifically residential, home equity, where we do have -- we continue to see improvements in home values, et cetera. So that could allow for releases out of those portfolios, which does help offset some of the loan growth. But we are in a position, where we feel it\u2019s prudent to be adding to our overall reserves. John McDonald : And is this quarter a pretty good indicative pace for now Bill? P. W. Parker: For now. John McDonald : Okay. And in terms of the NPAs and charge-offs can you just repeat what your outlook is there? P. W. Parker: Yeah it\u2019s pretty -- very stable really across the board. I mean, if you look at each of the asset classes C&I is surprisingly low in this quarter, we had -- we felt we were very got out ahead of the energy issues in the first quarter, and this quarter we had no material energy charge-offs, in fact we have nice recovery on one of our credits. So we feel like we\u2019ve got the energy with $50 a barrel anyway, that we have the energy issue behind us. And if you look at the other asset class, it\u2019s all very stable. Richard K. Davis: Just add to that, Bill I would add, we marked our portfolio at $35 a barrel for the second quarter. And we have no intention of releasing that reserve for some time and we see sustained higher levels of value on oil, but we do have at 8.8%, we think sufficient coverage and provision, and we\u2019re quite pleased with how that portfolio is behaving at this point. John McDonald : Okay, thanks. Richard K. Davis: Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question is from Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital. Richard K. Davis: Hey, Jon. Jon Arfstrom : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Maybe Richard, a question for you, expenses. Maybe about a year ago, you gave the chin up bar analogy on rates remain low; you might have to be tougher on expenses. I appreciate all the guidance, it looks like maybe professional services can start to moderate a bit maybe marketing to maybe there is some other offset, but maybe your latest thoughts long-term expense management, efficiency if the rate environment remains challenging. Richard K. Davis: Yeah, I appreciate that. So a picture of the bar fell up there, promising [ph] like crazy. Both knuckles are white, but we\u2019re hanging in there. A couple of thoughts Jon, I want to start by saying, I\u2019ll give you guys forward looking view that we intent at this point, at least for the second half of the year to stay in the 54% range. 54.0% to 54.9% kind of a range in our efficiency ratio. And I\u2019m giving you that, because I don\u2019t know exactly with no interest rates, flat -- very flat yield curve and that can move either than can move anytime and it seem to be very volatile. We\u2019re not giving up on positive operating leverage, but it\u2019s getting a lot harder. And I\u2019d rather just tell you guys that we\u2019re going to stay at the same current level and we\u2019ve been there for a couple of quarters now of efficiency. Because what I\u2019m saying is we already are under a pretty steady and measured expense control program. We\u2019ve got an FTE hold in the company that look for any growth items and areas of compliance. We haven\u2019t added those now since February of last year, and we continue to watch all the non-critical expenses, the discretionary expenses to a point that we think is it\u2019s right up to the line, where it would start to impair our new growth. And you guys invest in us not just for this quarter or next quarter, but for the long-term, and we\u2019re going to be very careful not to over react. And we have been careful so far not to do that.  So our expenses will go up as we said less than the 3.4% linked quarter, next quarter would be 2.5% to 3%. And as Kathy mentioned, half of that will in the FDIC premium cost and in the CDC, which typically has higher expenses in the second half. So rest is just core part of adding people for portfolios, adding to compliance. And as you said, professional services starts it did peak this quarter starts to come down. So I\u2019ll tell you it comes down very slowly. So it\u2019s not a big measured improvement. But it is at least a point in fact that this will be our highest quarter I hope on record. So that gives you a little more color and I think the 54% range that gives us enough room to have surprises during the quarter, but also protect the knowledge for you that we\u2019re not going to do something it get to 52 and I don\u2019t see this thing moving into 55s or 56s. Jon Arfstrom : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe quickly just an update on the consent order and once lifted what really changes in your mind? Richard K. Davis: Sure. So the consent order as you know is preclude us from whole bank transactions particularly things with branch banking and as we go through this consent order it takes quite some time not only to get things where they need to be, but to sustain and improve that they stay there and we are in those processes now. So I have no idea what the exit time will be, but we are working closely with our regulators to make sure that we have permissions particularly to be released from any part of the consent order first if that\u2019s helpful to us to get back into the traditional M&A business. However, I remind you that our M&A in the area of merchant portfolios, credit card portfolios, mortgage business activities, trust activities none of those are precluded under that order and those have been exactly the things we have in the last five years consistently as part of our M&A. So we haven\u2019t been precluded from doing what we wanted to do and as I said before there hasn\u2019t been a bank deal or a branch deal that we wanted since the Citizens Chicago deal that we\u2019ve included from. So our goal is to get out of it as soon as possible so we don\u2019t have any barriers on our options. But for now it\u2019s not impairing any of ability to run the company or find opportunities to acquire. Jon Arfstrom : Okay, great. Thank you. Richard K. Davis: Thanks, Jon. Operator : The next question is from Paul Miller with FBR and Company. Richard K. Davis: Good morning, Paul. Timothy Hayes : Hey, guys. This is actually Tim Hayes for Paul Miller. What is your view for mortgage revenues in the second half of the year given where interest rates are today, are you guys seeing any pick up in resize yet and do you think that\u2019s a tailwind to fee income from lower rates could offset the detriment to margin? Andrew J. Cecere: This is Andrew replying. So our second quarter mix was about 65% new purchases and 35% refinancing. So I would expect that to go closer to 60-40 in the second quarter and given that coupled with the normal seasonality I would expect mortgage fees to continue to increase in that 20% to 30% range. Timothy Hayes : Okay, great. Thank you. Andrew J. Cecere: Sure. Operator : The next question is from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Richard K. Davis: Hi, John. John Pancari : Good morning. I wonder if you can give us a little bit more color on the merchant processing revenue it looks like a little bit light from where I was looking for this quarter, I just want to see if we can get some of your updated trends that you are seeing on the merchant side? And then separately for the payments business just overall revenue trends that you can expect here I know we\u2019ve seen a pretty good rebound in that business, but wanted to get some color on your outlook. Thanks. Andrew J. Cecere: Okay. This is Andy again. Let me start with merchant and you are right there are a few moving pieces in merchant I want to explain. So first one of the principal drivers of merchant fee revenue is same store sales. And same store sales in North America were up just under 2%, 1.8% and in Europe they were up about 5%. So globally up about 2.6% and what you typically see from us is same store sales plus 1% to 2% is total merchant revenue growth. What happened this quarter is while we were up 2% on a year-over-year basis if you exclude FX that\u2019s up 3% that is also now flattening now revenue related to equipment sales. So we were up higher in prior quarters because equipment sales were going up, they are sort of leveled up, we\u2019ve lapped that so to speak. The other things you will see are transaction volume is down and that was intentional. We exited some low margin business, so it did have impact on transaction volume, but as you saw not a tremendous impact on fee income. So as we look forward to the next few quarter I would expect again same store sales plus 1% to 2% in terms of our fee growth in merchant volume. You asked about the other payments business so let me comment on that. Credit card is very strong. Excluding fidelity we were up about 6% and that\u2019s driven by card transaction volume growth of about 7% and I would expect that to continue in the future quarters. And then finally on corporate payment systems, very good story there is that we are seeing growth in the corporate side of the equation. While government is continuing to be flat our corporate fee income is growing, transaction volume, sales volumes up about 6% and that\u2019s a function of the investments we made in virtual pay and product activity, which is very positive. So T&E continues to be weak or level or down a bit, but payables and virtual pay is up strong. Richard K. Davis: I\u2019ll add to that, this is Richard. Just if you are going to bring up proxy question I\u2019ll help you out here. For Brexit, first of all it\u2019s not material and it\u2019s pretty neutral to the bank. But if it shows up anywhere it shows up in our European businesses, which is merchant acquiring. You may recall those of you who followed us for a decade, we started our business merchant acquiring business in the UK that\u2019s where it\u2019s actually headquartered. So a disproportion amount of business is in the UK. And actually if there is a lot of prognosis I believe there will be a lot of travel and visits and spending over the UK which is net positive for us. And given our portfolio mix being heavy on hotels, retail, hoteliers and airlines that could be quite positive as well offsetting any variances that may occur in the rest of the European market through this disruption. So we\u2019re seeing Brexit as fairly neutral to not material to maybe even little bit positive.  As it relates to our employees, we have a few hundred employees that are working in the UK and or in around Europe that would either have to have past reporting circumstances change for them because they\u2019re either UK employees working in Europe or European employees working in the UK that\u2019s something that will roll over the next couple of years. There is no rush to it and there has been no reaction there we\u2019re not changing any of our strategies as a result of that. John Pancari : Okay great. Thanks for all that color, it\u2019s helpful. And then just separately on the commercial real estate portfolio, pretty good growth this quarter and looking actually at the construction piece saw a pretty good jump there. So wanted to see what you\u2019re seeing on the commercial real estate side in terms of where the growth is coming from? And do you expect any moderation from regulatory scrutiny around CRE trends right now at all. And then lastly any credit concerns on that front because we\u2019re hearing a little of that too? Thanks. Richard K. Davis: Yeah I will go first, I want to go first on that. CRE has got as you know for our company is one of the areas we want to be particularly conservative in much as we love it and we\u2019re very big in it. And so the scrutiny it\u2019s high in the industry I\u2019m quite comfortable that the scrutiny will not be placed here because we\u2019ve been conservative for a decade and we continue to be underwriting. I\u2019ll also remind you that commercial real estate has a CMBS market where there is a lot of activity. And our guys are filling it with a lack of buyers coming particularly from the life insurers has affect the refinance and purchase activity, which only serves to say that there is a reduced pace to payoffs. So part of the increase is actually good news we\u2019re keeping the customers we have. But we\u2019re not striving to get new customers at any kind of risk of underwriting or at pricing change. I think the portfolio will prove itself more overtime. Andy and Bill can add little color about where the growth is and where we see the pockets of strength. But we love this business; we\u2019re very good at it. But I promise you we\u2019re just not going to get greedy at a time like this in the marketplace on terms or underwriting. Because it\u2019s easy to do and it\u2019s not going to happen here. So Andy you might go first. Andrew J. Cecere: Well to follow-up on Richard\u2019s point. If you look at our construction loan activity, you see that that\u2019s been increasing fairly consistently over the last five or more quarters. What\u2019s changed is that commercial mortgage or standing loan permanent loan where the attrition has declined and actually reversed this quarter, very slight increase. And that was what Richard was highlighting. I mean the strength has been it continues to be on the coast especially the West Coast for us and through a lot of our REIT clients they have been very active. P. W. Parker: And that's what I was going to say. California, Pacific Northwest is where we\u2019re seeing insurance activity. John Pancari : Great, all right. Thank you. Richard K. Davis: You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question is from Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Richard K. Davis: Hey, Scott. Scott Siefers : Good morning, everybody. Richard I was hoping either you or Kathy could extend upon your comments on the margin from the beginning of the call. First I want to make sure I understood it correctly. I think when you characterize they\u2019re down 3 to 4 basis points. I think you were talking about the second half, but is that three to four basis points per quarter in the second half or in the aggregate for the second half. And then I guess the broader question there is, at what point would you guess that margin compression would stop in this kind of pressure grade environment? Because I guess there are two big issues with the securities portfolio reinvestment risk and then there is still kind of wide gap between your loan and deposit growth. But just curious to hear your thoughts on both of those phenomenon. Richard K. Davis: Yeah thanks, Scott. I think we got to question five before we got to NIM, that\u2019s pretty good. I\u2019ll be very clear, what we said it was in quarter three which is all we can see into. We have a 3 to 4 basis point prediction of NIM decrease. I have no idea what quarter four would be. As we woke up this morning, you know that the call for interest rate increases is 21% for September, 36% for December. Better than zero worse than it was when we talked last time. So we\u2019re not going to bet on any of that, but to the extent that any of it comes back would be terrific. Also the 10 years above 150 again thank god. That is helpful to us as interest rate increases. And you know there is an equal impact on the income statement based on that.  So if we can manage through these very worse time which is continued zero interest rate increases and very, very low tenure. We can manage through just about anything which is how we\u2019re building the lower for longer kind of term around the company. So for one quarter we can see that pressure. We can\u2019t predict beyond that. I\u2019ll have Kathy talk a bit more about the sequencing and the importance of the refinancing that occurs in the securities. And the fact that we\u2019re actually seeing stable performance in most margin areas for compression as it relates to competitors. Kathy Rogers : Yeah. So well he is exactly right. We\u2019re looking at into the third quarter and we are down about -- we are projecting that we\u2019re going to be down in that range of 3 to 4. But I\u2019m going to say it\u2019s going to be a lot more of what you\u2019ve seen. So as the rate curve has kind of flattened although some signs of improvement here most recently. That\u2019s going to continue to have an impact on our securities portfolio. So we\u2019ll continue to see a decline in that.  And then the rest really you have to look to our loan growth to the extent that we continue to grow our wholesale loans little bit stronger than our retail loan that\u2019s also going to put a little bit of compression going forward. Richard K. Davis: So Scott, let it be said at the end, we remind you that net interest income will increase in quarter three. So we can out [ph] on this in the outset growth, but it\u2019s going to be continued more challenging until we get interest rate increases around that. Scott Siefers : Okay, terrific. Thank you guys very much. Richard K. Davis: Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Ken Houston with Jefferies. Richard K. Davis: Hi, Ken. Kenneth Houston : Hey, good morning everyone. Just as a follow-up on just the balance sheet mix, with still have a really good loan-to-deposit ratio. You\u2019re still growing deposits and I see you\u2019re able to remix from the short-term borrowings this quarter. Given that low rate scenario we\u2019re dealing with, at what point do you decide to just try to remix just more into loans less into securities given and understanding that you need to keep LCR. But does anything structural change with that thought process around just asset liability management? Richard K. Davis: No it doesn\u2019t Ken. And we\u2019re nowhere near those lines. I mean we take what the market gives us and then make sure that we apply it appropriately to the balance sheet and therefore the income statement. But there is no -- we're not near any of the line where we\u2019re evaluating the value of even deposits. We're self-collecting deposits and happy to take them because they will be more necessary in the future. And we\u2019re pricing loans at the right level to win the high quality and the securities portfolio is kind of a result of all of that. But it wouldn\u2019t be a driver it would be a follower. And there is nothing in our strategy that\u2019s going to change at this stage. And there is nothing that\u2019s getting us close to edge where we have to sit down and strategize on our balance sheet as it relates to a mix or an area of that appetite that we haven\u2019t already demonstrated. Kenneth Houston : Understood. And then on the deposit side, I think a lot of banks are starting to still see a modest tick ups on the deposit pricing side. What are you guys just seeing in terms of customer behavior in terms of product choice and any cost that you have to hand along even though we\u2019re not really getting it on the left side of the balance sheet? Kathy Rogers : Yeah, we really haven\u2019t seen a whole lot of shift. Really the consumer has really no rate change whatsoever on the consumer. We talked previously that we did have some repricing on our wholesale side some of that was just contractual that happened to other if as we work with our customers. But I\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s been relatively stable as we look into this quarter. Kenneth Houston : Okay. Last one real quick one, the preferred dividend Kathy, does it go back to the first quarter 57 in the third quarter? Kathy Rogers : Yeah. So it\u2019s a quarterly payment. So first and third quarter will be at the lower rate, second and fourth quarter will be at the higher. Yeah about 60 I would say, 60 in the third quarter, about 80 in the fourth quarter. Kenneth Houston : Okay, thank you. Richard K. Davis: I am glad you asked that because that gotten just neither didn\u2019t telegraph well or just gotten missed in a lot of the models. And it\u2019s real money and it's also real value. So I\u2019m glad to have that clarity. Thanks for asking it. Kenneth Houston : You bet. Operator : Your next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA. Mike Mayo : Good morning, Richard. So in the battle Richard Davis, first the tenure I think you\u2019re kind of getting obliterated. Richard K. Davis: I think so. They are definitely winning, I\u2019ll tell you that. Mike Mayo : On the other hand, you do have some accelerating loan growth. I know you talked about loan growth here. So originally you\u2019ve mentioned economic growth couple of years ago accelerating, improving and then tenure goes down and that\u2019s why I brought the comment initially. So if you look at the tenure you\u2019re really loosing, if you look at your accelerating loan growth maybe you\u2019re winning a little bit more. So I\u2019m just trying to make sense of as the markets for you do business improving or not? Richard K. Davis: Mike it\u2019s a great question. They are improving slowly, but I\u2019ll tell you what, I wish I\u2019ll be here 10 years from now to prove that, but we are taking market share, swear to god honest Injun. We are taking market share. We have been for years. Think of our home equity portfolio it\u2019s still growing, albeit slightly, but that\u2019s been shrinking across the industry. Auto loans we\u2019ve never got not of it, so we are selling it big, leasing or now one of the few players literally quite capable at it we\u2019ve been doubling down on credit cards and you are seeing some of our recent portfolio and partnerships. So it\u2019s mostly in market share, there is not a market that\u2019s actually weaker than it was a year ago, but for intents and purposes there is not a market much stronger than it was either. And what I think really turns on the dial for banks is when corporate America is more confident and I don\u2019t mean the original old unconfident we\u2019re always uncertain. But things with a Presidential Election in the offering things like Brexit uncertainties we don\u2019t need any of the things like that to continue to give corporate America a reason to just wait and but for M&A and for restructuring their balance sheet corporate America is not organically doing big things at least not needing banks in that process. So that\u2019s when the thing really starts to take-off. But in the meantime we are all getting it out in the trenches, trying to keep more customers and do more with the ones we have. And I just think the right answer as much as it\u2019s hard to prove is that we are doing it in our case with market share growth. Mike Mayo : And so the answer to my question -- that is helpful. But if you strip all that away do you think things are improving generally or not or it\u2019s just kind of the same old? Richard K. Davis: I think I meant to say every market is a little stronger than it was last year. So yes, but not very much. Mike Mayo : Okay. All right, great. Thanks a lot. Richard K. Davis: Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Richard K. Davis: Good morning, Erika. Erika Najarian : Good morning. I was wondering if you could share a little bit of color on the CCAR results. I was a little bit surprised how the regional banks faired in terms of their stress ratios or PPNR assumptions relative to last year. I am wondering if there is any color that you could share with your investor base on that? And also Richard I\u2019m wondering if the CCAR results and how acquirers were treated in this year\u2019s results at all impact your thinking about future acquisitions? Richard K. Davis: Let me say first of all we were very pleased with our CCAR results. I always joke at the stress test and it\u2019s effective because we are stressed the whole time. Also be reminded we haven\u2019t had the final exit exams on all the details and you also know we\u2019ll never know exactly how the model works. But I\u2019ll remind you that in this particular cycle the negative interest rate scenario was added and that\u2019s hard for any of us to predict exactly how that fair for each bank. But I know that that had an impact on what was likely the PPNR for every bank. As you know we continue to be at the top on the PPNR bearly in this case we are slightly below break even, but in the years past we\u2019ve always been above and I think on a relative basis we even performed better. So I\u2019m not concerned about trying to predict that and I think that the test continues to be effective in helping us all understand whether or not on a most stressed scenario we would be okay. Acquirers had more limited capital distribution and so we don\u2019t think that\u2019s a factor to us because it\u2019s not as relevant to us as it will be some others. But I think as you look at the stress test results and you apply it across different kinds of companies it\u2019s not unusual to see different distribution model based on both what we are starting from, what the stress test would do to us and where we would end. Erika Najarian : So essentially it doesn\u2019t impact how you are thinking about understanding that you have a consent order in place. But it doesn\u2019t impact your thinking about how to manage capital for future acquisition. Richard K. Davis: No, I mean emphatically no, in fact it doesn\u2019t have any impact on it at all. What we wanted to do is we want to continue to understand the best methodologies that they use in stress testing the loan portfolio. So we can better understand what mechanics are in there so we can predict those better than we have in the past. But we also continue to outperform on the PPNR as it relates to their satisfaction in the model with how much money we\u2019ll make. So it works both ways but every year we get smarter every year we go back and do our best to evaluate it and as I said we are a little bit early on getting any formal feedback which we\u2019ll be getting in the next couple of weeks between this and the next time we talk. Erika Najarian : Got it. And just as a follow-up question. Really appreciate the color on how to think about payments revenues as we think about forecasting. Could you give us a sense of how much of your payments revenues are generated in pounds so we can think about translation risk? Andrew J. Cecere: The translation is rather limited. So if you think about every 1% change it\u2019s about $1 million it\u2019s not a big number, Erika. Erika Najarian : Got it, thank you. Richard K. Davis: Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Richard K. Davis: Hi, Vivek. Vivek Juneja : Hi. Couple of follow-up. Firstly on CCAR, your current cost are at the high end compared to last year, can you comment on your thoughts on the results that are showing up there? Kathy Rogers : Yes. And I think really where you see that is particularly within our wholesale portfolio. And that\u2019s been something we\u2019ve been working on for quite a few years. I think we have tended to be on the higher side -- the Fed has been a little bit on the higher side. We don\u2019t have a whole lot of input into -- insight into what some of their modeling routines are, as you know it\u2019s relatively a black pot. But perhaps, we\u2019re thinking perhaps that, if you think about where our utilization rates and so forth that could have a play we\u2019re relatively low on a utilization side, but we are actually, as you notice, we project a lot lower risk in a downturn environment than the Fed and we\u2019re just going to continue to share to work through that and try and figure out where the differences lie. Richard K. Davis: So Vivek, this is a point of frustration for me, because we in the first couple of years, I was really worried, if we were different than them how bigger deal could that be. I will say that history is probably now better dictate than testing itself. And if you look in the last seven years, which is exact timeframe that we\u2019ve got the stress test our commercial portfolios outperformed almost everybody and done very, very well. And so, I\u2019m not challenging the test, I\u2019m just challenging that we\u2019re never going to figure out what they put in, Kathy gave you a hint. We think our commitments have been growing faster than anybody, well in addition to our loan growth. And I think if they take a model where all the commitments go to 100%, and they go to charge-off, that could be it. We have a big government portfolio in our corporate business, which if they take a 90 day late pay and take the whole portfolio to charge-off, maybe that could be it. And as simple as it sounds, we\u2019ll never get the answer, even to those questions I just offered. So what we will do is continue to watch our own performance as you should measure the dictate on how well we\u2019ve actually done in charge-offs and non-performs over the course of time. So we\u2019ll just do our best to get closer on that test. But we don\u2019t understand exactly ourselves, how it test like it does, when the results themselves show that way. Vivek Juneja : Okay, thanks. One more, capital markets, you have grown very strongly Richard. As you continue to do that, does that shift what you\u2019re thinking in terms of -- so that\u2019s been one of the strongest fee growth driver this quarter, and you\u2019re trying to grow underwriting. Does that shift what you are thinking from a capital standpoint, where especially when you look at peers, et cetera? Richard K. Davis: Vivek, I would say it doesn\u2019t shift, it\u2019s just -- it\u2019s a reflection of what\u2019s occurring in the market. We\u2019ve had traditionally two strong growth areas in fees, trust and our payments group, and it\u2019s great to have this third area come in and started taking what the market gives us. And given this low rate environment and the volatility, things like credit fixed income FX are very strong as well as derivatives. So it\u2019s great that we have these businesses, which in fact 10 years ago we didn\u2019t have. So it\u2019s a positive add to the fee businesses that we have. Vivek Juneja : Right. But given that it\u2019s a higher volatility business would that not mean that as you think about economic capital, but when you\u2019ve talked about 8% or 8.5% in the past that that starts to migrate slightly upwards. Richard K. Davis: No. I wouldn\u2019t expect that to have any impact on our capital ratio at all. Vivek Juneja : Okay, thanks. Richard K. Davis: Sure. Operator : Your next question is from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Richard K. Davis: Hi, Bill. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good morning. Richard, I had a question on your P2P money transfer product. How are you thinking about the potential disintermediation risk that clear exchange could pose to the revenues that you generate on the card issuing side of your business? Or are there any restrictions that you could put in place to prevent potential disintermediation? Richard K. Davis: Good question, Bill. First of all, we are clear exchanges [ph]. So we\u2019re going to be on either side of that transaction. But I\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s the same answer I gave three years ago with Square, when Square started coming out big with Starbucks, and at least for now not for long-term, but for now, most of these transactions are taking money out of this, cash out of the system not other card, debit or credit transactions. There is still so much cash in our system, in our society, there is plenty of disintermediation of cash a long before it starts to tap up against the other card businesses and that\u2019s what we are all planning for in the near-term and that could be a couple of years. But short beyond that period of time, we all have to be very thoughtful and your question is right on the money, as it relates to what\u2019s the evolving relationship between real time Pay-to-Pay, card, card not present, and the mobility of people moving money about in the different environment.  Remember we\u2019re still under a Federal Reserve circumstance that settles overnight and not over the weekend. So there is still a big disconnect and we have those things to fix systemically, before we get to a real time payment. But for now, disintermediation is mostly seen on cash and that\u2019s a net positive for us in the other banks, because that we have no benefit in cash moving about for the most part, we do when it starts to monetize itself in the form of the payment. Bill Carcache : Right. But maybe just as a follow-up, I guess the nature of that product is really for clear exchange where P2P money transfer between individuals not necessary to conduct a payment transaction. But I guess to the extent that you were and given your position as both acquirer and issuer you would be in a very good position to see to the extent to which people who are using the product to actually conduct payment transactions in lieu of USB credit card. And if that were the case is that something that you would expect to be monitoring and rack to as appropriate to the extent that we\u2019re having a revenue impact. Andrew J. Cecere: I think the principle -- this is Andy. I think the principal activity today is as Richard mentioned is cash and is also check individual-to-individual. I think the second category that will occur is for people to pay bills. And the bill payment again is going to be a replacement for check and or online checking. So it is in the bill pay so to speak. So in the interim or in the immediate timeframe I don't think there is any negative at all and we\u2019ll continue to monitor as Richard said over the long-term. I think the other thing to consider as how this migrates to the wholesale side of equation in the business. And that\u2019s also something we\u2019re very aware of. Richard K. Davis: Yeah that\u2019s right. So think about this is P2P right. Then there is P2B, people are paying their bills and there is a B2P where people are trying to business are reaching out to you and giving you reason to buy things and send money back. And then there is B2B which we\u2019re all working on including block chain. And then we\u2019re working on all of those alternative most of those are so nascent. I think as a banking category those are just all upside for us, because there is so much opportunity and much less to see remediation. But you\u2019re on to something, Bill and there will be a time. Right now babysitters you go home and you pay him cash, you write them check. Now you\u2019re going to start doing it in real time between you and the 17 year old and the money moves. We\u2019re assuming remediating something that\u2019s right now not a debit or credit card. But overtime this is something we have to put the whole universe together and figure it out. And I\u2019ve said this before I\u2019ll say it again the banks as a collaborative are working better together than we ever have to make sure we work together and create a better circumstance for all of our clients. And I think that\u2019s a big plus in the last couple of years if we see payments emerge as a real time issue. Bill Carcache : That\u2019s great color. Thanks gentlemen. Richard K. Davis: Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Kevin Barker : Thank you very much. Good morning. In regards to your commentary around the Brexit and your real positive commentary around that. Could you dig in a little bit on the impact of the Brexit in regards to your payments business in particular? Richard K. Davis: Yeah that\u2019s generally where it\u2019s going to be. Because we\u2019ve got the merchant acquiring activity, which we\u2019ve talked about a little bit here before. So I think we\u2019ll make -- we'll call it neutral for now based on what you can Kevin just because we have such a UK influence. I think there is a positive in UK enter UK and there is probably side negative enter Continental Europe. But we\u2019re going to say that to be net to favorably positive on the payment side.  Terry you got the trust side, you got a lot of employees in the Brexit impact there, you might talk about that. Terrance R. Dolan: Yeah in our corporate trust business which is that we have in Europe at least recently we\u2019ve seen just a little bit of a tick down with respect to deals that are being done as people kind of pause during that timeframe. But the impact that it had on the long rate of a curve so the tenure actually is probably going to stimulate the deal flow in terms of debt issuances. So the overall net impact of that over the next quarter or two, I would actually anticipate would probably be positive. Richard K. Davis: Yeah deals aren\u2019t getting allowed they\u2019re just being come in the new ones... Terrance R. Dolan: In Europe they\u2019re be in deferred, but in the United States the yield curve impact is actually stimulating some growth. Richard K. Davis: Is that helpful Kevin? Kevin Barker : Yeah that\u2019s very helpful. And then in regards to your marketing spend and professional services spend obviously that can be volatile quarter-to-quarter depending on the business conditions and what your planning for the future. But given the uptick you\u2019re seeing there, would you expect that to decline over the next few quarters just because of the spend we saw in the second quarter? Richard K. Davis: Yeah good question. In my 54% range of efficiency we\u2019re holding steady to finish what we start at this year on our marketing and branding campaign because there is a value and stability and sustainability in messaging. As you know people have to do things seven times to remember them once. So we\u2019re not going to give up on that and then the cost of third-party assistance on compliance as I said starts to tick down slowly. So those are both sustainable for the rest of this year. But trust me everything we can control continues to be in our gun sights. And marketing is one of those things that if it has to go it has to go, but I\u2019d love very much to not cut it off just a bit too soon if in fact we\u2019re on the advent of some times here what we can afford to do what we want to do and grow the company greatly. Kevin Barker : Thank you for taking my questions. Richard K. Davis: Yeah, thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Richard K. Davis: Good morning, Nancy. Nancy Bush : Good morning, Richard, how are you? Richard K. Davis: How are you? Nancy A. Bush: . : A - RichardK. Davis: Yeah. Well, first of all, I\u2019m going to join you more than because I agree with you. But I will tell you, we are what we see. And I\u2019m going to say two things that Fed is it has a different lens on this. They are looking at different things and looking usually later than we are. But on a real time basis, which we live in everyday, we are seeing a slow recovery. And it\u2019s a small nuance on a word, but a recession as things are going backwards where people are starting to feel worse and not taking actions that they might otherwise have taken before. We are not seeing that. On the other hand, because we\u2019re balance sheet companies and because we're highly levered and because half of what we do is in the wholesale business, we\u2019re all, I think, spending a lot of energy talking about how we\u2019re waiting for the wholesale side of the balance sheet to pick up in a real organic, old-fashioned way, and we\u2019re also not seeing that. But they\u2019re not going backwards, so just taking this long, long, long period of time to restructure, evaluate their best options when things do pick up. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, but that\u2019s why we have all these unused commitments and continue to grow the balance sheet. About the business side, they\u2019ve got reasons and they\u2019re informed and they\u2019re waiting. But on the consumer side, it\u2019s a little bit better every quarter and it\u2019s not a recession. And I would disagree it if someone is saying that at Fed level. And in fact, I think you can see consumers are starting to spend again. They\u2019re savings is at a level that they are comfortable. They\u2019re using their credit cards and they\u2019re paying it back on time and getting rewards for it. But I would say it actually make sense to me. But for the words recession being standard about lately by a lot of parties, we don't see it. Nancy A. Bush: Okay. Secondly, I had a question related to the consent order. You mentioned that it prevents you from doing branch acquisitions. Basically, branch institutions. Does it also prevent you from opening any new loan production offices? Is that something you're thinking about? And which markets do you -- are there any markets that you need to be in that you're not in right now? Richard K. Davis: Good question. The answer is no. It doesn\u2019t impair our ability to open loan production markets. And the answer is we don\u2019t have any new markets to get into, but I\u2019ve never had the chance to show you guys just how many markets we are in out of our footprint. So 25 state footprint where you see us on the street and you drive by us every day. And the other 25 states, for the most part, for commercial real estate, corporate trusts, middle market and large corporate, we\u2019re in all of those states. We just really have never taken the time to show you that. So I\u2019ll make this a note to do that at the Investor Day in September 15th to make sure we show you where all of our loan production offices are outside of what would be the footprint. Because when I show you, you\u2019ll see wherever we want to be, and so the answer to the expansion is no, because we\u2019re already there. Nancy A. Bush: Okay, thank you. RichardK. Davis: Yes, thanks. Operator : Your final question comes from Terry McEvoy with Stephens. RichardK. Davis: Hey, Terry. Terence McEvoy : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Trust and investment management fees, looked to be up 6% or 7% if I just based off the trailing four quarter average. In the release, you talked about account growth. Could you give a little bit more color about that business in 2Q as well as maybe the outlook for the back half of the year? Andrew J. Cecere: Yes. So if you ended up looking at the second quarter or if you look at the first half, the first quarter was a little bit slower simply because of the market spend. But in the second quarter where the market starting to recover, we\u2019re starting to see nice growth again with respect to new accounts, both on the corporate institutional side as well as within wealth management itself. So we end up looking into the second half of the year. We would anticipate that that sort of growth would continue just given the rebound, for example, in the markets where they are at today. Terence McEvoy : And then just a quick question for Kathy. Could you run through your mortgage banking outlook for Q3? And then just so I am cleared, does that include your best guess on hedging, gains losses and MSR changes in fair value? Kathy Rogers : Yes. So for mortgage fees, we are anticipating that that will have a linked quarter increase of about 20% to 30%. That does include all of our assumptions around hedging and so forth, so that\u2019s all in. And as Andy indicated earlier, I do think that we\u2019re going to see a little bit of a shift between -- in our application base from purchase -- between the purchase and refi. As he indicated, we\u2019re kind of 65-35 this quarter. I think that that\u2019s likely to go more towards the 60% purchase, 40% refi as we move forward. Terence McEvoy : Perfect. Thanks so much. Richard K. Davis: Thanks, Terry. Operator : I will now turn the call over for closing remarks. Kathy Rogers : Thank you for listening to the view of our second quarter 2016 results. Please contact us if you have any follow-up questions. Richard K. Davis: Thanks, everybody. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Following a review of the results by Richard Davis, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Dolan, U.S. Bancorp's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the conference call over to Jen Thompson of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. Jen Thompson : Thank you, Melissa and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Terry Dolan Andy Cecere and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's third quarter results and to answer your questions. Richard and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at USBank.com. I'd like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page 2 of today's presentation and our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Richard. Richard Davis : Thanks, Jen. Good morning, everybody and thanks for joining our call. I'd like to begin our review of U.S. Bank's results with a summary of the quarter's highlights on page 3 of the presentation. U.S. Bancorp reported net income of $1.5 billion for the third quarter of 2016 or a record $0.84 per diluted common share. I'm very pleased with the third quarter results. Industry-leading profitability was supported by solid loan and deposit growth and broad-based core revenue growth. As a reminder, our prior quarter results included notable items including a Visa gain of $180 million in noninterest income and $150 million related to litigation accruals and a charitable contribution in noninterest expense. There were no notable items to report in the third quarter. So for the remainder of this call, we will discuss the results on a core basis excluding the notable second quarter items I just described, as this is how we believe the investment community looks at our results. Slide 4 provides you with a five-quarter history of our profitability metrics which continue to be among the best in the industry. In the third quarter, our return on average common equity was 13.5% and our efficiency ratio was 54.5%. Turning to slide 5, the Company reported total net revenue of $5.4 billion in the third quarter. Excluding notable items in the second quarter of 2016, this represents an increase of 2.3% on a linked quarter basis. Our revenue growth was primarily driven by loan growth of 1.1% and strength in a number of our fee-based businesses, including mortgage banking and Payment Services. The industry continues to face headwinds from the low rate environment and a flatter yield curve. This quarter, our net interest margin was also impacted by higher levels of cash balances due to the strong deposit inflows. However, despite our lower net interest margin, which declined by 4 basis points to 2.98%, in line with expectations, we reported net interest income growth both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis. Credit quality was stable in the third quarter as expected. Both nonperforming assets and net charge-offs decreased modestly compared with the prior linked quarter. Before turning to Terry, I'll provide you with an outlook for the fourth quarter. Currently, we expect average loans to continue to grow in the range of 1% to 1.5% sequentially. While mortgage loan growth is expected to slow in line with industrywide tapering of refinancing activity and due to seasonality, we look for a rebound in commercial loan growth in the fourth quarter and expect strength in consumer loans to continue. Given the current shape of the yield curve, we expect that the net interest margin will decline a couple of basis points. However, we expect net interest income will increase on a linked quarter basis, principally driven by growth in earning assets. We look for somewhat lower mortgage revenue in the fourth quarter, in line with an expectation of lower refinancing activity. We expect expenses to grow 2.5% on a linked quarter basis, primarily driven by seasonally higher expenses including tax credit amortization costs related to our community development business. And finally, given the underlying mix and quality of the overall portfolio, we expect credit quality to remain relatively stable and we expect the provision to increase in line with loan growth. Terry will now provide you with more details about our third quarter results. Terry Dolan : Thanks, Richard. I'll start on slide 6 which highlights our loan and deposit growth. Average total loans outstanding grew 1.1% on a linked quarter basis and increased 7.6% compared with the third quarter of 2015. Excluding the retail card portfolio acquisitions completed in the second half of last year and student loans that were reclassified to held-for-investment in the third quarter of 2015, loans grew by 6.4% compared to the prior year. In the third quarter, the year-over-year increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans of 9.0% and strong growth in average total residential mortgage loans of 8.6%. Consumer loan growth was broad-based, led by credit card loans and other retail loans. Specifically, credit card loans grew 5.9%, excluding the retail card acquisition; and other retail loans grew 5.2%, excluding the student loans. Home equity loans grew 2.4% on a year-over-year basis, with growth primarily sourced from our branch network. On a linked quarter basis, our average loan growth was 1.1%, in line with our expectations. Credit card loans grew 2.4%; residential mortgage loans grew 1.4%; home equity loans were up 0.5%; and other retail loans were up 2.7%. Total average deposits increased by more than $28 billion or 10% compared with the third quarter of 2015 and were up 3.6% on a linked quarter basis. On a year-over-year basis, the trend reflected strong growth of 11.9% in our low-cost deposits, which includes our non-interest-bearing deposits and our interest-bearing savings deposits. This strong core deposit growth more than offset the runoff in higher-cost time deposits. Turning to slide 7, credit quality remained relatively stable in the third quarter. Third quarter net charge-offs increased by $23 million or 7.9% compared with the prior year, but decreased by $2 million compared with the second quarter of 2016. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans were 46 basis points in the third quarter, unchanged from the prior year and down from the 48 basis points reported in the linked quarter. Compared with a year ago, nonperforming assets increased $97 million or 6.2%, mostly due to downgrades that occurred in the prior quarters related to energy credit. Linked quarter, nonperforming assets decreased by $8 million or less than 1%, primarily driven mainly from improvements in residential mortgages and other real estate. We continued to add to the allowance for loan losses in the third quarter, in line with loan growth. Slide 8 provides highlights of third quarter results versus comparable periods. Third quarter net income increased by $13 million or 0.9% on a year-over-year basis, net revenue growth was partially offset by higher noninterest expense. As Richard mentioned, results in the prior quarter were impacted by notable items, including a $180 million Visa gain in noninterest income and $150 million in noninterest expenses related to litigation accruals and a charitable contribution. Excluding notable items from the second quarter, net income increased by $2 million or 0.1%, reflecting total net revenue growth of 2.3%, offset by noninterest expense growth of 3.1%. Our efficiency ratio of 54.5% was in line with our guidance of 54% to 54.9%. Turning to slide 9, net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis increased by $122 million or 4.3% compared with the prior year. Strong average earning asset growth was offset somewhat by the impact of a 6 basis point decline in the net interest margin to 2.98%. The year-over-year decline in the net interest margin primarily reflected increased funding cost, higher average cash balances, and lower rates on securities purchases partially offset by higher rates on new loans. Compared with the second quarter of 2016, taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $47 million or 1.6%. Growth in average total loans was offset by a 4 basis point decrease in the net interest margin. The linked quarter decline in the margin primarily reflects the impact of higher cash balances which represented 3 out of the 4 basis point decline, as well as lower average rates on securities purchased, offset somewhat by the benefit of higher LIBOR rates on loans during the quarter. Slide 10 highlights trends in noninterest income which increased $119 million or 5.1% year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to growth in mortgage banking revenue, trust and investment management fees, credit and debit card revenue and merchant processing revenue. Mortgage banking revenue increased $90 million or 40.2%, supported by core growth and strong industrywide refinancing activity which drove originations and sales volume. Trust and investment management fees increased $33 million or 10%, reflecting lower money market fee waivers, growth in assets under management and improved equity markets. A $30 million or 11.2% increase in credit and debit card revenue was driven by higher transaction volumes, including the acquired portfolios. Merchant processing revenue increased $12 million or 3%. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, merchant processing revenue increased 5.3% from the prior year. On a linked quarter basis, noninterest income increased $73 million or 3.1%. The increase was principally due to stronger mortgage banking revenue and growth in payment services revenue. Mortgage banking revenue increased $76 million or 31.9% which slightly exceeded our previous guidance range of 20% to 30%. Growth in mortgage banking revenue was driven by higher production volumes, reflecting stronger refinancing activity. Mortgage banking revenue was also supported by a favorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights net of hedging activities. Corporate payment products revenue increased by $9 million or 5.0%. And as a reminder, corporate payment products revenue is seasonally stronger in the third quarter of each year. Merchant processing revenue increased $9 million or 2.2% due to seasonally higher transaction volumes. Excluding the impact of foreign currency changes, merchant processing revenue would have increased by 3.5% sequentially. Commercial product revenue decreased by $19 million or 8.0%, primarily due to higher capital markets volume in the second quarter which in turn reflected market volatility during that quarter. Turning to slide 11, noninterest expense increased $156 million or 5.6% on a year-over-year basis. Compensation expense grew versus the prior year, primarily due to hiring decisions to support business growth and compliance programs, as well as the impact of merit increases and variable compensation tied to production. Professional services increased $12 million or 10.4%, also reflecting costs associated with compliance programs. Technology and communication expense increased $21 million or 9.5%, including the impact of capital investments and costs related to the acquired credit card portfolios. We continue our investment in our brand which is reflected in slightly higher marketing costs from a year ago. On a linked quarter basis, noninterest expense increased $89 million or 3.1%. Compensation expense increased $52 million or 4.1%, due to the impact of one additional day in the quarter and increased staffing. The $23 million increase or 5.1%, in other noninterest expense primarily reflected seasonally higher costs related to investments in tax-advantaged projects and the impact of the FDIC surcharge which began in the third quarter of 2016. Marketing and business development costs decreased $7 million or 6.4% due to the timing of various marketing programs. As Richard mentioned, we expect expenses to grow in the fourth quarter, however at a slower pace than the 3.1% growth that we recorded in the third quarter. Our current expectation is for linked quarter expenses to grow by 2.5% in the fourth quarter. This is primarily due to seasonal expenses, including tax credit amortization costs which we expect will increase on a linked quarter basis approximately $60 million during the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we realize the benefit of these tax credits in our tax rate. The linked quarter decline in preferred dividends was reflective of our fourth quarter 2015 preferred stock issuance which has a semiannual dividend payment. As a result of that issuance, we will have higher quarterly dividends in quarters 2 and 4 of every year, compared with quarters 1 and 3. Turning to slide 12, our capital position remains strong; and in the third quarter we returned 79% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. We expect to remain in our targeted payout ratio of 60% to 80% going forward. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, estimated using the Basel III Standardized Approach as if fully implemented at September 30, was 9.3% which is well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. Our tangible book value per share rose to $18.85 at September 30, representing a 9.6% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 2.1% increase over the prior quarter. I will now turn it back to Richard. Richard Davis : Thanks, Terry. I'm very proud of our record third quarter results. We maintained our industry-leading performance measures and we reported an 18.1% return on tangible common equity in the quarter. Our industry continues to face challenges from the low interest rate environment. However, we remain confident that we can continue to grow revenue even as we prudently manage expenses and strategically invest in our businesses to create value for both our customers and for our shareholders. That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Terry, Bill and I would be happy to answer any of your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Ricky Dodds : This is Ricky Dodds from Matt's team. I've got a quick question on C&I loan growth. It's a little weaker than we expected and I was wondering if you could provide us any color on what's driving the slowdown at USB? Richard Davis : Yes. I'll go first, Ricky and I'll turn it over to Andy. As we\u2019ve said, I think, at our Investor Day five weeks ago, we think quarter 3 represents a pause in C&I lending, meaning that it was strong in quarter 2 and we expect it to recover in quarter 4, in part based on what we believe is the vagaries of quarter 3 where we had some of the Brexit activities moved things up into quarter 2 and perhaps some of the uncertainty around election and other things moving things into quarter 4, but we see that returning nonetheless. You'll see that we had a particularly across-the-board performance in most of the corporate space as the slowdown reflected things like higher paydowns, reduction in deal activity. And a healthy capital market condition allowed some borrowers to use the debt markets, although we also captured some of that in our capital markets activity. The rest of the lending, though, on the consumer side, remained strong and in fact got stronger as the year progresses, and we continue to see that progressing into quarter 4 as well. But for a little color around commercial and CRE, maybe we'll have Andy give you that. Andy Cecere : So another factor was a little lower utilization rate. We were down maybe 75 basis points from 26 to 25.25 this quarter, and this is reflective of some of the things Richard talked about. Again I think the very strong debt capital markets issuance that we saw in the second quarter and early in the third quarter impacted Bank outstandings, as we talked about. And finally M&A activity which was a driver of strong growth in prior quarters, took a little bit of a pause here in the third quarter, either delayed or deferred to future quarters. So those factors all come into play and that's why we think it was more of a pause and that will come back a little bit as we [indiscernible]. Richard Davis : I just might add, it's already October, what is it, 19th? And so we're deep into the fourth quarter, and we have a pretty good idea how the annuities look, so we can see growth certainly over quarter 3. It's how strong it gets in the next couple of weeks; we'll be able to reflect at the next conference. Operator : Your next question is from John McDonald with Bernstein. John McDonald : I wanted to ask about expenses and efficiency, Richard. Where are you on the ongoing effort to kind of improve productivity and expenses but also keep investing? Is it a goal to try to self-fund your expenses and investments with savings elsewhere? Or is it more about an efficiency ratio mindset? Richard Davis : Yes, so you know, John, we don't measure efficiency ratio. It becomes the result of the fraction of revenues-to-expenses. So the best way to keep it low is to do more revenue which is our number-one goal. Expense-wise, I think we've telegraphed to you all that we appreciate that the higher cost of compliance and actually some of the capital expenditures we've been making in innovation technology continued to bear down on expenses. So I will continue to let expenses grow only to the level that revenue is allowing it under the circumstances that we set forth at the Investor Day which is that we think there will be a couple of nominal rate increases in 2017. With those rate increases, we made a commitment to you all, based on what we can see today to provide slightly positive operating leverage in this environment. We also said, however, if those rates don't materialize, it will be much harder for us to do that. To give you a sense of it, without the rates, a couple of rate increases in the next year, that for us is hundreds of millions of dollars in expenses that we would need to reduce further and I think would probably cut into some of the muscle of the Company's long-term objectives for growth and innovation. So we're not going to make that commitment at this stage, but we'll watch every nickel and dime. I always find a need to pause and remind you guys, to be in the 54%s isn't, like, easy. We don't sit there and we watch every nickel and dime and we have efficiency programs all over the Company. One of the ways we've kept it low is that we continue to get better every day. We take innovation and we let technology make it more efficient for our Company and for our people and therefore better service, but it's not easy. So we do have expense programs all the time, every day and forever. Some of the companies I know that announced efficiency programs, they put names around them, they give you dollar amounts; we don't do that because it's not our style. We also don't need to. But we do watch it every single day. So we will let revenue be the dictate in most cases to how well that efficiency ratio performs. Our goal is to have it continue to be in the mid-50%s and for a while. At that point, we'll measure against a future that I think won't be starved for investment. At the same token, the minute things get better and we have every opportunity to save a dollar, we will do that very thing and give you a better return. John McDonald : Just on the topic of rates, I was hoping to ask Terry if he could flesh out a little bit of the outlook on the NIM that you gave for next quarter. What are some of the puts and takes, the good guys and bad guys affecting the NIM outlook for next quarter? And if you could include there, what's your guess as to the effect that one Fed rate hike would have on your NIM in the quarter afterwards? Thanks. Andy Cecere : Sure. Incorporated into our guidance, we're assuming that the rate hike does occur in the December time frame; and that in and of itself would have a positive impact with respect to margin, probably maybe by a basis point or so. But one of the things that we anticipate, John, is that the cash balances that we saw an increase in, in the third quarter, we think are tied to money market reform. And that is going to have an impact in terms of net interest margin at least probably through the fourth quarter. We anticipate that it's going to be transitory and that those cash balances will start to dissipate as people get more comfortable with money market reform, but when we guide that the net interest margin is going to be down a couple of basis points, the cash balances are going to have an impact on that. John McDonald : And Terry, just to clarify, the one basis point NIM help, is that for the quarter that -- if it happened in December you would get that help this quarter? And would there be a carrythrough to the next quarter that's a little bigger than that? Terry Dolan : Yes. Richard Davis : Yes and yes. Operator : Your next question is from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Back to the loan growth topic, thanks for the color that you've given in terms of near term trends; and I hear you in terms of some of the inconsistencies around borrower demand amid the uncertainty right now. How does that play into your expectation for how you're looking at 2017? I know you don't yet have guidance and there for loan growth. But I want to get an idea if you continue to expect improvement coming out of fourth quarter through 2017 and generally expect a higher level of loan growth. Thanks. Richard Davis : The answer is yes. We've been in that range of 1% to 1.5% for a long, long time. Every quarter is different and yet we've found a way to pretty much stay there and I think you can count on that to be a forerunner for the future. When revenue is -- or when growth is strong in retail, it might be stressed in commercial; but this is a really well bifurcated model we have here. We like C&I, we like CRE, we like all consumer categories; but we see actually a little slightly stronger 2017 than 2016 based on nothing more than the fact that the world gets better a little bit, slowly but surely and because we're taking market share. I haven't talked about market share in a number of quarters, because I know it's a hollow category when all banks are doing well and everybody talks about it, but you know, we really are -- $28 billion in deposits in one year, the kind of loan growth we've had consistently, 10% commercial loan growth year-over-year, we're taking market share. And part of that, John, is also a proxy for next year, because we believe that market share momentum not only continues but it gets stronger.  When anybody in our environment -- think of the foreign banks or think of other banks that go through any period of stress -- we get the benefit of that. And as long as we continue to be -- if we're not their first customer, we're their first choice after that particular bank they're with, that's going to be a really good way for us to grow the business. So next year it's across-the-board. We expect to be strong in virtually every category. Look at our home equity. We continue to grow home equity and it's not with smoke and mirrors. We do it the old-fashioned way with really good products and really good branch-based products coming out of the branch employees. That's something that is really quite a difference from most of the companies that we compete with. So we can do it across-the-board and we like all the categories. So I think quarter 4 will continue to be in that range. I think next year will be in that range and maybe slightly positive bias to that. John Pancari : Then separately, I guess this would be a question for you as well, would be around the regulatory side. Since we've been talking about the regulatory expenses that you've been putting in the work, can you give us a related update on the BSA/AML progress and if there's any way to help us with expectations of when that could be resolved? Thanks. Richard Davis : Yes, sure, John. We're deep in the middle of it, so I not only don't have a projection of when we'll leave, if I had it I wouldn't tell you because of the regulators. I haven't made any agreements. So that will take a while; it will definitely be well into next year that we'll get a line of sight on when we can look for an exit of that. In the meantime, it's taken us to a compliance cost level that I had hoped to recover when we got out of the mortgage consent order which we're now long out of. But as it turns out, when the AML Consent Order came in, it's virtually replaced those same costs. So with our growth expectation of reducing expenses, we're unable to do that at this point. But it's also finding its way now into the run rate of the Company. It's also made us a better bank. I don't like Consent Orders and we only have the one and it's frustrating to me. But the fact of the matter is it's a proxy for the expectations of zero tolerance for errors and we've aligned that proxy with everything we do. It takes a little bit of time to adjust to it. It takes a little bit more money to get your first, second and third lines to do amazing levels of oversight and quality assurance. But once and when you've done that and you've put it into your run rate, both in costs and the way you do business, we'll be a better bank for it. So I would like you to think that the AML project has extended itself through the whole Company to improve our compliance capability and therefore fend off any other future areas of shortcomings. And I would say next year we'll be able to give you a better line of sight; but at this stage, we're deep in the middle of it, doing our very best job to satisfy the regulators and to overperform even to our own expectations. And at this point, I'd be hesitant to give you any kind of an exit timetable. Operator : Your next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : I had a question on the fee side of things. Terry, you mentioned that mortgage would be down in the fourth; and you talked about into the quarter how it would have a nice leap. I'm just wondering. It looked like the gain on sale margin was quite high. I'm calculating 150. Can you walk us through the mix of refi versus purchase and what you're expecting in general for mortgage to do in the fourth quarter? Andy Cecere : Sure. If you end up looking at the third quarter versus, for example, the second quarter, just to address your question related to the mix of refinancings, in the second quarter the mix was about 65% to 70% on the purchase side; and the rest of it was refinance, so let's say 35%. It was closer to 45% during the third quarter and we would expect that that refinancing mix will probably decline closer to 40% in the fourth quarter. So it is coming down based upon what we're seeing. You are right that when you end up looking at the mix of where a lot of that refinancing is coming from, it's coming from high-quality product, again primarily sourced -- probably a higher mix through our retail banking system. So when you end up looking at the gain on sale in that margin, we're seeing in the third quarter a better margin than what we had experienced in the past. So the growth that we saw in the third quarter is a mix of higher production as well as higher margin. So you're right on. Ken Usdin : Can you help us triangulate that to what kind of delta? You helped us understand the 20% to 30% up in the third; does that roll back off in the fourth or is it somewhere in the middle? Andy Cecere : Yes, I would say that it's probably somewhere in the middle, again, simply because of where the production is going to come from. When you have higher levels of production you're able to get better margins and pricing with respect to the product and therefore better margins as a result. But when we end up looking at the fourth quarter, we do expect the margin on production to be starting to taper a little bit, as well as production levels. Ken Usdin : A second follow-up, just, Richard, you've made the point about the kind of set-your-clock-to-it seasonality. I was just wondering on the rest of fees generally, do you see just the same type of growth patterns happening as far as the ones that grow and the ones that typically don't? And just your general sense of the ex-mortgage, just fee businesses, any improvements underneath the surface there? Richard Davis : Yes, I'll let Andy answer that, but I want to tell you, Ken, we're a seasonally strong fourth/third quarter Company on revenue, also higher expenses in third and fourth quarter because of the CDC. But that's one of the reasons this can look like a consistent predictable outcome, but it's slightly different each time. Quarter 4 we like a lot for fees and I'll have Andy give you some color around that. Andy Cecere : Right. The quarter 3 is the strongest quarter for corporate payments and then it tapers off a little bit. If you look at merchant and credit card issuing, I would expect a continued level of growth that you saw this quarter, the same-store sales in that 2%-plus, total revenue in that 3% to 5% like you saw this quarter. So I would see that same expectation, other than corporate payments which does tend to go down in the fourth quarter because third quarter is the strongest given the government activity. Trust fees will be a bit of a function of what the market is doing. We had a strong quarter this quarter with both strong market activity as well as good core growth. I would expect that to continue. And then Terry made reference to money market reform. We did see quite a shift in our balances also. Our primary funds went down in the neighborhood of $6 billion given money market reform; but our government bonds went up almost $9 billion. So how that settles out will also be impacted with fees here in the fourth quarter. Operator : Your next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Just a follow-up question on John's line of questioning, if I look at the 6% year-over-year increase in expenses in both 2Q and 3Q, Richard, could you help us break it down in terms of how much of that could be attributed to higher compliance costs and risk management costs and how much of that could be attributed to costs to invest for innovation? Richard Davis : Yes. The breakdown is it's both. Let's start with just year-over-year running the Company this size. Your merit increases alone, say they are 3%, 3%-plus and our total expenses are half compensation. That's 1.5% right there. Number two, I want to make it clear we're spending a lot more in our CapEx in innovation and technology. Gosh, five years ago this Company was at a $400 million, $500 million max annual investment in CapEx; this year, it's going to be between $800 million and $1 billion and our run rate is probably going to be more like $750 million to $800 million. That's good because it's appropriately -- because we're now more of a technology Company than we used to be. And given our payments leadership, we should be making those kinds of investments which of course will yield value down the line. So that's another piece of it. What's left then is the compensation costs and the overall just running the Company better and spending money on things that we didn't used to spend money on. Like quality assurance which isn't related to the compliance, that's just doing the job better. And making sure our people are paid fairly. The compensation is entire; it's employee benefits and it's the way we treat the employees and making sure that the culture itself is strong across all categories. And sometimes we have to spend money to make sure that the brand is protected, that the employees feel safe, that the work environment is good. And we're investing in all of those things, too. So compliance is a piece of it, Erika. That 6% is a number I don't want to see over the long course of time. I'd like it to come down to over a course of time more like a 3% to 5%, because I do think you have to spend money on investments. But that's a little bit high and compliance is probably the delta on that, that 1% to 2% delta that I want to bring down over time in these most current periods. So it's probably a third of it, but it's also a part that won't sustain over the course of a long period of time because once we get it right we'll get the benefits of that. Erika Najarian : And just a follow-up question, in terms of Governor Tarullo's speech, it sounds like given that your binding constraint will be the capital conservation buffer. That shouldn't make any difference in terms of how you think about capital planning at your size or the need to scale up to your asset base in order to deal with a higher capital requirement. Am I thinking about that correctly? Terry Dolan : Yes, so let me take a stab at it and then Andy can add to it. When you end up looking at Tarullo's comments and then the impact to U.S. Bank, we don't really see that it's going to have a significant impact to either our capital distribution plan or the requirements that we have with respect to the minimum requirement. That is because of the fact when you end up looking at the capital depletion that occurs during the stress-testing process that capital depletion for U.S. Bank, given our risk profile, is lower than the 2.5% buffer that is already incorporated into it. So we think that our minimum requirement from a regulatory perspective is going to continue to be at that 7%. We don't see that technology changing a lot. Impact to peers? Probably the smaller peers, simply because of the fact that they don't have to deal with some of the qualitative aspects I think will be net positive to them. But we don't see a big change to it. So Andy? Andy Cecere : And because of that, Terry, our current binding constraint is the standardized ratio under the base case and it will continue to be up. Operator : Your next question is from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Marty Mosby : You talked a little bit about the shift that was coming in because of the money market change. But deposit growth just continues to outpace loan growth. 10% over the last year for you all is just incredible at this part of the cycle. So why is this? The deposits keep flooding back into the bank balance sheets. Where is the primary source of all that coming from, because it's across-the-board for most banks? Andy Cecere : Marty, I think one of the principal reasons and both Terry and myself referenced it -- is money market reform. We saw ourselves about a $6 billion decline, some of it going to governments. But the industry saw about $0.5 trillion move out of prime obligation or prime funds. Some of that's moved into bank balance sheets and I think some of that will move back once the investment policies and so forth are adjusted to allow for floating NAV. But that is one of the key factors. I think the other factor is some of the movement between and among banks. Again, given ratings and some of the stresses that are occurring, we're getting a lot of deposits that are flowing to us from some of the non-U.S. banks and that has also been helpful. Marty Mosby : The other thing, when you look at the mortgage servicing, this was an interesting quarter for mortgage because you had the production go up with refis, but you also had rates trickle up at the back end of the quarter. So your valuation on servicing was actually positive as well. That happens occasionally but not typical. When you look at the about $25 million that you had positive in valuation, but you also had prepayments that were coming through, so your actual cash flow increased the other adjustments of servicing value, how do you look at the net of those two things going forward in the impact to the mortgage banking fees in fourth quarter and then into next year? Andy Cecere : Yes, Marty, I think when we end up, at least with respect to fourth quarter -- because it's a little hard to look beyond that -- but when we end up looking at looking at the fourth quarter relative to the MSR hedge, we would expect that to taper a little bit as well. That would be another reason why we would expect the mortgage banking revenue to decline somewhat during the quarter. Marty Mosby : But the other changes would also taper down, so that big negative you had there would be less negative as you moved into the next quarter as well. Andy Cecere : That's fair. Operator : Your next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA. Mike Mayo : First, a follow-up from Investor Day, I wasn't sure about your appetite for bank acquisitions after that day. In other words, once you get the regulatory side resolved, are you willing to look a little bit more or not? Richard Davis : Yes, sure. You can go back to, gosh, any of the 40 earnings calls I've had where we would remind you that we will more gladly double down in the 25 retail markets in states that we're in than to go into a new market where we would have lower pricing power and lower brand value. So think the Chicago deal a couple years ago, where we doubled down in Chicago. Think the New Mexico transaction; we moved in as number-three bank overnight. Those kind of opportunities will continue to be attractive to us. The idea of moving into a new market that we don't currently have a position in would have to be remarkably attractive and it would have to be at a pretty high market position to get our attention. So the good news is, despite the fact that we haven't got the ability to do that right now, there's nothing out there that we wish we could have had and the timing is working out pretty well. But when that opportunity is back, you can well count on us looking in-market for sizable deals that are worth disrupting the momentum of the Company -- but in markets where we're already present. Mike Mayo : Then a separate question. Your last comment at Investor Day, maybe I can call it the Richard Davis soliloquy. Richard Davis : Well, I don't know. Now what? Me and the 10-year bond? What is it now? Mike Mayo : Well, you go, look, banking has this remarkably noble opportunity to change the world; there's no other business I can think of. We don't feed people or fly people or give them medication; we get behind their possibilities. And it goes on a little bit more. And just the disconnect between that statement talking about the noble opportunity of banking and the tarnish the banking industry has now, due to some issues around cross-selling and-- Richard Davis : Sure. Mike Mayo : I'm just looking for some additional perspective from you. What are you doing to ensure this doesn't happen at U.S. Bancorp? And, more generally, when you do make a mistake and you say there's a guarantee, what do you do to fulfill that guarantee? Richard Davis : I just want to start out by saying, we've looked at this whole topic as industry and individual bank. Many years ago at a financial services roundtable, we made an effort to consider a nationwide brand reputation and rebuilding after the downturn and discovered very quickly that the American population wasn't ready for that. The bank industry sadly doesn't speak yet as one voice and even to date still doesn't. But we did agree that each of us could do a much better job of satisfying our own customers and building our own brand and eventually the totality of that would be the way to rebuild. I think, sadly, we're not where we'd like to be, but that's the way to do it. So each bank needs to stand very strongly on its own and do what's right by its customers. And if one bank falls away from that, then it's just one bank; it's not an industry. So we'll figure out a way to tell that story better. In our Company, it's where you start that matters the most in terms of sales culture. And it's not even sales culture, it's culture. Just underline the word culture. Sales practice is part of that; the way you incentivize people is part of that; the way you handle your customers. So answering your last question first, the guarantee is to always stand behind what you promise, overperform if you've made a mistake, atone and apologize, fix what's wrong and then figure out how that applies to the next possible action that could otherwise become a problem later. I've long talked about bankers going from baggage handlers to pilots in the same company. In fact, as of this morning baggage handlers now have to be more like pilots, if you follow the news out of the White House. But we believe that same thing is the case. I think as an industry we have to be much better at handling every individual transaction uniquely and honestly and genuinely. And when we make mistakes, get it right, fix it and apply it to the next things. You know me, Mike. I've been with you as long as anybody on this call and we've never even use the word cross-sell. I don't even know what the cross-sell is at this Bank. Honest to God, I've never, ever looked at that number. I would guess it's between two and four because nobody wants -- any part of their lifecycle needs more than probably two or four services at one time from a bank. But we don't measure that. We don't set quotas. What we instead do is ask our employees to make sure people know what we have so that as their lifecycle change needs and if we're their trusted partner they'll ask us for it. What that means is people buy our products; we don't sell them. As long as we have something they want and it's for services rendered and fees benefited, we'll be happy to provide that. I want to make sure it's clear, though, for this industry, selling is not bad. It's not bad anywhere, as long as you're selling to people's needs and you're making it clear what advantages you have to provide them at the time that they want them. So, yes, it's tough on the industry. But it still always go back to people love their banker, they like their bank, because they made those choices. They don't so much like the industry. We're sadly years away from getting that right. But if every bank and every banker does a better job, despite what happens on occasion in one location or another, we've got a fighting chance to bring this thing back. And I'll close the soliloquy with the fact that this has all been accomplished under a very negative economic environment. One of the reasons banks were possible 10 years ago, notwithstanding the downturn, was when times are good banks are doing more positive things. People are healthier. The economy is moving more quickly. People want us and need us and we can say yes more often. When the world gets a little bit better, we can just say yes more often; we're more popular and we're more effective. When times are tough, actually we move on to defense and we're there to protect people from things that could get them in harm's way. That's a less attractive position. People don't like to watch defensive games either, because it's low-scoring. At the end of the day, at the very end, it really does matter. So I do think it's a noble occupation. I'm very proud of what we do and very proud of the people that do it across this country. It's one of the most important things that we have in America and it's what makes us unique. And by the way, it's the only place where you can get leverage. $1 of deposits at a good bank is worth $7 in loans and that is an amazing way to grow an economy.  So I'm going to still be in the camp of it will get there one day, but one bank at a time. We can control it on that basis and we're doing our best here to do that. Operator : Your next question is from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Kevin Barker : I just wanted to follow-up on some of the comments you made about mortgage banking. In particular, you're mentioning the increase in refi activity. I would assume that the refi activity would tend to be more retail originations versus correspondent. So you probably had a positive mix shift this quarter. Was that a dramatic impact on the number and the gain on sale margin? And going forward, do you expect that mix shift to change as well? Andy Cecere : It was a little bit more retail. And just generally speaking, the gain on sale margins on refinancings are higher than purchases, so that was also a factor. As Terry mentioned, we would expect the refinancing component to go down in the fourth quarter as well as the overall volume. If you look at just the last few years, historically in a normal environment fourth quarter activity is down 10% to 15% because it's just fourth quarter; and new purchases particularly are down. So I would expect that same trend. And we will update you at further conferences during the quarter to give you an update what we're seeing, because it's also very dependent upon rates, particularly at that level of the yield curve which is quite an impact to activity for the fourth quarter. Kevin Barker : We're also seeing in the servicing market the market for MSRs softening and so the yields on those assets are going up. Are you seeing an opportunity to get better margins in the correspondent market and that support your overall gain on sale margin? And are you potentially participating in the purchase of MSRs? Andy Cecere : We're not going to participate in the purchase of MSRs. We're in the correspondent market. It depends on the geography and the type of loan. I would say some of it is very competitive in terms of pricing and some of it a little less competitive. So it depends on the mix. Operator : Your next question is from Brian Foran with Autonomous. Brian Foran : Maybe on the auto business, I realize it's not a huge part of your loan book; between the loans and leases maybe 9% or so of the book. But it's been a source of growth. You outlined a couple years ago some ambitions for market share improvement which you seem to have achieved. I wonder if you could just talk about further appetite for growth both in loans and leases. And then in terms of the credit quality, you had the comment in the release about lower residual gains. The appendix does show delinquencies rising, albeit from pristine levels. Is the performance you're seeing in line with what you had penciled out when you wanted to grow this book? Or is there a deterioration happening? Or how should we think about that? Andy Cecere : Brian, this is Andy, I'll answer those questions. First of all, the volume continues to be strong. It's a function of our dealer partnerships and the technology investments that we've made in the business. It's a good mix of lease as well as purchase. I would expect us to continue to have partnerships expand and continue to see strong growth. I'd also mention that we do not do any subprime activity in this business and we in fact have very conservative credit standards both in terms of term as well as the credit quality underneath it. So it is a high-quality portfolio and I'm very comfortable with the credit. One phenomenon that is occurring in the marketplace is residual values are coming down a bit. That's a function of dealer incentives going up which makes the comparison of new versus used favor the new. That means that the gain on sale is still positive, but might have been somewhere in the $1000 range, it's closer to $600 or $700. You'll see that phenomenon occur through our fee income category. Again I want to highlight it's still positive; it's just less positive. Brian Foran : Maybe one follow-up, and just to get the spirit of the question right, it's not to pin down basis points and the efficiency ratio, but just to make sure it's the right base. For 2016, it sounds like efficiency will be a little higher; the ratio will be a little higher in 4Q. And then I'm assuming we're using the adjusted 2Q number. So as we think about slightly positive operating leverage with a couple rate hikes or maybe flat without, is the base 55%? Basically 55%? Richard Davis : Okay, so you are trying to get the basis points. Look, this year it's going to look back, it's going to be in the mid-54%s. If we can deliver positive operating leverage -- and I said slightly -- then it stays in the mid-54%s. If we're unable to do that, it floats into 55%. Doesn't go above the mid-50%s and it doesn't go down to 51%. Until the world starts to give us a more robust both interest rate trajectory, mostly a steeper yield curve and/or just a stronger economy -- pick any of the three and pick all of the three -- things start to take off. So I'm going to say it as just much -- and expense is much of what you see this year, it's much of what you'll see next year. It's not going to move a lot one way or the other for better or for worse. But I will tell you it's the revenue that we're going to try to hope we can pull down even further into in 2017 and keep growing this thing like we do every year. We had record EPS this year. It's not just because we had a decent buyback but because we have good underlying loan quality and good underwriting and really decent revenue. So we're going to keep delivering that, Brian. And I would just expect it to be fairly consistent with what you see this year. Operator : Your next question is from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo. Jason Harbes : It's actually Jason Harbes on Matt's team. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but maybe I'll just ask a question on the card business. You've seen really nice momentum there this year. It looks like a lot of that is on the back of a Fidelity portfolio acquisition late last year. One thing that caught my eye was the net charge-off ratio was unusually low both sequentially and year-over-year. Is that primarily a function of the higher quality of that Fidelity book? Because I'm looking at the reported level compared to your normalized through-the-cycle target of 4.65% and it's quite a bit below. So just any comments around how your credit card business is going would be much appreciated. Andy Cecere : This is Andy again. Yes, that is the key difference; the Fidelity portfolio is slightly higher quality. Our card portfolio is very high quality, but the downturn that you see in that charge-off level of delinquencies is a function of the higher-quality Fidelity portfolio. Jason Harbes : Maybe just a bigger-picture question on the expense outlook for next year, this year it looks like you're going to come in a bit above the 3% to 5% target. A lot of that seems like it's related to some of the remediation activities that you are undertaking. But as we think about 2017, would it be realistic to think you might actually come in more towards the low end, as those costs or issues are resolved? Terry Dolan : Yes, Jason, one of the things that we've talked about when you think about the compliance programs -- and it ties into some of the things that Richard talked about with respect to AML and BSA -- we'll continue to work on that probably through next year. Last quarter we said that the compliance costs were peaking in the second quarter, but we also said that we really don't see them declining significantly, at least not through 2017. In other words, I would think about it more as it's kind of plateauing and it's going to stay at that level at least for some period of time until we get through some of these compliance issues. So if you're thinking about the 2017 time frame, that's the way that I would think about it. Operator : Your final question is from Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Nancy Bush : Good morning, Richard. How are you? Richard Davis : I'm good. I was wondering where you were. Nancy Bush : Still here in Georgia. Richard Davis : Well, you were on the Morgan Stanley call; I know you love them more. Nancy Bush : Yes. Yes, you could have brought up the -- you opened the door with mentioning election and Brexit and some other things. But I'm just more curious about your view of the regulatory scene right now. It seems everybody is focusing on Tarullo's latest speech or what a Fed governor is saying and we're losing sight of the forest for the trees. So can you just give me your impression of the overall regulatory scene? And do you expect it to change markedly one way or the other depending on the outcome of the election? Richard Davis : First of all, I think -- and I said this at our Investor Day. I think if we're a nine-inning game, we're probably in the eighth inning. We know most of the conditions. We know the condition on the field. We know the umpires. We know the fan attitude. We know the weather. We know the ball speed. There's not a lot here new. And there will be some adjustments to the election, but as you know, most of these positions are not tied directly to the election or directly to the President's term. They have different term timetables; and think the FDIC and the OCC to name two. So I think the philosophies and the general sense of what regulation looks like for banks is pretty well set. I think we understand most of those rules and what we're dealing with now is nuances, why certain speeches make so much attention, because we're trying to read tea leaves and figure out if they changed anything systemic. I don't think there's anything major to change. I also think a new President which is undoubtedly going to happen, has a slight variation one way or the other. I won't talk about which one I think does which, but one gets a little more uncertain and causes us to stand back a little bit and wait to see how things settle.  The other one is a lot more of the same and probably, whether we like it or not, is something we can manage because it's the devil we know. Either way, I don't see any circumstances where bank regulation gets easier or lightens. I don't see a significant place where it gets any tougher or gets a lot stronger. I do think there's going to be a need for us to particularly respond to this current issue on culture and doing the right thing and that makes sense to me and that's a place that we'll welcome that oversight. In fact, maybe to the earlier question, if banks are proven for the most part to be doing really the right things the right way, that might be a very positive catalyst for the American people. Because they now know that we're stronger; they know we're safer. They don't know that we intend to be good with that. And if we can prove that over the course of the next couple years, especially as the economy might get better at the same time, I think we're in a pretty good place. But for this bank, there's not a lot -- we don't spend a lot of energy trying to figure out what's going to happen next. We have relationship with regulators both local and national that we know and trust. And for us it's part of doing business and I think it's a normal course of running the bank. We don't fret about it and we don't try to predict anything. Nancy Bush : Well, on this issue of culture, how do you see that coming to the fore? Is that going to become a special -- does that get built into the DFAST? How do you see that happening? Richard Davis : Yes, that's a good question. That's too early to know. I do know and I believe it's known, that the OCC is conducting a horizontal review, first and foremost starting immediately on unauthorized new accounts. They are doing that horizontally. I don't know how far it's going but it's the first of -- look at more things like incentive practices and then will be, I think, eventually culture. We're thinking of it as culture and we always have from the very beginning. But I think, Nancy, that will find its way probably through more likely the OCC under the doctrine that they have as they oversee the banks. And then the Fed for the Fed banks will find their own way to approach it. I don't necessarily see it going into a CCAR stress test environment at this early stage. I see it being more of a pattern and practice for the CAMEL ratings and the overall valuation of management and board oversight. So for me I think it's just another nuance and we keep getting different things. It's a spotlight on a stage, right? Everything is on the stage, but you can only see the stuff the spotlight is on. It's just going to move across and now find something in the form of culture. I think we're all going to need to put better words around what we do. I think we're going to have to prove what we do. And I think we're going to have to show sustainability to good practices and that does require us to do a lot more record-keeping, a lot more auditing, a lot more quality assurance. I would say it's actually a pretty good thing, because most banks do it very, very well. And I think we're going to find out that that's an area of strength that we can showcase, that banks haven't been able to really put their finger on until now. Unfortunately, it takes a blemish to bring out the issues, but I think you'll be -- the American people will be quite pleased with what they find. Nancy Bush : Okay. One other regulatory issue, the fact that the EU seems to be backing away from Basel, do you think that will change anything? Does that make any difference? Do we not go to Basel IV? What do you think the impact of that is? Richard Davis : I don't predict that one as well, because I do think this one does matter a lot in who's in a position. I think Dan Tarullo's been our best guiding voice on this particular topic, both on what volatile means to the United States banks and what it means in relationship to the global circumstances. As long as he's in position I don't think it goes away and I think he continues to argue the position that America's banks need to be at the highest, best, strongest, position first and foremost -- but in an environment where all the banks have to account for the same general level of oversight. If Dan were to change positions, I think that will have a meaningful impact on whether or not the position of the domestic banks in relation to the international banks remains the same or not. But I think there's a general sense across the world that everyone wants all the banks to be stronger. They're looking for a governing doctrine. Basel seems to be the one that allows everybody to think most banks across the world have generally the same minimum oversight; and we're all getting there at different speeds. So I think it's probably still the best proxy and I don't think it changes greatly. I think the verbiage of a speech or a general sentiment that things aren't going to be adopted or things are going to be changed is just that, it's a small nuance. I think we're all going to stay within the confines of a general Basel oversight created out of the institutions across the country that have a voice and then America being probably the loudest. Operator : I will now turn the call back over for closing remarks. Jen Thompson : Thank you for listening to this review of our third quarter results. Please contact us if you have any follow-up questions. Richard Davis : Thanks, everybody. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Parker - Vice Chairman and Chief Risk Officer Analysts : John McDonald - Bernstein John Pancari - Evercore Elizabeth Graseck - Morgan Stanley Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill Partners Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks Ricky Dodds - Deutsche Bank Ken Usdin - Jefferies Erika Najarian - Bank of America Mike Mayo - CLSA Saul Martinez - UBS Kevin Barker - Piper Jaffray Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Peter Winter - Wedbush Securities Gerard Cassidy - RBC Operator : Welcome to U.S. Bancorp's Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Following a review of the results by Richard Davis, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Dolan, U.S. Bancorp's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon Eastern standard time through Wednesday January 25th, at 12 midnight Eastern standard Time. I will now turn the call over to Jen Thompson of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. Jen Thompson : Thank you, Melissa and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Andy Cecere, Terry Dolan and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's fourth quarter results and to answer your questions. Richard, Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at USBank.com. I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page 2 of today's presentation in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Richard. Richard Davis : Thank you, Jen. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. While the economy was challenging, and often unfavorable in 2016, it was a good year for U.S. Bank. As you can see on slide 3 of the presentation, we reported record net income of $5.9 billion and record earnings per diluted share of $3.24 for the full year. Our 2016 return on common equity was 13.4% and our efficiency ratio was an industry leading 54.9%. We reported strong loan growth and strong deposit growth and we returned 79% of earnings to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. I'm also pleased with our fourth quarter results which are highlighted on slide four. In the fourth quarter reported net income of $1.5 billion or $0.82 per diluted share. Healthy balance sheet growth supported 2.1% sequential growth in net interest income and strength in fee businesses such as payments and trust drove 3.9% noninterest income growth, compared with the year earlier. Credit quality remained stable in the fourth quarter. Turning to slide 5, our profitability metrics continue to be among the best in the industry. In the fourth quarter, our return on average common equity was 13.1% and our efficiency ratio was 55.3%. Terry will now provide more details about our fourth quarter results. Following Terry's remarks, Andy, whom we announced yesterday will assume the CEO role at the April shareholder meeting this year, while provide some insights about our opportunities for growth in the current environment. Terry? Terry Dolan : Thank you, Richard. I'll start with the balance sheet review and then discuss our fourth quarter earnings trends. Turning to slide 6, you can see our loan and deposit growth trends, average total loans outstanding grew 1.1% on a linked quarter basis and increased 6.2% compared with the fourth quarter of 2015 or 5.6% excluding a credit card portfolio acquisition at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015. In this years fourth quarter, the linked quarter growth and our increase in average loans was led by a rebound in growth in average total commercial loans of 1.6% and strong growth in several consumer categories. As expected and in line with industry trends, residential mortgage loan growth slowed in the fourth quarter, reflecting both seasonal factors and a slowdown in refinancing activity driven by higher rates. Also commercial real estate mortgages were essentially flat compared with the third quarter of '16, as customers paid down mortgages and evaluate the potential of policy changes and the outlook for rising rates. Total average deposits increased 11.8% compared with the fourth of 2015 and were up 3.3% on a linked quarter basis. The sequential growth was highlighted by a 3.5% linked quarter increase in non-interest-bearing deposits. Turning to slide 7. Credit quality remained relatively stable for the third quarter. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans were 47 basis points in the fourth quarter, up one basis point compared with the third quarter and flat with a year ago. A seasonal increase in our credit cards net charge-off ratio offset declines in commercial and commercial real estate net charge-offs. Nonperforming assets decreased by 3.7% compared with the third quarter. Improvement was driven by commercial loans, residential mortgages and other real estate. And while NPAs increased 5.3% versus the fourth quarter of 2015, NPAs as a percentage of loans, plus other real estate rose just one basis point to 59 basis points. We continue to add to the allowance for loan losses in the fourth quarter to support loan growth. I'll move to earnings results. Slide 8 provides highlights of fourth quarter results versus comparable periods. Fourth quarter net income of $1.5 billion was down 1.6% compared to the third quarter. The fourth quarter is seasonally lower from a fee revenue perspective each year and this year was no different. On slide 9, you can see that total revenue increased by approximately 1% in the fourth quarter, compared with the third quarter and grew 4.3% on a year-over-year basis. Our year-over-year revenue growth was primarily driven by solid loan growth, funded by strong deposit growth and strength across our fee businesses. Turning to slide 10, net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased by 2.1% compared with the linked quarter and was up 4.6% compared with the prior year. Linked quarter growth reflected 2.1% on average earning asset growth and a stable net interest margin. The benefit of higher rates to loan yields was offset by higher average cash balances and lower yields on security purchases and reinvestment rates on existing securities. Slide 11 highlights trends in noninterest income which declined by 0.6% versus the third quarter, reflecting typical seasonal patterns and a 24% decrease in mortgage banking revenue. The mortgage banking revenue decline was in line with our December guidance and reflects both seasonality and a drop in refinancing activity due to higher interest rates. On a year-over-year basis, noninterest income increased by 3.9% driven by strength in payment services revenue, trust and investment management fees and mortgage banking revenue. I'll highlight a couple of items within noninterest income, merchant processing revenue grew 5.6% on a year-over-year basis, adjusting for the impact of currency rate changes Trust and investment management fees increased 9.5% year-over-year, reflecting lower money market fee waivers, along with account growth, an increase in assets under management and improved market conditions. Given the recent increase in the short term rates the impact of fee waivers in 2017 will be minimal. Turning to slide 12, noninterest expense increased 2.5% compared with the third quarter, in line with our expectation. On a year-over-year basis, noninterest expense increased 6.9%. The primary drivers for the increase on both a quarterly and year-over-year basis were higher compensation expense, professional services expenses and other noninterest expense. Compensation expense reflects hiring for business growth and compliance programs, including addressing the AML Consent Order and DOL implementation. We believe the trajectory of cost for these programs is stabilizing. As a reminder, professional fees and other expense are seasonally higher in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter other noninterest expense was driven by higher costs related to investments and tax advantage projects which abates somewhat in the first quarter of 2017. I'll finish with a look at our capital position. Turning to slide 13, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as if fully implemented at December 31 was 9.1% which is well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement and our internal target of 8.5%. Our tangible book value per share was $18.70 at December 31st, up 7.2% from a year ago. In the fourth quarter we returned 81% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. We expect to remain in our targeted payout ratio of 60% to 80% going forward. I will now turn the call over to Andy. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Terry. I'd like to provide some insights into our thoughts on how we are positioned for growth in the current environment. For the full year 2016, average loans increased by 6.9% and we think are the full year 2017, a 6% to 8% growth rate is very achievable. We expect the pace of growth is likely to be more weighted towards the later part of the year as customers become more comfortable with the economic future post-inauguration. In the first quarter, we expected loan growth to be similar to the linked quarter growth experienced in the fourth quarter of 2016, as customers consider the implications of potential policy decisions and tax decisions of the new administration. We also expect relatively flat growth in residential and commercial mortgage loans as seasonally slower growth and credit card balances. Coming out of the first quarter, we are optimistic that an improving economy will spur more consumer activity, which will help both our payments businesses and our consumer lending businesses and improved economic backdrop should also result in increased business spending on development and capital investments, and we are well positioned to capture our fair share of that lending and fee activity. Given the improving interest rate environment, including the current shape of the yield curve, we expect that the net interest margin or the NIM will expand modestly in the first quarter. We look for mortgage revenue to decrease 10% to 15% in first quarter, in line with an expectation for lower refinancing activity, reflecting both seasonal trends and the impact of higher market rates. We expect expenses to decline slightly on a linked quarter basis, primarily driven by seasonally lower professional fees and a decline in tax credit amortization expense, resulting in a relatively stable efficiency ratio. Finally, given the underlying mix and quality of the overall portfolio, we expect credit quality to remain relatively stable. I'll now turn the call back to Richard. Richard Davis : Thanks, Andy. And I'm proud of our record fourth quarter and our full year 2016 results. We've maintained our industry-leading performance measures and reported a 17.7% return on tangible common equity in the quarter, and an 18% return for the full year. That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Terry, and Bill Parker and I would now be happy to answer any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from John McDonald with Bernstein. John McDonald : Good morning. Good morning, Richard and Andy. Congratulations to both of you on yesterday's announcement. I was just wondering\u2026 Richard Davis : Thank you. John McDonald : Just wondering, Richard, if you have any additional color to share on what drove the timing of the decision to do the transition now. Obviously it has been well-planned but just what drove the exact timing? And then also what exactly will be entailed in the role of Executive Chairman for you going forward? Richard Davis : Thanks, John. I know you all be disappointed, you can't kick me around anymore, that\u2019s the number one goal. First of all, this was very well telegraphed and I want to thank you for setting it up that way. You know, I hit my 10 year anniversary as the CEO of the bank last month and many years before that I conferred with the board and our senior leaders and told them that I had a couple of thoughts that attended to that notion, that at 10 years I think it's the right time for a transition. I think that's for any company of any type and it seem that we are about three years away. Second point, John was that our success was sitting right here. Andy, was clearly becoming the perfect person to lead the company based on his talents and his skills. I had worked with him seven years as a partner at that point and I want to make sure that as a board, and as a CEO we telegraphed him, first of all, that he was a candidate and it was up to them to make that final decision and that the candidacy wouldn\u2019t come eight years from now you know, when I am 65 and hi is 62, and it seemed appropriate that we lockdown that succession as soon as we could and that we started that process privately back then. And then equally important to me, but it's just a personal thing for me, I want to do something else in my life that\u2019s entirely different. I call it a calling, if you will, I don't exactly know how to explain it. And I know it's a little odd to have a 58-year-old healthy CEO leaving and to go nowhere. But that's really what it is because I'm not leaving this company, I'm handing it over to a great management team, and a great leader and I'm looking forward to being successfully part of it the future as an advocate and a exclusive partner in this part of the banking environment. So I'm really going off to do something uniquely different and I'll see what comes about in the next few months. As you know I'll be the CEO for another 90 days until April 18th and I'll be full in on that job until which time our shareholder meeting in Nashville will hand over the reins. I'll then step up to be the Executive Chair. And what that means, John is really what I am now. So I think of it this way, I had three titles two years ago, I gave Andy one of them last year, I'm giving him another one in April and I am keeping the last one because I am selfish. I am going to chairman for a while until the transition is ensconced and complete in both the Board and the Street, you guys are comfortable that we've made that transition and its my hope that there is a lot of continuity and sustainability of what we did and yet I also hope Andy feels the permissions to do what he needs to do and make adjustments into the future. So as a Executive Chair we're not telegraphing that we're separating the titles of Chairman, CEO permanently or just doing it because we would do that in any succession. We think that's one of the best practices. And then in the future whenever I move away and the Board has a decision either merge the two titles again or not and that\u2019s the decision we don't have to know or telegraphed now because we don't have that decision afoot. So hopefully that\u2019s clear and I'll be working with the lead director as a partner and that's what happens when you have an executive chair and a lead director, we'll work together with Andy to guide the board and to give him guidance to manage the company. John McDonald : Okay, great, that is super helpful. Thank you, Richard. And just a follow-up then on expenses. When you think about the year, it seemed like 2016 for U.S. Bank was a year of kind of digesting maybe an above average expense drag. You mentioned a few things like DOL, consent order, it seemed like there were some compliance costs, maybe some stepped up investments. Just wondering as you look at the operating leverage dynamics for 2017, does it get better from both ends with higher rates helping revenues and maybe easier comps on expenses? Could you flesh that out a little bit? Richard Davis : Yes, I will and then I'll give to Andy to color. The answers is yes, you are right, I work from both ends. Look, I'm more disappointed than anybody that we hit that 55% efficiency ever. It\u2019s a reality, its something that we needed to do. A big part of that is the AML Consent Order and you know I think most banks are probably dealing with some form public or private of the consent on the issue for AML and so a remarkably expensive process. I mean, remarkably, and we underestimated that, but we're able to handle it as we go forward. As Terry said that\u2019s stabilizing now only to mean that it's peaked, but also mean, we don't know when it starts to come back down, but it will definitely come back down because it's got and end point, its a consent order. I will say that that's a fair amount of the number that's moved us from what might have been 53 or 54 to the 55 and we'll see that come down. DOL is also a time vested event that will come and go by middle of this year and we said before we're investing heavily into it. We've got a great partner. We believe we've got the right solution and no matter what happens in Washington, we would do this anyways. So it's not bound by any kind of regulation or changes that might occur. So those are two big enough issues that have taken our efficiency ratio, our expenses up a little higher than we like, but we think that they sustain and they start moving down. And then you know as well as anybody, the fact that the interest rates are starting to move and that the curve is steepened, while that\u2019s the other benefit. And so on both ends let's call this and probably this quarter which should be pretty flat on efficiency, probably the high water mark and then we'll get back to places you expect us to be. The other thing that\u2019s sitting underneath those numbers is this remarkable cost of innovation and technology and we can talk about it until you guys stop listening, but it will only show itself in the future when you'll see which companies really made those investments and we're ready to jump to a new kind of real-time payments, mobile environment and those that didn't, we are one that is. And so are capital expenditures are right now and again this year, probably twice what they were many years ago, and probably half again what they need to be in the future years, but we're spending that kind of money to get this thing ready for this environment, its going to change pretty quickly. That is also a time bound issue where that CapEx starts to come down, probably this will be another peak year and then we'll start moving down. So everything moves back to getting into the low 50s without a lot of work, but with time passing. Andy, do you want to\u2026 Andy Cecere : And I'd Richard. So as you said we expect two rate increases in '17 mid year and in December, given that and the expectation for the stronger economy, plus the brand and innovation investments we made. We expect accelerated revenue growth in 2017 and positive operating leverage. John McDonald : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from John Pancari with Evercore. Richard Davis : Morning, John. John Pancari : Morning. I just want to get a little bit more color on what you are seeing in terms of loan demand and borrower appetite post the election. And where are you seeing strengthening? Is it in certain markets like in some of the borrower appetite in the Midwest given some of the manufacturing implications or is it some of your other markets? Thanks. Andy Cecere : John, I'll start and then I'll hand it to Bill for a little bit more detail. So first I will tell you that there's more optimism and positive commentary for a lot of our business customers. But we haven't seen a significant change in utilization or actually take down of credit yet. So while the talk is there, the actual action is not yet shown itself. We do see a steady growth in middle market, small business, and a higher corporate loan growth, and auto is strong as is the mortgage activity. But again, because re-financings are down we will expect that to diminish. But again, the key point I would make is, we're not seeing huge changes. In fact, it's relatively flat in terms of the overall utilization rate and then there are couple of areas that we're choosing not to be as active in, and I am going to let Bill comment on that. P.W. Parker: Yes, what is Andy is referring there is commercial real estate, we do see some of those markets as being sort of late stage credit cycle. If you look back, we had fairly robust growth in our construction, real estate construction book and that's slowing now, its even slowing with you know our client base, they are being more cautious. Multifamily is an area that if you look at the forecast, there are forecast, its pretty broad-based of potential rent declines in a lot of the major cities. So we're been more cautious there and then on commercial mortgages soft of the term portion we've been fairly flat to down in that area and there is very aggressive competition for long-terms, fixed rate, limited covenants, to no covenants, non-recourse and that\u2019s just not a market that we play in. So that's one area where we're just to going to see lower growth based on what the business we do. Richard Davis : You know, John, this is Richard. We've been here before 10 years ago when we started to see the bifurcation of loan growth by different appetites, by different banks and it always sounds a bit like a hollow victory to say, we're just not to be as aggressive, we're not going to fight on terms, we're not going to fight on tenor, we're not going to do certain kinds of kinds of loans and it might sound a little bit of an excuse, but it's really part of the strategy and it\u2019s the thing we're going to stick with, we're not changing that approach. I'll give you an example, commercial real estate $43 billion portfolio, $17 billion of it is in small communities, because remember we're really kind of a community bank at heart and there's a lot of smaller banks that are doing some things that you guys aren\u2019t even writing about because you don't follow the small banks, but we're in the middle of that and we're not going to play. And while it be easier to give you guys some loan growth in certain areas, it won't be on terms or tenor or stretching or underwriting on any category. It will be on price because we've got that cost advantage, we're going to use that advantage where can. But when you do price you do it only for AAA kind of customers and then you have the higher quality customers who by the way in this last quarter also had access to the capital markets more than other customers and you'll see our capital markets, these are much higher than they were expected, while loan growth might have been on the low end of our range, its probably a good outcome because it reflects quality of our customers. So we're going to stick to that and that\u2019s kind of thing you won't see change. And while we might take a little heat because I know loan growth is a good proxy for a healthy bank, its got to be at the right quality, the right terms and we're just going to stick to our guns. John Pancari : Okay, that is helpful. And then on that competitive point, I just want to get an update from you on a comment you made at a conference this past quarter around how much of the tax benefit could ultimately accrete to the bottom line. I think you had indicated that about 50% to 60% of any benefit that you do see from corporate tax reform could accrete to EPS. Is that still your thinking? Do you have any update there and any additional color you can get us on how do you come up with that general [ph] range? Thanks. Terry Dolan : Sure, John. And this is Terry. So I mean, obviously there are still a lot that has to happen with respect tax policy both in terms of the amount of the rate and you know what ends up continuing to be deductible and all sorts of things. But when you think about the tax credit business, the tax credits will still be worth a hundred percent all the rest of that stuff. But you know the area that we would you know see an impact, I think is really related to the tax benefit that you get on the investment that you make in those assets. So basically the tax benefit on the shield. But to keep it simple, if we saw a tax \u2013 a corporate tax rate decline of 10%, we would expect our effective tax rate to benefit or go down by about half of that or about 60% of that. So think about five percentage points to 6 percentage points in that range, that's essentially what we would expect to see the change in our effective tax rate and its because of the various dynamics associated with how tax credits work. John Pancari : Okay, so that is not any -- that doesn't factor in anything competitively like the expectation that some of this benefit could get competed away? Terry Dolan : No, I know what you are talking about and we don\u2019t see that, that\u2019s not - I'm not predicting that that\u2019s going to be given back by the banking industry as a form of competition. This is just a singular event that could happen. By the way, I am going to a tax benefits unless you guys know something I don't, it\u2019s really has to go with the budget process. So this is probably more a late '17, '18 issue, much as we all want to be immediate. And I think that's one of the reasons customers were also a customer of others are holding back on some final decision. So we see what and when things happen in taxes is one of them. But we're quite efficient now, we're proud of where we are, so I don\u2019t want to be punished for having been more tax efficient than others, but it also means is a little less benefit if the most aggressive tax benefits accrue, we've get a little bit less of it, but its still a benefit of its starting point. John Pancari : Got it. All right. Thanks again, and Richard and Andy congrats. Richard Davis : Thanks, John. Andy Cecere : Thank you, John. Operator : Your next question is from Elizabeth Graseck, Morgan Stanley. Richard Davis : Morning. Elizabeth Graseck : Hi. Hi, good morning. Thanks so much. Couple of questions. Just one as a follow-up on the compete away question that has been coming up on a bunch of calls. The corporates that you work with, the larger they get the more I think they are aware of how much wallet share and what the value is that they are providing to you. So I guess the question is why do you think that it won't get competed away given that it tends to be a pretty dynamic process in those discussions? Richard Davis : I'll go first and then Andy can jump on. They do know their wallet share. By the same token part of it is by design because they've learned over the years they want to be double or triple down with one partner, right. So first of all, they have \u2013 and need to have more than one partner in and above just from competition and rate. Second thing is, if you look at the way the industry is handling the rate increases that relates to the liability side of the balance sheet, right, we're a little smarter this time and we're not giving it all the way immediately and we're not \u2013 we're not colluding either because we never talk. But we're also being very careful and thoughtful about protecting what needs to be a wider range between the cost of liability and the cost of asset and if that behavior continues, I think the same action comes with taxes where we'll find it, we do it in pricing and yet the world still reasonable and aligned. And I think with taxes its going to be the same thing, we're all going to want to do our very best to protect what benefits our companies and help our customers do well, but company is one we're like to bank that and find it another forms, particularly in credit quality and in cost of funds. So I am saying others won't try it, but we also never really been competing on that level. If somebody wants to compete on price, bring it on because we can beat him every day for the highest quality customers. Andy Cecere : And to that point Richard, you know we already have the advantage of best rated bank which gives us a plenty of an advantage, which will already advantage in terms of getting new business and or achieving higher return. So that's the other component to it. Elizabeth Graseck : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Maybe I could also ask a separate question on the NIM outlook. I think, Andy, you mentioned expand modestly in -- was it 1Q '17 or 2017? But just wanted to tie that in with the commentary on this deck where you talked about how the reinvestment rate on securities was lower. Just wondering if that\u2019s the angle with which a higher reinvestment rate on securities is going to drive that expand modestly. Maybe you could help me understand if that is the case and how much expand means when you say expand modestly? Andy Cecere : So Betsy I'll start then hand it over to Terry. On the expand modestly it was a comment specific to the first quarter, it related to both the increase in LIBOR and the short term end of the curve as well, as long-term end of the curve and its principally around loan pricing and deposit pricing. The investment security portfolio, sort of stabilization occurs little about mid-year and then that would be beneficial towards the end of the year. And Terry anything you'd add to that? Terry Dolan : Yes. When we talk about reinvestment rates as Andy said, when we get to the end of the first quarter, into the second quarter, you know, we start to see that inflection point, so that will help the margin. And you know we - as Andy said earlier, you know we plan for a rate hike, December of last year, June and then December. And so you know we think about the margin first quarter it will expand modestly and then it will probably accelerate a bit from there. Elizabeth Graseck : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then last question -- on the impact of the stronger dollar on your merchant processing business and elsewhere if it is material, but I think it is mostly there. Terry Dolan : Yes, it is mostly there. So our stated revenue growth Betsy was 2.8% year-over-year and excluding the FX impact it was about 5.6%. So everyone 1% or whatever the currency is about a $1 million a year. Elizabeth Graseck : Thank you. Richard Davis : Thanks, Betsy. Operator : Your next question is from Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill Partners. Richard Davis : Hi, Scott. Scott Siefers : Morning, guys. First, Richard and Andy, congratulations to both of you, well-deserved\u2026 Richard Davis : Thank you. Andy Cecere : Thank you. Scott Siefers : I guess first question on the expenses, I appreciate the commentary for the full year on operating leverage and expenses. Just hoping you guys might be able to put sort of a finer point on the slight drop in costs you expect in the first quarter. I guess as I look back over the last few years the magnitude of drop into 1Q, it used to be much more significant I would say but it has gotten lesser as we have gotten more recent. Just curious if you can maybe give us a sense for order of magnitude of what you would expect that drop to be. Terry Dolan : Yes. So this is Terry. So when we end up looking at the first quarter you know, we would expect that drop to be about in the percentage point kind of range. But you know, the drivers behind that is that professional services fees are always seasonally high in the fourth quarter and included in that are compliance costs related at DOL and other things, which will start to abate in the second, third quarter. So some of those compliance cost, specifically related to DOLs start to go away. And then of course the tax credit amortization that we have in the fourth-quarter is always seasonally high in the fourth quarter and it comes back down to normal and remember last quarter we gave some guidance around how much that might go up, I think it was about $60 million and that will all go away, but you know - probably about 60% of that will abate in the first quarter. So those are the biggest drivers in terms of why we see expenses going down. Scott Siefers : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then maybe switching gears to the fee side. Terry, can you give a sense for what the dollar level of the equity investment income was in the fourth quarter? And I guess just to the extent possible, I know that is a volatile line, but your sense for what a typical level might be going forward? Terry Dolan : Yes, in terms of equity investments, when we think about fourth quarter, you know, its probably I am going to say $20 million to $30 million higher than what we had seen in the third quarter, fourth quarter is probably more of what I would say normalized sort of level. So when you think about equity investments on a go forward basis its probably going to be comparable to the fourth quarter when we think about the first quarter. Scott Siefers : Okay. All right. That\u2019s good color. Thank you guys very much. Terry Dolan : Thanks so much Scott. Operator : Your next question is from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Richard Davis : Hey, Marty. Marty Mosby : Hey. Congratulations on the shift and the evolution of the management team there. Richard Davis : Thank you. Marty Mosby : And Richard, what I wanted to ask you was as you take on the role solely of Chairman of the Board and working with your lead director, will you still take on most of those responsibilities? Because that is a large share of what you do when you have CEO and Chairman is you have a lot of activities just working with the Board, making sure that that process is going. So that relieves a lot of burden from what Andy would have to do initially as he takes his new responsibilities. Richard Davis : Marty, you nailed it, that\u2019s exactly why the transition is we think best practice because it affords me chance to work with the board and make sure that Andy is got the time and energy to work with the management team and to work on the issues. I will not be in the day-to-day management of the company because that's also a best practices to stay out of running the company, but to help him with the board side of it. And I'll be an ambassador of company, I'll do whatever he needs me to do, I can go places for him if he needs me to. I am not going to go on TV a lot, I am not going to talk about as the ex-U.S. Bank CEO, I am not going to do that because the voice has to be his and the current management team. But you got it right and when the transition is satisfactorily complete and the board and I and Andy feel that we made successful transition then will move it to the next step and they can decide where the chairman position lies, but it will give Andy the time to get focused on all the right things to run the whole company. Marty Mosby : And then Andy and Terry, when you are -- one of the things in the release that has been consistent across all of the bank so far, which is to me the biggest surprise, is that deposit growth is continuing not just to be relatively strong but in your case was actually picking up as we have kind of gone into rates starting to move up a little bit. And we would think some re-risking would be deploying some of this liquidity back into the system. I'm just trying to figure out where all that deposit growth is coming from, because, like you said, your deposit betas are going to be tied to what is happening on your deposits. And right now it is continuing to grow which gives you a lot of flexibility on pricing. Andy Cecere : So Mary, I'll start and Terry will add on. So I am going to say three areas of focus, why we're growing deposits. First of all in the wholesale side and as continuation of us taking market share and along with that market share is new customers who have deposits. Secondly is our corporate trust business. Corporate trust is a great business. It's very high return, great fee business, but importantly it also generates a tremendous level of deposit activity and we're growing that business both domestically, as well as in Europe and that's very helpful. And thirdly is the retail core basis. As we continue to take market share and this is one of the things we talked about being very prudent around branches. While its true that we consolidated 40 or 50 branches in the last couple years. We've done that very thoughtfully in a manner that says we don't want to lose face. We want to optimize the footprint. But we don't want to lose customers or deposits and I think the deposit growth you're seeing is because of that manner of closure or consolidation which is very thoughtful. Terry, what else would you add? Terry Dolan : Yes, I would add maybe just two different things. One is that you know as corporates kind of waiting to see what happens from a policy perspective as they have cash and they are waiting to figure out how to deploy that, they are probably parking it a little bit. And then as we talked about in the third quarter [with money market reform, there was a fairly strong inflow of deposits in the third quarter, I am not sure all that has abated yet, as people kind of figure out what they are going to do from a money market standpoint in terms of government funds or whatever. So those are the other two things I would just add. Marty Mosby : Thanks. Terry Dolan : Thanks, Marty. Richard Davis : Thanks, Marty. Operator Your next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Richard Davis : Hi, Matt. Ricky Dodds : Hi, guys, it is Ricky Dodds from Matt's team. Richard Davis : Hey, Ricky. Ricky Dodds : Just a quick question on - the goal is positive operating leverage. And if we don't see those two hikes that you guys have kind of built into your forecast is the goal of positive operating leverage still achievable? Andy Cecere : It\u2019s more challenging. This is Andy. It\u2019s more challenging and we've always had great balance around making sure we're investing for the future and recognizing our short-term objectives. And we believe firmly we can get there with the two rate increases that I mentioned it will be more difficult, we'll have to continue to measure that balance of short term versus long-term, but it would more difficult. Richard Davis : And Ricky, they are not equal because if we get the June one, another December, we're there. We get the December and not the June much harder. So - and I know there is a lot of work out [ph] that have a June, September, December, we're just using June, December projections right now. Ricky Dodds : Got it. And then maybe an unrelated follow up on deposit betas. Obviously not a huge impact with the first hike. But as you think about more hikes what's your thinking there both on the commercial and consumer side? Richard Davis : Yes, so I mean, and that\u2019s good way looking at in terms of commercial and consumer. So you in terms of the December rate hike and kind of what we're seeing right now its very similar to what we experienced a year ago in terms of the deposit beta. So kind of in the middle teens to upper teens is kind of in that ballpark. When we model it out, especially on a longer-term basis and so as we see rate hikes and if would see a June rate hike or December rate hike or maybe even the September rate hike, that will start to normalize. We typically model it in the 40% to 50% range in terms of deposit betas and then also from a modeling perspective, you know we assume that there is going to be some deposit disintermediation that would take place during that time because of economic growth. So that \u2013 that probably that kind of gives you some perspective and the price it will be more sensitive with respect to the wholesale deposits, our corporate trust deposits and it will on the retail side. Ricky Dodds : Perfect. Thanks, guys. Richard Davis : Thanks, Ricky. Operator? Operator : Your next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Richard Davis : Hi, Ken. Ken Usdin : Thanks, good morning, guys, and also congratulations to both of you. Can we talk a little bit about fees, understanding that the NII side looks to have a pretty good path to growth based on your loan and NIM comments? Can you talk us through what you think would be the lead driving forces on the fee side especially given that it looks like mortgage might be a more difficult comparison looking ahead? Andy Cecere : Yes, I'll start. This is Andy. The fees as you said, three component side highlight, number one is mortgage down 10% to 15%, number two payments. So our payments revenue this quarter on a year-over-year basis, up 4%, but actually about 5.5% excluding FX 5.3%, and we actually saw good growth in all three categories, the merchant acquiring, the card issuing, as well as corporate. So we would expect to see that to continue to grow, particularly as we see increased spend, both from a personal standpoint, as well as from a business standpoint. So that\u2019s a second category. And then final category I mentioned is our trust and investment fees, that is going to be partially leverage to a growing economy and continuing together investment activity in our private client, as well as our retail base overall. So those three categories, I think those two categories offset that mortgage category that we'll see growth in fees. Richard Davis : This is Richard, Ken. Why don't you also give a little color, because that will also come up later, that from the payment side we don't chase volume for revenue and just like we don't chase loans for quality. Andy Cecere : Right. I should mention, so and Elavon is the best example of that. So I mentioned that our core growth stated is about 2.8% and excluding FX it\u2019s about 5.6%. But what you see on volumes is actually decline in volumes and that\u2019s because we intentionally exited some very low margin large customers who were not profitable, and we did that intentionally, you'll see that impacting volumes, but you did not seeing impacting revenues and I think that is a great example we're trying to do this in a smart way. Ken Usdin : And that was actually going to be my follow-up. So it looked like the credit and debit card comped a little bit harder year-over-year, whereas corporate and merchant, to your last point, started to look better. Are we near the point where you think that we can get all three of the individual lines of payments moving the right way on a revenue growth perspective? And if not what is still holding that back? Andy Cecere : Yes. And let me add, so Elavon as I mentioned strong growth on the revenue, same store sales up just under 4% driven by airline and fuel and that drove that 5.6 ex-FX revenue growth. Corporate card is two stories, number one is on the business side of the equation. We continue to see strong middle market, virtual pay, commercial freight payment growth and that\u2019s positive. But that was offset somewhat by government spending down a bit, sometimes that happens in the fourth quarter, we saw that occur this time. I think that will come back or flatten now, but that's what drove some of the lower growth activities you saw on corporate. And then finally on the card side, of the issuing side, our growth in fees was about 7.5% less than that excluding Fidelity, but it was also impacted by one last processing day in the fourth quarter which impacted growth about 1% or 1.5%. So those three things are what's driving it overall and as I said, I think all these categories we would expect to grow in 2017. Ken Usdin : Thanks a lot, guys. And best of luck. Congrats. Richard Davis : Thanks, Ken. Operator : Your next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Richard Davis : Morning. Erika Najarian : Good morning. Congratulations, Richard and Andy. Richard Davis : Thank you. Andy Cecere : Thank you. Erika Najarian : Richard, we will sure miss you, but we are looking forward to having Andy at the top. So my first question, you mentioned in the prepared remarks that the trajectory of regulatory-related costs are stabilizing. And you mentioned how expensive the AML consent order was and DOL compliance. I am wondering if you know, the stabilization seems like the natural trajectory of regulatory-related cost. But if we get some regulatory relief from the new administration is there an opportunity for reg costs to actually go down for U.S. Bank? Richard Davis : The answer is yes. I wouldn\u2019t be this year and I'll say I'm going to be prognosticator here. But based on what I understand, the administration that's going to take office in a few days. The number one issues are health care reform, taxes and infrastructure and somewhere in the top five might be financial services, but it\u2019s not the top three, a lot of financial services issues I think will be dealt with in the early part of the year but with some implications later. So that\u2019s why I said earlier on DOL for instance, as we never made a bet on whether something would happen that would cause us to need to slow down because we want to be ready. We would do it anyway. So I think Erika the best thinking is that the understanding of what implications and lower regulation might happen will be known probably in the second half of the year and benefited in sometime in '18, but I'll also tell you but for things like an unusual consent order or an event like DOL transition, I think this bank has peaked on those costs. Our compliance costs in the entire company are now in terms of FTE, they are over 7000 people of our 70,000 and that\u2019s up more than twice what it was a few years ago. That\u2019s a little high because of these issues I just mentioned, but it's not going to go back to where it was, it\u2019s going to stay much higher because that\u2019s the cost of running a high-quality bank. We don't have issues other, but the AML issuance which has causes that kind of extra expense and so it\u2019s expecting that nothing else comes along. We will see that come down and whatever regulatory reform relief we do see. But most of it, I've got to say its going to be on the margin because most of the stuff is burdened in, its under run rate, it turns out a lot of its good operating policy and good compliance review tactics for double and triple checking and we're not going to give up a lot of that. So at least for this bank it\u2019s got a positive leaning toward improvement, its late in the year, if not next year and it\u2019s not going to be significant, but it will be part of it. Erika Najarian : Great. My second question is for Andy. I mean it is pretty clear in terms of the 60% to 80% capital return that you target every year. I am wondering, given the stock is trading close to 3 times tangible book if you think about future CCARs, whether you will maybe prioritize the dividend heavier as you think about dividend growth going forward and maybe normalizing to pre-crisis payout ratios. And also how you are thinking about acquisitions, especially depository acquisitions, in terms of your capital strategy going forward? Andy Cecere : So Erika, as you know our capital strategy is 30 to 40 and dividends, 30 to 40 on buybacks. We're at the high end on buybacks and at the low end on dividends right now I would think about as moving more to our balance perspective on that as we move forward and as we continue to look at the future years in CCAR. With regard to acquisitions, with the consent order in place right now we're precluded from traditional depository acquisitions. But we are doing things like you saw in the last year with Fidelity and IAG card portfolio acquisitions, we can do merchant acquiring to acquisitions and on trusted payments businesses. So that does not preclude us and that\u2019s actually area of focus. So I think that will be our focus in the short-term, once we're out of the consent order we may look at traditional depository, but that's not on focus right now. Erika Najarian : Great. Thank you. Andy Cecere : Sure. Richard Davis : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA. Richard Davis : Hi, Mike. Mike, are you there? Operator : And you maybe on mute on your end Mike. Mike Mayo : Okay. Richard, the first question is why are you stepping down? I guess I am - I mean I am a little confused. I mean you are running a bank with best-in-class performance measures. You have been there 10 years, you are 58, I guess almost 59 and you had many other banks - have sometimes run banks with worst-in-class performance measures, have been there over a decade and they are a lot older. So what's going on? And also what does it mean when it says you will help move the Bank to new areas of business? Richard Davis : So Mike, I don't if heard at the opening of the call, because I answer that question for John McDonald. That basically the reasons are, I said in place three years ago that at the 10 year mark, assuming nothing else that changed, that would be appropriate for a change in leadership because I just feel that way. It\u2019s my personal opinion. I indicated that Andy is the perfect candidate, he is sitting right here next to me, lets give him the signal, lets give him the time table and lets keep them. And thirdly, I do have another calling in life to do something entirely different, which I don't know what it is because I never felt permitted to look until the amount was passed and today will be my first day look into the future, along with my wife, but a very strong view that we want one more thing in life to accomplish and its going to be entirely outside the banking industry. So that\u2019s the reason and the rumors of my bad health or early demise are greatly exaggerated, I feel quite good today. And so that\u2019s timing for that and I don't know why some people stay longer. I don't know what the issues are in other companies. But mine was not the time it, mine was not to set this moment in time based on how the company is doing. It was three years ago to set a timetable that if at the 10 year [ph] market seems right and it now does, we've got everything lined up and the perfect guy to do it. And so that's exactly what it was and the board of course has all those decisions, I can't make any decision I want to on my own without their complete endorsement and they are very careful due diligence, which they did all of and they are quite excited about this transition as well. Mike Mayo : And then as far as Andy, is this business as usual? Are you going to have some tweaks or strategic changes? Or what degree of change might you implement especially with Richard still as Chairman? Richard Davis : Hanging around. Andy Cecere : So like Richard and I've been together - Richard. I've been together for 10 years and the strategies and the decisions that we have made and the position the bank is a combination of all of us, the management committee and the two of us. So I don't expect major changes. We are continuing to focus on one bank from the perspective of the customer, the technology and innovation will continue to be an area of focus as it has been as things move digitally. And you know I would maintain that we are the best bank right now and I'm certain that we have one of the best management teams out there. So I couldn\u2019t be more honored and pleased to take this on. Mike Mayo : All right, well, thank you. Richard Davis : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Your next question is from Saul Martinez with UBS. Richard Davis : Hi, Saul. Saul Martinez : Hi, good morning. Hi, good morning and congratulations on the roles. I wanted to ask you about the longer term guidance you had - you outlined at your Investor Day. And I think you guys have addressed it I guess in a directional fashion thus far, but sort of a broader question. You guys gave pretty expensive guidance on revenues, expenses, through the cycle provisions, business line growth. And obviously the backdrop has changed, we are kind of at an inflection in terms of - potential inflection in terms of the economic backdrop, regulatory backdrop and whatnot. But how are you guys thinking about the longer term guidance that you outlined today versus mid-September when you had your Investor Day? And where are you feeling more comfortable; where are you feeling less comfortable? If you could just kind of give us a directional sense of that. Richard Davis : So Saul, as you know that guidance was based on a three-year view and that was a three year view of what we would call sort of a more normal rate and economic environment. I think as we sit today we're probably more comfortable about getting there in the three year window that we talked about, certainly from a rate perspective, and what we predicted as far as occurring, the economy seems to be at least steadier and slightly improving. And so I would say we continue to feel good about those projections and our expectations are still to get there in that three year window. Saul Martinez : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I guess more of a specific follow-up. I think last quarter you talked about utilization rates on commercial lines being around 25%, 26%. Any change there? Are you seeing any of the optimism from companies starting to filter through in terms of borrowing the pipeline for credit and whatnot? Richard Davis : Saul, while the talk and optimism and discussion is more positive, the utilization rates are flat, still a 25% as they have been for the past few quarters. Saul Martinez : Okay. All right, thanks a lot. Richard Davis : Thanks, Saul. Operator : Your next question is from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Richard Davis : Morning, Kevin. Kevin Barker : Good morning. Congratulations on the new roles for both of you. Richard Davis : Thanks. Kevin Barker : I just wanted to follow up regarding some of your comments around the tax rates moving down to 5% to 6% effective tax rate. And obviously your reinvestment of some of those tax credits. Obviously it is very early in this discussion, we still have a ways to go before we figure it all out. Were there any specific line items around possibly low income housing tax credits or BOLI that you expect to go away? And at what level do you expect to have to reinvest those assets? Richard Davis : Yes. So let me add, take a stab and I think your question was really around tax policy and tax credit sort of investments and then where we might see either changes in the nature or type of investment. So you know, we invest in really kind of four different areas. Affordable housing is a very significant part of it, new market or economic developments sort of tax credits is a second, a little bit of historical tax credit, but then also renewable energy. You know, when we end up talking to people that are kind of plugged into the tax credit kind of market, we don't see a lot of change coming with respect to affordable housing because of all the policy implications associated with that, or any economic development because when you think about what the administration is trying to do, they are trying to stimulate economic development. So we don\u2019t see a lot of change to that, probably where that change is going to occur will be with respect to renewable energy type of credits and you know to be quite frank the law had already incorporated a phase out of those over the next four or five years anyway. So we didn\u2019t really anticipate a lot of impact to us with respect to where we were going to invest and you know what the implications associated were going to be. Kevin Barker : So when you say the 5% to 6% decline in the effective tax rate on a 10% decline in the actual rate with some reinvestment tax credit, depending on how that all plays out. If you were to see a 10% decline in effective tax rate would you believe that the decline in earnings would be close to 30% or 40% or do you expect - 30% to 40% of the 10% or something closer to 10% or 20% of the 10%? Richard Davis : I mean, its in fact, I have implemented it isn\u2019t a decline in earnings, its actually an improvement in earnings because of the fact that we're paying less in tax expense as opposed to more. So in my example, our effective tax rate would go from 20%, 29%, down from there and that actually would be a positive from a probability standpoint. Kevin Barker : Yes, what I mean is so with the tax credits, and what I am saying is if you had a 10% decline would it be a 5% to 6% improvement in earnings or would it be more of a 7% to 8% improvement in earnings? Richard Davis : It would be - again, this is all the simple math, and et cetera, in terms of how I'm portraying it right now. But it would be a 5% improvement in our effective tax rate. So you'd have to kind of do the math from there, but its not a 5% improvement in earnings or anything like that. It's a 5% reduction in our effective tax rate. Kevin Barker : Okay. Richard Davis : Using the 10% example. Kevin Barker : Okay. Thank you. Richard Davis : Thanks, Kevin. Operator? Operator : Your next question is from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Richard Davis : Hi, Vivek. Vivek Juneja : Hi, Richard. Hi, Andy. Congratulations again. Let me add that. A couple of quick questions. Just one just for Terry, just want to confirm that when you said percentage drop in expenses in the first quarter that I heard it correct, that you are referring to 1% drop in expenses, Terry? Terry Dolan : Yes, we would expect on a linked quarter basis, it would decline about the 1% range. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Okay. Then the other line item that you said, I can't remember whether it was you, Andy. You said equity investment gains should run at the fourth-quarter level. What is the level of equity investment gains and also what is the amount of equity investments? And is that increasing because you have increased investments? Can you talk a little -- can you give us some color on this three items there? Andy Cecere : Yes. You know, other income represents a whole variety of different things that includes trading income and includes end of term and retail product revenue. It includes equity investments. It\u2019s just a whole variety of different things and they kind of move in sometimes in different directions. So it's really hard to kind of narrow it down to \u2013 and specifically equity investments and I wouldn\u2019t want to kind of take you down that path or mislead with respect to that. I guess my point is that you know, when I end up looking at other income and the impact of equity investments within other income, I think its going to be fairly stable relative to fourth quarter, that what I would tell you. Vivek Juneja : Okay. And have you - what is the dollar amount of investment that you will have made in equity investments and has that increased recently? Andy Cecere : It hasn\u2019t increased and it\u2019s not something we've kind of specifically disclosed in the past. Vivek Juneja : Okay. One last quick one, AML. Are you - can you just give us an update on timing of when you expect to get out of that one? Richard Davis : Yes. Vivek, this Richard. We don't have timing on that. We're an OCC bank. so they are really our binding constraint. We are making great progress, we are moving forward. This is a bifurcated view I think on any consent order, one as you get to where you need to be, then you need to prove you can stay there for a while. Then they need to audit to confirm the sustainability. So you know we're in between stages one and two right now, so it depends on how long that will take. Back to Erika's question I do think that as regulatory reform starts to maybe lighten a bit, I think those kinds of issues move more swiftly and we might hope that there will be a faster conclusion from beginning to end on anything, any bank has been called out to improve because I think part of the issue is we're just in these issues for a very long time and maybe unnecessarily extended periods when the performance has actually been accomplished. The remedy is been done and it sustained and it just needs to long to prove it. So I think we've talked about this year being that year to get all those steps done, if I had to make a guess we're probably late this year or early into next year, but that's on my own guess and we're not [indiscernible] we're not you know another bank that has this issue, we're a U.S. Bank and we're dealing with our own issues and we're moving swiftly with our the regulator to OCC to prove to them that we've got the message, we've got the sustainability, and we're ready to move forward. But it's not imminent, but let's hope that it\u2019s not too much into the future either. Vivek Juneja : Okay, thanks, Richard. Richard Davis : Yes. Thanks, Vivek. Operator : Your next question is from Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Richard Davis : Hi, Peter. Peter Winter : Morning. You guys have had nice growth in the other earning assets, the excess liquidity with all the deposit growth. Any thought with the move up in rates to reinvest in securities? Or is it you want to hold onto it just thinking that deposits will outflow given the outlook for better loan growth? Richard Davis : Yes. It\u2019s really couple of different things. We do expect it to really kind of abate again then we'll see deposit outflows occurring, which is why, especially in the fourth quarter we tend to hold the cash balances, we see a run-up in deposits with respect to - for our corporate trust business and then that ends up getting deployed in terms of structures, et cetera. If the economy moves up - starts to improve and businesses start to make those business investments that we expect, you know, we do \u2013 and we would see some disintermediation [ph] deposits at that particular point in time because where they we would start to see outflow there. Peter Winter : Got it. And just a quick - just another question, housekeeping. You mentioned with the recent increase in rates that the fee waivers on money market accounts will be minimal in '17. Just what was that impact in '16? Andy Cecere : So two years ago I had at its peak - this is Andy. The money market waivers were just about $100 million and we received back so to speak about 75% or 80% of it in 2016. So that's why Terry says there is limited amount remaining in 2017. Terry Dolan : Right. And the vast majority of that we'll probably see in the first quarter and [indiscernible] Peter Winter : Yes. Got it, okay. Thanks. Richard Davis : Thanks, Peter. Operator : Your final question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning, guys. Richard Davis : Morning. Terry Dolan : Morning. Gerard Cassidy : A question for you, on your loan to deposit ratio, average loans to average deposits is about 82%, what is the optimal level that you guys like to keep that ratio at? Terry Dolan : We don\u2019t strive for an optimal ratio Gerard. We \u2013 it\u2019s a function of loan growth and demand and deposit growth and demand. So it's just an outcome, and if we have more than that some of it goes investment securities or cash, as referenced by Terry, if we have less than that we have plenty of funding opportunities of been a very highly rated banks. So we're not striving to a specific ratio, it\u2019s just an outcome. Gerard Cassidy : Okay, thank you. Richard, you mentioned earlier in the call that you're sensing that the banks are smarter in terms of the deposit pricing. How much of an influence do you think that the industry's low loan to deposit ratio may have on that if at all? Richard Davis : I don't know the answer to that, Gerard, but I know that the temptation already is been present if it was there. So the first couple of movies a year ago and now a month ago I think that based on the hunger for banks to do well that probably would have been as heightened and as an opportunity as possible. So I'm just of the mind that that temptation is past and people are very thoughtful and smart as we move up, obviously as rates get further and deeper beyond 25 basis point things will start to pick up. But the arbitrage between deposit and loan rates will start to get lighter which is good for banks and that's why people are betting that banks will do better in part. And I think we've just gotten smart, people are more thoughtful their balance sheet makes more sense to them and there is other lever to pull, I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be one of them, it could be wrong. Gerard Cassidy : Great. And then just a final question. Again, Richard, you touched on some of the regulatory aspects of what's going on in the industry and of course it is not the top priority of the incoming administration, as you have identified. We hear a lot about relief fees for the banks under $250 billion in assets from a regulatory standpoint. The so-called global SIFIs are not going to see as much relief. Can you point where you guys are positioned, obviously above $250 billion but less than a global SIFI, what would be ideal relief for banks your size? Richard Davis : You know that's a great question because don\u2019t hate me for this answer, but we don't think there be a lot of changes even if we were given really. We're a very large company and systemally important has a lot to do with whether you would break the world of you fell apart. In our case we're very important wherever we are and I think most of the practices that we have been performing, particularly stress testing and recognizing where the risks are, those are better practices and we're really good at it and we would keep a lot of those Gerard. So a lot of those would not go away, some of the relief would be in the consumer enforcement area. have long asked, I have pleaded with Rich Cordray to consider making the CFPB an endorsement agency, not an enforcement agency and I'm not being clever here. The idea that if they put out the basic tenets where the top-rated banks to be customer protective, plus pies customer supportive, financial literacy, do the right thing and they told us what those rules where, we would kill ourselves to be at that top-level. Everyday we do all we could to be positively vexed towards to getting better every day. And instead, there is undue sense that the enforcement side of the spirit comes from trying to catch up and do something wrong and not instead work to get better but try to find a mistake, many cases that were human error and in many cases that were even there when they were done. So that would be my favorite, that would be beneficial to all of us. We're 404 year - $450 million, we're not G-SIFI, but we're a SIFI and we're okay with that and we will come with it all the responsibilities would be that attend to being very, very thoughtful and your compliance above approaching your customer care and doing everything the right way as best you can and if you don't get it right as soon as you figure it out. So not a lot would change for us and you know we've actually not enjoying with some of the smaller regional banks and try to [indiscernible] because we just don't think it would change the way we run our bank. Gerard Cassidy : Great, appreciate the color. Thank you. Richard Davis : Yes. Hey, before we close, since I might get to the last question, I just had a couple thoughts on the bank and the environment. We do believe that the rate environment, steeper yield curve that it was 90 days ago likelihood of interest rates, we think those are those are bankable. We think banks deserve that long overdue and it\u2019s going to get better. That's part of our modeling and we think that that's important. Economy being better is actually trumps all of that, a really good economy, reflection of what our customers feel and when that economy kicks and we hope it does that'll be more important than anything. But were disappointed as you might be to hear it, we are like canaries at mind, we can see balance sheets, we can see customer behavior, optimism is high, but actions are not present yet. So we're going to wait and see on that on. And then tax reform might at a big one that benefits us and our customers, as I said earlier, based on my understanding of the budget process it\u2019s probably going to be a late year issue. So I think bank should bank, you should bank on banks doing well by the interest rate environment. I think you should expect the economy and taxes to be to the best benefits that will improve bigger than right. But I think those come later in the year and we're balancing the bank to manage through slight beneficial quarter and two and a much more beneficial probably quarter three or four. And this is my last call, 41 of them. So I just want to tell you guys how much I appreciate as a class of investors and analysts you had been fair and thoughtful and balanced and you treated this company very well and I appreciate that very much. We've also in kind been and transparent. We've been very complete and thorough in our forecasting and think we've been as candid as we know how to be because we trust the relationship that we have you as part based on transparency and clarity. So I want to thank you for that relationship. I want to encourage you to keep that relationship with us. Terry and Andy will be a remarkable team, and despite the fact that I want things to change for the betterment this company, I think you'll be appreciative that they'll be thoughtful and measured and very well telegraphed. So to end an sport note because that\u2019s how I try to think of my life, this is rather like a great relay race and we're on the backside of track and Andy and I are running together now because he's about to pick up the baton, he is got the perfect cadence, I've got the perfect speed. Our hands come together, the baton hands off and we're off to another race and that exactly how you see it. So with that operator or Jen I think you can close the call.

Following a review of the results by Andy Cecere, President and Chief Executive Officer and Terry Dolan, U.S. Bancorp\u2019s Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon, Eastern Daylight Time, through Wednesday, April 26 at midnight Eastern Daylight Time. I will now turn the conference call over to Jen Thompson, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. Jen Thompson : Thank you, Melissa and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Andy Cecere, Terry Dolan and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp\u2019s first quarter results and to answer your questions. Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today\u2019s call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today\u2019s presentation in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Andy. Andy Cecere : Thank you, Jen. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call. I am going to start off by giving you some high level commentary, Terry will then provide more detail in the first quarter results and some forward-looking guidance, and after that, we\u2019ll take your questions. In the first quarter, we reported net income of $1.5 billion or $0.82 per diluted share. Slide 3 of our presentation provides a summary on the quarter. As is typical in the first quarter, seasonal factors impacted sequential results. However, on a year-over-year basis, we reported solid growth in revenues, earnings, loans and deposits. Turning to Slide 4. I would like you to focus your attention on profitability and returns. In the first quarter, our return on average assets was 1.35%, our return on common equity was 13.3%, and our efficiency ratio was 55.6%. We are proud of these industry leading results and we continue to focus on enhancing our performance. We expect our return to shareholders and our efficiency ratio to improve throughout the year as we gain market share in core business lines and benefit from the funding advantage afforded by our high debt ratings and superior deposit franchise. We expect to do this while maintaining the same expense and credit risk discipline our shareholders have come to expect from us. The U.S. economy continues to improve. Interest rates are finally in an upward trajectory and consumer sentiment reflects optimism for potential actions by the new administration. So, there is a lot of change and potential opportunity on the macro front, much of which could be to the benefit of the banking industry. I believe we are well positioned for this next phase of the cycle. During the first quarter of 2017, commercial loan growth was sluggish across the industry. Our large corporate customers tell us that they are optimistic about the future, but are awaiting more clarity regarding potential changes in tax and regulatory reform, infrastructure spend and trade policies. Additionally, some of our clients are actively accessing the capital markets, which pulls some financing from the bank lending arena or result in reduced line utilization. However, we expect commercial loan growth to be better in the second quarter versus the first and we expect more robust commercial loan growth in the second half of the year. Let me talk more about profitability and returns. We are not interested in growing just to get bigger. We are focused on profitable growth. And that mindset is deeply ingrained in our culture. As a result, we are willing to forego volume growth to maintain an appropriate level of profitability. We have been doing this for years in our company. In the wholesale bank, we often acquired new customers by allowing them to utilize their balance sheet for some amount of time, but if we can transition that into a more profitable relationship, we call the relationship. That strategy has translated into client growth, higher revenue per client and better profitability. We apply this same logic in our payments business and every business line for that matter. High volume, low margin business can impair profits. So as an example, we are purposely allowing less profitable business in [indiscernible] to runoff. In the near-term, that\u2019s a headwind to top line merchant acquiring services sales and revenue growth, but those clients are being replaced by more profitable relationships. And that transition is setting us up well for the future. Terry will give more detail on merchant processing revenue during his remarks. Turning to expenses. Our efficiency ratio remains best-in-class, but it\u2019s higher than we would like it to be. As we said last quarter, we expect expense growth to moderate as certain risk management programs are fully implemented later this year. We are committed to delivering positive operating leverage for the full year 2017 with the support of top line revenue growth, careful management of expense and reduced cost pressures from compliance programs. And we will deliver that positive operating leverage without pulling back on prudent investment spending. We remain diligent on the topic of risk management. We feel very good about our credit quality and the overall credit environment. Our net charge-off ratio continues to be stable and the non-performing asset ratio improved on both the linked quarter and year-over-year basis in the first quarter. But we will never take our eye off the ball or fool ourselves into thinking we will be able to predict when the churn in the business cycle will come. Finally, our capital position remains solid. We haven\u2019t been burdened by an excessive amount of capital that has weighed on the returns. That said we have sufficient capital to support growth, effectively manage through periods of economic stress and continue to return capital to our shareholders. Our tangible book value per share of $19.13 at March 31 was up 6.6% versus a year ago. With that, let me turn it over to Terry to provide details on the quarter. Terry Dolan : Thank you, Andy. I will start with a balance sheet review and then discuss first quarter earnings trends. Slide 5 shows our loan growth trends. Average total loans outstanding increased 0.2% on a linked quarter basis and grew 4.1% compared to the first quarter of 2016. Strong linked quarter growth in retail leasing and residential mortgages was essentially offset by modest declines in commercial loans, commercial real estate loans and home equity lending. As mentioned earlier, the commercial loan growth was sluggish across the industry during the first quarter. Our commercial loans declined slightly compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding the seasonal decline of corporate card balances, which are included in our commercial loans, our commercial loan growth was positive 0.2%. Somewhat offsetting this headwind in the first quarter was strong growth in middle-market lending across many geographies. Loan growth in commercial real estate reflects our own prudent approach in lending to certain CRE segments, such as multifamily and retail given current market conditions. Turning to Slide 6. Total average deposits declined 0.2% compared with the fourth quarter of 2016, reflecting typical seasonal trends and lower funding requirements given the slower loan growth in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, average deposits increased 11.0%. Following the March interest rate hike, our total interest bearing deposit beta is about 20%. As future rate hikes occur, we model that the beta will gradually trend toward a 50% level. On Slide 7, you can see the credit quality remained relatively stable in the first quarter. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans were 50 basis points in the first quarter, up slightly by 3 basis points compared to the fourth quarter and 2 basis points higher than a year ago. Non-performing assets declined by 6.7% compared with the fourth quarter, and NPAs as a percentage of loans plus other real estate decreased 4 basis points to 55 basis points at March 31. Improvement was driven by commercial loans, commercial real estate, residential mortgages and other real estate. Slide 8 represents some information on two areas that have received a lot of attention lately by the investment community : auto lending and retail industry exposure. First, on auto, we are a prime lender in the space and we do not originate sub-prime auto loans. The average FICO score for originations in 2016 was over 770. Our credit metrics remain very stable in auto lending. The second area is the retail industry segment, given recent pressure, as consumers alter their buying habits. Commitments related to the retail industry totaled 3.4% at year end 2016. A little over half of that is direct C&I exposure to retailers, two-thirds of which are to investment grade or equivalent clients. We have minimal exposure to retailers who make their malls. We are watching this retail segment and are comfortable with our portfolio, given the relative small exposure, geographic diversity and high quality of customers. I will now move on to earnings results. Slide 9 provides highlights of first quarter results versus comparable periods. First quarter net income of $1.5 billion was essentially flat compared to the fourth quarter, but was up 6.3% versus the first quarter of 2016. The first quarter is impacted seasonally each year and this quarter was no different. Turning to Slide 10, total revenue declined by 2.0% on a linked quarter basis and grew 5.7% compared with the year earlier. The year-over-year revenue growth was primarily driven by solid loan growth funded by strong deposit growth and strength across our fee businesses. Turning to Slide 11, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $3.0 billion in the first quarter, essentially stable with the fourth quarter despite fewer \u2013 two fewer days in the quarter. Net interest income was up 3.7% compared with the prior year, reflecting earning asset growth from a year ago. Slide 12 highlights trends in non-interest income, which decreased by 4.2% versus the fourth quarter, reflecting typical seasonal patterns and a decrease in mortgage banking revenue of 14%. The mortgage revenue decline was in line with our guidance and reflects both seasonality and a drop in refinancing activity due to higher interest rates. On a year-over-year basis, non-interest income increased by 8.4%, driven by strength in payment services revenue, trust and investment management fees and mortgage banking revenue. I will highlight a couple of items within non-interest income. Trust and investment fees increased 8.6% year-over-year, reflecting new account growth and improved market conditions, along with lower money market fee waivers. Credit and debit card revenue increased 9.8% on higher credit card sales of 8.5% and total card sales volumes of 6.2%. Credit and debit card revenue increased 6.8%, excluding the impact of an acquired portfolio. The increase in other income was primarily due to higher equity investment income. Merchant processing revenue grew 2.7% on a year-over-year basis, adjusted for the impact of currency rate changes. This is a slower pace than we have seen in previous quarters and reflects several factors, including the impact of higher EMV related equipment sales revenue in the first quarter of 2016, the margin impact of certain interchange caps implemented in Europe in late 2015 and our decision to exit certain high volume, low margin merchant relationships last year. We are growing merchant relationships in this business, but the impact to volumes and revenue is being muted somewhat by these factors. We expect this masking effect will begin to dissipate in the second quarter. By the third quarter, merchant acquiring revenue is expected to return to a more normal rate of growth, a trajectory of same-store sales plus about 2%, excluding the impact of foreign currency changes. Turning to Slide 13, non-interest expense decreased 2.0% compared with the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting seasonally lower costs related to investments in tax advantaged projects, professional services expense and marketing and business development. On a year-over-year basis, non-interest expense increased 7.1%. Growth was driven by higher compensation and employee benefit expenses, reflecting the impact of merit increases, higher variable compensation, including performance based incentives and stock based compensation and hiring to support business growth and risk management programs. The increase in marketing and development expense reflected investment in the brand and various business initiatives. Other expense was up 6.2%, reflecting the impact of the FDIC surcharge, which began in the third quarter of 2016 and an insurance recovery last year. Slide 14 highlights our capital position. At March 31, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as if fully implemented was 9.2%, which is well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement and our internal target of 8.5%. In the first quarter, we returned 78% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. We expect to remain in our targeted payout ratio of 60% to 80% going forward. I will now provide some forward-looking guidance. In the second quarter, we look for modest growth in net interest income on a tax \u2013 fully taxable equivalent basis, driven by improved loan growth compared with the first quarter and slightly higher net interest margin. Credit card, mortgage and auto loan growth are seasonally stronger in the second quarter. Additionally, we look for improved commercial loan growth in the second quarter as well. However, the timing of anticipated policy changes are difficult to predict. Also, given the current yield curve and rate expectations, corporate clients are continuing to access the capital markets, which may impact that growth in commercial loans in the short-term. Therefore, we think meaningful acceleration in commercial loan growth is more likely to occur in the second half of 2017. Finally, we remain disciplined in lending to the CRE market and growth in that category will likely remain muted in the near-term. We look for mortgage revenue to increase compared with the first quarter. The second quarter is seasonally stronger, as home sales strengthen in the spring and we are well positioned to gain share in the purchase market over time. Industry refinancing activity is projected to continue at lower levels, reflecting higher mortgage rates. Expenses will be seasonally higher in the second quarter, but as previously mentioned, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage for the full year. Given the underlying mix of quality of our loan portfolio, we expect credit equality to remain relatively stable in the second quarter and we expect the loan loss provision to increase in line with loan growth. The taxable equivalent income tax rate was 27.0% in the first quarter compared with 28.1% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease reflected the impact of new accounting guidelines related to stock based compensation effective for the first quarter of 2017. We estimate the taxable equivalent income tax rate in the second quarter of 2017 will be approximately 28%. Finally, in the first quarter, we provided notice to redeem all of our Series G preferred stock and issued $1 billion of Series J preferred stock. The total quarterly dividend \u2013 preferred dividend \u2013 the total quarterly preferred dividend for the quarter was $69 million. Included in the determination of diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2017 was an additional charge of $10 million related to the Series G issuance cost. Looking to future quarters, given our current capital structure, the level of preferred dividends will be about $63 million in the second and fourth quarters of each year and $70 million in the first and third quarters of each year. Of course, the $10 million issuance charge will not reoccur. Let me hand it back to Andy for closing comments. Andy Cecere : Thanks Terry. So to summarize, we feel good about where we are and how we are positioned and even better about where we are headed. I look forward to leading this company through the next phase of its evolution. Our Chairman and former CEO, Richard Davis\u2019 leadership has set us up well for the future. And I am grateful for his guidance and partnership over the last 10 years that we have worked together. Our businesses are strong and our culture of innovation is intact. So as I transition into my new role, you should not expect major changes to the strategic direction of this company, given our industry leading performance. You should expect an ongoing focus on innovation, continuous improvement in our customers and employees. That concludes our formal remarks. Terry, Bill and I will now be happy to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from John McDonald with Bernstein. Andy Cecere : Good morning John. John McDonald : Good morning guys. I am wondering about the expenses Terry, what kind of step-up in expenses should we kind of be thinking about for the second quarter and just remind us, where does that seasonality occur, which lines? Terry Dolan : Yes. So if you end up thinking about the second quarter, we are going to typically see it growing probably 3% to 4% in the second quarter relative to first quarter. As John, we have talked in some of our investor conferences, we still expect pressure with respect to risk programs, at least through the end of the second quarter, with the trajectory of that growth starting to slow as we get later into the year. So when we think about positive operating leverages as far as expenses are concerned, we are pretty confident that we are going to deliver on positive operating leverage for the full year. John McDonald : Okay. But maybe we shouldn\u2019t expect efficiency ratio improvement in the second quarter and it probably gets better late in the second half? Terry Dolan : That\u2019s the way that we are thinking about it. I think it\u2019s going to probably start to plateau and then as it gets later into the year, it\u2019s going to start to come down. Andy Cecere : So, John, this is Andy. I do think we are sort of at our high level. It will be flattish in the second quarter and then start to come down as we achieved that positive operating leverage in quarters three and four. John McDonald : Okay. And Andy, what kind of loan growth outlook do you have nearer term? How much do you think you can get better in the second quarter and what drives your confidence that we could accelerate further in the back half of the year? Andy Cecere : Sure. So first of all, our starting point is a little higher versus where we ended the fourth quarter. Secondly, our pipelines are stronger. As Terry mentioned, a lot of our corporate clients were accessing the Capital Markets, so that did put a bit of a damper on loan growth. But the seasonality on home equity, what we are seeing on auto and what\u2019s going on with the corporate loan growth tells me that the second quarter is going to be stronger than the first quarter, but probably not as strong as what we achieved some quarters last year, but I do see acceleration here in quarter two. John McDonald : Okay. And then last thing, Terry, can you just give us some thoughts on the net interest margin? What are the puts and takes going forward for next quarter and how much improvement could you see? We got the March hike. And what do you think for the second quarter NIM? Terry Dolan : Yes. I think net interest margin as we said is going to end up expanding, but it\u2019s going to end up expanding slightly, I think in the second quarter. We do see growth in the net interest margin as we get into the third and fourth quarter. Part of the growth in the first quarter of 5 basis points, some of the factors that will help us as we go into second quarter is we are starting to see that inflection point in terms of the investment security portfolio, so that will help us a little bit. Cash balances will be a little bit higher, which will put some pressure on it. When we end up looking at kind of all of those, the growth quarter-over-quarter is going to be in the basis point or so. John McDonald : Okay, thank you. Andy Cecere : Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question is from John Pancari with Evercore. Andy Cecere : Good morning, John. John Pancari : On the \u2013 back to the loan growth expectation, I know you indicated that as the capital markets weighed near-term, but you expect that could be strengthening. What type of annual growth rate do you expect for this year in overall loan growth? And then as you look into a more normalized macro improving type of environment, what is the go-forward loan growth that you think USB is capable of for next year, for example? Terry Dolan : Right. So, one of the things that we talked about last quarter is that we thought that loan growth for the year would probably be in the 6% to 8% sort of range. And certainly, as we look at where the first quarter has occurred, that\u2019s going to be hard to achieve, but we think it\u2019s going to be middle single-digits, if you will, for the year. We also do believe that second quarter is going to start to get stronger and that\u2019s going to start to accelerate as the year progresses. And so as we think about 2018, we certainly believe that, that 6% to 8% is very reasonable as we think about the future. John Pancari : Okay, great. Thanks. And then back to the expense topic. Appreciate the color you gave, but just looking at the efficiency ratio, more of on a long-term basis as well. I know you are sitting there at 55.5% for the quarter. How could we expect that, that will trend as we look into \u201818, if you can give a little bit of color? Thanks. Andy Cecere : So John, as we have said, we expect our efficiency ratio to be in the low 50s and that\u2019s still our goal and our target and that\u2019s what we are planning to. I would say, again, that this quarter was at our highest level, our high point and we are going to start to achieve downward trend, particularly in the second half of this year and I would expect the same trend next year as we achieve positive operating leverage. John Pancari : Okay, great. And then lastly on the credit side, I know you indicated you don\u2019t originate sub-prime auto, but do you have a component of your auto book that is sub-prime that is migrated that way? Andy Cecere : No. I mean, obviously, if somebody goes delinquent and they get scored out, they will wind up with a FICO below 620, but that\u2019s just normal migration. So \u2013 but I mean, we have a very high-quality auto loan book. The origination FICOs are 770 plus. On the leasing side, it\u2019s even a higher credit quality portfolio. FICOs are over 780. So anybody that winds up with a 620 or less FICO is just somebody that\u2019s probably lost their job and has payment issues. John Pancari : Okay, great. Thank you. Terry Dolan : Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question is from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Matt. Ricky Dodds : Hey, guys. This is actually Ricky Dodds from Matt\u2019s team. Just a quick question on the professional services line down quite a bit on a linked quarter basis, I was just wondering how should we be thinking about that line going forward and If the first quarter number is a good starting point to sort of model off of? And then maybe another question on the other fees line item, obviously that line item is a little lumpy historically. Wondering if you could remind us maybe what is in that line item that makes it so lumpy and then perhaps provide a good run-rate going forward? Thanks. Terry Dolan : Yes. So, let me take the professional services fee piece first, Ricky. And if you end up thinking about that, that is an area where a lot of business initiatives comes through and a lot of expense related too, for example, some of the risk compliance programs. It\u2019s also very seasonal. It\u2019s very \u2013 it\u2019s seasonally high in the fourth quarter. First quarter comes down to the levels that you are seeing and then it starts to ratchet up as business initiatives are put into place and as the year kind of progresses. So, we do expect that it\u2019s going to be a line category that is going to go up. As we get later into the year and especially as we kind of start getting into 2018 though I think some of the pressure related to professional fees as is related to risk management compliance programs is going to start to alleviate. And so I think that is an area for opportunity as we start looking at next year, but second quarter definitely is going to be seasonally up third quarter and then fourth quarter is usually the high watermark for professional services fees. In terms of other revenue, other revenue is a combination of a whole variety of different things. It ends up including equity investment income, some trading income, sometimes syndications \u2013 part loan syndications is a part of that, retail product revenue, insurance product revenue. And so it can be very lumpy depending upon what\u2019s happening that particular quarter. Year-over-year, it\u2019s up a little bit, but relative to the fourth quarter, we had some CDC syndication fees that were a part of that. So, it tends to be a little bit lumpy. Ricky Dodds : Okay, thanks, guys. Andy Cecere : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Saul Martinez with UBS. Saul Martinez : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Couple of questions. First, sort of a bigger picture strategy question. I know, Andy, you mentioned that you shouldn\u2019t expect any meaningful change in strategy, but wanted to ask about your branch strategy specifically. You haven\u2019t, since the crisis, really changed your branch count that much, especially relative to peers. You have also had very strong deposit growth over this time period and continue to. So maybe that\u2019s playing a role. But going forward, how do you think about the ideal network size, especially given changes in consumer behavior and frankly some pressure to achieve positive operating leverage? Andy Cecere : So Saul, you are right. The branches are a great source of deposits. We recognize that. And I think that will become even more important as we move into a higher interest rate scenario. At the same time, you are also right that transactions in our branch are reducing. So, 60% of transactions today are done digitally outside of the branch. So what we have done and we will continue to do is change the footprint of the branch in terms of reducing the square footage and we have done that for the past few years and we continue to focus on that. We have also had some reductions in the number of branches and I would expect that to continue. So, overall, the footprint space, so to speak, in our branch network will come down. The number of people handling transactions will come down, but it does continue to be an important source of deposit growth. And for that reason, we will have branches as we do, but fewer square footage, fewer branches, less space. Saul Martinez : Okay. Do you give any sort of magnitude or sense of the magnitude of how much you are reducing square footage or the proportion of branches that are being refurbished or remodeled? Andy Cecere : Yes. From the number of perspectives, we have been calling branches in the neighborhood of 50 to 100 last few years and I would expect this to continue for the next couple of years. Saul Martinez : Got it. And then a more specific question on credit quality, credit card specifically. The charge-off rates didn\u2019t move up, 37, I think a year ago, it\u2019s 32.6. So, obviously, there is some seasonality component quarter-on-quarter, but year-on-year, there is some increase, and I know you talked about retail and sub-prime auto, but anything there? What\u2019s driving that, anything to be worried about in terms of the trajectory on your credit card book? Andy Cecere : Short answer, nothing to be worried about. As you recall, we have grown our \u2013 all of our loan portfolios throughout this cycle. So we do have seasoning impact there. We have had good \u2013 that acquisitions. We have had good organic growth, especially out of the branches. So there is nothing there that \u2013 we saw the same seasonal patterns and delinquencies, so we see nothing that concerns us. It\u2019s all within expectation. We expect that the latter half of the year, those rates will come back down depending upon the balance. Saul Martinez : Got it, right. Okay. Can you remind me what you \u2013 I think you mentioned in your Investor Day, but what the through the cycle charge-offs are for your credit card book? Andy Cecere : Yes. I think we tagged that. It\u2019s either, like, 4.75 or 5, somewhere in that range. Saul Martinez : Okay. So you are still well within that? Andy Cecere : Yes. Saul Martinez : Alright, very good. Thanks a lot. Terry Dolan : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Terry Dolan : Good morning Ken. Amanda Larsen : Hi, this is Amanda Larsen on for Ken. Can you talk about the pushes and pulls on balance sheet growth, average earning assets were down quarter-over-quarter for the first time in many years and I guess that balance sheet size the product of deposit growth in the opportunities that growing loans, but you remain out of cash into loans and securities also shrinking the balance sheet this quarter and I am wondering if this is \u2013 if this will be more indicative of your future plans and lower deposit, lower growth quarter as you focus on profitability over volume? Terry Dolan : Yes. I mean, so if you are all looking at just kind of the shifting of earning assets, I mean we are holding a little bit more cash balances than what we have in the past and that\u2019s for things like liquidity purposes, etcetera and the fact that we have had stronger deposit growth over the course of last couple of quarters. In terms of loan growth, I think we have kind of talked about the mechanics of that. Our investment securities is really going to grow in line with what our liquidity requirements are at any particular point in time. From a deposit standpoint, in terms of pricing, we are just really looking at being very competitive with respect to deposit pricing. But right now, deposit beta has been fairly inelastic. So we don\u2019t see a lot of changes relative to where we are at. I think it is fairly indicative in terms of what you are going to see going forward. Andy Cecere : And Terry, I would say most of the fluctuation occurred in the fourth quarter was function of cash levels. And that can be volatile given the deposit flows and given the loan growth. So if you look at our loan portfolio that was up 7.2% [ph]. Our securities were relatively stable. And cash from around a bit, probably up a little bit more cash as we were before. Amanda Larsen : Okay, great. And then fees were good across the board, can you talk about pipelines and commercial product revenue and also some of the headwinds and tailwinds in the payment line, it looks like corporate payment products may turn into growth, but that merchant processing slowed? Terry Dolan : Yes. No, I think that is true. I mean we did see really nice growth with respect to credit card. And one of the areas that I would also kind of focus on is in the commercial payments space. We saw some very nice growth. Linked quarter is about 4.7%. On a year-over-year basis is about 5.3%. It\u2019s one of the things we are seeing and we started making some business investment in that, a little over a year ago in terms of technology. We rolled out kind of virtual card offerings and innovations. And we are also seeing a little bit of a tailwind as a result of fuel prices getting a little stronger. So that\u2019s some of the things that are benefiting us. In terms of commercial business sort of spend, in that particular category. And then in the first quarter, we are starting to see government spend expanding a little bit up, which is a little bit unusual for the first quarter. It was up about 2.2% year-over-year. And we are seeing stronger defense spending in the sense of the election, it\u2019s maybe the way that we would categorize that. On the merchant \u2013 merchant acquiring and merchant processing revenue, I did talk a little bit about it. But again, the drivers behind the 1.3%, part of that is the foreign currency, so that gets you to about 2.7%. We, as part of the kind of chip and PIN sort of rollout in the whole \u2013 in that whole topic, our EMV equipment sales were strong at the end of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. But relative to the industry, we are more penetrated in terms of chip technology with about 66%, 67% penetration at this particular point in time relative to the industry, which is closer to about 40%. And so in the first quarter of this year, we are kind of just continuing to see that. Now, that will abate as we get into the second quarter and into the third quarter as well. And then I think the other thing that\u2019s been \u2013 the other two things that\u2019s been impacting that is that we just have margin compression that\u2019s been occurring in Europe because of the interchange caps that were put into place in late 2015. That\u2019s getting close to the end, which is good to see. And then as we said, we have been exiting some high volume, low margin sort of merchants. And so that has impacted revenue a little bit, but it certainly has impacted volumes. And so when we think about merchant acquiring revenue for the second quarter, we do believe that, that is going to get stronger as some of these factors start to abate. And it\u2019s going to become more normalized in the third quarter. And we think about that \u2013 we usually think about it in terms of same-store sales plus 1% to 2% in terms of what the revenues should look like. Andy Cecere : And Terry, let me reemphasize something you said. The corporate payment systems in the past few years seems to have had a headwind either in the government side because of lower government spend or on the corporate side as some large corporations slow down their expense spending. This was a quarter that we actually saw growth in both. And that was very positive on the corporate side [indiscernible] some of that innovation on the government side because some of the increased spend. And we continue to expect growth in both of those. So that\u2019s an important turn in terms of the growth trajectory for corporate payment systems. Amanda Larsen : Okay. And just one last one on the commercial product revenue thinking about pipelines into 2Q, I know you had a good quarter this 1Q, but then also last year 2Q is seems like a tough comp, so what you are seeing on that [indiscernible] activity, is it possible you can post year-over-year growth next February? Thank you. Terry Dolan : Yes. Well, certainly, on a year-over-year basis, we do believe that. The second quarter tended to be a little bit stronger last year because of some of the Brexit things in terms of second quarter. But the pipeline, in terms of syndication and fixed income capital markets, continues to be strong. We do expect, given the current rate environment and just kind of some of the things our large corporate customers are doing, that they will continue to access the capital markets. Our capital market revenue was up very strong in the first quarter. We would expect it to stay at higher levels going into the second quarter. So we think that that\u2019s a pretty good outlook. And of course, by those large corporate customers accessing the capital markets, that has been impacting our loan growth to some extent. But we do see that continuing. Amanda Larsen : Okay, great. Thanks very much. Andy Cecere : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Terry Dolan : Hi Erika. Erika Najarian : So just wanted to ask a question on the trajectory of deposit costs from here, as you mentioned, deposit betas remained quite low, I did notice that there was a 10 basis point quarterly up-tick in money market savings and I was wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on perhaps a different competitive dynamics of the different deposit products and also you mentioned an eventual 50% deposit beta, but what is the realistic trajectory in 2017 if we only get one or two more rate hikes? Terry Dolan : Yes. So let me kind of talk about it. Again, betas overall, if we end up looking at December of \u201815, December of \u201816, March of \u201817, typically what we have seen and we are pretty much on track on this is well in terms of the March hike, is that deposit betas have been up about 20%, 20% to 25% kind of in that ballpark. We have a strong retail deposit base that represents about 50% of our overall deposits. And the pricing from that particular standpoint has been pretty inelastic thus far. So we haven\u2019t seen a lot of movement in terms of retail deposits. And certainly for the next rate hike, I don\u2019t expect that we are going to see a lot of movements. There may be a little bit more pressure, but we still think there is room and opportunity there. On the wholesale side, which represents about 30% of our overall deposits, we are seeing kind of what I would say, selective competitive pressure and the deposit betas with respect to that or closer to the kind of 25% to 30% kind of in that ballpark. And then our corporate trust business, which will be unique to us, represents about 18% of our overall deposits. That tends to be a little bit more sensitive to interest rates. And so we are seeing pressure in terms of movement of interest rates is going to be in that space. As we think about kind of the rest of the year and certainly, the next rate hike or so, that 20% to 25% deposit beta probably starts to migrate to 30%, 35% and that would be \u2013 what I would think we would see kind of through this year. It\u2019s really going to depend upon how many rate hikes and how quickly they come. I just want to point out is that when we model a rate hike movement, certainly as we get a few rate hikes out, we are going to see deposit betas. There is going to be just more competitive pressure there in the future. So that\u2019s kind of how the way we think about it. Erika Najarian : Thank you. And just as a second question. Andy, we totally get the message as a marketplace that it\u2019s going to be business as usual and no large change in strategy, I am wondering if you could remind us on how U.S. Bancorp, over the next 2 years or 3 years is thinking about inorganic growth in terms of use of its excess capital, especially in a world where your consent order is listed or you don\u2019t have any [indiscernible] restrictions in terms of inorganic growth? Andy Cecere : Right. So we have \u2013 as you know Erika, we have been doing some portfolio deals, credit card transactions, some payments transactions as well as trust and fund services. So those types of things, we are not precluded from doing. They are high return, low capital usage businesses and we will continue to focus on them. We are precluded from branch transactions until we are out of the consent order. And we will look at opportunities there to increase market share, our depth of participation on market as that presents itself. But we are well positioned with both organic growth that we have today and our opportunities for acquisition with the current model. So we are not really prohibited from what we want to do. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you. Andy Cecere : Sure. Operator : Your next question is from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Andy Cecere : Hi, Vivek. Vivek Juneja : Hi, Andy. Hi, Terry. A couple of follow-ups on those questions that have come up, Andy can you remind us where you are in terms of your expectations for timing on when you get out of that anti-money laundering issue? Andy Cecere : So there are three components with the concenter and I am going to ask Bill to fill in the details. But the way I think about it simply, there is the people process side and that we are done with that. The second is the technology component, which will be done this summer. And the third is the sustainability component, which is really a function of the regulators improving the sustainability. And that one has a little bit more in terms of uncertainty of timing. Bill Parker : So Andy hit on it right. We got it late 2015. We had already been working on it for well over 1 year. So last year was a year of build, this year is a year of installing some of the new technology enhancements. We are pretty much at a full staffing level. So towards the end of the year, we expect to be able to demonstrate sustainability. And then from there, it\u2019s getting all the external parties comfortable with validations and etcetera. So that\u2019s how we think about the timing. Vivek Juneja : Do you think you get out of the whole thing from the regulators by end of this year, early next year, any sense of where you think the timing lands? Bill Parker : Yes. Again, towards the end of this year is when we will be demonstrating sustainability. So that\u2019s \u2013 after that, it\u2019s up to the auditors and regulators. Vivek Juneja : Okay, great. Separate question, other income, which was up 16% year-on-year, you have mentioned in the release that higher equity investment gains, can you give us some perspective that\u2019s pretty nice jump in other income, what is the run rate of equity investment income and what is the dollar amount of equity investments? Terry Dolan : I have never gotten into the dollar amount associated with equity investments simply because other revenue represents the whole bunch of different categories, I will tell you that as we think about the second quarter Vivek, that we do believe that the equity investment income is we are \u2013 going to be pretty consistent based upon anything that we see right now, pretty consistent with the first quarter. So we wouldn\u2019t expect to see a lot of movement up or down in terms of equity investment. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Lastly, auto lease residuals, can you talk a little bit about that, there has been some concerns about that item, given concerns about lot of leases coming off in the next couple of years? Andy Cecere : So Vivek, this is Andy. That has come back. So as you know, that was in the $700, $800 level last year, migrated down to about $200 of gain in the first quarter. But I will tell you in April, it\u2019s back up to the $800 to $900 level. So it\u2019s bounced back. Part of that it because it will slow down in production, which has eased the pressure on used car prices, so that has bounced back. Vivek Juneja : Alright. Thanks Andy. Andy Cecere : You bet. Operator : Your next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Andy Cecere : Good morning Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi, a couple of questions and follow-ups, one is on the deposit rates that you showed on your slide deck where for time deposits, you did increase this past quarter, but there was some outflow and I am just wondering, I know for quite a while, you have been shrinking time deposits, not necessarily most efficient way of gathering deposits, but I am wondering, from here on in is that strategy still hold or should we expect that you are going to try to regain some activity there? Andy Cecere : Yes. From a time deposit standpoint, that\u2019s really kind of a function of what sort of funding we need in order to be able to support loan growth. So in some respect it\u2019s kind of a function of how much loan growth we end up seeing. If we do continue to see rising rates, that we may have kind of change our pricing strategy a little bit with respect to time deposits, especially as we get into a period of time I don\u2019t know whether it will be the next rate hike or the following where retail deposits become more sensitive to rising rates. Then you may see us kind of shifting that strategy in order to kind of lock in some of the deposit pricing associated with time deposits. But right now, based on what we are seeing in the relatively inelastic retail deposits, I don\u2019t anticipate that we would change a lot. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then my other follow-up is on the commercial real estate, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, not really looking to grow that line item and in fact strength of it being conservative, maybe just you can speak to some of the reasons why and touch on if any of that has to do with regulatory reviews or CCAR process, etcetera? Bill Parker : Betsy, this is Bill. Last part first, none of it has to do with the [Technical Difficulty] regulatory or CCAR process. If you look at the CRE line and you look at the two pieces, the piece has been declining is the standing loan or mortgage loan part. So that\u2019s as other banks have offered long-term fixed rates or not interested in doing that, loving non-recourse. We are not \u2013 we have our set appetite for that. And then just the insurance markets, etcetera. So that\u2019s the piece that\u2019s been declining. On the construction, we enjoyed fairly rapid growth there for a while. That has slowed, but that\u2019s in part because of our own client base. They are getting more cautious on multi-family side and obviously, we follow our clients. So we do look at the high asset values in some of the CRE markets right now, some of the different markets. So our borrowers are cautious, our customers are cautious, we are cautious. But we still anticipate construction, both to grow, just not at the same rates that they used to. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then just lastly on the C&I, I saw the comments around how large corporates are refinancing in the capital markets driving pay downs, a little bit of pressure there on the C&I loan balance, but what about the mid-market side, is that \u2013 are you seeing the same thing there and what degree of interest do you think there is in increasing loan utilizations, just separating out large versus mid? Terry Dolan : Yes. So when we end up looking at loan growth, C&I loan growth, we did see good growth in the middle market space. And so on a year-over-year basis, middle-market was actually up about 8.7%. And on a linked quarter basis, it was up about 2.5%. It represents about 13% to 15% of our overall portfolio. We are seeing that type of growth across the whole variety of different markets. We have seen good growth in places like Nevada, Utah, Colorado, here in the Twin Cities, Kansas City, Wisconsin, just kind of across the board. So as we kind of talk to our folks, we talk to our clients, we are not seeing the same level of access to the capital markets. So that impacts really more on the large corporate space. And we would expect the middle market to continue to grow. The other thing I would say is as we look into the second quarter, part of the middle market is our community banking space and we typically see lift in the second quarter as the ag lending starts to kick in and so both of those would be areas that we would look for opportunity as we think about the second quarter. Betsy Graseck : Okay, that\u2019s great. Yes. Andy Cecere : I was just going to add one other thing that in the first quarter, we did see several hundred million of pay-downs in our energy portfolio and we don\u2019t expect that to repeat as the portfolio is stabilizing and improving, but we did have large number of pay-downs in the first quarter, so... Betsy Graseck : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And just lastly the definition between middle-market and large corporate for you? Terry Dolan : Yes. It\u2019s kind of based upon size. It\u2019s about $10 million. Andy Cecere : $10 million in sales, Betsy. Terry Dolan : Yes, the middle-market is the $500 million, above that\u2019s the large corp. Betsy Graseck : Okay, super. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Kevin Barker : Hi, good morning. Thanks for your time today. Just a quick follow-up on the auto side. Given the decline we have seen in used car prices, I was wondering how you are thinking about the residuals on your auto lease book and how they might be performing relative to your expectations, in particular, just maybe you have increased the depreciation rate on those leases and just really how you are mitigating the residual risk on that book? Andy Cecere : So Kevin, I mentioned before that the residuals have actually come back here in the early second quarter, back to the normalized levels, I would say. They dipped down in the first quarter. You are absolutely correct, but they did come back. We are already very conservative in the way we think about residuals and the way we book them. So we are not changing anything there and the market has come back. Kevin Barker : Great, thanks. Andy Cecere : Sure. Operator : The next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning. Andy Cecere : Hey, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Can you guys share with us the AHA data as recently as this past Friday showed the home equity loans continue to shrink for the industry. Yours have pretty much held in flat now for a year. Can you tell us what your guys are seeing in their frontlines, why this portfolio is not growing faster since housing prices have obviously come back quite a bit from the lows of the crisis? Andy Cecere : Well, couple \u2013 I mean, we still \u2013 we have actively originated our product out of our branches throughout this whole cycle. So, we still have $1.5 billion, $2 billion of originations every quarter and we do pull our folks on what their intended uses are. And it is as you would expect on a traditional home equity, people want to improve the kitchen or whatever. But as home prices have really rebounded, a lot of folks are able to refinance out both first mortgage and our home equity line, lock in a new lower fixed rate. So I think that\u2019s what we are seeing right now is a refinancing of all, both the first and second loan, but our origination volume has held in there very steady. Terry Dolan : And the growth in the utilization, I think, will drive growth. Andy Cecere : Yes, right. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. You guys have been very steady and predictable on the amount of capital you return to shareholders. What kind of environment would have to develop where you may lift that number closer to 100% of earnings or slightly above it? Terry Dolan : Well, Gerard, we are in a good spot right now. Our capital levels are such that \u2013 and our returns are such that our capital formula works. In other words, we are able to generate enough to return that 60% to 80%. We are at the high 70s right now and still accommodate balance sheet growth. So, I don\u2019t see a scenario that we are getting to that 100% as far as the near-term as long as we are continuing to achieve balance sheet growth, which is what I expect. And again, we are in a good spot. We are not sitting here in a big excess position today. Gerard Cassidy : No, I agree. I totally agree. And then finally, when you guys are talking about the inorganic growth acquisitions, obviously, depositories are off the table for the time being. Are you \u2013 would you consider \u2013 or can you purchase a wealth manager if you felt that fit into your current wealth management strategies? Andy Cecere : Components of the wealth business, we could do that and it is a level of \u2013 area of interest for us. Wealth is one of our growth businesses. We are doing a great job organically already, but if there are opportunities that present themselves, we will take a look. Terry Dolan : Yes. And Gerard, what I would say is that in that particular space, we are not interested in what I would call traditional asset managers, but where we found a good fit in terms of a real wealth manager, I think those are things we would take a look at, because culturally, that would be a better fit for us. Andy Cecere : Exactly. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you, guys. Andy Cecere : Thanks. Operator : Your final question is from Brian Klock with Keith, Bruyette, & Woods. Brian Klock : Good morning, gentlemen. Andy Cecere : Hi, Brian. Terry Dolan : Yes, Brian. Brian Klock : It\u2019s a follow-up question. And actually I missed I had to jump off a little bit so I might have apologized if I answered this already. On the loan growth side and thinking about the NII growth for the second quarter versus the first quarter, I mean, should we be thinking about last year\u2019s second quarter, you had a really strong 1.5% on annualized growth in total loans. Like with the commentary about maybe some slower rebound for the second half of the year in commercial, should we be thinking about with overall 1%ish maybe loan growth into the second quarter on a linked quarter basis? And does that sort of drive the NII growth quarter-over-quarter? Andy Cecere : So Brian, we achieved 2.2% in the first quarter. What we said is given the pipelines, the expectations of some seasonality we expect that to accelerate into the second quarter, but not likely to get to that 1 and 1.5. So the way you can think about it is sort of 0.2 to the mid 0.5 somewhere in that area. Brian Klock : Okay, great. Thank you. And I guess kind of follow up on the auto leasing side. There has been some pretty strong growth year-over-year. Just thinking about if there is the issues around the residuals and how that may impact the amount that\u2019s financed by the purchaser. I guess, you guys think that you may see some slowing growth in that \u2013 the auto leasing book? Terry Dolan : Our leasing group is doing a great job. They are taking share. They have a great product. They have been consistent in the marketplace, good turnaround time. So I think that continues to be an area of opportunity for us. And as a reminder, everything we are doing there is prime. So, it\u2019s good business and it\u2019s good credit quality business. Andy Cecere : Yes. Brian, the other thing that I would end up saying is that if you end up looking at the competitive landscape, we offer both the retail leasing as well as the auto lending. And so when customers come into the dealership then we also have very strong relationships with the dealership. So when they are coming into the dealer make a decision upon about buying a loan or buying a car or leasing that car, we have the ability in that prime space to be able to go either way. And I think that\u2019s, from a competitive standpoint, one of the reasons why we see the growth. Terry Dolan : With longstanding relationships. Andy Cecere : Yes. Brian Klock : That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks for your time guys. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Brian. Terry Dolan : Yes. Thanks, Brian. Jen Thompson : Okay. Well, thank you for listening to this review of our first quarter results. Please contact us if you have any follow-up questions. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Following a review of the results by Andy Cecere, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Dolan, U.S. Bancorp's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon, Eastern Daylight Time, through Wednesday, July 26 at 12 o'clock midnight Eastern Daylight Time. I will now turn the conference call over to Jen Thompson of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. Jen Thompson : Thank you, Melissa and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Andy Cecere, Terry Dolan and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's second quarter results and to answer your questions. Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Andy. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Jen. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call. I am going to start off by discussing a few highlights from our second quarter earnings results. Terry will then go into some details and also provide you with forward-looking guidance, and after that, we'll take your questions. I'll start with Slide 3 of the presentation. In the second quarter, we reported net income of $1.5 billion or $0.85 per diluted share. You will see on the slide that our balance sheet is strong and growing, sequential loan growth came in at the high end of our guidance range at 0.9%. As expected, C&I loan growth picked up after a sluggish start to the year and gained momentum towards the end of the second quarter. Based on current trends we expect that by the third quarter total loan growth will be back to the 1% to 1.5% range we think that is more normalized. Credit quality remains excellent and we feel good about the risk profile of the loan portfolio. The net charge-off ratio was stable in the second quarter and our non-performing asset ratio improved on both, the linked quarter and year-over-year basis. Shifting to capital management; our book value per share ended the quarter at $25.55 which was up 4.8% from a year ago. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio estimated for the Basel III fully implemented standardized approach was 9.3% at 6.30 [ph], the level which is sufficient to support growth effectively managed through periods of economic stress and returned capital to our shareholders. In June, the Federal Reserve Bank notified us that they did not object to our capital plans submitted during the CCAR process. We subsequently announced the dividend increase of 7.1% and a new share repurchase program for the year. Now let me touch on our key performance ratios. We turn to Slide 4, our return on average assets for the second quarter was 1.35%, our return on common equity was 13.4%, and our efficiency ratio was 55.2%. We're proud of our industry cleaning profitability metrics that we're always striving to improve. Although consistently best-in-class, our efficiency ratio has been at the higher end of its historical range in the past few quarters, primarily reflecting increased personnel and technology cost related to the regulatory compliance programs. However, we are nearing the end of the build out of these programs and believe the growth rates of these costs will begin to moderate. We expect compliance costs to grow at a pace more in-line with the company's core expense space in late 2017 and into 2018. When we look out through the remainder of the year we expect to deliver positive operating leverage in both the third and fourth quarters of 2017 on a year-over-year basis. We further expect that the year-over-year non-interest expense growth will be in-line with our long-term target range of 3% to 5%. We believe that our strong balance sheet, diversified revenue mix and our focus on expense management combined with participation in some significant expense headwinds provides momentum for the second half for this year and into 2018. Let me stop there and turn it over to Terry. Terry Dolan : Thank you, Andy. If you turn to Slide 5, I'll start with the balancing review and follow-up with the discussion of second quarter earnings trends. In the second quarter average loans increased 0.9% on a linked quarter basis and grew 3.4% from a year ago. Commercial loan growth rebounded from the first quarter increasing 2% sequentially. Line utilization has not increased materially, however, deal activity has strengthened and we continue to gain market share. As Andy mentioned, large corporate lending, there are momentum in the latter part of the quarter. Additionally, throughout the quarter we continue to see strong growth in middle market lending across many geographies. Commercial real estate lending reflects our prudent approach to certain CRE segments such as multi-family and retail given current market conditions. We did have opportunities for growth in construction lending. However, remain cautious in commercial mortgage markets where the competitive environment has created unfavorable conditions from a risk and return standpoint. In addition customers continue to refinance commercial mortgages in the capital markets given the rising rate environment and opportunity to extend maturities. We had particularly strong growth in retail leases as far as up 11% linked quarter where both a prime lender and a less or in the auto segment and our well established market position, full product offering and a strong dealer relationships that provided strong growth in both lending and leasing. We have made significant investments in this business over the past few years which is coming to fruition in the form of increased market penetration with both dealers and manufacturers. We expect growth will remain healthy for the next few quarters as we continue to penetrate market. I want to emphasize that leasing growth is not coming at the expense of increased risk. If you look at Slide 6, credit metrics remain very stable in our retail leasing portfolio. We have not changed our underwriting in this business and are not enhancing residual values. I would also highlight that in the second quarter the weighted average cycle score on originations for auto leases was 782. Turning to Slide 7, total average deposits increased 0.8% compared with the first quarter of 2017 and 7.7% on the year-over-year basis. Following the June interest rate hike, our total interest bearing deposit is in the mid 20% range. As future rate hikes occur we would expect the beta will gradually trend towards 50% level. On Slide 8 you will see the credit quality was relatively stable in the quarter, net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans was 49 basis points in the second quarter and non-performing assets declined by 9.8% on the linked quarter basis. I will now move on to earnings results. Slide 9 provides highlights of second quarter results versus comparable periods. Second quarter net income of $1.5 billion was up 1.8% compared with the first quarter but was down 1.4% versus the second quarter of 2016. As a reminder, the second quarter of 2016 including two notable items; a $180 million Visa Europe gain in non-interest income and a $150 million non-interest expense related to interest accruals and a charitable contribution. Excluding these items net income increased slightly year-over-year. I will exclude the impact of these notable items when I discuss revenue and expense comparison versus the second quarter of 2016. Turning to Slide 10, revenue totaled a record $5.5 billion, up 3.1% on a linked quarter basis and 4.2% higher compared with the same quarter a year ago. Turning to Slide 11, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $3 billion in the second quarter, up 2.4% compared with the first quarter and 5.9% higher than the second quarter of 2016. Comparisons in both quarters benefited from earning asset growth and higher interest rates. In the second quarter the net interest margin increased one basis point to 3.04% in-line with our guidance. The increase was primarily driven by rising interest rates partially offset by the impact of a flatter yield curve and higher cash balances which increased to meet certain regulatory expectations related to liquidity. We do not expect average cash balances to increase meaningfully from current levels. Slide 12 highlights trends in non-interest income which increased 3.9% versus the first quarter reflecting seasonally higher revenue, particularly in the payment services business. On the year-over-year basis, non-interest income increased 2% excluding notable items. Credit and debit card revenue increased 7.8% from a year ago on higher sales volumes. Merchant acquiring revenue grew 2.7% on a year-over-year basis adjusted for the impact of currency rate changes. In the second quarter we exited two merchant acquiring joint ventures which did not have a material impact on the second quarter results but will mute revenue growth comparisons for the next few quarters. Divestitures were in part -- due in part to changing priorities of the joint venture partners that were impacting future growth and profitability portfolios for us. Mortgage revenue grew about 2.4% on a linked quarter basis but declined 10.9% year-over-year, in-line with our expectations. Turning to Slide 13, non-interest expense increased 2.7% compared with the first quarter of 2017, primarily reflecting higher compensation expense and marketing and business development expense, partially offset by seasonally lower employee benefit expenses. On a year-over-year basis non-interest expense increased 6.4% excluding notable items, were also driven by higher compensation and other non-interest expense. Compensation expense grew mainly due to the impact of hiring to support business growth and compliance programs, as well as seasonal merit increases in higher variable compensation related to production. Other expenses increased primarily due to be impact of the FDIC insurance surcharge which began in the third quarter of 2016. Slide 14 highlights our capital position. At June 30, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as if fully implemented was 9.3%. This compares to our capital target of 8.5%. I will now provide some forward-looking guidance for the third quarter. Given recent trends, we expect linked quarter total loan growth to be in the 1% to 1.5% range. Average earning asset growth will track with loan growth. We expect the linked quarter net interest margin to increase in a manner similar to the first quarter of 2017 which is within a range of four to five basis points. Let me take a minute to talk about merchant acquiring revenue. Last quarter we indicated that during the third quarter merchant acquiring revenue was expected to return to a more normal growth trajectory of same-store sales plus 1% to 2% excluding the impact of foreign currency changes. The adverse impact on sales volumes from exiting certain large volume customers is beginning to dissipate with reported sales volumes increasing 3.3% on a linked quarter basis. Given the anticipated revenue impact from exiting the joint ventures, we expect year-over-year merchant acquiring revenue will be essentially flat in the third quarter. Growth will begin to normalize in the fourth quarter and then heading into 2018. As Andy discussed, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage in each of the next two quarters supported by year-over-year expense growth of 3% to 5%, a level we target as more normalized on a long-term basis. Finally, we expect the taxable equivalent tax rate to approximate 29% in the third quarter. Let me hand it back to Andy for closing comments. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Terry. Our financial performance gained momentum in the second quarter and we expect to continue to improve profitability and returns as we look in the second half of this year and head into 2018. From a macro perspective, corporate balance sheets are strong, consumer confidence is increasing and the evolving economic and regulatory backdrop has to promise to be conducive to growth. I just spent time in Washington last week and was very encouraged by the open and productive dialogue that has taken place; nonetheless, progress has been slower than any had hoped. While we have not yet seen evidence of a resurgence in the CapEx cycle, consumers are spending and businesses are active, and we continue to ensure across our geographic markets and business lines. We have a solid and growing revenue base and we believe we have reached an inflection point in expense growth. Importantly, the profit improvement that we expect will drive improving returns will not be achieved as the expense but at the cost of credit quality nor will be achieved at the cost of delaying prudent business investment which will be increasingly focused on technology and innovation. Finally, I want to thank our dedicated employees who work hard every day to be our customers and communities trusted financial partner. That concludes our formal remarks. Terry, Bill and I will now be happy to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks, good morning. Just following up on the expense, rate of change; it's good to hear that it's anticipated that quickly. So I just wonder if you can help us just to understand -- when you're talking about both, 3Q and 4Q getting back down into that three to five; what things are getting better and what things are you still having any inflation underneath the surface? Terry Dolan : Yes, so let me take that question. I think there is three broad things. From a compensation standpoint we expect that that will begin to moderate and continue to moderate third, fourth and into 2018 and that will be driven by the fact that we're getting close to the end of building out those risk and compliance programs, so that is kind of number one. Then cost related to risk and compliance such as like consulting activities; that are really have been helping us support some of those programs, has been moderating, it will continue to moderate as we go into the next few quarters and also into 2018. So those would be the biggest things and then a year ago FDIC implemented a surcharge and so we're starting to lap that and the year-over-year effect associated with the FDIC insurance will start to moderate. Unidentified Analyst : And I'll keep my follow-up to expenses; and can you just help us understand the tax advantage investments and what does that mean for sequential growth as we go third, into fourth as well; it seems like you also had a bunch of that more in the other line this quarter. So can you just help us understand what that means for sequential growth as well? Thanks. Terry Dolan : We don't necessarily talk about that specifically but we do typically see the tax credit amortization expense start to move up in the third and then the fourth quarter. I think last year from third to fourth as an example it was up about $40 million to $50 million kind of a net ballpark. So that should give you kind of some sort of a range with respect to how that's going to change. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thanks guys, appreciate it. Operator : Your next question is from John Pancari with Evercore. John Pancari : Good morning. Just around the deposit balance sheet again for the ended period, just want to get a little bit color on what drove that -- the end of period coming in above the average and some of the volatility there and how we should look at the deposit flows going forward? Terry Dolan : Yes, so on a linked quarter basis if you're going to look at just averages, we saw growth in deposits, both in our consumer business and then also in our corporate trust business. We end up looking at the ending cash balances, keep in mind that one of the things we were doing as we were building cash balances in order to meet some of those liquidity requirements; and in order to be able to do that one of the things that we did is a little bit of a pricing change related to some sort of deposits in order to bring some dollars in near the end of the quarter, and so that's why you see that. Kind of on a go forward basis when you think about cash balances, we don't expect the average balances to change much from current levels. Andy Cecere : That's right, Terry. And I'd add in any particular day that cash balance can be up or down, there is a lot about that particularly within the corporate trust business with flows that are there, so one day I think there is a designated trend during my [indiscernible]. John Pancari : Okay, so the average should remain where it is, so therefore the EOP is probably going to head back towards the level where it was? Andy Cecere : Yes, it's an average balances. John Pancari : Yes, got it, okay. And then on the margin, in terms of your expectation, could you remind me again, you had mentioned four to five basis points? Terry Dolan : Yes. You know, our guidance for the -- going into the third quarter we expected to spend -- expand four to five basis points from here. And one of the things, just -- when we end up looking at the one basis point movement in the second quarter, we had guided that it would be lower. One of the big reasons for that is really building the higher cash balance as that cost has got two basis points during that quarter and the flatter yield curve cost us a little bit but when we look at third quarter we feel pretty comfortable with that range of four to five basis points. John Pancari : Okay. And then jumping off from that point into fourth quarter, how much beyond that would you think barring incremental hikes then into '18 can be a good color? Thanks. Terry Dolan : When we look into the fourth quarter, at least right now, we would expect that the margin increase may not be at the four to five but it's still going to be kind of in that range of three to four, some and above. Andy Cecere : And we try this thing with the 90 days because so much can change with the yield curve in particular, so we'll continue to give guidance as we go to the next 90 days. John Pancari : Yes, got it. Thanks, Andy. Thanks, Terry. Operator : The next question is from Betsy Graseck. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. I just had a couple of questions, little more on the strategic side. I just wanted to get your thoughts on some of the consolidation that's going on with merchant acquiring over in Europe and how that plays into your business over there, any thoughts on incremental investments that you would be looking to make as a result? Andy Cecere : Right. So as you know Betsy, we're five or six both in North America, as well as Europe, we have a great platform, our dynamic currency conversion capabilities, our international payment platform; so I think we're well positioned in both places. Merchant acquiring is an area that we will continue to look for incremental acquisitions, I would call it more open bolt-on or add-on as opposed to major deals. We don't need to really expand or start in Europe because we already have a very strong presence, so -- but it is in an area of focused rest and one that continues to grow along, we continue to invest in. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then on the corporate trust side, could you give us some more updated comments there? Andy Cecere : So corporate trust is having a good year, we continue to be leading market share across all three categories, muni, corporate, as well structured; we have again a good platform and good technology which I think is key to that business and we've been very consistent in terms of our commitment to that. So our opportunity is to continue to expand in the U.S. but also we have a foothold in Europe and our opportunity to expand there I think is comparable to where it was in the U.S. about 20 years ago. Betsy Graseck : And then just lastly, you talked a bit about deposit betas and how they've been projecting; I just wanted to get a sense from you on how close to run rate you are on the corporate side of your business? Terry Dolan : I think when you end up looking at deposit bidders overall, they talked a little bit about that. I do think that one of the things you're seeing on the wholesale side is that the deposit prices gain a little bit more competitive; and so we do see that picking up both in the June hike and as rate hikes continued in the future. And you know, I think that is going to continue to move up and as part of what we are so when we think about the positive bid as overall moving up closer to that 50 basis points, we're going to see more pressure on the wholesale side and on the corporate trust side. Betsy Graseck : Okay. But it feels like we are two-thirds the way through or a third of the way through. Terry Dolan : With respect to this rate hike? Betsy Graseck : Yes. Terry Dolan : I think we're probably further along on the wholesale side of the equation getting normalized betas and we have more space to go on the retail side which the beta there has been very low and we'll continue to go up as the next rate increases come forward. Betsy Graseck : Okay. No, it was interesting just -- I asked the question because obviously we had a rate hike but yet you did a great job on non-sparing deposits growth in the quarter, and so it kind of suggested to me that maybe you were done on the corporate deposit beta side. Terry Dolan : No, I don't know if we're done. I think that's all that we can really driven based upon what we see from a competitive standpoint but I don't think based upon the fact that we have cash balances where we're at, we don't necessarily see a need to drive deposits in. We're -- I would agree with you, I don't think there is a lot of upward pressure with respect to it. Deposit beta is both -- whether it's retail or wholesale etcetera, it's really tracking pretty similar to what we've seen in the past, maybe just a little bit higher. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Alright, thanks so much. Operator : The next question is from [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. My first question is on loan growth, it sounds like the aggregate stuff is pretty much tracking as you would have thought that through the course that you're already indeed will accelerate back in your targeted range in the back half. So that's all good but it is kind of running a little contrary to the weakness we still see in the HA [ph]. Just curious if you can spend another moment or so just talking about exactly where it ends up coming from how much of it is market share versus [indiscernible]? Andy Cecere : So I'll start and then I'll ask Bill to add on. You know the areas of growth continue to be in few -- middle market is doing exceptionally well, that's in excess of 2% on a linked quarter basis and we continue to see that accelerating or being about that level in future quarters, that's doing well. As Terry and I both mentioned, we saw some growth in the second half of the second quarter in the large corporate wholesale part of the category. And then a lot of leasing as Terry mentioned, very high quality but given the great platform relationships we had that shows some growth. So those are areas that I would say are our principal areas of focus. Bill Parker : Yes, that pretty much hit on the consumer, we expect it to remain fairly strong through the latter half of the year, so we continue to see good demand in auto loans and leases; and again, that's very prime portfolio for us, we've always done it that way and we've stayed consistent in that area. We also using some demand on home equity, that's a tough market but we haven't seen the big increases, we do still have strong originations there. Andy talked about the commercial side; I will stay on the commercial real estate side although we do see some roll-off of our -- what we call our mortgage portfolio or standing loan portfolio, I guess it's very aggressive terms and by the life companies in the VS market. We are still an active construction lender, so we've seen growth there and we also -- our client base is a lot of reaps [ph] and much of that actually shows up in the C&I line and we're seeing good growth quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year there. So there is a lot of space where we're continuing to see good demand. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, that's perfect. I appreciate the color. And then just separately on -- just the idea of positive operating leverage; it looks like both the quarters in the back half of the year, we should get was just good. Just curious about your updated thoughts on positive frame leverage for the full year and sort of when you would expect to see that? I think you've previously been hoping to generate positive operating leverage for the full year '17; I guess just my rough cut on the updated guidance -- just now, it will still be a little bit of a challenge but just would be curious to hear your thoughts. Andy Cecere : Scott, we'll get in third quarter and fourth quarter and we'll be very close if not on for the full year. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, sounds good. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Just a follow-up to Scott's question; as we look on longer term in terms of the progression of your efficiency ratio, if we presume this with either forward curve today; could we see U.S. Bancorp exit 2018 with an efficiency ratio in the low 50s? Andy Cecere : Yes, it's a short answer to that question. We would expect to have positive operating leverage and closer to our long-term growth projections as move into '18 and that is what we talked about at Investor Day and that expense ratio in the 3% to 5% and revenue growth above that. Now that's assuming sort of a normal yield curve, economic growth is abnormally lower or anything like that but we would expect to continue to have that into '18. Erika Najarian : That was very clear, thank you. The follow-up on some of the deposit question, some of your peers have noted that if the SAD [ph] does reduce its balance sheet or begin reducing its balance sheet by September, they believe that the outflows will be most vulnerable in wholesale deposits and I'm wondering what your color is on that -- your take is on that and whether or not that could potentially accelerate beta's even further for U.S. bank? Terry Dolan : Yes, so let me take that. And so -- you know, the Fed is still kind of in the process defining what the level of balance sheet reduction and the pace of that overtime; and our expectation is that first of all, they're going to be very transparent as they go through that process and the pace is going to be very gradual, most likely several years. So we do believe that as -- kind of excess liquidity comes out of the market, we would expect there to be more competition for deposits and that is going to end up impacting pricing; I do believe that just because of the nature of the deposits on the wholesale side you're going to see more competitive and -- more of a competitive environment associated with that. Whether I'd be surprised if it's going to significantly impact 2017, and I do believe that just because it's going to be very gradual, it's going to also be very manageable and the market is going to respond accordingly. Erika Najarian : Thank you. And just one last follow-up question; I know you always get asked on this call about an update for with the consent order and I'm wondering if I could ask a more technical question; is the consent order for OCC applicable to the holding company? And I'm just wondering whether or not there is a way to isolate the consent order to sort of unshackle it more strategically? Andy Cecere : OCC obviously regulates our national banks, so that's where it is. But our national bank is essentially the holding company, I mean I think it's over 99% of the entire banks; so all the operations occur within that national bank. So what the OCC -- it really applies across the board. Terry Dolan : Erika, we continue to expect to have our people in process who are in place, their technology will be completed by the end of the third, into the fourth quarter and then it gets to the sustainability and part of the equation and that goes into early '18. Erika Najarian : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is Matt Connor [ph] with Deutsche Bank. Ricky Dodds : This is actually Ricky from Matt's team. I'm wondering if I could just do a bigger picture question first. I wonder if you can touch on some of items on the growth front that you mentioned in the past, maybe it's in payments or in wealth penetration; maybe frame out what those could mean to revenue as we think about both, the rest of this year and into 2018 and beyond? Andy Cecere : So I think our -- let me just sort of go across the business lines, yes, for high level; our wholesale continues to be an opportunity to expand our dominance in terms of being the bank of choice for large corporate customers. We have a number of capabilities we've built over the years and we continue to take market share in different categories, particularly in the commercial group as we move up the league tables. On the wealth management side, I do think the extension of corporate trust, as well as the wealth management piece of the pie, particularly were focused on the emerging [ph], that represents a great opportunity. Payments across all three categories, merchant acquiring, card issuing, as well as corporate payment systems; I think we have the technology and leaders to continue to grow that. I think particularly in regard to Elvan [ph], I think the opportunity is both here, as well as in Europe. And then finally retail, we're doing very well in terms of small business as well as retail core customer growth. And so I think across all of our business lines as we've said many times before, I think we're in a strong position, and we're not really seeking to have major adjustments and just taking advantage of the opportunities we have in front of us. Ricky Dodds : Okay, great. And the maybe separately, it seems like energy and maybe oil prices are starting to come back in the conversation a bit more; some analysts are calling for sun $40 oil prices by 2018. I'm just wondering if you can remind us again what your exposure in that space and does it seem like there is any real signs of deterioration in your portfolio? I'm wondering if you could talk again maybe about the quality. Andy Cecere : Sure. Yes, I mean our book has been relatively modest in size, we do finance the energy sector but we're below 2% of our commitment level and less than 1% of our loans within that sector. When the original price decline took place we obviously did see some impact. This quarter NPAs were down in part because of some of the resolution of those original non-performing loans but we've been bringing our reserve levels down but it's not -- it's just not a material impact to our overall performance but we think the -- were at -- going to a $40 price tag, we think that's a comfortable place to be, so we expect to continue to see improvement in that portfolio. Ricky Dodds : Okay, thanks. Operator : And the next question is from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Hi, couple of questions, and maybe this one goes to Bill. Credit card net charge-offs up 58 basis points year-over-year, turning a little higher than your peers; can you talk a little bit about what's going on there? Bill Parker : Yes, sure. I mean I think that I'll start within -- the forward look is lower than that, right, it will come back down, it will be below 4%; so it's not a trajectory thing. I think what we see is that we have continued to grow that portfolio both with acquisitions and internally through our branches, it's been solid growth; so there is a seasoning impact and if you've probably seen that across the industry but we have -- we do have a seasoning impact there but our outlook is very solid, we haven't -- we've seen our underwriting to begin that growth. Andy Cecere : And it's a crime portfolio across the board, there is no sub-prime activity there and we're not -- that's not something we're worried about. Vivek Juneja : Okay, alright. Second topic, mortgage banking, you talked about that on last quarter's call. Terry, Andy in terms of -- your applications are pretty sharply, seems like gain on sale margins were down; can you give some color as to what's going on and what you expect to see on that? Andy Cecere : Yes, so maybe just to talk about the second quarter first, mortgage applications on a year-over-year basis we're down about 16% for us and that's pretty much in line with what the market was experience and that's driven in large part by the right refinancing. Second quarter mortgage applications, we did see a nice movement up on a linked quarter basis; we end up looking into the third quarter, we would expect mortgage applications to continue to move higher, that is kind of seasonal effect and we also have a nice mix of retail and on the purchase mortgage side, so that seasonal impact will continue to see in the third quarter. Gain out of sale margins in the second quarter did come down, I think you saw that kind of in the industry, our expectation or outlook is that they will be relatively stable going into the third quarter. Vivek Juneja : Okay, great, thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Next question is from Brian Klock with Keith, Bruyette, & Woods. Brian Klock : Good morning. I wanted to just follow-up maybe a little finer tooth on the expense guidance. On the year-over-year basis, I mean would you think that anyway if we look at the 3% to 5% range, do you think that sequentially we're looking at expenses; especially I think Terry if you mentioned the impact of the amortization of -- well income housing tax credits, so should we be up most single digits on a sequential basis, third versus second? Terry Dolan : Yes. I mean usually there is a little bit of a seasonal effect that comes into play with respect to the third quarter but I think that's a reasonable assumption when you think about the third quarter. Brian Klock : Okay. And I now you talked about earlier the deposits and you know the expectation around just the seasonal, there is a season of run-off that comes back in the second half of the year; so cash balances on average you think will be unchanged. So with the recent issuances of some longer term debt are you planning to add anything else to the investment securities portfolio? Are you planning to keep the securities portfolio relatively flat? Terry Dolan : Yes. We end up increasing the securities portfolio really kind of in-line with the overall balance sheet growth; so if you think about what average loan growth is going to look like -- our average earning assets really kind of tracks in a very similar manner, so we would be adding to the investment portfolio in order to be able to do that but that's kind of one way to think about. Brian Klock : Alright, thanks for your time. Operator : The next question is from Saul Martinez with UBS. Saul Martinez : Good morning, everybody, couple of questions. Just sort of closing the loop a little bit on the net interest margin in NII guide; the NIM guidance four to five basis points average loan growth, 1%, 1.5%; I guess this should -- you know, triangulating that into NII growth of getting the numbers of around -- I guess 3% to 4% sequential growth is -- it's a little bit higher than I thought but I just want to make sure I'm not missing something in terms of triangulating NIM into NII growth? Andy Cecere : Yes. I know that you can do the math based on what we ended up laying out but I think that's a reasonable assumption. Saul Martinez : Got it. Okay, perfect. Now I guess a little bit of a bigger picture question on [indiscernible] merchant acquiring business, sort of a follow-up to an earlier question; especially in light of some of the consolidation you're seeing in Europe. But we have heard and feel free to disagree with this but we have heard that from some that it feels like you're subscale in the acquiring business in both, the U.S. and Europe, and obviously you've exited some low MDR relationships, you've exited some JVs, but can you talk a little bit more about the business strategically in terms of where you see the opportunities and how you capitalize on those opportunities? Where do you see [indiscernible] getting into the entire payment space in the merchant acquiring space and how do you differentiate yourself and drive better growth on an ongoing basis? Andy Cecere : So I think first on your scale question, I think we have sufficient scale to be very competitive. I think we've had that for a number of years. We're focused on the few areas, number one is verticals, I think as you think about the merchant processing business, it's migrating from a natural transaction business to an information business and being very focused on verticals and providing that information, it's usually important and we have a number of verticals; the travel industry, hotels, small realty retailers that I think we're very good at, healthcare is another one; so our focus is in that information and in terms of innovation and technology providing beyond the financial transaction, and as well as the expansion of our sales force, both domestically, as well as Europe. And then finally, the e-commerce side of the equation is another area of focus for us in terms of investment and growth. Saul Martinez : Got it. And how do you feel like your e-commerce capabilities are now versus where you want them to be? Andy Cecere : I think they are fine, I want them to be better. Saul Martinez : Okay, alright, fair enough. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question is from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Kevin Barker : Good morning. I just had a quick question on tax rate; you mentioned it was going to 29%, I'm right there on the third quarter, so it's been quite volatile over the last few quarters. Are you still sticking with the 27% to 28%, give or take range for this year and maybe longer term? Terry Dolan : I think that when we end up looking at the tax rate on a tax equivalent basis on a long-term basis, you know just because of growth it's going to -- because of the marginal effect it's going to drift upwards, so when I end up looking at certainly the next few quarters and going into 2018, the 29% is certainly more reasonable. Kevin Barker : Okay. And then in regards to growth, obviously commercial mortgage -- C&I has been the main driver of growth as we've seen in the last few years, it slowed recently here. When you look out the next one or two years do you feel like the consumer and retail lending will start to take the lead or do you feel like commercial lend -- C&I lending will continue to be strong over the next couple of years? Terry Dolan : I think wholesale will continue growing as it is and I think we'll start to see a turnaround in retail; so we've had strong growth, we've seen another portfolio that we talked about, a little bit less in terms of the home equity in traditional retail loan areas but I think we'll start to accelerate in future periods and I think that's how we get to the more normalized long-term growth rates. Kevin Barker : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, I just had a follow-up question. It's around the CCAR process and the ask and -- you know, really the question is around the dividend. I thought you had a nice increase in the dividend but yet you have one of the lowest volatility earning streams of the group and it feels like there might be some room to boost up the dividend component of the capital return. Just wondering how you're thinking through that. Andy Cecere : Betsy, that's a fair question. So I think first of all, we're starting from one of the lower capital ratios; you're right that we have the lowest volatility and the lowest downturn in the stress environment, in fact, we still make money as you say but we're starting from a point that's not far away from what we think is our optimal capital structure, the 8.5% versus the just over 9% we are today, that's number one. Number two is, we're always wanting to make sure that we do -- that we are successful in the outcome of the CCAR process and then finally balancing between the buyback side of the equation and the dividend. What we've done is, what I would call continue -- very predictable continually steady growth and we would expect to continue that in the future. We might balance a little bit more but we will balance a little bit more towards increasing the dividend probably more than a buyback in future periods. Betsy Graseck : Okay, alright, thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, thank you. Can you guys give us some additional color -- you touched on in your opening remarks about the commercial real estate markets, you're seeing possibly some weakness in the multi-family space; can you share with us is there any geographical areas that you see as more concerning for you at this time? Andy Cecere : Well, I mean there are certainly some of the cities that have very strong multi-family growth and if you look at some of the rent forecast and there is plenty of companies to do this. They will see there are markets, some of the coastal markets of Boston, DC; where the forecasts are for either no or slightly decline in rent growth; and that doesn't mean we won't do projects there, we follow our client base and if they like the project, we like the project, we both will do something but some of the markets have seen a lot of multi-family, Minneapolis is another one where you got to be cautious about it. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. The second question was and I think you may have touched upon this and I apologize if you did; can you kind of give us your view of -- obviously, the Federal Reserve has made it clear that they're going to start unwinding their balance sheet and it will go into full speed operation in 2018. How are you guys looking at that and the impact it may have on deposits in the banking system and then for USP as well? Terry Dolan : Gerard, thank you. We talked a little bit about that earlier but you know, when you end up looking at what the Feds -- the Fed still needs to kind of define a level of reduction in the balance sheet and really the pace of it and I think that they've been really transparent that that pace is really going to be gradual over several years and I think that that will cause any impacts of it to be very manageable on the banking industry. And as the market adjusts, I do think that as -- or we think as excess liquidity comes out of the market you could expect to see and you will expect to see more competition with respect to deposits, I would also expect that the long end of the curve on a relative basis would be a little bit higher; as a result some of their activities -- that have [indiscernible] from a deposit standpoint is most likely to come on the wholesale side of the equation. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then just lastly, you know, obviously you guys have industry leading profitability with your ROA and your ROE at the present levels. What -- is it going to be more the net interest margin improvement or the efficiency ratio when you look at how you're going to or could drive that higher? As you know in the past, your numbers were higher but is it more of a margin issue or is it more efficiency ratio or leverage; what are you guys looking out for the levers? Do you even take it higher than where it is today? Terry Dolan : Gerard, I think it's both parts of the equation, it's accelerating revenue growth and moderating expense growth; positive operating leverage which will improve the efficiency ratio and ultimately improve ROA and ROE. Gerard Cassidy : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question is from [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. Just one question, the bottom of Slide 8 really stands out; and that U.S. bank has built reserves for the last six quarters whereas your peers even through 2Q for those that have reported continue to release those reserves. So could you talk about it as something in terms of the mix shift or the loan portfolio that's driving your ability to grow reserves, again when your peers are just not in that same position? Andy Cecere : Well, one of the things you're looking at is that lot of the peers have larger energy exposure so they added more and like us, we can see improvement in this quarter so they may have released more reserves out of their energy book. And we're pretty much steady as she goes from a credit standpoint; so at this point in the cycle we have a very stable credit environment and we're still growing loans, so that's what we look at and we will add to reserves to support loan growth if you think about what they are for and they are for potential future losses out of your loan book and as you grow the loan book, that's what the reserve is for. So if we don't have big upswings, we're needing to add to reserves in a downturn like the energy portfolio. Then we're going to be adding for loan growth. Bill Parker : Sorry about that, it's been a lot lower than everyone else and so simply stated if we're not adding a lot, we're also tracking a lot. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Then just a follow-up question for me. Andy, this concept of one U.S. bank which you've talked about I believe is in the annual report; as you think about the second half of this year there are any areas within your core businesses that stand out in terms of benefiting from this strategy as you work together under this one U.S. bank kind of a strategy? Andy Cecere : Terry, has a long list, there are a number of initiatives across the company from the way we handle our call centers, the way we do innovation and the way we communicate with our customers, to how we share information among the business lines. So there are a number of initiatives and I would say it's probably our number one focus of the company right now. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : The final question is from [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, I just had a couple of small ones on the -- making sure we're getting the payment -- merchant cost JV, it's right in the model; so were there any pain associated with the exit either in 2Q or back half of the year? And then the second just in terms of the guide, I think you said your 3% FX adjusted growth now in merchant processing and you see that flat in 3Q; was that -- how -- is it the earnings -- is it like equity method accounting that was being booked or is there revenue and then we should think about some expense coming out also in P&L? And I guess last, maybe just curiosity -- which JVs are you exiting? I saw something about [indiscernible] but couldn't find the other. Andy Cecere : So first I'm going to ask Terry to go on the other details, there was no material gain or loss in the second quarter as a result. Terry Dolan : Yes, so if you just end up looking at and trying to think about the growth rates over the next couple quarters, certainly reported growth rate is about 2.7% excluding the foreign currency as we said. I'd also say that same-store sales percentages and organic business growth has generally been quite strong which I think is good to see, that gives us insights with respect to the future. Reporting growth sales have been impacted by three factors; we talked last quarter about exiting some large volume low margin customers, that's been muting sales volumes and that has been dissipating and it's getting behind us, and certainly will be behind us as we get into the end of the third quarter; and so we're starting to see sales volume starting to grow. We are experiencing some margin compression in Europe because of interchange caps that were put into place late 2015, and that has continued to impact our year-over-year sort of growth rates and will continue to do impact at least through the third quarter if that will start to dissipate in the fourth quarter and then really be behind us as we get into 2018. And then the impact of exiting the two joint ventures will have an impact on merchant acquiring, really for the next several quarters as we think about the year. To kind of give us some, maybe specifics; when we look at the third quarter, we do expect the year-over-year growth rate for the third quarter to be essentially flat and that's essentially what we said. As I look into the fourth quarter, I do expect the fourth quarter year-over-year growth rate to be similar to what we saw in the second quarter of this current quarter. And then as we continue to see organic growth that we are experiencing, you know that will start to benefit us as we go into 2018. Unidentified Analyst : Great. And are you able to disclose which JVs are not at this time? Terry Dolan : Yes. I mean the one joint venture is related to our joint venture in Spain with Santander. And you know really, they've had changing priorities with respect to what they want to focus on; and as we think about Spain, it continues to be an area that has some economic challenges. So from our standpoint we really do believe that we have the opportunity to continue to grow in that market on our own with a focus on the right customers and I'd be very clear we're not exiting the market. With respect to the second joint venture, that is the joint venture with KeyCorp [ph], so we thought key merchant services; and in that situation our partner really wanted to focus on a third-party servicing arrangements and we respect that decision on their particular part. And we also say that we're retaining the clients that we believe will create the best growth opportunity for us as we move into the future. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you, that was very detailed and I appreciate the answers. Operator : There are no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to you for closing remarks. Jen Thompson : Thank you for listening to this review of our second quarter results. Please contact us if you have any follow-up questions. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to U.S. Bancorp's Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. Following a review of the results by Andy Cecere, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Dolan, U.S. Bancorp's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon, Eastern Daylight Time, through Wednesday, October 25 at 12 midnight Eastern Daylight Time. I will now turn the conference over to Jen Thompson of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. Jen Thompson : Thank you, Melissa and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Andy Cecere, Terry Dolan and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's third quarter results and to answer your questions. Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Andy. Andy Cecere : Thanks Jen. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call. Terry and I will discuss third quarter results and provide you with some forward-looking guidance, after that, we'll take your questions. I'll start in Slide 3 of the presentation. Third quarter net income totaled $1.6 billion or $0.88 per diluted share. Our performance was highlighted by record revenue in net income and earnings per share and our return on tangible common equity was 18%. Slide 4 highlights our key profitability metrics, each of which improved on both the linked quarter and year-over-year basis. The return on average assets for the third quarter was 1.38% and return on common equity was 13.6%. You can see on the far right of the chart that our efficiency ratio improved to 54.3%. On our second quarter earnings call, I told you that we will deliver positive operating leverage in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis and we did.  Our revenue growth remained strong in the third quarter while our year-over-year expense growth dropped to 3.7% which is a significant improvement compared with the year-over-year growth rate we've experienced over the past several quarters. The above normal expense growth rate over that timeframe was primarily tied to expenses incurred to address the AML consent order. The people and processes needed to address these issues are substantially in place. And these costs have beginning to normalize towards the company's overall expense growth rate. We've reached in inflection point and we expect to deliver positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter and in 2018.  I want to emphasize, however, that we'll continue to make prudent investment in our business to world that is changing at a faster pace never before. We are embracing the new reality of constant change and evolving customer behavior. Our ability to leverage technology and innovation to drive growth and improve efficiency will be fundamental component of our success. While the banking environment continues to evolve, our balance sheet is strong and growing. Credit quality is stable, we are winning market share in our businesses and we are delivering positive operating leverage. In summary, we are well positioned heading into the end of the year and looking ahead to 2018. Terry will now provide some details on the quarter. Terry Dolan : Thank you, Andy. If you turn to Slide 5, I'll start with the balancing review and follow-up with the discussion of third quarter earnings trends. Average loans increased by 0.8% on a linked quarter basis and grew 3.0% from a year ago. Commercial loan grew 1.0% sequentially. While we continue to gain market share across our commercial lending businesses, some large corporate customers took advantage of a mid quarter decline in interest rate to secure low, long term funding. This preference for bond issuance benefited our capital market business and continues to impact total loan growth. The decline in commercial real estate loans reflects our prudent outlook for commercial real estate lending at this time and pay down activities as customers refinance to extend maturities at relatively low interest rate.  Retail loan growth of 2.6% was supported by robust growth in installment loans and retail leasing. Strong growth in retail leasing reflects customer preference shifts toward lease financing as well as market share gains with dealers and manufactures.  Turning to Slide 6, average total deposits increased 1.2% on a linked quarter basis and 5.2% year-over-year. We saw 0.9% decline in noninterest bearing deposits partly reflect the normal third quarter seasonality in our trust business, as well as investment managers deploying trust cash balances into other asset categories. Our total interest bearing deposit beta is similar to previous quarters and in line with our expectation. As future rate hikes occur, we would have expected the beta will gradually trend toward a 50% level.  On Slide 7, you can see the credit quality was relatively stable in the quarter, net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans were 47 basis points in the third quarter and non-performing assets declined by 7.3% on a linked quarter basis. Our $360 million provision expense reflects normal provisioning related to loan growth, as well as potential credit losses for markets affected by the two recent hurricanes which occurred in the third quarter. After an assessment of credit exposures within the impacted areas, we do not expect any impact to the provision for credit losses in future quarters.  I'll now move to earnings results. Slide 8 provides highlights of third quarter results versus comparable periods. Record third quarter net income of $1.6 billion was up 4.2% compared with the second quarter and up 4.1% versus the third quarter of 2016. Revenue totaled a record $5.6 billion, up 2.2% on a linked quarter basis and 4.1% higher compared with the same quarter a year ago. On Slide 9, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $3.2 billion in the third quarter, up 3.8% linked and 8.3% year-over-year. Comparisons in both quarters benefited from earning asset growth and higher interest rates. In the third quarter, the net interest margin increased six basis points to 3.10% slightly higher than our guidance. The third quarter margin benefited from higher than expected interest recoveries that contributed approximately two basis points on linked quarter basis.  Slide 10 highlights trends in noninterest income which increased by 0.1% on a linked quarter basis and was down 0.9% year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, credit and debit card revenue increased 3.0% on higher sales volumes. Credit and debit card revenue growth was muted somewhat by fewer processes and cycles in the third quarter of 2017, compared with a year ago and year-over-year impact of previously acquired portfolio. Trust and asset management revenue grew 5.0% reflecting strong core business growth and favorable market conditions. Lower mortgage revenue primarily reflects a lower refinancing activity from a year ago. Merchant processing revenue was down 1.7% on year-over-year. As we previously discussed our recent exit of two joint ventures negatively affected the linked and year-over-year comparison. In addition, the recent hurricane conditions adversely impacted sales volume and related revenue in the third quarter. Excluding the impact of the weather conditions during the third quarter, merchant processing revenue was essentially flat from a year ago as expected.  Turning to Slide 11, noninterest expense increase to 0.5% compared with the second quarter of 2017, and was up 3.7% versus the third quarter of 2016. On a year-over-year basis, higher personnel costs were partially offset by lower legal professional expenses and marketing expenses. Slide 12 highlights our capital position. At September 30, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as if fully implemented was 9.4%. This compares to our capital target of 8.5%. I will now provide some forward-looking guidance for the fourth quarter. We expect linked quarter total average loan to grow at pace similar to the third growth rate. We expect that net interest margin to be essentially flat to the third quarter which included two basis points related to unusually high interest recoveries for this period in the business cycle. With respect to fee revenue, the third quarter is seasonally our highest quarter for growth. We expect fee revenue to be essentially flat on a linked quarter basis and on a year-over-year basis.  As Andy discussed, we will deliver positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter and in 2018, supported by expense growth in the 3% to 5% range. As a reminder, linked quarter expense growth in the fourth quarter is seasonally impacted by the timing of professional services and higher tax credit amortization expense. We expect credit quality to remain stable.  I'll hand it back to Andy for closing comments. Andy Cecere : Thanks Terry. This company has a history that is remarkable for its consistent high performance. But we are always looking for ways to improve. This is the time to look ahead and I am very optimistic about the future .At its core banking is a relatively simple business. As with anything execution will be the differentiator. The winners in this industry would be those banks that anticipate customer preferences and deliver the product and services they demand in a most convenient and efficient manner. Towards that end, every single leader in this company is focused on two mandates. First, deliver on the promise of one US Bank by putting the customer at the center of every discussion and every decision regardless which door their customer walk through. Second, figure out how to optimize everything we do whether it's optimizing the customer experience, the distribution model or the customer relationship. Figure out the most efficient and most valued way to deliver the highest quality product and services and then do it. If we execute effectively, which I'm confident we'll, results not only the industry leading but improving returns. And we will deliver those results within the parameters of a risk management framework that considers both the current and future environment.  I am looking forward to leading this company to the next phase of its evolution. Supported what I truly believe is the best team in the banking industry. That concludes our formal remarks. Terry, Bill and I will now be happy to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. I was wondering if you could just talk a bit about the deposit pricing strategy both on the interest bearing side and the noninterest deposits were down a little bit linked quarter on average basis, little bit more on a trade end basis. And just comments in terms of what type of migration that you are seeing out of the noninterest bearing into other buckets? Terry Dolan : Now so this is Terry, Matt. Let me talk a little bit about the deposit balances first. When you end up working at core deposit balances we really saw a little change relatively stable. Where the decreases did occur principally in a couple of different areas about $900 million it is really seasonal decreases that we always see for the second and the third quarter that's really tied to kind of our corporate trust business. Then we also saw some balances that went out simply because of custodial type of activities so those tend to be a little bit -- they fluctuate a little bit. Our time deposits were up a little and that was principally because of some decisions related to large customers. We expect that to be relatively short term and for those to flow out early in the fourth quarter. So but when you end up looking at the core deposit balances, they were reasonably stable during the quarter. The deposit pricing standpoint, let me just kind of talk about it, we haven't seen a lot of change relatively what we've been experienced in the past. We end up looking at retail deposit pricing or deposit beta they are essentially unchanged at this particular point in time and we don't see a lot of competitive pressure with respect to that. Our wholesale deposit pricing, we are essentially just being responsive to competitive pricing in the marketplace and that can be in certain markets a little bit on the West Coast and little bit in the New York area but not a lot of widespread competitive pressure that we are seeing. But those rates on the wholesale side are starting to go up. I'd also say if you end up looking at our corporate trust and deposits, those tend to be highly operational and fairly stable as well. So and keep that in mind too. Andy Cecere : And Terry you focused on average deposit being core relatively stable because any day period end could be very volatile given the trust. Terry Dolan : Exactly, yes. Operator : Your next question is from Scott Siefers from Sandler O'Neill & Partners. Scott Siefers : Good morning, guys. Terry you had just sort of given the outlook for sort of flattish fees as you see them in the fourth quarter and then I guess year-over-year as well. Just as you see what are sort of the major nuisances in that guidance? In other words what are the puts and takes? And as you think about just the payments business in particular, appreciate the comment on both the JV exit and the hurricane activity but just how you are thinking about progression in those businesses? Terry Dolan : Sure. Yes, when you end up looking at fee income it's typically seasonally flat to down in the fourth quarter. And that comes from a variety of different categories. Mortgage banking, from a market standpoint is a typically seasonally and little bit lower in the fourth quarter. Our payments businesses are typically a little seasonally down especially in the corporate payments space. So there are a number of kinds of categories that tend to be flat to down. Our commercial product revenue is typically flat to down a little bit as well because capital market activities tend to slow a little bit in the fourth quarter. So there are a number of different areas where you see that seasonal impact taking place. Let me tell you -- let me talk a little bit which is kind of your second question on the payments revenue. And you kind of keep in mind that we have really three businesses that are part to that. First is the credit card and debit card business and year-over-year the growth is about 3.0%. That was impacted by fewer processing days, and that's something that's unique to US bank because it's based upon how we best process those sales transaction in any one quarter and the third quarter happened to have one fewer processing cycle if you will. Sales on a reported basis, on a credit card perspective were up about 5.1%, without that processing cycle would have been about 6%. So that's pretty consistent with what we've seen in the past. That 3.0% is probably impacted by about one percentage point because of that processing day. When you think about the fourth quarter, we would have expected that credit card revenue to rebound a little bit because of that processing cycle that I talked about. And when we think about that particular business we can think about kind of mid single digit in terms of revenue growth on a year-over-year basis. Second category is really merchant acquiring and last quarter we talked about the fact that we exited the joint ventures. And we expected revenue to be essentially flat. And when we look at the impact of the joint ventures, that about 2% to 2.5% but the other thing that happened in the quarter as you know as we had three hurricanes and earthquake in Mexico and a variety of different things like that that end up impacting revenue growth by about 1.5%. As we think about fourth quarter, the impact of the hurricanes is going to continue. We still have a significant number of merchant that are either offline or have relatively slow sales as they continue to kind of come online. And so when we think about the fourth quarter we really think that merchant acquired revenue is probably going to be flat year-over-year. And then last business is our CPS business and we had a great quarter in CPS. If you end up looking at the total revenue within CPS it was up about 5% -- little over 5%, 5.8% on a year-over-year basis. Then you know we've been investing in a business pretty significantly, we talked about virtual pay in and some other things but we were investing in a couple of years ago. And we are starting to see some really nice dividend and momentum in that particular business. And when we look on a year-over-year basis we would expect to see continued growth and strength in that particular area but on a sequential basis or a linked quarter basis, it typically is a lower quarter in the fourth quarter. Operator : Your next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. I just wanted to follow up on Scott's line of questioning. I completely appreciate that's probably too early to give outlook on the puts and takes behind the commitment deposit operating leverage for 2018. But I am wondering similarly how you walk through in the fourth quarter. Could you give us a sense of the big trend that you are seeing over the next 12 months that could drive fee growth next year? And I am wondering that because clearly you outlined the seasonality in the fourth quarter but also the fees are expected to be flat year-over-year. So just the big trend would be great. Terry Dolan : Yes. At a very high level, again this is Terry. I think one of the biggest drags that we had this year was really related to mortgage banking revenue and so when we look into 2018, we see that has been relatively stable or starting to grow from there. And that was one of the biggest factors. And then within the merchant acquiring I think is probably the other major area that we'll continue to see strengthening in terms of the year-over-year growth rate because as those joint ventures kind of lapse in the second quarter of next year, some of the hurricane effects and some of the investments we've been making in that business, we should continue to see strength. Andy you want to add anything else here? Andy Cecere : The only thing I would add to your question Erika is that on the expense side the equation as we mentioned in our prepared comments, I think we've reached an inflection point in terms of their higher growth rate that we've seen in the past. What you saw this quarter is more consistent with that 3% to 5% that we talked about. So balance sheet growth together with the income growth that Terry articulated and more normalized expense growth will give us that positive operating leverage. Erika Najarian : Thank you. And just a follow up to that. There has been a wide swing in terms of expectations for rate from just early in September to now. And I am wondering Andy you seemed very committed to the expense side of the efficiency ratio equation, if the revenue outlook for next year is not as robust as we think because of whatever the rate outlook is, is there enough flex in the expense base and that you could continue to make the investments that you referred to in prepared remarks but still deliver the positive operating leverage. Andy Cecere : So, Erika we are projecting what the market has in terms of rate increases both in December and then for next year. And that's set of assumptions that we are using to talk about and discuss positive operating leverage. To the extent that doesn't happen, we'll continue to manage expenses as best as we can like we always have and making sure we have the balance for the short-term result as well as the long-term investment in the businesses to make sure we can have growth going forward. So that's something we've always done and we'll continue to do. Operator : Your next question is from John Pancari with Evercore. John Pancari : Good morning. On the loan growth side, I know you mentioned that the growth in the fourth quarter in average loan should be similar to that what you saw in the third quarter. So then about less than 1% so we are annualizing to about 4% or so. Is that a long, a fair assessment of where growth should really be trending even into 2018 and what could bring about strengthening outside of any -- as they are all macro factors that you need to see to really see pickup there in that growth rate. Thanks. Andy Cecere : John I'll start and then ask Bill to add some more color. So first of all it is lower than what we would expected over the long term and what we are seeing with our customers are couple of things. Number one is Terry mentioned taking advantage of lower yield curve and low rates, the lock in either to dead issuance and sometimes pay down bank lending activity is impacting us. So that's one. Second is much of the growth that we are seeing is M&A related and that I would call core CapEx and expansion. And I think that's a little bit of function of waiting for more clarity and certainty around principally tax policy and tax rates. And I think that will be a key driver of accelerated loan growth in 2018 when there is more clarity around tax policy. We also have some nuisances within category so let me ask Bill to talk about. Bill Parker : Yes. The factor that Andy cited are macro factors right, low rate or the refinancing was certainly affects number of our C&I and commercial real estate. And then uncertainty holding back some of the natural activity, investment activity that our customers will make. So those are probably the two biggest drivers. That being said, we continued to be very aggressive in terms of our market share amongst prime customer base which is our customer base on across all the retail categories. So you could see we did grow our home equity loans that somewhat unique we never backed off from that. Credit cards, we've been growing those throughout the down turn in the cycle so we had steady growth in that. Auto loan, same thing, I mean we are in the super prime space there. Retail leasing, we never exited that, we stayed in that and we benefited from that lately. So we do have levers in the prime space that continues to give us loan growth regardless of what's going on a macro basis. Andy Cecere : And I'd also mention that John our revolvers, utilization rate on a commercial revolvers are still right around 24% -25% that's about 10 points below what I would say is normal. So we are still growing commitment. We are taking market share but the utilization continues to be at low level. John Pancari : All right. Thank you, Andy. And then separately on the credit side, I just want a little bit color on the consumer credit trends you are seeing, your card and auto charge offs and delinquency were up in a quarter and how much that is storm related versus not? Thanks. Bill Parker : Well, none of it is storm related now. That's too early for that. We did put in programs for reaching out to customers, providing loan application; we've already started that process. So that's well underway. But the reserve build that was mentioned that's really for what we expect to be kind of future credit losses as a result of the storm but that has not shown up. I think the increase that you are referring to in auto and cards, it's really just the seasoning effect, the fact that those portfolios have grown fairly significantly over the past several years. This is natural seasoning so they are performing within our expectations. Andy Cecere : And again Bill they are -- they are prime portfolios, their average cycle on the leasing side 770 so nothing is going down stream in terms of that credit. John Pancari : Got it. So nothing underlying in terms of deterioration starting -- okay, got it, thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. I just wanted to dig a little bit on the comments you made in the presentation on the AML BSA. It sounds like it's coming to close in your compliance program are nearing maturity I think were the words you used. Could you just give us a sense as to is that going to accelerate over the next few quarters and so we should see pull back in the expense side there? Andy Cecere : So as we've talked about before that the story and that has not changed. Betsy, the people processes and technology what we -- pretty much in place by the end of the year. They are almost on a place, we have a few more technology releases but that part of the spend, which is the bulk of it that will be in place by the end of the year. And then we'll see the compliance related expenses migrate more towards what I'd call a normal expense rate. I don't expect them to go down because we have to continue to maintain the levels we have but I'd expect them to normalize and that will normalize our overall expense growth rate back to that 3% to 5% like you saw this first quarter. With regard to the consent order overall, once those people processes and technology component have in place we go into a sustainability mode which is proving the back that they are working as intended and that will start beginning of 2018 and flow into what I would expect the middle of 2018. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then once you get the green light from regulators you passed the test, there is an opportunity to reengage in M&A. Could you just give us a sense as to how important that it is for you over the next kind of planning cycle here or is that one of the cores that you are looking into or is that just gravy or something comes up? Andy Cecere : Betsy, our M&A activity hasn't really been impacted by this. There hasn't been traditional bank deal that we not been able to do that we wanted to do because of the consent order. Our M&A has been focused on categories like card portfolios, payments businesses as well as trust and fund services. Both that deals that we've been able to do, we continue to look at and I'd expect that our emphasis and focus going forward would continue to be on those deals. If after a consent order exit we see an opportunity on our traditional banking, yes, we will take a look at it but it have to be meeting our criteria which is increasing our market share in our current states having the core customer capabilities that we are looking for and so forth. But it's not causing a significant disadvantage today. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then just separately, the OCC changed their guidance on deposit advance product right, not allowed before now they are allowed again. Is that something that you would look at? Andy Cecere : So Betsy we are looking at a number of different products in that category and that maybe something we pursue over the next few quarters over the next year. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then just lastly on the online lending, you have kicked off a couple of new relationships and product recently. Could you give us a sense partnership, could you give us a sense as to how these are progressing and what your expectations are from those relationships? Andy Cecere : Yes. So I think one that's doing very well is our mortgage partnership with Blend which is online application tool, mobile application tool which is doing terrifically. It is exceeding our expectations, it's very well in terms of highly thought of and functioning as expected both from the perspective of a customer but importantly also the mortgage originator. So it is a real positive because they are able to do some of the simple things in a more digital format and really add value to the customers in terms of consultation. So that has been very successful and we expect to continue to grow that into 2018. Betsy Graseck : Okay, all right. And then just last on the deposit advanced product. That was like 2 percent-ish of your fee I think when you had to wind that business down. So is it your expectation at this stage that you could over time build that type of level of revenue back into your business model getting back into that type of space? Andy Cecere : Likely not, Betsy. If it comes back it would probably be at a different fee level and probably not with the same size as what we saw historically. And again there is not much certainty that it will come back right. Operator : Your next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning, guys. I just wanted to come back to the NII side of equation and think about the balance sheet mix. So you are seeing as you mentioned all these ins and outs and out of flows and some might be temporary, some might be kind of this natural mixing and relate to the beta. But just wondering how did you think about just overall size of the balance sheet from here? I think we've seen a bit of slowing in AEA progression and given that loans are slower, how do you think that loans versus deposit growth is going to look for the fourth quarter and then beyond? Andy Cecere : Yes. When we've talked a little bit about what we think loan growth is going to end up looking like in kind of what those categories are. Obviously from a balance sheet standpoint growth in loans is going to be really demand driven as much as anything. From a deposit perspective, I mean we are always looking for good core deposits and so when we have the opportunity to grow good core deposits they are going to be long term stable, we will take that opportunity to be able to do that. But I think what you are going to see really from here for a period of time is just some fluctuation with respect to deposit balances. Ken Usdin : Okay. And will that mean will you be willing to -- the cost of your short term borrowing has actually started to increase a lot too. I would assume that's more market based type of funding. And so does that mean that we see a mix more towards that wholesale if there is more fluctuations in deposits and how that is kind of weigh on the forward outlook for the margin past the fourth quarter. Andy Cecere : Yes. I don't think that you are going to see a significant shift in how we end up funding the balance sheet. I mean what ends up happening from a short term standpoint is just what sort of cash level needs, you need in order to have in place in order to meet liquidity requirement either on an average basis or the end of the month and so that's probably what you are seeing more than anything. Operator : Your next question is from Saul Martinez with UBS. Saul Martinez : Hi, good morning. I have couple of questions on taxes. Any updated thoughts on your expectations for your tax rate assuming no changes in quarter in terms of corporate tax rate? And I think last quarter you said FTA adjusted 29%. And secondly on tax reform I think in the past you guys have indicated you feel like you can get something along the lines of 60% of the benefit. Obviously the devil is going to be in the details and there is lack of detail out there. But the blueprint did specifically seem to protect low income housing credit. So curious if there is any updated thoughts in terms of how you see yourself benefiting from tax reform and how much of that you feel like you can garner from any reduction in the corporate tax rate? Andy Cecere : Yes. Well, so I'll take the first question which is really how we think about the fourth quarter. I think the tax rate in the fourth quarter would be pretty similar to what the third quarter was. So that's kind of our expectation. In terms of tax reform, I don't think our view has really changed in terms of what the impact of that might be on the company kind of going forward. But to be quite honest, we were in Washington here recently and what's going to ultimately be in the tax reform bill, there are still moving around a lot even though that there are some framework associated with it. So we are kind of in a wait and see mode in all honesty. Bill Parker : About 29% in the fourth quarter. Andy Cecere : 29% in the fourth quarter. Saul Martinez : Got it, that's fair. And then just finally on Elavon? Was there any FX impact? I didn't see that in the release. Andy Cecere : Yes. The impact of FX was very insignificant in the third quarter. Operator : Your next question is from Brian Foran with Autonomous. Brian Foran : Hi, good morning. Just think about the payment business longer term. And I assume merchant processing is the biggest piece of that but really all four line items that we see on the face of the P&L. There has been department of percent issue, there was some FX headwinds, now there is the JVs so I appreciate there has been lots of puts and takes but what do you think it take kind of takes for those line items to show little bit more momentum and get back to the normal more significant growth rate that maybe they enjoyed in the past. Andy Cecere : Yes. Well, I think that maybe when you end up looking at the merchant acquiring business, we think on a longer term basis as kind of a mid single digits are a little bit stronger than that. One other things we are seeing or seen stronger sales volumes in their business and I think what we've to do is we have to get beyond the impact of the joint venture as well, some of the hurricane effect. And from a hurricane standpoint as an example, we've now -- we face four hurricanes and earthquake and some wildfire so I think there is a few things that we are going to end up having kind of work through over the next quarter or two. The hurricane effect in Puerto Rico where we have a fairly significant amount of merchants who is going to be there for several quarters. So I really look at it in terms of timing probably mid next year before we get back to that normalized sort of growth level because we'll lap those joint ventures. And I'd also add Brian and we talk about investment and innovation, this is an area we've been focused on historically and we continued to be going forward. I remind you we have a couple of great platforms, our international platform, our dynamic currency conversation capabilities because we invest in the business and merchant processes an area we continue to focused on particularly as it relates to e-commerce and value added services principally around data so it will continue to be an emphasis and an area of focus for us in terms of investment and capabilities. Brian Foran : And then maybe just turn into the auto leasing business. Totally appreciate your comments that are all prime and partly driven by customer preferences. But maybe you could just talk about -- I mean the growth rates have been very high. One, are there specific strategy that are in place to gain more shares with dealers or geographic expansion or anything like that? And then two, you gave some helpful commentary, I believe it was back in April kind of citing some of the green shoots in used car pricing so as you roll forward today, are you still seeing the kind of stabilization and even recovery in used car pricing? And is this growth you are pursuing in auto leasing kind of you are saying that you think the market is overdone and how does it feed into the overall used car price outlook? Bill Parker : So this is Bill. No, we are still bullish on our retail leasing portfolio. So it has been a good business or remains a good business. Used car prices have actually picked up even more in part because of the hurricane that increased demand for pickup et cetera. So in terms of expansion, we do go after different manufactures and we are very competitive in that space, provide an alternative to some of the old captives. So it's an area that we continue to work very hard to keep the growth rates up. Operator : Your next question is from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi. You mentioned commercial real estate a little bit more caution, it's big chunk of loans at your company. So I guess is commercial real estate a friend or foe on the one hand or maybe you can make a case for home prices back above pre crisis levels and homebuilders or some others could do well. On the other hand you have retailers and a more competitive environment. Where do you come out on that? Bill Parker : So commercial real estate is a friend. We are -- I think we've always been in active in that space. We did not cut back or exit our construction lending after the downturn, that's grown nicely. We've continued -- we are very active in this space but with the low rates and lot of our customers are appropriately seeking long term fixed rate for financing something banks are not great at offering. There are better sources for that in insurance company, some of the smaller banks, CMBS market but we are -- we remain very active with our client base. Some of our client base is gotten a little more cautious as well. Lot of the growth has been in multifamily, so people are little more cautious in that space, that's just for our client. Residential mortgage, construction we have been very active in that. And we never pulled out of that, they extended into Texas, and we had really nice growth in the Texas market. That's obviously going to be little disruptive by what happened with the hurricanes but that will come back. So overall we are very active commercial real estate lender and we like the business. Mike Mayo : So just one follow up. So one -- if you look at over the past couple of decades where are we in terms of being aggressive being conservative. When you look at your own experience, is this, 2010 is great and 5 is average and 1 is look out that's 1992, where do you think we are in the CRE cycle? Bill Parker : I don't really think of it that way because we stick with our underwriting criteria so we are consistent throughout the cycle. And different asset classes or a different spaces you mentioned kind of concerns with the retails. Well, that's been good for the industrial side. So we've seen nice growth in industrial activity. So there is balance of activity that we provide our customer base and its ebbs and flows, but it's a business we stick with. Operator : Your next question is from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Marty Mosby : Thanks. Good morning. When you look at your owned portfolio, residential mortgage is now the second largest category and it's continuing to grow. When you look at the mortgage banking business, I am kind of looking at it in the sense there has been a shift from originate and sell and to originate and portfolio of loans because we just don't enough total loan growth in the market. So we are not squeezing out those loans like we used to. Is that a rational way to think about it? And if so is mortgage banking which is kind of business that you kind of continue to grow is going to pretty more fee income from that maybe just not going to get back on track from a fee income side but we have a heavier kind of contribution in net interest income. Andy Cecere : Marty, I'd say it's balanced and we both originate a sell which are the qualified market just that we've always done and that continuous to be area for growth for us as well as the servicing component. And we portfolio those which are not typically jumbos in our core customer base. So I would expect growth in both categories and I wouldn't expect the major shift one way or the other. Bill, would you add anything to that? Bill Parker : No. I mean the portfolio activities that are a national platform along with qualified mortgages so we originate through retail channels and through from broker so we will continue to see portfolio growth in the jumbo category. And if you can look at the stack, extremely high quality and low loan to value so --. Marty Mosby : Bill I think I was going to ask you about was seemed to be two things that kind of took a little bit of the earnings out this quarter in the $30 million build with net charge -offs going down and non-performers going down, you kind of handed that was hurricane related but want to make sure that because that's not what you have been doing in the past. So that big portion of that was related to hurricane and the expected losses going forward and then also the tax rate, the 29% this quarter and then foreshadowing that to next quarter, that's about 0.5% higher than what you have been. So just I was curious why the step up in the tax rate and the build and allowance for those two things. Bill Parker : Yes, this is Bill. I'll do the build and allowance, that was entirely related to the hurricanes. We had some modest -- we've been doing some very modest build related to loan growth. We will continue to do that but the loan bump up was definitely directly related to the hurricane. Andy Cecere : And our expectations that is -- Bill Parker : That is sufficient to cover Andy Cecere : Sufficient and including what we know thus far in the wildfire situation in California. Terry Dolan : And the tax rate, really the issue there is that again kind of comes back to tax reforms and some of the uncertainty there. When you had a lot of conversations around tax credit low income, renewal energy and all sorts of things. There is a lot of pull back within the market and lot of change in related to pricing associated with tax credit. So part of the reasons why you are seeing the rate going up is a little bit lower level of tax credit production which is market driven as much as anything and then as earnings get stronger you had just have the marginal effect on the tax rate and that will cause it to go up as well. Operator : And your next question is from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Kevin Barker : Hi, good morning. In regards to your credit, obviously it's been very good over last several years and running well below your long term target and what you think the normalized charges- off would be. And we start to see somewhat of an inflection point here in credit card losses moving higher after several years of being strong or even better than what we've seen in past cycles. When we look over into 2018 and maybe even to 2019, what are your expectations for where credit card losses are going and where charge -offs may actually end up given we are still at pretty good part of the cycle. Bill Parker : So they have gone up due to seasoning, due to sort of natural seasoning and growing the portfolio. But we do expect them to stabilize around the 4% rate that would be sort of normal -- that's not through the cycle rate but that's sort of normal rate during stable economic conditions. Andy Cecere : Current environment 4%. Bill Parker : Yes. Kevin Barker : And when you think about the outlook is it something where it grows to 4% in plateaus or is it something where you would incrementally continue to see move higher? Bill Parker : No. We will think it will plateau around the 4% in this kind of economic condition. Kevin Barker : Okay. And then given the outlook on auto, we've obviously seen pressure on used car prices in here and to follow up on some of the John's questions, delinquency rates and frequency of the fall to start to slow across the industry, do you expect charge-offs rates decline in 2018 given some of the positive development we've seen with a little bit resiliency in used car prices and slight decline in frequency? Bill Parker : I would say -- I wouldn't necessary say decline but I think they are pretty stable right now. So I would say about where they are right now. Operator : Your next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning. Hi, Andy, how are you? Terry, if I heard you correctly on the earlier part of the call talking about the net interest margin, I think you said you had some maybe couple of basis points improvement due to the recoveries on some bad credits. Could you make sure that's correct that it was a basis point or two? And was that in the energy sector that you had to recover in the credits? Terry Dolan : Yes. So it was two basis points impact from interest recoveries that occurred in this quarter and actually these recoveries relate to loans that were probably charged up as many as 10 years ago. So they went back long ways which is in part why they were so unexpected and unusual. And it's not something that we would expect to repeat. But it was about two basis points for the quarter. So you think we went up six basis points and our core basis of this four and we are really expecting the core basis go up another two in the fourth quarter from there. But it will be flat because of the interest recoveries. Gerard Cassidy : Good. Okay and thank you for the clarity. And then second, you guys talked about how the betas for the traditional consumer deposits really are not that high, but you did see some in the commercial area. What about within the Wealth Management segment? Some of the other banks that have reported have pointed out that the betas are rising and that part of their business. Did you guys see any of that in the Wealth Management business? Terry Dolan : Yes. In the wealth management business we've not seen that yet although when we end up looking at the broader consumer sort of category that's the one area that we may start to see when we get into the next rate hike. But we haven't seen anything at this point. Gerard Cassidy : Okay, good. And then with rising rates, obviously, some of your commercial customers will pay for the services you guys give them with compensating balances, and the credit they receive is reflective of the rate environment. Are you starting to raise those credits for them in a rising rate environment or not yet? Terry Dolan : Yes. A little bit relative to what's going on with short term rate as well as the yield curve overall but I don't -- it's not material yet and we would expect to continue raise and as rates move up. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. And does that show up in the treasury management fee line? I noticed it was down little bit sequentially. I don't know if that was more seasonal or not. But is that the way where we would see that? Terry Dolan : Yes. Compensating balances show up there and the credit for compensating balances as you said but the decline was more seasonal in nature. Operator : Next question is from Terry McEvoy with Stephens. Terry McEvoy : Hi, good morning. It was mentioned earlier that US bank is gaining share in the commercial lending business and it sounds like that will likely continue here in the fourth quarter. Could you expand on specifically what's behind those gains? Is it some targeted industries or some specific markets that standout? Terry Dolan : Yes. This is Terry. Just kind of broadly we are seeing good growth in market share and loans in the middle market space across most of our markets. And we would continue to kind of expect to see although I would say recently we've seen some pay down occurring even in the middle market space so it's something that we are watching. Bill Parker : Yes. It really relates to the old products that we build out over the last several years in our national corporate strategy. So I think the capabilities in the capital market area for providing bond underwriting not only for our investment grade but also kind of middle market or non investment grade customers. So they can come to us and a more full service bank and that's providing a lot of fuel to the growth. Andy Cecere : And currently to that point Bill, the other area that I have to highlight is the virtual pay product which is corporate payment system product which is targeted squarely at that middle market customer base as well above that but that one is one of the drivers of the growth that we are seeing is taking additional customers and using that product. Terry McEvoy : That's good to hear. And then Terry just a quick question for you, within the corporate lines or these equity investment gains that were up $46 million, I believe year-over-year, could you just talk about the nature of those gains and what type of typical run rate would you see in any given quarter? Terry Dolan : Yes. We typically don't get into a lot of detail with respect to other incomes simply because there is a lot of different things and including the equity investments. Equity investments tend to be a little bit choppy from quarter-to-quarter so it's really I kind of stay away from giving guidance with respect to what I think they're going to be next quarter et cetera. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for Q&A. I'll now turn the call over to the presenters for closing remarks. Jen Thompson : Thank you for listening to our call this morning. Please call us if you have any follow up comments or questions. Andy Cecere : Thanks everyone. Terry Dolan : Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Following a review of the results by Andy Cecere, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Terry Dolan, U.S. Bancorp\u2019s Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star, one on your touchtone phone, and press the pound key to withdraw. This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon Eastern time through Wednesday, January 24 at 12 :00 midnight Eastern time. I will now turn the conference call over to Jenn Thompson of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. Jennifer Thompson : Thank you, Jamie, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Andy Cecere, Terry Dolan, and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp\u2019s fourth quarter results and to answer your questions. Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today\u2019s call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today\u2019s presentation, in our press release, and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Andy. Andrew Cecere : Thanks Jenn, and good morning everyone, and thank you for joining our call. We have a lot to talk about this morning, and as usual we\u2019ll take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks. I\u2019ll start with Slide 3. In the fourth quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.97, which included several notable items amounting to $0.09 per share. Let me take a minute to talk about these notable items. The tax reform legislation that was passed a few weeks ago is a very positive development that will provide immediate and ongoing benefit to our employees, customers, communities and our shareholders as we invest a portion of our tax savings in each of these important constituencies. As a result of the signing of the legislation, the company recognized a one-time fourth quarter benefit related to the revaluation of our tax-related assets and liabilities of $910 million. In connection with this event, we took the opportunity to make $150 million contribution to our charitable foundation and we accrued $67 million for a special one-time bonus to certain eligible employees. The impact of these two items was approximately $152 million net of tax. We also recognized an accrual of $608 million for costs associated with legal and regulatory matters and an investigation discussed in previous filings related to our legacy bank secrecy, anti-money laundering compliance program, and a legacy banking relationship between U.S. Bank and a former customer\u2019s business. U.S. Bank has worked diligently over the past several years to improve and strengthen its AML controls, processes and staff, including increasing compliance staff and making significant investments in systems. U.S. Bank embraces the highest standards of integrity, risk management and compliance, and we remain committed to continually improving our controls and processes across the enterprise to protect all of our stakeholders. The 8-K we filed this morning provides additional information on this topic. Our earnings per share were $0.88, excluding the notable items. Slide 4 provides highlights of our results. Loan growth was in line with our expectation at 0.8%, credit quality was stable, and our book value increased by 6.9% from a year earlier. We returned 72% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Slide 5 highlights key performance metrics. Our performance, excluding notable items, in the fourth quarter was highlighted by a 13.4% return on average common equity, a 17% return on tangible common equity, and a 1.33% return on average assets. We delivered positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter and our efficiency ratio, excluding notable items, was 55.3%. Now let me turn the call over to Terry to provide more detail on the quarter as well as forward-looking guidance. Terrance Dolan : Thanks Andy, and good morning. If you turn to Slide 6, I\u2019ll start with a balance sheet review and follow up with a discussion of fourth quarter earnings trends. My remarks will be referencing results excluding the notable items. In the fourth quarter, average loans increased by 0.8% on a linked quarter basis and grew 2.6% from a year ago. Commercial loans increased 1.0% sequentially. We continued to gain market share across our commercial lending businesses. Commitment levels increased in the fourth quarter; however; line utilization rates continue at historical low levels and pay down activity remained elevated in the quarter as some borrowers tapped capital markets to fund long-term funding needs. Pay downs also continued to negatively impact our commercial real estate portfolio. We remain prudent in our lending activity in both our construction and commercial mortgage lines, continuing to forego loan opportunities that do not fit our return and risk appetite. Primarily as a result of the pay down activity and our prudent view in lending in commercial real estate in general at this time, average total commercial real estate loans declined by 1.5% in the fourth quarter, which contributed to a 40 basis point drag to our total average loan growth for the quarter. Retail loan growth of 1.9% was supported by strong growth in installment loans and retail leasing. During the quarter, credit card loans increased 1.4% sequentially, partly reflecting seasonality, and mortgage loans increased 1.0%. Turning to Slide 7, average total deposits increased 1.2% on a linked quarter basis and 3.0% year-over-year. Compared with the third quarter, non-interest bearing deposits increased slightly and saving deposits grew 1.4%, reflecting growth in consumer and business banking and wealth management and investment services. Our interest-bearing deposit betas continue to perform consistently with past experience. We expect the total interest bearing deposit beta following the most recent rate hike will end up between about 30 to 35%. As future rate hikes occur, we continue to expect our deposit beta will gradually trend toward a 50% level; however, the pace toward that level continues to be somewhat slower than we initially anticipated primarily due to lower than expected betas in our consumer deposits. On Slide 8, you can see that credit quality was relatively stable compared to the third quarter. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans declined one basis point on both a linked quarter basis and year-over-year. Non-performing assets declined by 4.0% on a linked quarter basis and were 25% lower than a year ago. I will now move onto earnings results. Slide 9 provides highlights of fourth quarter results versus comparable periods. Record fourth quarter net revenue of $5.6 billion was up 0.5% compared with the third quarter and up 3.7% versus the fourth quarter of 2016. On Slide 10, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $3.2 billion in the fourth quarter, up modestly compared with the third quarter and up 6.4% year over year. Linked quarter and year-over-year growth were both supported by growth in loans and higher loan yields. In the fourth quarter, the net interest margin decreased two basis points to 3.08% as expected. Excluding interest recoveries that contributed approximately two basis points to the third quarter margin, the net interest margin would have been unchanged. Slide 11 highlights trends in non-interest income, which increased by 0.8% on a linked quarter basis and 0.4% year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, corporate payments systems revenue grew 10.5% and credit and debit card revenue grew 5.4%, both driven by higher sales volumes. Trust and investment management fees increased 7.1% mainly due to favorable market conditions and net asset and account growth. Somewhat offsetting this strong fee performance was a 15.8% decrease in mortgage banking revenue driven by lower refinancing activity which impacted production margins for the industry, as well as slightly lower merchant revenue. In line with our previous guidance, merchant processing revenue declined 1% from a year earlier mainly due to the exiting of certain joint ventures in the second quarter of 2017 and the impact of weather events that occurred late in the third quarter of 2017. Turning to Slide 12, non-interest expense increased 2.5% compared with the third quarter of 2017. The increase in expenses was primarily due to seasonally higher costs related to investments in tax advantaged projects. On a year-over-year basis, expenses grew by 3.6%, reflecting higher compensation and employee benefits expense mainly related to hiring to support business growth and compliance programs. Regulatory and compliance expense growth has slowed in recent quarters and continues to moderate towards the company\u2019s overall expense rate. It\u2019s worth noting that in the fourth quarter, professional services expense decreased 27% versus a year ago, reflecting fewer consulting services as compliance programs near maturity. Slide 13 highlights our capital position. At December 31, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as if fully implemented was 9.1%. This compares to our capital target of 8.5%. I\u2019ll now provide some forward-looking guidance. Let me start with a discussion of how our earnings will be positively impacted by tax reform on a go-forward basis. Our effective rate in 2018 is expected to be approximately 16% for federal tax purposes plus 3 to 4% for state taxes, or approximately 9% in total. We expect our taxable equivalent to tax rates to decline to about 21.5%. This compares with our taxable equivalent tax rate, excluding notable items, of about 29.8% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Consistent with our capital management policies, we plan to reinvest approximately 25% of the tax benefit we expect to realize in business growth initiatives, including technology, innovation and business automation, as well as in our employees. Inclusive of these accelerated investments, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage for the full year of 2018. Now let me shift to first quarter 2018 guidance. We expect net interest income to increase at a mid-single digit pace on a year-over-year basis. Due to the impact of day count, we expect net interest income to be modestly lower on a linked quarter basis as is typically the case in the first quarter. We expect fee income to increase at a low single digit pace on a year-over-year basis. On a linked quarter basis, fee income is typically lower in the first quarter due to seasonally lower credit card and merchant processing sales volumes and seasonally lower deposit service charges. We expect expense growth on a year-over-year basis to be in the mid-single digit range. On a linked quarter basis, non-interest expense is typically seasonally higher in the first quarter due to higher compensation costs reflecting the timing of merit increases, employee benefits, employee incentive programs, and marketing activities. This is somewhat offset by seasonally lower tax credit amortization and professional service costs. We expect non-interest expense to increase slightly on a linked quarter basis. We expect credit quality to remain relatively stable compared to the fourth quarter. I\u2019ll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks. Andrew Cecere : Thanks Terry. We are now 10 years past what, in hindsight, was the beginning of a national crisis. By almost any account, the banking industry has re-emerged stronger, safer, and more nimble. Today the economy appears to be on firm footing. The regulatory environment is becoming more supportive of growth and tax reform will arguable promote job growth, consumer spending, and prolong the growth base of this business cycle. Against this backdrop, U.S. Bank is well positioned to win market share in our lending and fee businesses and deliver improving returns on equity while operating with the same risk discipline that has served us well through many credit environments. The delivery of predictable, industry-leading profitability and returns has been a constant over the years, but recently the pace of improvement in these metrics has been limited by headwinds we have faced, some within our control, some out of our control. However, there is reason to believe that these headwinds are starting to abate. First, expenses have been higher than we considered normalized primarily due to costs related to addressing our consent order with the OCC. However, the heavy lifting is completed and we expect compliance and regulatory costs to continue to revert towards our overall expense growth trajectory. Fee headwinds are starting to shift in our favor. Mortgage refinance activity, which has been a headwind for the industry, is declining at a diminishing pace, and home sales continue to strengthen. Strategic decisions and market challenges depressed our merchant processing in revenue in 2017; however, we remain confident that merchant processing revenue will return to a mid-single digit growth trajectory by the third quarter. While diminishing headwinds are beneficial, what we are most optimistic about is the potential for investments that we have previously made in our businesses, as well as investments we plan to make in the future, to increasingly manifest in the form of improving top line revenue growth and profitability. Our corporate payments services business is firing on all cylinders heading into 2018. For the first time in many years, both the commercial business sector, which is benefiting from higher T&E spend, and the government sector are showing good momentum. In our wealth management and investment services businesses, market share gains are being driven by new client growth. In our traditional banking businesses, we are up-tiering our clients in corporate bank and moving up the lead tables in our capital markets businesses. On the consumer side, investments over the past several years aimed at enhancing our auto relationships are driving strong market share growth. We are well positioned as one of the few remaining non-captive lessors in the industry and as one of the few financers to offer both a lending and leasing option to our dealers. It is clear that past investment spending is delivering the intended results, and we expect to reap those benefits for years to come. Now, because of tax reform, we have the opportunity to accelerate our investment spending. We will target additional technology and innovation spending on the initiatives aimed at enhancing the customer experience and leveraging our competitive positioning, with a particular focus on payments, digital and mobile banking, and B2B capabilities. Technology and innovation are core to our long-term strategy for growth, and we\u2019re excited about the opportunity to advance key initiatives that will support both top line revenue and improved operating efficiencies. To wrap up, I believe that 2018 will prove to be a very good year for U.S. Bank, and by that I mean for the entirety of what makes us U.S. Bank - our employees, our customers, our communities, and of course our shareholders. That concludes our formal remarks. Terry, Bill and I will now be happy to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open. Amanda Larsen : Hi, it\u2019s Amanda Larsen on for Ken. Andrew Cecere : Hi Amanda. Amanda Larsen : Did you all say that your effective tax rate is going to be 19%? Can you go over that again? Terrance Dolan : Yes, it was 19%. Amanda Larsen : Okay, great. Then the expense outlook, you noted that you\u2019re planning on reinvesting approximately 25% of the benefit, and you noted that there would be an expense growth rate in 1Q18 of mid single digits. Should we expect that for the full year \u201918, we\u2019re going to move to the mid-single digit range in lieu of that 3 to 5% you guys had previously discussed? Terrance Dolan : Yes. When we end up looking at expenses for the full year of 2018, because of the reinvestment that we plan on making, you would expect us to be in that mid-single digits and the high end of that range. Amanda Larsen : Okay, thanks. Then also, can you touch upon the growth outlook for \u201918, particularly in deposit service charges area and treasury management? A couple of your competitors have announced some changes - overdraft, making more customer friendly, and then on treasury management, just if you are moving that earnings credit rate yet. Thank you. Terrance Dolan : Yes, and thanks for the question. From a fee standpoint, so if you think about deposit service charges, we made a lot of those types of changes a while back, and so I wouldn\u2019t see us making any further changes with respect to our fee structure at this particular point in time. We have seen good growth with respect to deposit service charges, and that is really tied to both deposit balance and just growth in terms of consumer accounts. In terms of treasury management, treasury management has been a real success story for us this year. We\u2019ve seen good core growth in terms of client relationships throughout the year, and we would continue to expect that that will have a positive impact going into 2018. As deposit rates do rise, though, we would expect that we would be making some adjustment to the earnings credit rate, and that would dampen it a bit. Andrew Cecere : I\u2019d add, Terry, as we think about treasury management, we think about it in combination with corporate payments because they\u2019re really two parts of the same component, and corporate payments in particular has had a wonderful year - 11% growth, both on the government as well as the corporate side. Our virtual pay product is growing 22%, and as we think about the future, there\u2019s going to be that combination of thinking about treasury management together with corporate payments. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. John Pancari : Good morning. Andrew Cecere : Morning. John Pancari : On the merchant processing side, Andy, I know you indicated that you\u2019re confident you can get back to that mid-single digit growth rate by third quarter. What are you seeing that\u2019s giving you that confidence in the rebound? Andrew Cecere : I\u2019ll ask Terry to add on, but I think the principle reason is two of the impacts this year and this quarter were weather related as well as the exit of the joint ventures that we\u2019ve talked about in the past. The weather related will diminish greatly in the first quarter and going forward, and we lap the exit of the joint ventures starting in the second half of \u201918. Terrance Dolan : Yes, so the impact of those two is about 2.5 to 3%, and again the weather events diminish pretty significantly in the first quarter and then by the end of the second quarter, as Andy said. The other thing we\u2019re seeing is that sales volumes in our merchant acquiring business have been particularly strong. We\u2019re 4%-plus in terms of same store sales, which was good - we saw some nice lift in the fourth quarter, and then our overall sales were about 7.3%, kind of in that ballpark, and that\u2019s because we\u2019re seeing nice growth in terms of new business. We believe that that momentum that we started to create in the merchant acquiring business is going to help us generate that mid single digits by the end of the--by the second half of 2018. John Pancari : Okay. All right, that\u2019s good. Then on the loan growth side, just wanted to get a little bit more color in terms of what you\u2019re thinking about for 2018. Is it fair to assume still around GDP, GDP plus, so 2 to 3% growth in loans as you look at \u201918; and on that front, on commercial real estate, just want to get your updated thoughts on when we could see some stabilization and possibly some growth in that line. Thanks. Terrance Dolan : Yes, so let me take it first and then I\u2019ll hand it off to Bill. If you think about loan growth, in the near term there is certainly going to be impacts of tax performance. It\u2019s a little bit difficult to forecast, but quite honestly loan growth in the near term is going to be dependent upon the level of pay downs that we see and that sort of activity in the capital markets as corporate customers realign or rebalance their debt structure, the capital structure if you will. I think your expectation of GDP, kind of in that range or a little plus of that is a good or reasonable estimate as you think about the full year, but in the near term it\u2019s going to be impacted by some of the things that we see in terms of customer behavior. Bill Parker : I\u2019ll pick up on your question on commercial real estate. The commercial mortgage line, which has seen decreases for the last several quarters, I think that\u2019s a function of the interest rate environment. Once we get through this rate increase environment, see more stabilization there, I think we\u2019ll be more able to build that book. On the construction side, we are seeing some positive growth on our residential construction area. We\u2019ve been expanding that into the southeast and we\u2019re hopeful with the tax bill that perhaps multi-family should come back, so we\u2019re looking forward to being aggressive in that area in \u201918. Terrance Dolan : Then John, maybe the last thing I would just add in terms of loan growth is that in the latter half of 2017, and I think with tax reform, we are seeing momentum in terms of consumer spend and consumer activity, and I think that that bodes well with respect to loan growth on the retail side. John Pancari : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open. Scott Siefers : Morning guys. Andrew Cecere : Morning Scott. Scott Siefers : A quick question just on the mid-single digit expense growth for \u201918. Just so I\u2019m clear, can you give maybe the dollar amount off which--for 2017 off which you\u2019re basing the mid-single digit growth expectation? Terrance Dolan : Yes, I think if you end up looking at our growth rate this year, it was a little bit above 5% on a year-over-year basis, and we expected that to continue to improve excluding the tax reform and some of the reinvestment that we end up making. With that tax reform, that really is kind of what causes us to think we\u2019re going to be at the high end of that range, or in the mid-single digits. Andrew Cecere : I think, Terry, when we\u2019re talking about the base for that, it is off of the numbers excluding notable items, which I think is about $12.1 billion of expense. Terrance Dolan : Yes, yes. Scott Siefers : Okay, perfect. Yes, that clarifies it. I appreciate it. Then I think you guys said in the prepared remarks that you would expect positive operating leverage excluding the investments. I guess that implies revenue growth somewhere at or below the mid-single digits? Terrance Dolan : No Scott, we expect positive operating leverage including the investments - including the investments. Scott Siefers : Oh, including - okay. All right, good. I appreciate that clarification. Just wanted to make sure I heard it correctly, and I did not, so. That\u2019s it for me, so I appreciate it. Terrance Dolan : Thank you, Scott. Operator : Your next question comes from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Kevin Barker : Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to get a little bit more detail on the innovation spending that you\u2019re making, and when you think about the range of mid-single digit growth rates, can you put some parameters around that? Andrew Cecere : Our focus is going to be on the things I talked about, which is digital, mobile banking, B2B, brand, continuing our expansion of our customer base and our customer experience, and as well as our employees, and we talked about the increased $15 minimum wage. But those are all the things we\u2019re talking about, and as you think about what we\u2019ve been doing, our success is really dependent on continuing to innovate and continuing to deliver the very best customer experience, so those are the things we\u2019re focused on that, over time, will continue to drive the growth that we\u2019ve been experiencing. Then Terry, in that mid-single digits, we\u2019re talking around 5% or so in terms of expenses, right? Terrance Dolan : Yes, that\u2019s right. Kevin Barker : Okay, and then in regards to the flow through into 2019, 2020, will you start to return back to your longer term target 3 to 5% expense growth rate, or do you feel like that will continue for the next couple years? Terrance Dolan : Yes Kevin, maybe let me take that. If you think about incremental investments that you\u2019re making, there\u2019s kind of an arc, and I think about it over kind of a two or three-year time frame, making the investments today and you start to see the revenue benefit in that second half of the second year and then into the third year. So when we think about 2019 and 2020, we have to kind of think about that arc, if you will. I do believe that as you get down to the 2020 time horizon, you\u2019re going to see that incremental revenue that\u2019s going to be impacting the business positively, but the double benefit of that is that with the digital initiatives that we have going on, we also would expect to see efficiencies come from those investments as well, following that sort of time horizon. Andrew Cecere : And importantly, Terry, as you said, we\u2019re looking at this from both a revenue and an expense perspective, and we\u2019re making the additional investments to grow the revenue, and to simply say that we\u2019re going to manage both sides of that equation, the positive operating leverage in \u201918,\u201919, \u201920 and going forward. Kevin Barker : Okay, thanks for taking my questions. Terrance Dolan : Thanks Kevin. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Ricky : Hi, this is actually Ricky from Matt\u2019s team. Sorry if I missed this, but I\u2019m wondering if you could touch a bit on NIM outlook for the year, both with and without additional hikes, and the puts and takes there. Terrance Dolan : Yes, given all the moving parts, Ricky, I think one of the things we\u2019re going to focus really on is giving guidance with respect to net interest income, so when we think about net interest income going into next year, we would expect growth pretty similar to what we see this year, fee income growth being a little bit stronger. That net interest income growth is going to be driven by our expectations around loan growth and just the rising rate environment. Ricky: Got it, and then maybe one follow-up. It looks like securities ticked up a bit this quarter. Wondering if you could talk a bit about that and what the trajectory for the securities book should look like in 2018. Is that going to track overall balance sheet growth, or what\u2019s the thinking there? Terrance Dolan : Yes, the way that we end up managing our investment portfolio is really from a liquidity management standpoint, and that will track very consistently with the growth in average earning assets. Ricky: Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Terrance Dolan : Hey Erika. Andrew Cecere : Morning. Erika Najarian : Good morning. My first question is just on the regulatory backdrop. It seems like there is bipartisan momentum to pass some amendments to Dodd-Frank, and obviously the Senate version has a dollar threshold of $250 billion. I\u2019m wondering if you could sort of share some feedback - does that simply mean if the new threshold for SIFI is $250 billion that nothing changes for U.S. Bank, or does that put you in a different tier in terms of SIFI rules? Andrew Cecere : My expectation, Erika, is that we would see limited changes to the U.S. Bank. As a reminder, we\u2019re above $250 billion but we don\u2019t have a SIFI buffer on the capital component. We\u2019re already at the capital levels. We have the processes in place for CCAR and stress testing, so I expect limited change or impact to our company. Erika Najarian : Got it. Just as a follow up to Ricky\u2019s question, could you share embedded in your positive operating leverage guidance how many rate hikes you presume for 2018, and also the shape of the curve for 2018? Terrance Dolan : Yes, so when we\u2019re thinking about 2018, we expect that we\u2019re going to see rate hikes, probably a couple rate hikes, and then one in December, so we\u2019ll see two kind of midyear, and then in terms of the yield curve, we kind of established our plan or our forecast based upon where the yield curve was in that mid-December time frame, and as you know, recently it\u2019s steepened a little bit but I think there\u2019s probably going to be movement up and down in terms of where that yield curve is. There\u2019s going to be pressure, and I think it\u2019s probably going to flatten a bit as rates rise during the year as well. Erika Najarian : Got it, thank you. Andrew Cecere : Thanks Erika. Operator : Our next question comes from David Long with Raymond James. Your line is open. David Long : Morning everyone. Terrance Dolan : Hey David. David Long : Just wanted to get your thoughts on any potential competing away of any of the tax benefits, whether that happens in 2018 or further on down the road. Terrance Dolan : Yes, so this is Terry. When you think about tax reform, I think how it ends up getting utilized, we talked about the reinvestment; but the competition in terms of pricing, we obviously live in a pretty dynamic environment. I do think that there is going to be some bleed that will take place because of competitive pricing, but I also expect that that\u2019s going to take place over time and it\u2019s probably going to be a little bit different, depending upon the product and the service and the customer segment that you have. Obviously, we operate in a pretty competitive environment, so ultimately how much gets competed away will be dependent upon that competition. I would say that if you think about the last 10 years, though, the industry has run at lower return levels because it\u2019s been real difficult to price in things like regulatory costs and the cost of capital and liquidity, and all sorts of things. So I do think that especially for some period of time, the banking industry is going to try to recapture some of that in terms of its returns, and as a result from a competitive standpoint I think that will be a little bit delayed. David Long : Got it, appreciate the color. Thanks. Operator : Again if you would like to ask a question, press star, one on your telephone keypad. Your next question comes from Brian Klock with KBW. Your line is open. Brian Klock : Good morning everyone. Terrance Dolan : Hi Brian. Brian Klock : I have a question, I guess probably for Bill. Talking about the CRE pay downs, I noticed that there was a tick-up in charge-offs after being in a net recovery position in the CRE book for a while. Can you talk about that? I think the note was related to enclosed malls that were written down, so can you give us a little bit of color on that? Bill Parker : Sure. Well, obviously at this point in the cycle, you eventually run out of the recovery, so we\u2019re pretty much there on the CRE book. On the enclosed malls, we do have a smaller portfolio of what I\u2019d call small market enclosed malls, and I think some of those were more harder hit with this shift to online, so that\u2019s where we saw that. The overall portfolio is about $700 million, but we don\u2019t expect that to continue each quarter. We just had a couple of deals this quarter that we had to deal with. Brian Klock : All right, great. Thanks, that\u2019s helpful. A follow-up question for Andy, I guess - thinking about the legal settlement or the legal accrual that you had in the quarter related to BSA AML, and I know you guys have spent a lot of money and a lot of effort to remediate that, can you give us an update on where you stand, or where you think you stand with that regulatory order? Andrew Cecere : Yes, that hasn\u2019t changed, Brian. We completed most of the--all of the systems integration and process and build, as well as the people and process at the end of 2017, and we\u2019re now on a sustainability phase of it and we will continue to be in there for the first half of \u201918, which is really ensuring that the processes we\u2019ve put in place are acting and performing as expected. Brian Klock : Okay, so it\u2019s possible maybe back half of \u201918, you could be looking or being able to pursue bank acquisitions again? Is that reasonable, or is this something we should think about for \u201919? Andrew Cecere : You know, that\u2019s dependent upon the regulator, certainly, but we are doing everything on our end to make sure we\u2019re performing as well as we can. As I said, I think we have all the processes and systems and people in place, now it\u2019s just a matter of going through it and ensuring that they\u2019re working appropriately. I would also remind you that the M&A activity that we\u2019ve been focused on has been not related to the AML consent order of things, like card portfolios, payments, and trust activities. We\u2019ll continue to look at those items. Brian Klock : Right. Helpful, and thanks for your time. Andrew Cecere : Thank you, Brian. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters. Jennifer Thompson : Thank you everyone for listening to our call. Please contact us if you have any follow-up questions. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Following a review of the results by Andy Cecere, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Dolan, U.S. Bancorp's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon, Eastern daylight time, through Wednesday, April 25, at 12 :00 midnight, Eastern daylight time. I will now turn the conference call over to Jen Thompson, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. Jennifer Thompson : Thank you, James, and good morning to everyone who's joined our call. Andy Cecere, Terry Dolan and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's first quarter results and to answer your questions. Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Andy. Andrew Cecere : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry and I will be opening the call -- will open our call for questions. I'll start on Slide 3. In the first quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.96, which compares with $0.82 reported in the first quarter of 2017. During the quarter, a lower-than-expected tax rate, offset by a transitional change in vesting provisions within our stock-based compensation program, increased earnings per share by $0.01. On a year-over-year basis, first quarter net revenue increased by 3.4% to $5.5 billion. Excluding the impact of tax reform on our net interest income, revenue growth would have been 3.9%. Loan growth is seasonally lowest in the first quarter of every year. Pay-downs have been a headwind in recent quarters due to capital markets activities by customers and our disciplined underwriting in commercial real estate at this stage of the business cycle. In addition, in the first quarter, loan demand has been lower across the industry. These factors offset solid growth in our retail loan portfolios and underlying strength in new business and market share gains in our commercial portfolios. We believe the early part of this year will prove to be a transition period. Tax reform impacted not only loan growth this quarter, but also commercial products revenue, as it influenced the timing and level of corporate bond issuance and deal funding. Combined with strong growth in pipelines, conversations with our customers gives us confidence that commercial loan trends will improve as we move further into the year, although the timing of more robust growth tied to a resurgence in CapEx investment remains uncertain. In the meantime, we are focused on gaining market share across our lending and fee products. This quarter, we saw improved sales volume growth in merchant processing, higher sales growth in credit card and commercial payment services and strong growth in new customer accounts and client balances in our Wealth Management and Investment Services businesses. We expect this momentum to continue into the year.  On the right side of Slide 3, you will see that the credit quality was stable in the first quarter, and our book value per share increased by 5.9% from a year ago. During the quarter, we returned 68% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Slide 4 highlights our best-in-class performance metrics, including a 14.9% return on average common equity, a 1.5% return on average assets, and our tangible return on common equity was 19.3%. Our efficiency ratio rose modestly from a year ago to 55.9%, reflecting increased investment in spending on technology and innovation and certain transitional matters related to stock-based compensation that Terry will address in a moment.  As we discussed previously, we are stepping up our business investment in digital-first capabilities, revenue-enhancing initiatives and business automation. We expect that 55.9% efficiency ratio to be the high for the year. Now let me turn the call over to Terry, who'll provide more detail on the quarter as well as forward-looking guidance. Terrance Dolan : Thanks, Andy. If you turn to Slide 5, I'll start with a balance sheet review and follow up with a discussion of earnings trends. In the first quarter, average loans grew 2.3% compared with the first quarter of 2017, a decline by 0.1% on a linked-quarter basis. During the quarter, we reclassified $1.5 billion of student loans originated under the federal loan program to held for sale. As you know, we exited the student loan origination business in 2012, and the runoff portfolio is not as strategically important to our future businesses. The reclassification did not materially affect our average balance sheet for the quarter. However, it did affect ending loan balance growth. Turning to core trends. Average loan growth is slowest in the first quarter for each year, reflecting seasonality affecting credit card, auto lending and mortgage banking, in particular. This quarter, mortgage loans increased 0.9% sequentially but were up 3.9% year-over-year. Similarly, retail loans declined 0.2% sequentially but increased 6.1% year-over-year. Retail and mortgage loan growth is seasonally stronger in the second quarter of each year, and we feel good about core trends in auto lending and leasing, where we continue to gain market share and credit card balances.  Adding to the impact of seasonality on retail loan growth this quarter were a few factors. Commercial and commercial real estate portfolios continue to be impacted by elevated levels of pay-downs. While average commercial loans increased 4.0% from a year ago, average balances declined 0.1% sequentially. Pipelines improved as the quarter developed, and we continue to grow commitments. However, line utilization remains at historical lows, and pay-down activity was exacerbated this quarter by corporate clients flushed with cash on the heels of tax reform and continuing to deleverage their balance sheet.  Turning to commercial real estate. Average loans declined 6.5% year-over-year and 1.6% on a linked-quarter basis. The risk reward dynamics in commercial real estate remain unfavorable in our view, particularly in multifamily and certain areas of commercial mortgage lending. That discipline is influencing decisions to not extend credit on unfavorable terms and adding to the elevated pay-down pressures, driven by customers accessing the secondary market. This quarter, commercial real estate contributed a 25 basis point drag to the linked-quarter average loan growth and a 160 basis point drag to year-over-year average loan growth. In the near term, we intend to remain disciplined in our commercial real estate lending. Turning to Slide 6. Average deposit -- average total deposits increased 1.9% year-over-year but declined 1.4% on a linked-quarter basis. The linked-quarter decline partly reflects typical first quarter seasonality that we see in Corporate and Commercial Banking and Wealth Management and Investment Services. Within our Corporate Trust business, CLO issuances and deal closings tend to be seasonally lower in the first quarter, impacting balances. In addition, investment managers deployed funds for loan and other asset purchases, taking advantage of favorable debt market conditions in the early part of the first quarter. Recently, our deal pipeline strengthened within the Corporate Trust business and ending deposits began to seasonally increase across the business lines. Slide 7 indicates the credit quality was relatively stable. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans increased 3 basis points on a linked-quarter basis and were down 1 basis point compared with the first quarter of 2017. Nonperforming assets were essentially flat compared with the fourth quarter and down 19.5% in the first quarter of 2017. Slide 8 provides highlights of first quarter earnings results. Please note that during the first quarter, the company adopted accounting standards related to revenue recognition, and certain revenue and expense categories have been recast to reflect the change in accounting standard. The adoption had no material impact on operating income, as you can see on Slide 9. Slide 9 also shows how tax reform impacted our first quarter net interest income and the related revenue growth rates. In the first quarter, net revenue of $5.5 billion was down 2.3% compared with the fourth quarter and up 3.4% versus the first quarter of 2017. Adjusting for the impact of tax reform on our taxable equivalent net interest income, revenue increased 3.9% on a year-over-year basis. On Slide 10, net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis was $3.2 billion in the first quarter, essentially flat compared with the fourth quarter and up 5.5% year-over-year, which was in line with our guidance. Linked-quarter growth was impacted by 2 fewer days, while year-over-year growth was supported by growth in loans and higher loan yields.  In the first quarter, the net interest margin was 3.13%. This is 2 basis points higher than the fourth quarter net interest margin of 3.11%. Both periods include the impact of the reclassifications related to the revenue recognition standards. Excluding the impact of tax reform on tax-exempt earning assets, the net interest margin increased by 4 basis points on a linked-quarter basis. The increase was driven by higher yields on earning assets due to higher rates and a steeper yield curve, partly offset by higher funding costs. Our interest-bearing deposit betas continue to perform in line with past experience and our expectation after the December rate hike. We expect the total interest-bearing deposit beta following the most recent rate hike will be about 40%. As future rate hikes occur, we continue to expect our deposit beta will gradually trend toward a 50% level. Slide 11 highlights trends of noninterest income, which decreased by 4.1% on a linked-quarter basis and increased 0.6% on a year-over-year basis. Linked-quarter results are affected by seasonality within our credit and debit card, merchant processing and mortgage banking businesses. On a year-over-year basis, we saw growth in credit and debit card revenue and corporate payments revenue due to higher sales volume. Merchant processing services revenue increased 2.5%, supported by strong volume growth, which our processing revenue continues to be impacted by exiting 2 joint ventures in the second quarter of 2017. We continue to expect that merchant-acquiring revenue will return to a more normalized mid-single-digit pace by the third quarter of 2018. Trust and investment management fees increased 8.2% year-over-year, driven by business growth, net asset inflows and favorable market conditions. Strong growth in payments revenue, trust and investment management revenue and deposit service fees was partly offset by an 11.1% decrease in mortgage banking revenue, which was affected by lower refinancing activity and lower gain on sale margins and a 10.9% decrease in commercial product revenue. Treasury management fees declined 2%, reflecting the impact of changes in earnings credit, which is a trend typical in a rising rate environment. Client behavior related to tax reform was a headwind to our commercial products revenue this quarter. Meaningful deleveraging by clients flushed with cash led to reduced corporate bond issuance and investment-grade underwriting activity. There was also a significant reduction in municipal market activity due to a pull forward of issuance into the fourth quarter of 2017 related to tax reform. Corporate bond market conditions have improved in the early weeks of the second quarter, and announced M&A activity continues to pick up. Turning to Slide 12. Noninterest expense decreased 0.6% on a linked-quarter basis, excluding notable items included in the fourth quarter. On a year-over-year basis, expenses grew by 5.0%, in line with our expectation for the quarter. Personnel expenses were the biggest driver of costs, while non-personnel expenses declined 1.2% from a year ago.  Compensation expense increased 9.5%, principally due to the impact of hiring to support business growth and compliance programs, merit increases, higher variable compensation related to business production and the impact of changes in vesting provisions related to stock-based compensation programs. This vesting change was related to changes in our compensation programs in response to shareholder feedback and to ensure competitive programs within the employment and [dot-com] market. The vesting change negatively impacted year-over-year expense growth by 130 basis points. Excluding this impact, total noninterest expense would have been -- would have increased by 3.7%, and compensation expense would have increased 6.9% from a year ago. Notably, within non-personnel expenses, professional service expense declined 13.5% from a year ago, primarily due to fewer consulting services as compliance programs near maturity. As we've discussed previously, we had an inflection point in a growth rate of cost related to the build-out of programs related to our consent order in the second half of 2018. Compliance-related costs will continue to moderate through the year. We have started to deploy increased investment dollars towards digital capabilities and innovation projects, multicultural initiatives and brand. The impact of these investments will occur over the next several quarters, and the magnitude will depend upon the timing of our investment opportunities. Including the impact of these business investments, we still expect full year 2018 expense growth will be within the 3% to 5% range we think of as normalized. As a result of our investments, we expect stronger revenue growth, improved productivity and expense efficiencies in the future. With respect to income taxes, our tax rate on a taxable-equivalent basis decline from approximately 29% in 2017, excluding notable items, to a tax rate on a taxable-equivalent basis of 18.9% in the first quarter of 2018. This tax rate was slightly lower than expected due to the accounting impact of stock-based compensation and the resolution of certain tax matters during the quarter. Slide 13 highlights our capital position. At March 31, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, estimated using the Basel III standardized approach, was 9.0%. This compares to our capital target of 8.5%. I will now provide some forward-looking guidance. For the second quarter, we expect net interest income to increase in the mid-single-digit range on a year-over-year basis. We expect fee revenue to increase to the low single-digit range year-over-year. As a reminder, fees are seasonally higher in the second quarter. We expect expense growth to be in the mid-single-digit range year-over-year, within our long-term growth target of 3% to 5%. We expect to deliver positive operating leverage for the full year 2018. We expect credit quality to remain relatively stable compared with the first quarter, and our full year tax rate on a taxable-equivalent basis is estimated to be about 21%.  I'll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks. Andrew Cecere : Thanks, Terry. The early part of 2018 is shaping up to be what we thought it would. The economy is on solid footing, and consumer and business confidence is strong. While the business confidence has not translated into increased lending activity yet, we believe it will. Strong consumer spending, supported by a strong job market, higher wages and lower taxes, should drive more business activity and business investment in technology and infrastructure, and we are well positioned to win the lending business that comes with it. Business optimism is evident in the conversations our bankers are having with our clients, and we are seeing that in terms of increased commitments and more robust pipelines. I feel very good about the outlook for our fee businesses. We are reaching an inflection point in merchant processing revenue, and our focus on retail-driven purchase mortgages is enabling us to capture market share in mortgage banking. And while reduced headwinds are a positive development, I'm most excited about the sales and volume trends we are seeing in some of our high-return fee businesses like payments and trust and investment services, which provides fuel to an already good momentum in the second quarter and beyond. As we have discussed previously, we are accelerating technology and innovation investment spend on initiatives aimed at enhancing the customer experience and leveraging our competitive positioning, with a particular focus on payments, digital and mobile banking and B2B capabilities. These investments will position us at the forefront in banking and drive improved leverage over the next several years. In closing, I'm confident that our business model, combined with the hard work, dedication and integrity of our entire U.S. Bank team, will enable us to deliver improving returns on equity for shareholders in the near term and over the longer term without compromising our risk profile. That concludes our formal remarks. Terry, Bill and I will now be happy to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Richard Dodds : This is actually Ricky Dodds from Matt's team. Just a quick question on expenses. Appreciate the color you gave. Just wonder if you could talk about expense growth as we exit 2018. Had an uptick in cost this year and in recent years. I was wondering if you could see expense growth sort of at the lower end of your long-term range in 2019 or maybe even below that. Terrance Dolan : Yes. So this is Terry, and thanks for the question, Ricky. With respect to expenses, we certainly expect them to be, in 2018, kind of on the higher end of that range, as we said. As we get into 2019, one of the things that we expect and we think is important is that we would start to see revenue accelerate because of some of the investments that we're making as well as some of the efficiencies that we would expect from business automation and other activities that we are investing in. So I don't know whether it will come down to the lower end of that range in 2019, but I think we'll start to see an inflection point where it will start to come down in the range during 2019. Richard Dodds : Got it. And then maybe to follow up, sort of switching gears. Just thoughts on mortgage banking for the year. Maybe it was a bit weaker than we had expected in the first quarter. I'm just wondering if there's any read-throughs there. And then just sort of raw thoughts as we move throughout 2018. Terrance Dolan : Yes. So again, let me kind of take that question. On mortgage banking, I think we're kind of seeing a couple of different things. One is that I know we've had a very strong focus on enhancing the retail channel and focusing on purchased mortgages over the last couple of years. What we are seeing in our particular business is we've actually seen applications increase on a year-over-year basis by about 11% but the revenue coming down on a year-over-year basis. And that's principally because in the industry, it's very competitive in terms of the gain on sale margins that we are seeing and that the industry is seeing, particularly in the correspondent banking. I think that there -- as the year progresses, that margin compression is placing a lot of pressure on our competitors. We're continuing to capture market share. And as capacity in the industry starts to go down, we should start to see improving margins, but the timing of that is hard to know. Andrew Cecere : And Terry, I'd add that our capabilities in the digital front, specifically our Loan Portal position us well for that gain on share on the retail side. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore. John Pancari : On the -- to the deposit topic. On the noninterest-bearing deposits down about 6%, I know you mentioned that seasonality, but the year-over-year balance is still down about 3.5% or so. So is there something else going on there? Is this more of the impact of higher rates and deposit betas picking up? And just want to get some color on that. Terrance Dolan : Yes. John, this is Terry again. When we look at deposit trends, for us, it's really kind of important to kind of look at the business mix of our deposits. We typically, in the first quarter, see deposits being down on a seasonal basis, and that's because deal flow within corporate trust tends to be higher in the fourth quarter and then lower in the first quarter. And so we always see kind of a runoff. If we look at kind of the deposit outflows that we saw in the first quarter, we didn't see anything significant in the consumer or the retail side at all. In fact, they were pretty stable from fourth quarter to first quarter. The Wholesale or our Corporate and Commercial Banking deposits were down, but at the end of looking year-over-year, seasonally, it's about the same. So the most significant decrease that we saw was within our Corporate Trust business, and we really think that's tied to 3 factors. The first is the fact that a lot of CLO deals got pulled forward because of tax reform into the fourth quarter, so fourth quarter balances were higher. And in the first quarter, the CLO investment managers started to deploy those deposit balances out of the trust. And so that's pretty natural. But I think because of the pull-forward, it was more pronounced in the first quarter. Second is just timing of M&A activity. We have escrow balances and we saw an outflow of escrow balances, which is really tied to M&A deals. With the pipeline of M&As strengthening, we would expect that to get stronger and then just normal seasonality. So it's kind of 3 different factors that are happening in the Corporate Trust business, not as much really tied to deposit pricing. Andrew Cecere : And Terry, I'd add our deposit beta assumptions were consistent with our expectations. [On G40], we're still expecting they get 50 towards the middle -- last part of 2018. And the other point I'd make is that we saw acceleration in deposits actually here early in the second quarter. Terrance Dolan : Yes, yes. John Pancari : Got it, got it. And then separately, on the loan front, in terms of your expectation around the trajectory of loan growth, are you still comfortable with GDP-plus level of loan growth as you look at 2018? And then -- or could this -- or could it be weaker, just given the trends you saw this quarter? P. Parker: Well, it does appear to be a little stronger in the second quarter than the first quarter. But we still think it's probably going to pick up mostly in the second half of the year. But we did see in the C&I side, for example, our ending balances were higher at the end of the quarter. So there are signals that is then starting to pick up. John Pancari : Okay. So you're still good with the GDP-plus range for the full year? Terrance Dolan : Yes. I mean, that's something we talked about last year. We'll see loan growth, for example, in many of our retail categories. And that's going to be more tied to what GDP is doing, et cetera. So I think we see a number of signs that would still make us feel comfortable at this point. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald from Bernstein. John McDonald : I wanted to follow up a little bit on the expenses, just maybe bigger picture. Andy, the 3% to 5% kind of normalized expense growth, you mentioned that a few times and something you targeted at the Investor Day in 2016. Just remind us, like, what are the foundation assumptions of why 3% to 5% is what you target over time? And the reason I'm asking is we get the question, other regional banks seem able this year and maybe next year to self-fund their tech investments and keep expenses pretty flattish this year and next. So what's different about U.S. Bank in terms of maybe where you are in the cycle, that you're kind of at 3% to 5%, and in elevated, you're at 5% when others are kind of doing flattish? Terrance Dolan : Well, John, I'll start with the fact that we're starting from an efficiency ratio a bit lower than those other banks that you're describing. I do think we're going to and we are going to focus on positive operating leverage and making sure that our expense growth is below our revenue growth. But at the same time, we want to make sure we're balanced in terms of the making investments for the longer term. So we're factoring in all those things into our number of 3% to 5%. I do think it'll range in there for sure. I do think that there are periods it'll be at the low end of the range. But we want to make sure we're thinking about things not only in the short term, but in the long term. Andrew Cecere : John, the other thing I that would just add to that is it's important to remember our business mix relative to a lot of our regional banks that we end up competing against. With the payments business and the Investment Management business in particular, the payments business, a lot of those expenses are more variable in nature. And so as revenue grows, expenses will grow with that, but not to the same level, but also the business mix ends up impacting that a little bit. John McDonald : Okay, that's helpful. And just as a reminder, what do you guys think is an appropriate medium-term efficiency target for you guys, say, over the next 1, 2, 3 years? Andrew Cecere : Well, as I said in the prepared remarks, John, I do expect that this first quarter is the high point for the year. And we continue to expect it will be in the mid- to low 50s in terms of our efficiency ratio. So I expect it to migrate down principally because we're going to have positive operating leverage. John McDonald : Okay, great. And then just a reminder, Terry, where you stand on interest rate sensitivity. Has anything changed there? And can you kind of remind us of the split between the long- and short-end sensitivity? Terrance Dolan : Yes. So again, looking at our balance sheet, probably about 50% of our assets benefit from the short end of the curve in terms of movements in interest rates and about 50% of it benefits more on the long end of the curve. And that's really what's our business mix has been overall. From an asset liability sensitivity perspective, one of the things I would kind of maybe point out, and Andy talked a little bit about our deposit betas, but if you think about our Corporate Trust business, we're getting closer to, what I would call, that terminal beta level, and that's kind of starting to be baked into our rate movements as well as kind of the wholesale side. So the movement up of deposit betas for us, I think, will be impacted by that, to some extent, favorably, I think, relative to maybe some of our competitors. So that's the way we kind of think about it. Andrew Cecere : Because a lot -- for about half of our balances, it's already at the highest level. Terrance Dolan : Yes. John McDonald : Great. And then just one follow-up. You mentioned the overall retail beta or the beta assumptions getting to, I think, you said 40 later in the year. Can you just talk about the retail beta? And is that kind of the terminal assumption there? Or would you expect to go kind of higher than the terminal on the retail over time since it's been so low for the first part of the cycle? Terrance Dolan : Yes. So I mean, the movement from 40 to 50 is probably going to be more so on assumption that retail deposits are going to start to move upward in terms of deposit betas. Through the most recent rate cycle or rate hike, we have seen very, very little movement in terms of deposit pricing. I do think that with the March rate hike and as we get into the rest of the year, we're going to see more competition with respect to retail deposits. And we're just going to be pricing to meet that competition. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Couple of questions. One, just to continue on the last conversation. Your loan-to-deposit ratio appears to be pretty low. I think it's in the low 80s. So I'd wonder if that -- is that something you can use strategically to hold back on deposit beta at all? Terrance Dolan : Yes. I think the way that I would kind of think about it, Betsy, I do think that there's that opportunity. I think we can be a little bit more targeted and more focused with respect to how we think about retail deposits. I mean, we price in 120 different markets and so we surgically kind of look at where the competition is moving rates. And then we only really have to move in those particular markets. So I think your point is correct in the sense that we can be more targeted, and we can be a little bit more focused with respect to deposit betas as they end up changing. I think that we -- again, we haven't seen a lot of movements yet, but that's something that we're expecting. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then separately, on capital return dividend payout ratios, that kind of conversation, obviously, the Fed put out the SCB proposal recently. Maybe you could talk a little bit about how you see that proposal impacting you and your minimum capital ratios that you have been targeting because, obviously, your SCB is well below. The ratios that the Fed has been putting out there, the SCB of 2.5%, you're well below, I believe, right? So can you talk a little bit about that as well as how you think about the dividend payout ratio over the next couple of years here, given that the soft cap is likely to be removed? Andrew Cecere : Betsy, this is Andy. We continue to be bound by the base case, not distressed case. Our base case target's 8.5% common equity Tier 1. We're at 9%, so we're in the range. Our capital distribution has been in the range of our long-term targets, that 30 to 40. I do think that one change that this may offer an opportunity to do is to increase the dividend component of that share versus the buyback. So you might -- you will see us increasing the dividend piece as this rule becomes more clear. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And any kind of expectation for how much that could move over time? I know I'm not asking for the specific CCAR, I know you can't talk about that. But you put in the low 30s, but then if I look precrisis, 10 years ago, you did run with a much higher dividend payout ratio. So just wondering how you think about what kind of, over time, payout ratio your business can handle, given the low earnings volatility that you typically have. Andrew Cecere : Sure. So Betsy, as we think about the $0.30 to $0.40 in dividends and the $0.30 to $0.40 in buybacks, I could see our dividend component migrating towards that $0.40. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from Bank of America. L. Erika Penala : My first question is a follow-up to what John was asking. And appreciate, Andy, that you're reminding us sort of the medium-term efficiency target of mid- to low 50s. As we think about 2019, I'm wondering if you could give us sort of a sense of timing of the investment spend relative to the revenue that you would reap from that investment spend. And I guess, really, the question I'm asking is, as we think about the efficiency ratio migrating over time lower, what that rate of change is going to look like in the initial year beyond 2018? Terrance Dolan : So Erika, I think we're making these investments that we talked about with a particular focus on customer experience and digital, B2B, all those things I've talked about. Those expenses are now starting to be baked into the run rate that you're seeing in the first quarter continuously for the rest of the year. We're going to work on the expense growth to be in that 3% to 5% range under the assumption that our revenue growth is above that, and we talked about our revenue growth assumptions. So to the extent the revenue growth is robust, I would expect, and as expected, I expect our expense to be 3% to 5%. If the revenue growth is below that, we'll manage expenses down, consistent with what our revenue opportunities are, again, with the objective of continuing to deliver positive operating leverage and a lower efficiency ratio over time. L. Erika Penala : Okay. And I just wanted to ask a little bit about the commercial real estate dynamics. You're typically the bellwether in terms of credit inflection trends. And I'm wondering as -- if you could give us a little bit more detail on some of the unfavorable terms that you're seeing as some of these loans come up for refinancing. I think the worry that the industry or the market has is that a lot of commercial real estate loans had been struck at ultra-low rates. And I'm sort of wondering whether or not part of your decision to not refinance is that the developers are -- have other options for continued low rates outside of the banking industry and outside of U.S. Bank, and you're refusing to underwrite it under market rate. P. Parker: This is Bill. That's certainly part of it. It's either rate, and it's often tenor and just the lack of recourse structure on these long-tenor deals that -- whether it's insurance companies or the securities markets or offerings. So that's where we've seen the runoff in, what we call, the standing loan side or mortgage loan side. On the construction side, we're still very, very active. We actually did see our ending construction loans up a little bit in the first quarter, so that was encouraging. So that's where we focus. That's where we can add most value. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Kenneth Usdin : Can I follow up on the payments and the restatement for the revenue and expense recognition? It would seem that you're taking out that rewards payment that was in short-term borrowings and also putting that back in, and that's what changed out of the NII side. Is that right to say? Terrance Dolan : That's correct. Kenneth Usdin : So then as a go-forward then, Terry, can you help us understand that now that that's going to be netted inside the payments lines, how does that change either the seasonality and the variability of payments revenues as we look ahead from this restated basis? Terrance Dolan : In terms of the seasonality, I don't think it's going to end up impacting it a lot. I mean, the rebates that you're talking about are principally related to our corporate payments businesses. And we end up looking at the seasonality of that and then just how those rebates will match up against it. I think the seasonality will be the same. You just have to kind of reset your first quarter expectations regarding the line item. Kenneth Usdin : Okay. And then so just more broadly on payments. I know you've talked about the merchant processing getting back to mid-single by midyear, and on a restated basis, it looks like it was back to comping positive. Your corporate and debit is already doing 8%, and corporate -- credit and debit is up 8%, and then corporate's up 12%. Can those also continue to post improving rates of growth as we also move into the second half of the year? So just how coincidental is this overall rise in the payments business? Can you get back to those historical growth rates overall in an aggregate for each of them? Andrew Cecere : So I'm going to hit corporate payments, and Terry will talk about the retail payments. On the corporate payment side, they're having an exceptional -- they've had an exceptional year last year and continue to see that in the first quarter. We had sales growth of 12%, revenue growth of 10%. And you're seeing really strong growth in both the government as well as the corporate sector. A lot of that's driven by some of the technology investments we talked about, one of which is virtual pay, which is up about 20% on a year-over-year basis. So I would continue to see strong growth in those categories in corporate payments at the very high end of that single-digit or low double-digit range. Terrance Dolan : Now when you think about retail credit card, we've been talking about mid-single-digit sort of revenue growth for the year, and that business tends to be a little bit seasonal in the sense that the fourth -- first quarter tend to be a little bit higher in terms of the revenue growth. So I think it's important to kind of keep that in mind. To the extent that we -- I mean, we have been seeing strengthening with respect to consumer spend in that particular space, and I think that based upon everything that we're seeing, we would -- we believe that, that can continue. But it'll be really tied to what does that retail customer spend look like over the course of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Michael Mayo : So is this new information or are you reiterating the old information about accelerating investing in tech and innovation? I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, your tech budget is $1 billion each year and it's gone up to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. So when you're saying you're accelerating investing there, is this a little more of a step change than you're thinking before? And if so, why? Andrew Cecere : No, Mike, it's not new information. It's reiteration of what we talked about in the fourth quarter. Michael Mayo : Okay. And then if we could just get a little bit more kind of meat on the bones. In terms of the areas where you're investing, if you could just give us a little more granularity. And what are the outcomes that you expect? You've clearly said you want revenues to grow fast in expenses over time, that you're playing the long game. In terms of the mobile and online users or other metrics like that, some banks disclose that, others don't. What should we look for on the outside to monitor your progress? Andrew Cecere : Thanks, Mike. So let me break it into 3 categories. I'll start with the payments categories. And in there, it's going to be a focus on increasing our capabilities around e-commerce and integrated software providers. We're good there and want to be even better in those categories because that's where the growth is. On the retail side of the equation, it's increasing our digital capabilities. Today, about 65% to 70% of transactions occur in our mobile device, but under 20% of sales. We want to continue to enhance our capabilities around the sales side of the equation, offering convenience and speed for customers as we think about a digital-first world. And then on the business side of the equation, it's all focused on B2B and the new rails are being built and our capabilities around those rails. So those are the 3 areas of focus. The outcome of those will be increased sales activity and customer acquisition on all 3 fronts and particularly, on the consumer front, a more central relationship with those consumers and our ability to expand beyond our footprint with consumer customers. Terrance Dolan : And Mike, I might add maybe just a couple of things. Obviously, on the retail side, the areas of focus, we started in mortgage because we have an important business there in terms of our Loan Portal, bringing online capabilities for people to be able to acquire autos online and be able to get the lending within essentially kind of minutes associated with that, and then checking deposits and all sorts of things. A lot of the digital capabilities in the industry today are very service-oriented, though, and so a big significant focus for us is really more on the sale side as we go forward. Andrew Cecere : Right. Michael Mayo : All right, that's helpful. So just big picture, are you doing this because you have the money with the tax reduction to catch up or to get ahead of the industry? How do you think about it? Andrew Cecere : Mike, I'm doing this because I think this is where the industry is headed, and I want to be at the forefront. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran from Autonomous Research. Brian Foran : Most of my questions have been asked, but maybe just 2 quick ones. First on the guidance. All the year-over-year comparisons you're referencing are based on the newly reported numbers, not like what was in the 2Q release, right? Terrance Dolan : That's right. Based upon all of the recasted numbers. Brian Foran : And then in the NPL schedules, there was a little bit of a jump in C&I. I appreciate it was fully offset by improvement elsewhere. But just any color on what drove that and broader C&I credit views. P. Parker: Well, the credit's very stable, but yes, we did have one commercial account that's a consumer products account that did go nonperforming. So it was just an isolated incident. But overall, credit metrics are very, very stable. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja from JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : A couple of quick questions. Number one, merchant processing. In the past, you've highlighted when the dollar was strengthening, that you had an impact -- a negative impact from FX translation. Given that the dollar has been weakening, can you give us some color on how much of a benefit you got from FX translation, though? Terrance Dolan : Yes. So if you end up looking at revenue in merchant acquiring is, on a year-over-year basis, up about 2.5%. And what we have been guiding for the first half of the year is really that merchant acquiring on a core basis would be relatively flat on a year-over-year basis, and that's essentially what the difference is between the 2, is the FX. Saying that, again, when we end up looking at the second half of the year and we think about the core growth within that business, we think about that in terms of the mid-single digit. So we do expect to continue to strengthen. And those things that we end up looking at, in particular as new business activity and sales volumes, the sales volumes continue to strengthen that business as well. Vivek Juneja : Okay, great. Second one, the deposit betas on the whole wealth management side, where are those running now? What would you -- how would you -- what level is it, 70%? Is it -- any color on that? Because, obviously, that's a different business. Terrance Dolan : Yes. And so within our Wealth Management business, we started increasing deposit betas in the last rate cycle. And where there was literally no movement in earlier rate hikes, we started to see betas in the 10% to 15%. But they're well below what you see on the wholesale side of the other institutional side. But that's kind of what we've been experiencing. Vivek Juneja : When you say institutional, you're talking -- when I was referring to Wealth Management, I was referring to the whole sort of Wealth and Institute of the Corporate Trust. So yes, I realized different definition. Terrance Dolan : Yes, yes. So if you end up looking at Corporate Trust, when we get to more of a terminal, there are certain deposit betas in that 70% to 75% range, and we're pretty much there already. That's why as we think about the future, we believe the asset viability sensitivity standpoint, that's pretty much baked in. So that's kind of on the Corporate Trust side of the equation. And then on the, what I would say, on the core Wealth Management side, it's closer to that 15%. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez from UBS. Saul Martinez : I think, in the last quarter, you highlighted that you expected to be sort of at the high end of the 3% to 5% expense guidance because of the reinvestment of a portion of the profit windfall. Sorry, if I missed it, but is that still the expectation within that guide for 2018 and/or is it more revenue-dependent? Terrance Dolan : No, that is still our expectation. Saul Martinez : Okay. And I guess, a little bit more of a detailed question. The other noninterest income line, you mentioned this quarter was off because of lower equity investment. And can you help size that up? And I know it's a difficult line item to gauge on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but this quarter was light relative to last year, even on a restated basis. Can you just give us a sense or help us understand what a more normalized level should be going forward? Terrance Dolan : Yes, Saul. In terms of giving the specifics regarding equity investments, we've never really provided that specific type of guidance. I will say, in other revenue, there is many different categories of types of revenues that are part of that, including, for example, end-of-term gains and losses on residuals, et cetera, et cetera. It tends to be lumpy because of not only equity investments but just the way that all those different categories end up interacting it from 1 quarter to the next. So I think what I would suggest is kind of look over a period of time and you kind of see a range, and I would just kind of look within that range as kind of a way of getting some sense on other income. Saul Martinez : Got it. Just the number is about $30 million higher -- lower this quarter than the average of last year. So just wanted to make sure I understood that a little bit better. Andrew Cecere : Yes. It tends to be lumpy. Saul Martinez : Got it. And just a final one, quick one. On the consent order, any update there in terms of how that's progressing and just anything you could share on that? Andrew Cecere : Nothing different. We are in our sustainability pace. Things are going as expected. We expect to be done with our part of the equation in midyear, June 30. And then the regulators will continue with what they're doing, and that timing is uncertain. But we're right on track with what we expect. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker from Piper Jaffray. Kevin Barker : Just to follow up on the deposit betas. Can you give us an idea where your deposit beta on wholesale side stood this quarter and where it was in the previous quarter and where you expect that terminal rate to be? Terrance Dolan : Yes. On the wholesale side, the betas are kind of in that 55% to 65% sort of range. And that's getting pretty close to terminal level that we have experienced in the past. It -- that's kind of where it is today, Kevin. Kevin Barker : So overall, your Wealth Management, combined with the wholesale, are getting pretty close to the terminal side and that's just based on catch-up on the retail, right? Terrance Dolan : Yes, that's exactly right. Andrew Cecere : That's correct. Kevin Barker : Okay. And then a follow-up on some of the mortgage questions. You mentioned the correspondent has been -- seen heavy competition. Can you give us an idea where your gain-on-sale margins dropped on a correspondent basis from 4Q to 1Q and what your expectations are, at least for the next couple of quarters? Terrance Dolan : Yes. If you end up looking at margins on the correspondent side, they're in the low -- high single to low double-digit sort of range. And that's probably 20% to 30 basis points lower than what we would normally see. Our expectation is that as we get into the latter half of the year and probably more so into the fourth quarter, that they will start to rebound because there's a lot of pressure on the smaller players and the players that just don't have the capacity to be able to deal with the margins that low. But that's kind of where they're at, and our expectation is it will start to improve. It's just a matter of timing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Gerard Cassidy : On the terminal betas that you guys have been talking about on the call, it sounds like the terminal level, and please correct me if I'm wrong, is around the 65% range. Is that fair? Or is it a little lower, a little higher? Terrance Dolan : Well, that would be -- kind of on the wholesale side, it's probably just a little bit lower but kind of in that ballpark. On the Corporate Trust side, it tends to be a little bit higher because we end up having -- the substitute investment is government funds, for example, in the money market fund area or T-bills. So you have to kind of track that, but that tends to be closer to 70% to 75%. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. And could we ever see them get to 100%? I mean, in your guys' experience, because, obviously, we're in a rate environment we've not seen before being so low, could these terminal betas ever get to 100%? Andrew Cecere : Yes. This certainly isn't our expectation based upon both our experience in the business and also from a client standpoint. There is certain operating sort of need, the cash flow. And so there's a benefit to having those deposits with the bank. And so I don't think from the perspective of having to be competitive in terms of what they're accomplishing that we have to go that high. I think we're very -- we're at or very close to what -- where we need to be. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And I apologize, Terry, if you addressed this. In prior calls, you talked about the impact that the hurricanes and natural disasters had on your merchant processing and acquiring businesses. And I think you pointed out in the spring of this year, you thought that we'd get back to normal. Where are we on -- if you haven't addressed it, where are we on that kind of time line? Terrance Dolan : Yes, good follow-up. And in terms of the impact of Irma and Harvey, that has pretty much dissipated. So certainly, early in the first quarter, any effect associated with that has pretty much kind of worked its way in. Puerto Rico is much smaller for us. It really isn't that significant, but it will take more time for that to recover. Gerard Cassidy : Great. And then just lastly, you guys have addressed the commercial real estate lending, how you guys obviously have conservative underwriting standards. What are you seeing in the other areas, whether it's retail or commercial? Is there any evidence of those underwriting spendings getting a little too aggressive from your competitors that makes you wonder what they're doing? P. Parker: This is Bill. I would say not necessarily. I mean, we're in, obviously, in late stages of economic expansion and then credit cycle. We just try to keep our underwriting consistent throughout the period. There have been -- I mean, I talked about the real estate and there's a lot of activity in that long-term fixed rate pricing, which has affected our mortgage book. But on the other side, it's pretty much steady as you go. There's a lot of pricing pressure. But basically, we compete to have a full relationship and bring the other commercial products to the table. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Matthew O'Connor: I jumped on a little bit late here, but it sounds like you're not committing to lower expense growth next year, which I guess is a little surprising, given the increase in investment spend this year. But it also sounds like you expect a nice increase in revenues. So I was hoping you could kind of frame it in terms of operating leverage percent that you're targeting if things go according to plan. And I appreciate it's a year out, but I think we're all focused on the expense growth continuing to be quite high. And without having the context of the revenue expectations, it's a little -- it's not totally clear. Andrew Cecere : Sure, Matt. And this is Andy. Let me clarify a little bit. So we talked about 3% to 5% this year, at the high end of the range because of some of that increased investment we talked about. That increased investment will be in the run rate. We expect positive operating leverage this year. And going into next year, I would continue to expect that we're not going to increase our tax spend again next year. So that will be baked into the run rate, and I would expect the growth rates next year will start to migrate down within that 3% to 5% range. Matthew O'Connor: Okay. And in terms of the amount of positive operating leverage that you're targeting because it'll likely be modest this year, I think, based on the guidance and how much are you hopeful to achieve next year? Andrew Cecere : It will be modest this year and it will continue to increase as we go into 2019 and beyond because our expectation is these investments will produce the revenue that we're looking for, and that's why we're doing it. Matthew O'Connor: Okay. I know a couple of years ago, you put out some of these medium-term revenue growth targets. And I think the hope was that you would achieve that in year 3, which I think is next year. Is that something that's still possible? And remind us how much that revenue growth was. Andrew Cecere : So our revenue growth rates and our expense growth rates, we do expect to be in the ranges, that we were in the 6% to 8% range on revenue, 3% to 5% on expense. And our return numbers, we're already in that range. One thing I will mention, Matt, is that we intend to increase our ranges on our returns, given the tax situation that we're in. We'll communicate more about that. But as you saw, we're up in that range already in the middle of the range. Matthew O'Connor: Okay. So just to summarize, you are hopeful of the 6% to 8% revenue growth next year, 3% to 5% expense growth, but hopefully drifting below the high end of that 3% to 5% range? Andrew Cecere : That's our target. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Klock from Keefe, Bruyette, Woods. Brian Klock : So I just wanted to follow up a little bit on the commercial loan growth from earlier in the call. And I thought what was interesting, looking at your segment data, is I know you guys mentioned that there's still some corporate deleveraging and a lot of your peers have talked about the same issue of some large pay-downs on the corporate side. When we look at your Corporate and Commercial Banking segment, I know this is averages versus end of period, so maybe there was a difference on end of period. But the Corporate Banking and other, actually, balances were slightly up on average or up almost 3.6% year-over-year, but the middle market was actually down and it seemed like that's a trend. It's a little bit different at some of your peers. I wasn't sure if this is just an average issue or if your end-of-period balances in March were showing a different trend versus the average. So maybe we can just talk about that in that Page 10 of your supplement. Terrance Dolan : Yes. Well, when I think about kind of ending balances, on a spot basis, Brian, they are a little bit higher than the averages. So we do expect to see some momentum as we think about the second quarter. And of thinking about middle market, for us, middle market, we're continuing to grow on the commitment side. But one of the things that we have seen a little bit is just the impact of pay-downs or payoffs. And the principal driver behind that is from market to market, we see some M&A activity, and that M&A activity ends up negatively impacting some of the middle market. If you're looking across kind of all of our markets, we're seeing nice growth in at least half of them, a little bit stronger than that. And we're seeing flat sort of growth in the others. And so it kind of depends market to market and the change is from quarter-to-quarter, too. Brian Klock : Got it, got it. And I guess, my other follow-up is just on the funding side. I have been focused on the betas, and you talked about on the wholesale deposit side, the larger trust deposits getting closer to your terminal expectations. On the borrowing side, on your wholesale funding side, the borrowing piece of this, can -- Terry, can you remind us how much of that is swapped out to 3-month LIBOR? And I mean, what are your expectations on the borrowing side with either refinancings or work at the borrowing cost? Terrance Dolan : Yes. I know there's been a lot of conversation around LIBOR basis risk, et cetera, on some of the other calls. For us, we -- at the end of the first quarter, as an example, we have very little that is floating rate on 3-month LIBOR. So we don't have the same sort of basis risk to increase the 3-month LIBOR at this point. Brian Klock : Okay. So is there anything swapped out for that? Or are you saying just overall it's more fixed on that borrowing base? Terrance Dolan : Yes. Well, typically, when we go into the marketplace, it's kind of a normal cycle. We have gone about 75% fixed, 25% LIBOR or floating and tied to the 3 months. But we have substantially swapped that out to fixed at this point. Operator : And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Jen Thompson for closing remarks. Jennifer Thompson : Thank you for listening to our call this quarter. Please call us if you have any follow-up comments or questions. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

Following a review of the results by Andy Cecere, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Terry Dolan, U.S. Bancorp\u2019s Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon, EDT, through Wednesday, July 25 at 12 :00 midnight, EDT. I will now turn the conference call over to Jenn Thompson, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. Jenn Thompson : Thank you, Jack, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Andy Cecere, Terry Dolan, and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp\u2019s second quarter results and to answer your questions. Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today\u2019s call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today\u2019s presentation, in our press release, and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Andy. Andrew Cecere : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry and I will open the call up to Q&A. I\u2019ll start on Slide 3. In the second quarter, we reported record net income and record earnings per share driven by record revenue and positive operating leverage. Excluding the impact of our student loan sale, loan growth picked up compared with last quarter even as we remain disciplined in our Commercial Real Estate underwriting. On the right side of Slide 3, you can see that credit quality improved in the second quarter and our book value per share increased by 5.8% from a year-ago. During the quarter, we returned 69% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. In the second quarter, the Federal Reserve completed its annual stress tests, and once again the results confirmed our ability to withstand and remain profitable in severely adverse economic conditions. Based on the stress test results, our Board of Directors approved a 23% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.37 per common share beginning in the third quarter as well as a 15% increase in our stock repurchase authorization. Slide 4, highlights our best-in-class performance metrics, including a 19.8% return on tangible common equity. Our efficiency ratio, return on average assets, and return on average common equity all improved sequentially and on a year-over-year basis. Now let me turn the call over to Terry, who will provide more detail on the quarter as well as forward-looking guidance. Terrance Dolan : Thanks Andy. If you turn to Slide 5, I\u2019ll start with a balance sheet review and follow-up with a discussion of earnings trends. Excluding the student loans sold this quarter, average loans grew to 0.3% on a linked-quarter basis and increased 1.8% compared with the second quarter of 2017. We saw continued strength in retail portfolios such as mortgage and retail leasing. Credit card transaction volume grew, and the growth was strong and supportive of a robust fee growth. However, revolve rates have been declining, reflective of a strong economy and the strong credit quality of our customer base, which is muting balanced growth. Commercial middle-market loan growth accelerated to 2.2% sequentially in the second quarter. However, paydown activity among large corporate customers continued to be a headwind to total commercial loan growth. Line utilization remains at historical lows. However, pipelines continued to improve, and commitments grew. Clients are optimistic, and we are starting to see customers deploy deposit balances to fund business investment. While the timing of more robust CapEx activity is uncertain, we continue to expect that moderating paydowns and increased M&A closings will support improved commercial loan growth in the second half of the year. Commercial Real Estate loans declined in the second quarter, reflecting our decisions not to extend credit on unfavorable terms and elevating paydowns as customers seek alternative financing. This quarter, Commercial Real Estate contributed a 20 basis point drag to linked-quarter growth and a 140 basis point reduction to year-over-year average loan growth. Turning to Slide 6. Lower deposit growth relative to prior periods was driven by stronger economic conditions. Business customers are beginning to deploy balances to fund capital investments. Also, the impact of rising interest rates on deposit earnings credits have reduced their need to maintain non-interest bearing deposits. Finally, there is some migration of balances to interest-bearing deposits for alternative investment vehicles as customers seek higher yields. These deposit flows are consistent with our asset liability modeling expectations. Slide 7 indicates that credit quality improved in the second quarter due to improving economic conditions with customer paydowns resulting in pressure on loan balances with an improved credit profile. Notably, our non-performing assets declined 9.4% compared with the first quarter and decreased 19.1% compared with the second quarter of 2017. Slide 8 provides highlights of second quarter earnings results, including a 7.5% sequential increase in pretax income and a 5.1% increase in net income available to common. On Slide 9, linked-quarter and year-over-year net interest income growth was supported by higher interest rates and earning asset growth, which was partially offset by a shift in deposit and funding mix. Additionally, year-over-year growth was negatively impacted by tax reform, which reduced the taxable equivalent adjustment benefit related to tax exempt assets. In the second quarter, the net interest margin was 3.13%, flat with the linked-quarter, but higher by 5 basis points compared with a year-ago. The impact of tax reform on taxable equivalent earning assets hurt year-over-year net interest margin expansion by 2 basis points. Our interest-bearing deposit betas continued to perform in line with our expectations during the last few rate hikes. As future rate hikes occur, we continue to expect our deposit beta will trend toward a 50% level, which compares with the current level about 45%. The betas on our commercial and trust deposit basis, which represent about half of our total deposits, are in line with their estimated terminal betas. We expect that movement in the overall beta going forward will primarily be driven by our consumer deposit base. Slide 10 highlights trends in non-interest income. On a year-over-year basis, we had strong growth in payments revenue and trust and investment management revenue, partially by a decrease in commercial product revenue and mortgage banking revenue. Mortgage revenue was affected by lower refinancing activity and lower gain on sale margins. Treasury management fees declined, reflecting the impact of changes in earnings credit, which is typical in a rising rate environment. Looking closer at our payments business on a year-over-year basis, we had strong growth in credit and debit card revenue and double-digit growth in our corporate payment products revenue, each reflecting higher sales volumes. It's worth noting that this quarter mark the best revenue growth performance in corporate payments in over seven years. Merchant processing revenue growth continued to be impacted by our exits from two joint ventures last year, but we continue to expect that it will return to a mid single-digit growth pace by the third quarter of 2018. Merchant acquiring sales volumes continue to support our expectations. Trust and investment management growth, fee growth was driven by business growth and favorable market conditions. Turning to Slide 11, non-interest expense increased 1% on a linked-quarter basis and 3.4% on the year-over-year basis in line with our expectation. Compensation expense increased principally due to the impact of hiring to support business growth and compliance programs, merit increases and higher variable compensation related to business production. Notably within non-personnel expenses, professional service expense declined from a year-ago, primarily due to fewer consulting services as compliance programs near maturity. We expect compliance related cost to continue to moderate through the year. In addition, mortgage service and related costs are declining due to favorable economic conditions. Slide 12 highlights our capital position, at June 30, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach was 9.1%. This compares to our capital target of 8.5%. I will now provide some forward-looking guidance. For the third quarter, we expect fully taxable equivalent, net interest income to increase in the low single-digit range on a year-over-year basis. We expect fee revenue to increase in a low single-digit range year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage in the third quarter and for the full-year of 2018. We expect credit quality to remain relatively stable, compared with the second quarter. Our year-over-year tax rate on a taxable equivalent basis is estimated to be 21%. I\u2019ll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks. Andrew Cecere : Thanks Terry. We are building on a firm foundation and I'll leave you with two goals, our entire management team is focused on as we head into the second half of 2018. Number one, growing revenues while maintaining our credit discipline. We are willing to forego growth in areas where the risk-reward dynamics don't make sense, like certain areas commercial real estate or higher risk leverage lending in the corporate space. Risk management is a core competency, but this is not mean, we will forgo revenue growth. We have a broad enough set of businesses that enable us to efficiently and dynamically allocate capital to areas where we expect the best growth and risk adjusted returns. We are optimistic about our ability to continue to gain share in both retail lending and commercial lending. And as paydown pressure subside and existing pipelines are funded that market share growth will be evident. I feel very good about the outlook for our fee businesses. Momentum is building in retail and corporate payment services, wealth management and trust and investment services, and we expect the third quarter to mark an inflection point in merchant servicing revenue. Cyclical headwinds facing mortgage will abate over time and we are positioning that business to thrive in the purchase mortgage market. Number two, our management team is focused on investing for the future while delivering positive operating leverage. As we discussed previously, we are stepping up our business investment in digital-first capabilities, revenue enhancing initiatives and business automation as we position this company for the future. These investments enable us to stay at the forefront in banking and will drive improving operating leverage over the next several years. However, we are mindful that we need to manage expenses for whatever revenue environment we are operating in and we are in committed to delivering positive operating leverage this year and going forward. In closing, I\u2019m pleased with our second quarter results and I am optimistic as I look out to the remainder of this year and beyond. I want to thank our employees for their hard work and commitment to serving our customers and earning their trust every day. That concludes our formal remarks. Terry, Bill and I will now be happy to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Your line is open. John McDonald : Hi. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask a little bit about expenses and operating leverage. It looks like you delivered about 10 basis points of positive operating leverage this quarter, which is an improvement and I was just wondering when you look ahead to the third and fourth quarter, would you expect increased magnitude of operating leverage? Do you expect that to widen out? And if so, what would be the drivers? Terrance Dolan : Yes. John, this is Terry Dolan. Thanks for the question. When we end up looking for the third and fourth quarter, I think that we will deliver positive operating leverage, although I think it will still be relatively narrow. We do expect that as we kind of get into 2019 and into 2020 that that wedge of revenue growth versus expenses will start to widen and toward that 2% to 3%, which is a part of our long-term growth expectations, but for the balance of 2018, we would expect it to be fairly narrow. John McDonald : Okay. And just on that point, Terry for this year, the expenses this quarter came in a little better than expected. Does that help you to get in a little closer to the lower end of the 3% to 5% expense range for this year? Or you still expecting the high-end and does that forecast for this year include any change in the FDIC surcharge for the end of this year? Terrance Dolan : Yes. With respect to the FDIC charge, we're really expecting that. We're going to have to continue to pay that through the balance of the year. But coming back to expenses, we recognize just like the rest of the industry that we're kind of in a transitional period with respect to tax reform. And I would say that just \u2013 as put some challenges with respect to loan growth and as a result revenue growth. And as Andy and I have said, we're always balancing short-term versus long-term and I would say with respect to the second quarter and the balance the year, well we're going to continue to make investments in those long-term digital capabilities and strategic areas of focus. We're going to be very disciplined with respect to looking at discretionary spend and areas where we cut back and so we're definitely going to be managed to the lower end and with respect to our expectations to revenue growth at that point. John McDonald : Okay. So this year you are still looking at kind of upper end of the 3% to 5% expense range and then next year\u2026? Terrance Dolan : No, we are at the lower end of the range. Andrew Cecere : Lower end. John McDonald : Got it. Okay, good. This trend \u2013 this quarter comes in better, so you are looking at lower end this year and then next year as well? Terrance Dolan : Yes. John McDonald : Okay. Got it. Thanks guys. Andrew Cecere : Thanks John. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Andrew Cecere : Hi, Matt. Good morning Matthew O'Connor: Just to follow-up on the expenses. Obviously a positive messaging on slowing the growth and you mentioned working towards the 2% to 3% operating leverage in 2019 and 2020. Is that \u2013 when you say working towards, are you hoping to be in that range next year, if I can try and pinpoint you on that? Or is that something that's going to take a couple years to get to the 2% to 3% operating leverage? Terrance Dolan : Yes. I think that, that is \u2013 we're starting from something that\u2019s very narrow, so it's going to take some time in order for us to be able to get there. But I would expect continued improvement in quarters as we go sequentially throughout 2019 Matt. Matthew O'Connor: Okay. So maybe like a 1% to 2% operating leverage next year and then in 2020 you're thinking the 2% to 3%. Is that a reasonable thought process? Terrance Dolan : We\u2019ll continue to make improvements. That\u2019s going to depend on the revenue outlook, which is going to be very dependent upon loan growth and the economy overall. We're going to manage that positive. We\u2019re going to manage to expanding that positive. Matthew O'Connor: Okay. And then just separately on the net interest margin. Obviously, flat NIM linked-quarter. Is there still leverage to rates going up? The curve isn\u2019t helping, but just talk about kind of the NIM trajectory not just next quarter, but as we think through the next few quarters, what some of the puts and takes are there and if there's an upward bias or think about it being flat? Terrance Dolan : Yes. So again, for the second quarter, we were flat first quarter at 3.13%, but else being equal, we would have expected that to expand by a couple of basis points during the quarter. But there are a couple of different things that I would just point out. First is in the credit card space and it tends to fluctuate, but if revolve rates were a little lower during the quarter and that ended up impacting NIM relative to kind of what we were expecting. Second is that we sold a student loan portfolio, and that had an effect. And then the third is that we took the opportunity early in the quarter to hedge some of our LIBOR-based long-term debt and fix it, and that had a time zero hit or impact to us, but it should help us a little bit as we think about the future. Those three things really represent 2 basis points and so that hopefully helps kind of frame it. We think about the third quarter and into the fourth quarter, we do expect and believe there's opportunity for NIM expansion. Our securities portfolio continues to be accretive in that 100 basis points to 125 basis points as we\u2019re replacing securities. As loans grow and we have an outlook that loan \u2013 our loan outlook is that loans will grow. And with that and the right mix of loans, we would expect to see margin expansion as well. So we do think there's opportunity for that. Matthew O'Connor: Okay. Thank you. Terrance Dolan : Thanks Matt. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Andrew Cecere : Good morning. Terrance Dolan : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Couple questions. One on the loan growth outlook. I'm hearing that you are very clearly retaining credit quality. And so my question is, is that \u2013 does that drive to a slightly slower outlook than you've been delivering? In other words, is there a narrowing of the credit box that has an impact? Or is there a narrowing of the credit box that has potentially runoffs increasing in the loan book? Andrew Cecere : Betsy, this is Andy. And the short answer to your question is no. We're not narrowing the credit box. We\u2019re remaining disciplined as we always have been, and in fact, we have confidence that loan growth will accelerate. Our pipelines are as strong as they've been in a long time. The impacts that we think from a tax reform are starting to dissipate. The consumer spend numbers are high. Corporate payment spend activity is high, payables and T&E. So there's a lot of confidence out there, and I think, actually, loan growth will accelerate. Betsy Graseck : Okay. So the NII up low single-digit year-on-year is more about NIM as opposed to loan growth is that accurate? Andrew Cecere : No, I mean, I think that is kind of a combination of both. I mean if you remember in the first quarter, we were growing at 0.1%. Now we\u2019re at 0.3%. And we're going to continue to see that expand and improve. But it's not going to go hog wild in the third quarter. I mean, we would say that it's going to be moderately growing in the third quarter. So that\u2019s kind of our expectation. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Got it. So some of the trimming of \u2013 around the edges, like in the student loan book or \u2013 I mean, we saw some shrinkage in CRE. Is that pretty much over at the stage? Andrew Cecere : Well, student loan book is no longer in the numbers, actually. The CRE probably will continue to lag because of what we're seeing in the marketplace and that's an area that we're not becoming more disciplined or tightening of credit box, but we have been more disciplined historically, and we\u2019ll continue to maintain that. Betsy Graseck : Yes. I get that Andy. And on the student loan piece, my question was really more about other portfolios that you would be looking to trim? Or are you finished with\u2026 Andrew Cecere : Yes. Betsy, we\u2019re \u2013 obviously we\u2019re always looking at different alternatives and different things to look at, especially portfolios that might be in runoff status and don't have any long-term strategic benefit to the company. But there's nothing that is on the immediate horizon that we would point to, right? Betsy Graseck : Okay. And the faster growth in C&I that you've got this quarter is part of the optimism on the loan growth from here? Andrew Cecere : Yes, that\u2019s particularly true, Betsy, in the middle market, what just Terry mentioned in his remarks was up 2.2% on a linked-quarter growth. We\u2019re seeing strong activity there. Terrance Dolan : Yes. And then I think the other positive thing about that is that, that growth we're seeing really across many markets is fairly broad-based at this particular point in time. And the effect of paydowns was dissipated in that space as well. The other thing I would add is that our community banking markets saw some nice growth in the second quarter. We would expect that to continue in the third. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks so much. Andrew Cecere : Thanks Betsy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open. John Pancari : Good morning. Andrew Cecere : Hey, John. How are you doing? John Pancari : All right. On the loan growth side, back to commercial, end-of-period balance came in above the average balance? Is that a better number to work off of? Is that level sustainable in terms of where we\u2019ll grow off of? Andrew Cecere : Yes, I mean what I would say John is that certainly when you end up looking at ending versus average, we started to see strength in the latter half of the second quarter and in all the different factors that we ended up talking about, we also saw paydown starting to dissipate a little bit more in the second half of the second quarter. So I think that that is a good way of looking at the loan growth outlook. John Pancari : Okay, good. And then any impact that you\u2019re seeing on the \u2013 from tariffs on commercial demand? Bill Parker : Not on demand. This is Bill. You can read in the papers, the specific companies that maybe impacted, but we have not seen that in any kind of \u2013 even that in the industry level. We really have not seen any impact of the tariffs. So obviously we continue to monitor closely. But if it stays at this level, we don\u2019t really anticipate any impact. John Pancari : Okay, all right. And then lastly on the deposit side, just want to get a bit more color on the deposit moves in the quarter that you saw, I know end-of-period balance is down 1% flat on an average basis. Is there \u2013 are you starting to see a pick-up in the shifts in deposits and anything else that\u2019s impacting the growth and what your outlook would be there as well would be helpful? Terrance Dolan : Yes, on the deposit side again, what I would say is that whether its betas or whether it's just the flow of deposits, it\u2019s very much in line with the way we have been modeling our asset liability sensitivities, so there really hasn't been any unusual expectations. We've always said that corporate or commercial deposits, we will start to see outflows when the economy gets stronger and I think we're seeing that. We're not seeing a lot of rotation, and in fact, we are seeing growth in the consumer side, which is good to see. And then our corporate trust balances, especially in the second quarter because of timing of bond payments and that sort of thing turns to fluctuate a lot. So I guess where I'd leave it is that everything is really on track with respect to our expectations. John Pancari : Okay, got it. Thanks, Terry. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open. Kenneth Usdin : Thanks a lot. Hey guys, a couple small ones. Can you help us understand how much NII went to weigh with the student loan sale and how much was in that other fee line related to the gain? Terrance Dolan : Yes, I would say that the gain impact is very insignificant, and if you've seen other student loan portfolio sales, you don't see a significant premium with respect to that. So gain was very small. And from a net interest income standpoint, again kind of coming back to my point around 2 basis points, I mean you can kind of back into that in being about the third of that overall equation. Kenneth Usdin : Okay. And then so that's means in other fees than \u2013 but you had with the VC/PE stuff pretty big again, outsize would you say? Terrance Dolan : Well, that that category tends to be pretty lumpy and there's a lot of different things that end up going into in terms of retail product revenue, insurance sales, insurance product sales, everything. So it's not any one particular item in the second quarter that really has caused that to move. Kenneth Usdin : Okay, got it. On the expense side, just one question about the third quarter comps, now that we've gotten a couple quarters into the post tax reform changes. Do you expect the seasonal upward trend in the tax benefit related expenses and that's included in your kind of operating leverage guide because I just try to understand if you're saying low single-digit NII and low single-digit fees that kind of means low single-digit expenses and that's inclusive of any bump up in the tax advantage expense? Terrance Dolan : Absolutely. There will be a bump up. There always is because of those seasonality of that particular business and a lot of tax credit projects been completed in the third and fourth quarter, particularly late in the fourth quarter, but yes it absolutely includes everything. Kenneth Usdin : Okay. And last one, are you expecting \u2013 in terms of the year operating leverage? Are you expecting the FDIC to go out by year end, if so can you help us size what you think it will be? Terrance Dolan : Well, the FDIC surcharge, we expect that it's going to continue through at least the end of the year and as I look into 2019, they say they're going to pull it back, but at this particular point in time, who knows. Andrew Cecere : The guidance we\u2019ve been giving is not assuming any change in the FDIC. Kenneth Usdin : Right, okay. So there's the positive operating leverage even with that staying in there. Got it, thank you. Andrew Cecere : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Andrew Cecere : Hi, Erika. How are you doing? Erika Najarian : Good. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about your comments on corporate payments and one of the strongest quarters you\u2019ve absorbed. Is that a leading indicator for the rest of the year and sort of what's the lag in terms of that being a potential leading indicator for corporate activity on the financing side? Andrew Cecere : Erika, that\u2019s a great question. And we look at that corporate payments spend, especially on the commercial side as a leading indicator with respect to basically corporate confidence and their willingness to spend on both discretionary items as well as capital expenditures. So the fact is that is growing, gives us more confidence that when we look into the future that they have confidence that business continues to expand and grow and that's part of the calculus as we kind of think about the loan outlook. Terrance Dolan : And Erika just to give you some numbers, the sales volume growth, spend volume so to speak, this quarter versus year-ago were up 11.7% and a year-ago those numbers were 6.4%, so it's almost doubled in terms of the activity from a corporate spend perspective. Erika Najarian : That was helpful. Thank you. On the consumer side, Andy you talked about confidence in terms of growing both corporate and consumer, could you remind us a little bit about your offering in the premium card space? I know one of your larger peers just introduced a premium card that's available outside of their deposit network, which is unusual for them, but just wondering sort of what you're observing about competitive dynamics and how you think your premium card is positioned and what the take up has been with your customer base? Andrew Cecere : We have a full array of card products, including a premium card that we call the Altitude Card. The Altitude Card is principally for core customers already with U.S. Bank, and then the uptake has been tremendous. It's a great card. One of the attributes of that card is the mobile component and it has multiple points and rewards. And so it is really intended to the choice to be first in your mobile or digital wallet and the uptake has been very positive. Erika Najarian : And just lastly on the comments earlier about the consumer deposit pricing really driving deposit rates from here. I\u2019m wondering if you could give us an update on potentially launching a national product and what products would you lead with and sort of what you've observed with regards to competition picking up or not picking up on the retail side. Andrew Cecere : Yes. We have a number of initiatives underway, Erika. But the one I'd highlight is really trying to extend beyond our current branch geographic 25-state positioning beyond that where we already have a customer base. So we are a national player in both our mortgage lending as well as our auto lending through our indirect network. And our opportunity is to expand the relationship with those customers. We already have a relationship with the U.S. Bank through mortgage or indirect to include depository and other opportunities in terms of bank products and that's where our focus is. Erika Najarian : Just to clarify, I\u2019ll have to \u2013 you\u2019re marketing directly to your national clients or outside of the 25-state geography that already have a products are similar to card, this is something that\u2019s \u2013 for your current client base, and it's not necessarily available to somebody that was just going on bankrate.com and shopping for a money market account or CD? Andrew Cecere : They certainly could do that. But our focus in terms of [leveraging] growth is against the current customer base because again, they already have a relationship with the U.S. Bank. It's not a full bank relationship. It's typically a single product relationship, typically a mortgage or an auto loan and our opportunities to expand upon that relationship. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you. Andrew Cecere : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Mike Mayo : Hi. I have one cyclical question and one structural question. The cyclical question, you seem to be very positive about the economy. I guess, I think I heard you correctly, accelerating loan growth and corporate spend and payments is twice as fast as a year-ago. So given that view, do you think that the yield curve will steepen? And do you back up that view with how you position the balance sheet? Or the big debate about the flatter yield curve, does it foreshadow a downturn, but it seems like you're saying the opposite, so you kind of make investments to go against the recent movement in the yield curve? Andrew Cecere : So Mike I\u2019m going to start and then ask Terry to add on. I do think we do have confidence in the economy from small business to middle market to large corporate, confidence is up. Activity is up. On the consumer side of the equation, spend is up and activity is up there too. So we do have confidence, pipelines are strong. We talk to our leaders and our lenders and they\u2019re talking to their customers. Things are very positive. Credit is very good as you know. So those are all positive indicators. The yield curve does say something different today and there could be other components to that that\u2019s driving that differential. And Terry \u2013 from a positioning standpoint, we're not assuming that there's going to be a steepening in the short-term. Terrance Dolan : Right. That's exactly right. So when we are looking at our interest rate modeling and are looking at our forecast with respect to revenue growth et cetera, we're continuing to assume that the yield curve remains fairly flat as the short end rises. If you end up looking at the spread between two-year and 10-year treasury, we're kind of expecting that, it's going to stay in that ballpark and not really changing that perspective. Mike Mayo : Well, it's not a disconnect. I mean, you seem pretty [bulled] up on the economy, which would imply a steeper yield curve. Or are you just being conservative? Or are you assuming tactical QE factors still stay in place? Andrew Cecere : Well, I think that until we actually see the yield curve steepening, I think we're going to be \u2013 the way we model and the way we think about forecasting, we're just going to be conservative and take that point of view. Mike Mayo : Okay. And then the structural question, to follow-up on the last line of discussion. So this strategy to expand outside of your 25-state network to cross-sell to mortgage and auto customers that could potentially take you to all 50 states or most of the states and what gives you confidence that that strategy will succeed. And the opposite of that strategy, it seems like everyone's doing a national digital bank now, from Citigroup, PNC, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and we tend to hear Minneapolis pop up every now and then. So these competitors from a thousand miles away are coming into Minneapolis trying to cross-sell to customers in your backyard. So I guess, the question is how do you defend against those other banks that are coming to your backyard to try to steal away your customers and how do you think you can go ahead and cross-sell to your customers where you don't have a branch presence? Andrew Cecere : So Mike, I will tell you in Minneapolis and in our core markets, we have not seen movement or lost customer base, either on the wholesale or in the consumer side from some of these new entrants. I\u2019ll start there. Secondly, while you can enter all the states, we're going to focus on a few, and we're going to continue to test, learn, and try different things. Number three, as I think if you go into a market without a customer base and you either compete on price or product you could get negative selection. So that's why we're focused on current customers, who already have a relationship with the bank, who we can expand that relationship with other products and services, because they already have U.S. Bank as part of their wallet, so to speak, part of their relationship. We think that's the way to do it, and again, we're focused on a few markets as we started out and we'll continue to update you on the results as we go forward. Mike Mayo : Okay. And when did you start this recent initiative? Is it like\u2026 Andrew Cecere : This year. We're starting it this year. Mike Mayo : Okay. Great. All right. Thanks a lot. Andrew Cecere : You bet, Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Kevin Barker : Good morning. Andrew Cecere : Hi, Kevin. Good morning. Kevin Barker : In regards to some of the outlook for revenue growth, and obviously, you expect a flattening yield curve, is there any acceleration of deposit betas beyond what you've already seen within your numbers? And do you expect asset yields to continue to move higher despite the flattening yield curve? Terrance Dolan : Yes. So on the deposit side, as we said in the \u2013 some of the remarks, when you end up looking at the commercial corporate world and you look at corporate trust or deposit. We really feel that those are at kind of their terminal betas and so as rates move up, we would move kind of block step with it. But we wouldn't necessarily see an expansion or narrowing to that. The real question is more on the consumer side of the equation. Consumer beta is there kind of in that 15% range and they will typically migrate towards 30%. But the question is over what period of time? We haven't seen a lot of pressure. The pressure is there. It is more on the affluent side, which we've been responsive too. And we price in a lot of different markets and so we keep our ear to the ground so to speak, but it really come down to how quickly consumer deposits move. On the asset side, as we have talked in the past, our \u2013 if you end up looking at our balance sheet, we benefit both on the short-end and on the long-end about 50/50. As rates continue to move up, I think that there's opportunity there. The other thing I would say is again coming back to our securities portfolio \u2013 will continue to be accretive for several quarters, many quarters. And as the residential mortgage portfolio rotates and some of our longer-term assets rotate, we'll see accretive benefit associated with that as well. Kevin Barker : Great. Thank you. And then regards to mortgage banking question, I noticed that the origination numbers quarter-over-quarter appear to show that you\u2019ve let market share to go. Are you making a conscious decision to pullback from the market, given the competitive dynamics that are occurring right now in the mortgage space? Andrew Cecere : Yes. In the mortgage space, our app volume on a linked-quarter basis was actually up about 8%. And so we continue to, I think feel like we're in a pretty good spot in taking market share. I will tell you that it's very competitive, margins are thin. There's a lot of capacity that\u2019s out there. But we have shifted our focus more toward purchase mortgages. We started that about two years ago, two, three years ago. We also focused on the retail channel. The margins tend to be better in the retail channel. I think what you are seen in the industry is really more on the correspondence side, where the margins have been very thin and people have been kind of pulling back and we're from a pricing standpoint. We're remaining competitive, but just given where margins are. We're being prudent about that as well. Kevin Barker : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Vivek Juneja : Hi. Andrew Cecere : Hi, Vivek. Vivek Juneja : Hi, and thanks for taking the questions. A couple of questions here, corporate payments, I wanted to get a little more granularity. How's government spend been doing, Andy, Terry? I know you've talked that in the past\u2026? Andrew Cecere : Yes. Government spend is also up, Vivek, as spend year-over-year was up 9.8% in the second quarter of 2018. That compares to relatively flat or even down 1% last year. So that is also strengthening. Vivek Juneja : Okay. And how does the fee rate on that, Andy, compare with the rest of corporate payments? Andrew Cecere : The fees on both our substantial are fine. There hasn't been a decline in those. So you can see that the revenue for both have also increased in the same relative vein. So commercial spend volumes were up 11.7% and the revenue was up 12%. The government spend was up 9.8%, and revenue was up 11.8%. Terrance Dolan : Yes. On the government side Vivek, remember that those contracts tend to be very long-term and so from a pricing perspective, you see the pressure when the contract get renegotiated, but generally during the term they stay pretty consistent. Andrew Cecere : And they\u2019re relatively comparable for that between the two. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Another one cards, you talked about the decrease in revolvers. How much of that do you think is coming from just this increased price competition in the industry from promotional balances? Terrance Dolan : I wouldn't necessarily attribute it as much to that and I think that what we end up seeing when the economy gets stronger and consumer confidence goes up, you ended tend to see more spend, but balances the revolve rate actually comes down a little bit, simply because people have the capacity to be able to make those payments. Then I think the other thing that we are seeing right now is just with tax reform, there's a little more cash in people's pockets and they're taking that opportunity to reduce the revolving part of their balances. So I think it's probably more so that than anything. Andrew Cecere : And Terry, I'd add the high quality nature of our portfolio. Terrance Dolan : Yes, for us. Yes. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Thank you. Andrew Cecere : Sure. Terrance Dolan : Thanks, Vivek. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Your line is open. Andrew Cecere : Hey, Saul. Saul Martinez : Hi. Good morning, guys. A couple questions, first clarification on your comments on deposit betas, so Terry you mentioned that going forward you would expect around 50%, it was around 45%, I think this quarter. So should we take that as meaning the 12 basis points increase in deposit cost you saw this quarter more or less with future hikes that sort of the magnitude we should be thinking about in terms of increased deposit costs? Terrance Dolan : It\u2019s a reasonable assumption, yes. Saul Martinez : Okay. And that bakes in \u2013 that already bakes in the increase in the consumer deposit beta you mentioned from 15% to 30%. You mean you mentioned the commercial and I guess, trust already \u2013 the corporate trust is already up terminal beta? Terrance Dolan : Yes. I would say that currently, it's at 15% and it\u2019s going to continue. The question is over what period of time? I don't know if it'll be in the next rate hike after that. So it's kind of from a timing standpoint. Those betas will move up a little bit to 12, maybe 13 basis points for a 25 basis point movement et cetera, but it's not going to be dramatic anymore I don't think. Saul Martinez : Okay. But you don't think it's a big meaningful move up from here, from the starting point? Terrance Dolan : No, we don\u2019t. Saul Martinez : Okay. And then a follow-up on the discussion on sustainable positive operating leverage of 200 basis points to 300 basis points. I know it take some time to get there, but your long \u2013 I think that's based on the assumption of 6% to 8% revenue growth long-term, 3% to 5% cost growth and that's how you get to 200 basis point to 300 basis point. But to the extent revenue growth doesn't materialize in that fashion? How much room do you have to manage expenses down below that 3% to 5% range and keep that 200 basis points to 300 basis points? Terrance Dolan : Yes. Saul, way I would kind of think about is not only from a revenue standpoint, but as we continue to make investments in digital capabilities, those digital capabilities are going to offer us opportunities to be able to streamline or improve our cost basis or cost structure as well. So I think it\u2019s really kind of a \u2013 we have to think about it from both sides of the equation, I think as everything over the next three years or so. Saul Martinez : Got it. So does that mean if the revenue backdrop doesn't materialize because I think most of us probably don't have 6% to 8% revenue growth in our model for most banks? Should I take that answer saying is meaning you can manage it down below that or you just have investments you need to make and cost growth is going to be sort of within that range regardless of the revenue environment? Andrew Cecere : So I think Saul, the easy way to think about it is the higher the revenue growth the wider that wedge between revenue and expense will be. To the extent, the revenue growth is narrow that wedge will be in a more narrow because it's just going to be a function of revenue growth in the long-term. Saul Martinez : Okay. All right. Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Andrew Cecere : Hey, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Terry. Good morning, Andy. Can you guys give us a little more color on the commercial loan book? Obviously, you pointed out that the Commercial Real Estate outstandings came down due to paydowns, but also underwriting standards that are not up to your standard. If you look at it carefully, how much went \u2013 the decline? How much was due to the paydown versus underwriting standards? And then in commercial lending, C&I lending, I think you said you also had some paydowns. Where is the outside money coming? Is it other banks taking those loans or is it the private equity market shadow banking industry? Bill Parker : Yes. So this is Bill. SO on commercial real estate, where we lose balances is in what we call the standing loans or longer term mortgages and that's the area that's gotten aggressive really in terms of terms and rate. Many of that outside the banking community and so that's where we've seen the runoff. The other big portion in CRE is construction lending. We remain very, very active there. We haven't seen \u2013 it\u2019s been relatively stable. It hasn\u2019t really seen a runoff. But that's an area that we remain very active, very \u2013 add great value to clients. We watch the markets carefully, but for good clients will continue to do the construction lending. And then on a C&I side, that's really more a function \u2013 some of the larger M&A deals, but we\u2019ve seen good pipeline growth coming into the end of the quarter and into this quarter. So we anticipate that that paydown activity should subside as we see more M&A transactions closed, in addition to \u2013 as was previously mentioned, some of the kind of core growth in our community and middle market books. Gerard Cassidy : Bill, as a follow-up to that, your comments about the term commercial real estate mortgage market, can you compare it today the terms that are being used to 2005, 2006? Is it that stretched or we're not there yet in those types of... Bill Parker : No, I think it\u2019s \u2013 I would say it's not that stretched, but it more a function of the length of term and rate that people are offering. Our bank \u2013 and specifically we\u2019re not interested in doing a fixed rate 15-year loans. That\u2019s just does not fit well with our models, so \u2013 but there are whether it's the securitization market that can accommodate that or insurance companies can accommodate that. Gerard Cassidy : Great. And then as a general question, Terry, you touched upon the operating expense growth being at the lower end of the 3% to 5% range that you gave us? Have you guys seen any \u2013 we hear a lot nationally about the employment situation, very strong, maybe a labor shortage in certain markets and certain industries. Do you guys see any of that in your commercial bank with office \u2013 loan officers or branch managers? And if you don't see it, is there something on the horizon that makes you a little nervous that you could see it in 12 months if the economy turns out to be as strong as we all hope? Andrew Cecere : Yes, I think \u2013 this is Andy. I think what we actually \u2013 it\u2019s taking longer to fill positions. And so I would say that there's a bit of a tightening labor market and that's impacting our hiring. It\u2019s not substantially increasing pay yet, but I do think that could happen. But right now it's just taking longer to fill positions. Gerard Cassidy : I appreciate that. Thank you, Andy. End of Q& A Operator : There are no further questions at this time.

Following a review of the results by Andy Cecere, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Terry Dolan, U.S. Bancorp\u2019s Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon, Eastern Daylight Time, through Wednesday, October 24th at 12 :00 midnight, Eastern Daylight Time. I will now turn the conference call over to Jenn Thompson, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. Please go ahead. Jenn Thompson : Thank you, Casey and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Andy Cecere and Terry Dolan are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp\u2019s third quarter results and to answer your questions. Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. I'd like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today\u2019s call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page two of today\u2019s presentation, in our press release, and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Andy. Andrew Cecere : Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry and I will be opening up the call to Q&A. Let me begin on slide three. In the third quarter, we reported record net income and earnings per share driven by record revenue and positive operating leverage. In line with our expectations, loan growth accelerated in the third quarter, supported by continued strength in consumer lending and a pickup in commercial loan growth. On the right side of slide three, you can see that credit quality improved in the third quarter and our book value per share increased by 5.3% from year ago. During the third quarter, we returned 78% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Slide four highlights our best-in-class performance metrics including a 19.9% return on tangible common equity. Our efficiency ratio, return on average assets, and return on average common equity all improved sequentially and on a year-on-year basis. Now, let me turn the call over to Terry, who will provide more detail on the quarter as well as forward-looking guidance. Terrance Dolan : Thanks Andy. If you turn to slide five, I'll start with the balance sheet review and follow-up with the discussion of earnings trends. Average loan grew 0.9% on a linked-quarter basis and increased 1.8% on a year-over-year basis excluding the impact of a student loan portfolio sale in the second quarter. We saw continued growth in retail portfolios such as mortgage and retail leasing. Credit card loan growth was supported by expansion in both the number of active accounts and sales per active account. We are seeing good momentum in digital acquisitions across platforms. As expected, commercial loan growth accelerated in the third quarter following modest growth in the first half of the year. Pipelines remain strong and we are seeing CapEx investment and M&A activity among our corporate clients. Alternative funding sources such as the capital markets and companies own cash balances are limiting the clients' need to access the loan markets, but to a lesser extent, than during the last several quarters. As investment spending gains traction and companies worked through their cash balances and tax repatriation, we expect commercial loan growth to continue to improve. Consistent with the past several quarters, commercial real estate loans declined reflecting our decisions not to extend credit as unfavorable terms and continued pay downs as customers seek alternative financing. This quarter, excluding the impact of a student loan sale, commercial real estate contributed a 27 basis point drag to linked-quarter growth and a 122 basis point reduction to year-over-year loan growth. While pay down activity remains a headwind, it is gradually diminishing in intensity and we expect the trend to continue. Turning to slide six, deposits declined 1.4% on a linked-quarter basis. This included the impact of an anticipated balance migration related to the business merger of a large financial client, which represents about half of the balance decline. This impact is expected to moderate in the fourth quarter. About half of our deposits are retail customer balances within our consumer and business banking business line where we saw a 0.7% linked-quarter increase in average deposits, driven by a 2.7% increase in non-interest-bearing deposits. Within corporate and commercial banking, our business customers are deploying the deposit balances to support growth and are migrating balances to alternative investment vehicles. This drove some of the decline this quarter. Additionally our corporate trust business saw seasonal declines in deposit balances associated with the timing of the receipt and distribution of funds. These deposit flows are consistent with our asset liability modeling expectations. Slide seven indicates that credit quality improved in the third quarter due to improving economic conditions with customer pay downs resulting in pressure on loan balances, but an improved credit profile. Notably our non-performing assets declined 8.0% compared with the second quarter and decreased 19.7% compared with the third quarter of 2017. Slide eight provides highlights of third quarter earnings results including a 3.9% increase in diluted earnings per share on a linked-quarter basis. On slide nine, linked-quarter and year-over-year net interest income growth was supported by higher interest rates and earning asset growth which was partly offset by a shift in deposit and funding mix. Year-over-year growth was negatively impacted by tax reform which reduced the taxable equivalent adjustment benefit related to tax exempt assets. In the third quarter, the net interest margin was 3.15%, up two basis points linked-quarter and one basis point compared with the year ago. The impact of tax reform and taxable equivalent earning assets year-over-year and net interest margin expansion by two basis points. Our interest-bearing deposit betas continue to perform in line with our expectations during the last few rate hikes. As future rate hikes continue, we expect -- we continue to expect the deposit beta will trend toward 50%, which compares with the current level of about 45%. The betas on our commercial and deposit -- and trust deposit basis, which represents about half of our total deposits, are in line with our estimated terminal betas. We expect that movement in the overall beta going forward will primarily be driven by our consumer deposit base. Slide 10 highlights trends in non-interest income. On a year-over-year basis, we had strong growth in payments revenue and trust and investment management revenue partially offset by a decrease in commercial product revenue, mortgage banking revenue, and treasury management fees. Commercial product revenue pressure reflected market dynamics in corporate bond underwriting and loan syndications. Mortgage revenue was affected by lower refinancing activity and lower gain on sale margins. Despite lingering market headwinds, we expect the year-over-year decline in mortgage banking revenue to moderate in the fourth quarter. We are well-positioned as a waning refi market transitions to a more robust purchase mortgage market. We are optimistic that gain on sale margins in this business have stabilized and will expand as excess capacity leaves the origination market. The decline in treasury management fees reflects the impact of changes in earnings credits which is typical in a rising rate environment. Turning to our payments business, we had strong growth in credit and debit card revenue and double-digit growth in corporate payment revenue each reflecting higher sales volumes. As we have been signaling for several quarters, merchant promising revenue return to mid-single-digit base in the third quarter as we lapped the impact from the exit of joint ventures in the second quarter of 2017. Merchant acquiring sales volume growth continues to be strong. We expect merchant processing revenue to continue to strengthen in the fourth quarter of 2018. Trust and investment management revenue growth was driven by business growth as well as favorable market conditions. Turning to slide 11, non-interest expense decreased 1.3% on a linked-quarter basis, partly reflecting typical seasonality and increased 1.5% on a year-over-year basis. Compensation expense increased principally due to the impact of hiring to support business growth and compliance programs, merit increases, and higher variable compensation related to business production. Notably within non-personnel expenses, professional services expense declined from year ago primarily due to fewer consulting services as compliance programs near maturity where we expect compliance related cost to continue to moderate through the year. Other expense declined from a year ago due to lower deposit insurance and litigation costs as well as a reduction in cost related tax advantaged projects as we syndicate tax credits in the secondary market. Slide 12 highlights our capital position. At September 30th, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach was 9.0%. This compares to our capital target of 8.5%. I'll now provide some forward looking guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect fully taxable equivalent net interest income increased in the low single-digits on a year-over-year basis strengthening from the third quarter growth rate. We expect fee revenue to increase in the low to mid-single-digits year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage on a core basis in the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2018. We expect credit quality to remain relatively stable compared with the third quarter. Now, I'll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks. Andrew Cecere : Thanks Terry. The second half of 2018 is shaping up as we had anticipated and momentum is building on our core businesses as we head into the end of the year. We expect the loan growth to continue to accelerate in the fourth quarter and our fee businesses remain on a good trajectory. Merchant acquiring revenue growth is gaining momentum and our other two payments businesses, retail card issuing and corporate payment services, are firing on all cylinders. In wealth management and investment services, we are benefiting from favorable market conditions even as we continue to grow new accounts and reap the benefits of our strong market position in corporate trust. We remain diligent in our focus on managing expenses for whatever revenue environment we are operating in and we are committed to delivering positive operating leverage in the upcoming quarter for the full year 2018 and 2019. We manage our company for the long-term while balancing shorter term financial objectives. This approach means that we will be prudent with expense management, but continue to make traditional investments in our businesses and accelerate investments to enhance our digital and payments capabilities. In terms of more traditional investments, we recently announced the expansion of our middle-market commercial banking team in the New York metro area where we have a strong presence in the large corporate space for over 10 years and will be able to leverage that existing platform. On a technology and innovation front, we announced the creation of a new fully digital capability for small businesses to apply for and receive a loan or line of credit. The application of funding time is often less than an hour, improving on a process that can take weeks within the industry. During the third quarter, we acquired Electronic Transaction Systems, which enhances our integrated software capabilities within our merchant processing business. It expands us into the new municipality industry vertical where we can leverage our government banking relationships within corporate and commercial banking. These investments and future investments will enable us to stay at the forefront in banking and will drive improved operating leverage over the next several years. We understand the value we create for our shareholders starts with the value we create for our customers. As the banking industry evolves in this new era of digital capabilities, we continue to look for ways to use technology and innovation to make our customers' financial lives simpler and more productive while at the same time protecting their data, their personal information, and their privacy. If we do it right and we will do it right, our customers win, our employees win, and our shareholders. In closing, I'd like to thank our U.S. Bank team members across the country for bringing their A game to work every day, to deliver on the promise of One U.S. Bank, and driving outstanding results for each of our stakeholders. That concludes our formal remarks. Terry and I will now be happy to answer your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead, your line is open. John McDonald : Hi good morning guys. Wanted to ask a little bit about the positive operating leverage, you had a nice print on positive operating leverage this quarter, looks like about 80 basis points. Just wondering how much help you got on the expense line this quarter from some of the accrual reversals and any other one-timers that you mentioned? And then more importantly as you look out into next year and I think you've talked about shooting for operating leverage gap of 1% to 1.5% next year, what do you see as the drivers for that to accelerate next year to that range you talked about? Andrew Cecere : I'd ask Terry to start, then I'll jump in. Terrance Dolan : Yes, John, let me talk a little bit about the expense question that we had. Again our focus is around being able to deliver that positive operating leverage. But at the end of looking at expenses, we're kind of focused on a lot of different areas. You mentioned the litigation accruals, that actually is not a very big driver of the overall change. If you think about on a year-over-year basis, the biggest drivers is that is -- one is related to tax credit amortization costs which are lower this year versus last year. And when you think about it with tax reform and us having lower tax expenses, the capacity that we generate in tax credit production allows us to generate both fee revenue through tax credit syndication, but also reduce our tax credit amortization and that's something that we believe is both sustainable over the long haul. The second thing that we've kind of talked about, our FDIC insurance is a little bit lower than what we expected and then if we think about our mortgage servicing costs, we continue to be just as the refi market has changed, et cetera, the mortgage servicing type of costs would come down and foreclosure related costs, et cetera. So, those are probably the biggest drivers. On a quarter -- on a linked-quarter basis, the tax credit amortization represents the majority of the change. So, those are things I would focus on. Andrew Cecere : And John, Andy. As we look at next year, I would highlight a couple of things. As we've talked about, we've lapped the payments to the merchant revenue issue and you saw that that's growing 4%. We continue to expect that to accelerate as we go into next quarter and next year. Mortgage revenue which has been a little bit of a headwind in the industry, I think, will start to come back. We are seeing accelerated loan growth, continued economic growth, and then across all our business, we're seeing increase in market share and customer acquisition. So, those are all things that I was positive opportunities for 2019 revenue. John McDonald : Okay. And Andy just a quick follow-up. Is the 1% to 1.5% still kind of a good target as you sit here now and look out to 2019 for the operating leverage that you're going to shoot for? Andrew Cecere : Yes, it is. John McDonald : Okay. And then one quick follow-up Terry. The FDI insurance fees lower that you mentioned, what was the driver of that? And you still have a stepdown coming from the end of the surcharge later in the fourth quarter next year? Terrance Dolan : Yes. The biggest driver is really the FDIC rate as much as anything. And as we make capital decisions and other things and then if you think about kind of our risk profile, we are getting an FDIC kind of benefit from a rate standpoint, that's probably the biggest driver. And then I think your second question was really related to the surcharge. If you think about the surcharge, so -- if you think about the fourth quarter, we expect the surcharge to continue and until it ends, we're going to continue to expect it to be there. So, we'll wait for that decision. The impact to us on a quarterly basis is about $20 million related to that surcharge. So that kind of gives you some sense in terms of the size of it as well as you're thinking about that for the future. Andrew Cecere : And John, importantly, we're not assuming that surcharge goes away as we think about positive operating leverage in 2019. John McDonald : Great. Thanks guys. Andrew Cecere : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead, your line is open. John Pancari : Good morning. Andrew Cecere : Good morning. Terrance Dolan : Good morning John. John Pancari : On the loan growth front, I heard you're on the expectation that we're going to see some good acceleration in growth in coming quarters, your release for next quarter. What is really driving that view? What is changing that you're calling out? Is more about the pay down abatement that you think is going to continue? Or the bond market flow finding its way back to the bank loan market? Or is it more about just outright demand? Thanks. Terrance Dolan : Yes, I mean, I think it's actually a combination of all of those things you think about it. I mean we've been talking about the fact that our pipelines have been getting stronger and M&A activity has been picking up. We've seen in our corporate payments business the spend by businesses in both discretionary and CapEx getting stronger. So, I think part of it is demand, at least, in terms of what we are seeing. I do -- we're also seeing the pay downs that we saw in late 2017 and in the second -- in the first half this year, those starting to moderate. They are still continuing, but I think they are moderating. And so, it is kind of a combination of all those different activities. I also think that as the long end of the curve has moved up, the opportunity within the capital market spaces -- that dynamic has changed a little bit. So, I think it's a combination of all of those different things. And we think -- as we think about the third quarter linked-quarter was up 0.9%, the fourth quarter will get a little stronger and we expect that to get stronger as we move into 2019 as well. John Pancari : And related to that, the line utilization on slide 16, despite some of these trends, you're still seeing it trend down. I mean is that -- are you signaling an inflection that you expect that we should start to see next quarter? Terrance Dolan : Yes, well, I guess what we end up looking to utilization rates. We think as kind of stable it ends up balancing kind of up and down. I do believe that when you end up thinking about the optimism and capital expenditures that are -- that we are seeing, I do think that there's the opportunity for utilization to expand and so as we kind of think about that, that's a part of the equation let's say. John Pancari : Okay. Terry thanks. And then just one last thing on the deposit side, how should we think about overall deposit growth trends going forward? I know you've flagged the volatility from the customer merger and all that you've flagged, but how should we think about growth from this level going forward on total deposit trends? Terrance Dolan : Yes. So, I think it's really kind of point to three things and I talked about some of those, but just let me just kind of reiterate. One is that our consumer deposits are growing. They grow -- they grew nicely both on a linked-quarter and year-over-year basis. So, I think that that's good and that that tells us that from prices standpoint, we feel pretty good about that and what we're seeing in that market is good. The large customer -- or the financial customer that was part of a business combination, we've known and we've anticipated that those balances are going to be migrating and we've been working with that customer to kind of know and understand timing. But to, kind of, give you some perspective, on a year-over-year basis, the decline is nearly 100% related to the fact that that customer migration is occurring. On a linked-quarter basis that represents about half of that. So, when we kind of take that into consideration, we know that that's going to moderate in the fourth quarter. When we look at the fourth quarter, we think about 2019 in particular, we actually think it's going to moderate and allow us to be able to grow deposits again. John Pancari : Got it. Thank you, Terry. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, your line is open. Andrew Cecere : Hey Matt. Matthew O'Connor: Good morning. Another one on loan growth because you're one of the few banks that had accelerating loan growth this quarter and seem a bit more optimistic than others. Any idea why maybe you're seeing a slowdown and pay downs and a couple of other of your peers have pointed to an acceleration. Is there something different in the mix or is it just the way the lumpiness in that business can be? Terrance Dolan : Yes, I mean I think -- again it's probably a combination of things that could be lumpiness. We're in different markets. We end up having a much bigger community banking market than maybe some of the other competitors have been describing. So, it probably is a combination of things. It's not necessarily one thing that we can kind of pinpoint, let's put it that way. Matthew O'Connor: Okay. And then when you talk about accelerating loan growth in 4Q, is that versus the kind of 4% annualized growth that you had in 3Q versus 2Q? Or are you talking about on a year-over-year basis were loans were only up 1% in the third quarter? Andrew Cecere : Matt, this is Andy. We were talking about that, the 0.9% accelerating to a higher number on a linked-quarter basis. Matthew O'Connor: Okay, got it. All right. Thank you. Andrew Cecere : Thanks Matt. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is open. Andrew Cecere : Hey Ken. Terrance Dolan : Good morning Ken. Kenneth Usdin : Good morning guys. How are you? First question just on the on the balance sheet and repricing characteristics, so it's getting harder to talk about sequential betas per se, so deposit costs up 10 basis points, how would you characterize that in terms of your expectations of the rate of change in terms of what you saw this quarter? And how that might go forward in the context of that you had previously talked about NIMs continuing to expand. So, can you help us understand that dynamic within? Terrance Dolan : Yes. So, maybe a couple of things. We end up looking at net interest margin, of course, how it expands, how much better, is always a function of how your balance sheet ends up changing what sort of loan mix you have, et cetera. Certainly as we kind of think about deposits or funding costs, well, let me kind of step back, I think there's other reasons, our investment portfolio continues to be a creative as we as we see roll-off and that will continue at least through the vast majority of next year. So, I think there's a couple of things on the asset side that's positive. On the deposit side, I really think that -- and we've talked about this, deposit betas, they are at about 45%. We think they will migrate up to 50% whether it's this next rate hike or the following, but it's slowly moving in that direction. And our corporate trust and our wholesale deposit pricing is pretty much at terminal level. So, the movement of the deposit betas is really going to be more a function of how fast consumer deposits and the move in. And we are maybe seeing a little bit more competition in that particular space, but it hasn't been significantly greater. So, I think it's just kind of a function of all those different things. Andrew Cecere : And Terry our deposit beta assumptions have been consistent with what's happening. Terrance Dolan : Yes exactly. Kenneth Usdin : Yes, fair. And Terry to that point you mentioned on the asset side, can you help us dig in a little bit? Can you talk to us about front book, back book, on the securities yields? And also the types of loan growth you were expecting to see increase, is that also the types of stuff that's also accretive to the existing loan yield? Thanks. Terrance Dolan : Yes. So, on the investment side of the equation, if you think about our portfolio -- our investment portfolio, it has a duration of around four years which is what we've talked about. We are seeing a fairly significant amount of low yielding treasuries and those types of securities that are now rolling off. The -- its pretty consistent with what we talked about last quarter that that roll-off is accretive at a 100 to 125 basis points, so that that continually gives you the opportunity to be able to see some accretion with respect to that particular portfolio. Now, on the loan side, again, I would point to the fact that we've seen nice growth in residential and we've seen nice growth in our credit card and our consumer type of products. And that type of mix will be beneficial to us as we kind of look in the future and we would expect and anticipate that to continue. Kenneth Usdin : Okay, got it. Thanks guys. Andrew Cecere : Thanks Ken. Operator : Your next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead, your line is open. Erika Najarian : Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Andrew Cecere : Good morning Erika. Terrance Dolan : Good morning Erika. Erika Najarian : So, my first question is a follow-up to the competitive aspects on -- for commercial. The bond market was brought up, but I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of how much competition non-banks like private equity firms, how much competition that's posing to U.S. Bancorp? And as an add-on to that. What is your on balance sheet exposure to broadly syndicated leverage lending and private equity-backed transaction? Andrew Cecere : You start there second question. Terrance Dolan : Yes. So, with respect to leverage lending, that is something in terms of our balance sheet, we have never really had any significant amount of lending in that particular space. So, it's an area that we managed pretty tightly and again, it kind of is reflective of our credit risk profile. So, as we think about the next downturn, we feel like we'll be in a pretty good spot from a leverage lending point of view. Andrew Cecere : And then Erika on your question on private equity you're now in bank or non-bank competition, I would say that is evident in some of the wholesale categories. I think it's probably most prominent in our commercial real estate category where some of the pay downs that are occurring are because of non-bank competition coming into the marketplace. But as we said and as Terry said in his remarks that is starting to abate here as we come into the third and fourth quarter. Erika Najarian : Got it. And another follow-up question on the expense side. I wanted to make sure I understood the Ryan run in particular for other expenses. So, as I think about the three year sort of average for other expenses, the average is about $450 million and it was $414 million last quarter and $377 million this quarter. Terry, am I right to think that that's all the tax credit amortization expense that you were discussing earlier? And I'm wondering if that $377 million is a good run rate for us to think about. And whether or not there is an offset in the tax rate line that we need to consider? Terrance Dolan : Yes. Well, it's already incorporated into the tax rate that we have because when you think about when you establish your tax rate for the year, you think about the entire year in terms of what your tax credit production is going to be. So, it's already a low tax rate. Here's the way that I would think about it Erika. I do think that the tax credit amortization is going to be an opportunity, it's going to be something that's going to continue, but it also has a quarterly cycle to it. The third and fourth quarter happened to be your strongest production quarters and so tax credit amortization and the impact associated with it, tends to be more dramatic in the third and fourth quarter. So, there's a little bit of a seasonality. I guess if I were looking at it, I think the $377 million might be a little bit on the lower end of that range, but reasonable. Andrew Cecere : And the fourth quarter, Terry, is actually higher than the third quarter. So, we'll see a little bit of an increase in that -- in the fourth quarter because of that. Terrance Dolan : Yes. Last year it went up about $60 million, this year it's probably close to $40 million that it will increase just because of tax credit amortization. Andrew Cecere : Third quarter to fourth quarter? Terrance Dolan : Yes. Erika Najarian : Got it. And just the follow-up question for you Andy. I think that the performance in bank stocks lately have seemed to reflect some revenue concerns rather than credit concerns for 2019. Although, of course, you bucked the trend in loan growth this quarter and I'm wondering what your message is on that positive operating leverage on 1% to 1.5%. So, I guess this is a two-part question. Where is the company in terms of it's -- not less traditional investment spend? So, let's talk about technology for example. And if the revenue environment is less robust for the whole industry than we'd hope, will you still be able to deliver that positive operating leverage for 2019? Terrance Dolan : Short answer to your question Erika is yes. The longer answer is we do expect credit to continue to be favorable, its 46 basis points in charge-off this quarter. The loan growth is the only reason we added to our reserve. Credit quality underlying that is very stable, but we have good loan growth, so we added to reserve and as we have done in the past. As we think about next year in terms of the revenue, we have some positives as I talked about earlier. It's both the combination of less -- fewer headwinds as well as continuing momentum in certain businesses. But as we've also said we'll manage expenses consistent with what we see from the revenue side equations, sort of like we did in this quarter. So, we expect to continue accelerated revenue opportunity next year and we're managing expenses with that in mind. If the revenue doesn't happen as we think, we'll manage expenses more prudently. Erika Najarian : That's helpful. Thank you. Terrance Dolan : You bet. Andrew Cecere : And Erika maybe one thing that I would just kind of add to that. I think when you end up looking our business mix, so this is one of the things that we've talked about in the past, the business mix having the strong fee base sort of businesses and payments, et cetera and with consumer spend continuing to get stronger, I just see that as something that differentiates us as we think about the future. Operator : And your next question comes from Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill + Partners. Please go ahead, your line is open. Scott Siefers : Morning guys. Thanks for taking the questioning. Andrew Cecere : Morning Scott. Terrance Dolan : Hello Scott. Scott Siefers : Just wanted to go back to the deposit dynamics for a quick second. First just make sure I understand the large customer migration you talked about that just went from deposits out of deposits, right, rather than a move within the category of total deposits? Terrance Dolan : Yes. Those are deposit outflows from the company and if you think about it was acquired by another financial institution and they wanted to bring those deposits under their balance sheet. And it's something that we have been anticipating, that's been a part of our NIM and our asset liability modeling process for well over a year. Scott Siefers : Yes, okay. Thank you for that. And then just within the categories same directional trend that you guys versus others which is sort of money coming out of non-interest-bearing into other categories. But the order of magnitude seemed a little larger for you guys and I've seen in others. So, I guess one given you guys are a little unique in terms of business mix with like corporate trust in there, for example, so there's an element of apples-to-oranges. But if maybe you could just briefly walk through how you guys differ from just sort of a typical bank? And then more importantly, I guess, how will that dynamic flush out or play out here as we move forward just given the uniqueness of your business mix? Terrance Dolan : Yes. Well, I mean again the thing that we end up really focus on in terms of the uniqueness is our corporate business and I mean within those trust structures as yields have gone up, they continue to look for opportunities to be able to get as much yield as they can within that structure and so migrations from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing is something that we kind of anticipate and expected. There is a portion of those structures though that is very operational in nature and is sticky within the non-interest-bearing. So, while that migration has been occurring, I don't know whether that will continue to be as strong as it has been in the past. Andy, if you could--? Andrew Cecere : Yes, so the corporate trust business is a great -- not only great fee business, but it's a great deposit gathering business. And as Terry mentioned, there's two components to it, one is operational nature and the flows that occur will continue to occur regardless of the rate environment because it is a flow between the bond issuer and the bond holder. The second component or what I would call more short-term investments and that's where we're seeing more of the volatility, but it's as we expected and particularly in this rate environment is new investment opportunities present themselves, so bottom-line Scott, I don't think it's anything that we didn't anticipate. We're going to be a little bit lumpier because of that second component, but it's in line with what we expect. Terrance Dolan : Now the other thing is that because of the corporate trust business, the size of our total deposits as a percentage of our total funding cost that even though our deposit pricing may be a little bit higher, our total funding costs are very competitive excuse me. Scott Siefers : Okay, that's perfect. Thank you guys for the color. And then if I can ask one last sort of tic-tac question. You had the Elan unit sale that you have announced a few weeks back, any revenue or expense impact as we look into like 2019 that you guys would call out from the loss of that business? Andrew Cecere : Yes. So, I mean that sale is so impressed. Maybe I can just step back a little bit. That is very specific to third-party ATM processing and it's also the sale of our MoneyPass debit card network and so it's not related to our payments business. As I knew there was a little bit of confusion on that early, so I just want to make sure that actually-- Terrance Dolan : It actually rolls up to consumer bank. Andrew Cecere : Yes. And the -- it would end up kind of dimensional, so 2017 revenue for that business on an annualized basis was $170 million. On a quarterly basis, third quarter, I believe the revenue was around $45 million and then the efficiency ratio of that business pretty similar to the rest of our company maybe a slightly higher, but pretty similar to the rest of our company. So, if you kind of take that information, you can get some sense, both in terms of fourth quarter and 2019. From a fourth quarter perspective, right now we anticipate that the sale will close at the end of October, but if not in October, then the end of November and we just have to kind of wait and see based upon regulatory approval. Scott Siefers : Okay. All right. That's great. Thank you guys very much. Andrew Cecere : Thanks Scott. Operator : Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is open. Betsy Graseck : Hey good morning. Andrew Cecere : Morning Betsy. Terrance Dolan : Morning. Betsy Graseck : Andy can you talk a little bit about the different levers that you've got on the expense side, when we're thinking about the operating leverage for next year? I know you talked through kind of revenue line items already, but what's in your back pocket there? Andrew Cecere : Well, one of the things we talked about is we are investing in both traditional as we talked about the expansion in our commercial banking business as well as more of the digital and payments businesses. We did an acquisition in the third quarter as we talked about we are continuing to expand our capabilities on our mobile application, our capabilities in terms of sales activity on that application. And everything you think about from an investment standpoint as a little bit of a digital focus on it. So that will continue. We have continued opportunity in terms of optimization of different business processes which we are working across the company in terms of our branch optimization across structures and where we are in this space and so forth. So, we have a number of things, a number of initiatives we're working on. And at a high level, actually I would describe it as continue to invest in the future while recognizing that some of the things that we've done in the past we can do better or do lesser. Betsy Graseck : And your tech investments spend, am I right in thinking it's around $1.5 billion, is that is that accurate? Andrew Cecere : Yes, so the CapEx related to technology is about $1.2 billion. And as Terry and I have talked about in the past, our operating expense related that probably another $1.5 billion. So, if you combine the two, it's just over $2.5 billion, but the CapEx that we talked about is $1.2 billion. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay. And so that line kind of holds in, but then the headcount or occupancy associated with these other things you're talking about pullback that's the push-pull in the line items? Terrance Dolan : Yes, that's a fair way to think about it. And just to be clear we've been at that spend level for a year and a half, two years, so that's in the numbers as we think about what we reported today. Betsy Graseck : Got it. And then can I shift gears a little bit and just ask the thoughts around CECL. I know that's not coming into play until 1Q 2020, but I'm sure you're prepping for it and going parallel next year, so maybe you can give us some thoughts as to how you're thinking about it from an early look perspective? Terrance Dolan : Yes, I mean as you said we're still kind of in the process of dimensioning it. 2019 is kind of our parallel year. If you end up looking across the entire industry, the entire industry is really in the process of kind of refining their models that they'll use as part of that process. I would anticipate that we'll have better dimension around what the size of that is later this year. And of course one of the factors that comes into play is what is your outlook with respect to the economy, et cetera, as you get closer to the adoption of it. So, lot of moving parts, but we're on track. We feel good about at lease the position that we're in in terms of us being able to adopt it. Betsy Graseck : And are there areas you think there's a little give back because some of these ratios look pretty high. Part of it is because we've got very low losses right now, but I'm also wondering if you know there's some parts of the portfolio which could be a net giver of reserves as opposed to a taker? Terrance Dolan : Yes, that's the interesting thing about CECL, it is very product dependent in terms of within the company, in terms of what the impact of it's going to be. To the extent that you have longer live or longer duration assets like mortgages and that type of product, you're going to actually have a bigger negative impact or increasing the reserve that's going to come into play. The area kind of -- to me it's a little counterintuitive, but commercial real estate is one of those -- especially on a construction site where you tend to get a little bit of benefit. But we really have to kind of look at the total mix. It's a little bit of a moving dynamic. Betsy Graseck : Got it, okay. Thank you. Andrew Cecere : Thanks Betsy. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead, your line is open. Andrew Cecere : Hey Mike. Mike Mayo : Hi. You mentioned digital banking quite a bit -- the digital platform; you've disclosed that you have 18 million customers, if that's correct in prior annual reports. Can you tell us the percentage of customers for online and the percentage of customers that use mobile banking? I think your other five large bank peers all disclosed this and it be great if you could give that to us, not now, then sometime in the future? Andrew Cecere : I can give it to you now. So, we have 18 million total customers. If I exclude single service customers, so some of our mortgage customers, card customers, and indirect customers who outside our market -- what they would call full banking customers were about 11 million and of 11 million about 50% use our digital platform. Mike Mayo : And how many -- what percent mobile? Andrew Cecere : The majority of that is mobile. Mike Mayo : Okay, great. I got my wish. -- And you've got one price for doing well and one price for not doing so well just follow-up on those two other issues. So when it comes to deposit growth, when we look year-over-year, it still doesn't look great. So, I guess that would kind of neutralize the seasonal aspects. And so I get the one-off merger -- the client lost in deposits and then some other ins and outs, is there anything else going on there? Maybe just what's your forecast for deposit growth over the next year or so? Terrance Dolan : Yes, I mean I think we've kind of covered all the dynamics that are taking place. On a year-over-year basis, again, the decline is 100% related to this part of our customer. Consumer deposits are growing. When we think about 2019, we do expect growth in deposits and I think that'll be kind of consistent with low single-digits. It will be kind of tied to economic growth, et cetera. But I don't think that we -- there's any unusual sort of dynamics that we haven't talked about. Mike Mayo : Okay. Then on the positive side, the loan growth -- commercial loan growth, and I noticed been a lot of questions on that. And I'm just trying to get the main takeaway, are you executing better or are you taking more risk? Or is it simply mix if you were to characterize that, kind of what's the main -- a lot more cautious. Andrew Cecere : Yes, I want to be real clear on one thing it's not taking any more risk. Our credit box has not changed at all and we've been very prudent and strict around and disciplined for a long time and that is not changing at all. I think it's a function of all the things we talked about. It's expanding our customer base, gaining market share, it's our diversified portfolio. It's not in any one area or geography, it's a function of all those things. And that's why we're feeling pretty good about it going forward. Mike Mayo : And you open up a new office in the New York area. Are there some other newer offices that are getting traction that's helping with that commercial? Andrew Cecere : Yes, we've opened up a few offices in the south, the Dallas area and the south -- and the southeast New York. We'll look at other opportunities like this and it's typically leveraging presence that we already have in the market. And we talked about that also thinking about our consumer expansion doing the same, building a customer base that we already have. Mike Mayo : Great. all right. Thank you. Andrew Cecere : Thanks Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead, your line is open. Marty Mosby : Thanks. Two questions. One if you look at merchant processing, it's kind of an anomaly in the growth rates. If you look at over last year, its 4% growth quarter-over-quarter. If you look at sequentially annualized, it's the 5% growth, so looks like an acceleration there. But if you look at year-to-date, it's only growing 3%. So, it's kind of strange how those three numbers all kind of working, but is there really -- is the momentum finally picking up here in essence what we are seeing same-store sales and we're seeing some retail purchases and we're getting that lift from the economy we've been waiting on for so long? Terrance Dolan : Yes, we have been looking at the dynamics. We certainly are seeing a lift from consumer spending getting stronger. Our sales volumes have been quite strong in that 8% sort of range if you will. The biggest issue on kind of in terms of both year-over-year growth and then kind of how it started to accelerate is really the fact that a year ago, we're starting to overlap the joint ventures that we had -- we've kind of talked a little bit about. But the overall business we've been making some investments in terms of both capabilities, industry verticals, variety of different things which I think as we kind of think about the future is going to continue to enable us to be able to expand revenue. Marty Mosby : We saw one of your peers yesterday actually announced restructuring in the securities portfolio to accelerate that 100 to 125 basis points of net difference between the market and the portfolio rates. Any consideration since that's already kind of being taken out of tangible book value anyway in the mark-to-market that you just go ahead and realize that loss you know take it -- there was an extraordinary towards into this year and then accelerate the benefit in essence of what you get from what the market's going to give you over the next couple of years. Terrance Dolan : Yes, I mean short answer is we really don't have any plans to restructure our investment portfolio at this time. Andrew Cecere : And we've been managing to optimize it all along, right? Terrance Dolan : Yes. Marty Mosby : Have you -- you have excess capital, so given the excess capital that you have it is a way to temporarily deploy it and actually accelerate the benefit while locking in rates. We wake up six months from now and all of sudden rates have somehow fallen back down, you kind of lose that opportunity or that window. So, I just was curious since it's already marked and you got to extra capital anyway, if that wouldn't be something that you couldn't lock in those higher rates why you got them? Terrance Dolan : Yes. Well, like I said, we don't necessarily have any particular plans to do it so. Marty Mosby : Okay, thanks. Terrance Dolan : Yes. Andrew Cecere : Thanks Marty. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead, your line is open. Kevin Barker : Good morning. Andrew Cecere : Good morning Kevin, Terrance Dolan : Hey Kevin. Kevin Barker : Just a follow-up on some of the deposit flows and some of the deposit questions you mentioned, the movement out of non-interest-bearing deposits specifically around the commercial deposits, do you have any offsets on fee income specifically around treasury management that could increase fee income as some of the balances come off of non-interest-bearing deposits? Terrance Dolan : Yes. I don't necessarily -- I can't necessarily kind of point to something like that. I mean I do think that when you end up looking -- and a lot of people end up talking about compensating balances as kind of being that offset or whatever, but I mean our core treasury management growth is about a little under 1% and the drag is really related to the rising rate environment, but there's nothing that I would specifically point to Kevin. Kevin Barker : Okay. And then just to follow-up on the expense side. Your expense growth was below your long-term target this quarter on a year-over-year basis, I think you pointed to about 3% to 5% long-term target on year over year and obviously there's some puts and takes associated with the tax accrual and the amortization. But when you look out into the first half of 2019 and maybe in full year 2019, you think it's possible you could see expense growth run below your long-term target and maybe for the foreseeable future? Terrance Dolan : Kevin it depends a bit on the revenue side of the equations. So, we're managing the company for positive operating leverage and we'll manage expenses as we think about it consistent with the revenue opportunities. So, the numbers aren\u2019t going to be specific, it's going to be relative to what we think on the revenue side. Kevin Barker : Okay, all right. That's all I had. Thank you. Terrance Dolan : Thanks Kevin. Operator : Your next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is open. Andrew Cecere : Hey Vivek. Operator : Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan, please go ahead, your line is open. Vivek Juneja : Yes. Can you hear me? Sorry. Andrew Cecere : Yes, yes we can hear you. Thank you. Good morning. Vivek Juneja : Sorry. Thanks. Sorry to go back to the expense question. Just trying to understand Andy -- Terry, the $377 million, here you it will go up $40 million or so for the seasonal increase, but -- so should we think of that $377 million as a good run rate going forward, is there anything like you talked about a legal accrual changes, is there anything like that that's unusual that we need to factor in as we think about -- I know beyond 2018, I mean is this really the new base? Terrance Dolan : Yes, I mean I think Erika kind of talked a little bit about the averages associated with other expenses. I mean other expenses tends to be a little bit lumpy. It depends upon what businesses are growing, foreclosure, reserves, -- foreclosure or costs and those types of things in terms of how those are changing. So, I would say that the $377 million is probably on the lower end of that band. And -- so when you kind of think about the future, I really think looking at kind of the averages associated with other expenses is probably a reasonable way to look at it. Vivek Juneja : Okay, great. Similar one on the other income side. You called out private equity gains, that's also -- that number is also running above if you look at last six quarter average, which is more like $191 million or $226 million. Again how much of it was private equity and what's a good set of run rate to think about? Terrance Dolan : Yes, so more of that was really related to the tax credit syndications that we were able to do in the third quarter. And again in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, those tend to be a little bit stronger; it will tend to be a little bit stronger. Now, we have the opportunity to be able to do that if we think about a kind of a full year basis because of the fact that we have a very good and strong production base of tax credit and because we can't -- we don't have the capacity to use all of them, we have the option to be able to syndicate them. So, I think when you think about on a full year basis, there is kind of a little bit of a step-up associated with it, but it tends to be a little lumpy in the third and fourth quarter because of the -- just the timing of when that production occurs. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Okay, great. One last thing. At the Barclays Conference, you raised your long-term return on average common equity target by 100 basis points. When we do the math on the tax reform benefit, the benefit to you is 150 basis points. So, is there a plan to catch-up on that additional 50 basis points at some point? Terrance Dolan : At the high level we announced that the tax improvement in the fourth quarter of 2017, we also announced the step-up on some spend activity, particularly related to digital and payments and so forth. So, that is -- the numbers that we talked about incorporate both sides of the equation which is what we're seeing right now. Vivek Juneja : Okay. All right. Thanks. Terrance Dolan : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead, your line is open. Saul Martinez : Hey good morning guys. Andrew Cecere : Good morning Saul. Saul Martinez : Two quick -- couple of questions. Just changing gears a little bit. Want to ask you how you're seeing the regulatory environment quarreled has indicated that preference for prudential regulations to be based more on complexity that size, you highlighted that very recently. But do you feel like once we get the proposals out of the way for the $1 billion to 250 billion asset banks, you could see some relief for banks of your size and complexity as well? Andrew Cecere : I'm hopeful Saul, as I think about our balance sheet, our business mix, our risk profile, our trading book which is you know minimal, all those characteristics are more like a smaller regional bank or medium-sized regional bank there like the large money center banks. So, as you know 2155 [ph] talks about the tailoring shall occur and if you think about tailoring based on risk characteristics, I'm hopeful that we'll get some relief. Saul Martinez : Okay. Okay. And just your changing gears and I hate to beat a dead horse on the other expense question; I just want to make sure I understand it right. But I think Terry you mentioned the $377 million should be you just sort of at the lower end of what a reasonable range would be. But am I right in saying that that reasonable range should also be lower than maybe what it's been in the recent past which is average about $450 million for some of the reasons that you talked about the changes in the tax credit amortization business, lower FDIC surcharges and whatnot. But I guess is that the right way to think about it that range should be a little bit lower than what we've seen historically? Terrance Dolan : Yes, I mean whatever your assumption is with respect to the surcharge in the future, I mean that's kind of where that ends up getting the impact. I mean your point is well taken I think that I wouldn\u2019t just focus on other expenses though. I'd focus on how we're managing the overall expenses. We've got opportunity with respect to the plans and risk programs and mortgage servicing and a whole variety of different things. So, I know there's been -- and I think my horse might be dead. I wouldn\u2019t just focus on other expenses, let's put it that way. Saul Martinez : All right. No, point taken. Thanks a lot. Terrance Dolan : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead, your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning Andy. Good morning Terry. Andrew Cecere : Good morning Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Can you guys to share with us -- when we go back and look at your non-interest-bearing deposits to total deposits during the 1994-1995 tightening cycle or even to the 2004 to 2006 tightening cycle, they held in pretty constant. Particularly in 2004 to 2006, you really didn't lose much in non-interest-bearing deposits. Can you give us some color? Do you think your mix is similar to those time periods? I know Andy, you've obviously -- both of you have been in the bank a long time, maybe you can share with us some comparisons to those time periods? Andrew Cecere : Yes Gerard, I don't think our mix is all that different. I do think in those time periods, we were in the midst of acquiring corporate trust businesses that they have impacted the activity in the deposits because we were growing -- we've done 22 acquisitions in corporate trust over the years, many of them in the years that you describe. So, that may be a factor in the comps. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then following up on regulatory. I know you guys have done everything required from your BSA/AML issues; can you just give us an update on where that stands now? Andrew Cecere : We have. We completed our activity and our verification from an internal standpoint on June 30th consistent with our schedule. It now sits with the regulators and we're hopeful. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. And just one quick question. What's the duration of the securities portfolio? Andrew Cecere : Yes, the duration is about four years. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Please go ahead, your line is open. Brian Klock : Good morning. Andrew Cecere : Good morning Brian. Brian Klock : So, I promise I won't ask anything about other expenses. I know that you guys talk about the average commercial real estate loan growth and it seems like maybe even some of the headwinds that others have seen in the industry, the pay downs and those sort of headwinds might be abating, but it seems like on end of period basis, I look at page 20 of your sup, if I'm right, commercial real estate loans, the first time you end of period loans have actually grown since the first -- or third quarter of 2016. I'm just wondering is there anything that you're saying is this sort of the inflection point when you think about overall end of period balance growth going forward. Terrance Dolan : Yes. It\u2019s a good question. We certainly hope that it is. The end of looking at commercial real estate as we said, pay downs were particularly strong. Before tax reform, a lot of commercial real estate developers were derisking, taking a lot of things off -- a lot of their chips off the table and they were paying down and then they had the uptrend to be in the capital market space. So, those were definitely some headwinds. We haven't necessarily changed -- we haven't changed with respect to our credit box. We're still not -- we're not doing anything crazy from a structural standpoint. So, we are optimistic that it is at an inflection point and no, big part of it is just the pay downs that we saw earlier in the year and have really started to slow. Brian Klock : Got it. Thanks for that. And just trying to triangulate -- I haven't tried to put it back through my model yet, but the big picture guidance you gave for the fourth quarter, it seems like it's implying at least a continued upward trend -- really flattish to upward in the NIM. I know you don't give NIM guidance, but is that a fair assumption even with your beta assumptions that the NIM could be better in the fourth quarter than the third? Terrance Dolan : Yes. Well, as we said, I mean when we think about the opportunity for NIM to expand, we still think there's opportunity for expansion. Brian Klock : Great. Thanks for your time guys. Andrew Cecere : Thanks Brian. Terrance Dolan : Thank you. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters for any closing remarks. Jenn Thompson : That concludes our earnings call. Thanks for listening and please contact the Investor Relations department if you have any follow-up questions. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to U.S. Bancorp's Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Following a review of the results by Andy Cecere, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Dolan, U.S. Bancorp's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. This call will be recorded and available for replay, beginning today at approximately noon, Eastern Standard Time, through Wednesday 23 at 12 :00 midnight, Eastern Standard Time. I'll now turn the conference call over to Jenn Thompson of Investor Relations of U.S. Bancorp. Jenn Thompson : Thank you, Kirk, and good morning to everyone who's joined our call. Andy Cecere and Terry Dolan are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's fourth quarter results and to answer your questions. Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. I'd like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Andy. Andrew Cecere : Thanks, Jen, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry and I will open the call up to Q&A. I'll begin on Slide 3, which provides financial highlights for the fourth quarter. We reported earnings per share of a $1.10, which includes $0.03 per share of notable items, which Terry will discuss in more detail in a few moments. Excluding these notable items, we reported earnings per share of a $1.07 for the quarter. Loan growth accelerated in the fourth quarter driven by strength across our consumer and commercial loan portfolios. The income improvement was supported by growth in new customer accounts and expanding client relationships. Strong payments revenue growth reflected higher sales volume across the board in retail card, corporate payments, and merchant acquiring. We also saw good business growth in trust and investment management, which offset the impact of unfavorable market conditions. In summary, loan growth and fee revenue trends remain healthy. As expected, we delivered positive operating leverage on a core basis in both the fourth quarter and for the full year 2018. Credit quality was stable, and our book value increased by 6.3% from a year ago. During the quarter, we returned 80% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Slide 4 provides key performance metrics. We delivered a 20.2% return on tangible common equity in the fourth quarter. We also saw year-over-year improvement in our efficiency ratio, return on average assets, and our return on average common equity. Now, let me turn the call over to Terry who will provide more detail on the quarter as well as forward-looking guidance. Terrance Dolan : Thanks Andy and good morning. If you turn to Slide 5, I'll start with the balance sheet review and follow up with the discussion of fourth quarter earnings trends. Average loans grew 1.5% on a linked quarter basis and increased 2.6% year-over-year, excluding the impact of the fourth quarter of 2018 sale of the majority of our FDIC covered loans that had reached the end of the loss coverage period. On the consumer side, we saw continued strength in residential mortgage, credit card, and retail leasing. Credit card loan growth was supported by expansion in both the number of active accounts and sales per active accounts, as well as seasonal sales activity. Digital acquisition of customer accounts across platforms continues to be robust. As expected, commercial loan growth accelerated and pipelines are strong. Fourth quarter growth was supported by strong M&A financing activity in our corporate banking business line. Paydowns continued to be a headwind to balance growth, however, the pace of the paydowns continues to moderate. Commercial real estate loans increased on a linked quarter basis, although they declined versus a year ago. Linked quarter growth was partly due to the timing of closings in the third and fourth quarter, which helped average balance comparisons. Also, during the last several months, the competitive environment has shifted a bit providing more lending opportunities that meet our disciplined underwriting criteria. Turning to Slide 6, deposits increased 1.3% on a linked quarter basis. As expected, deposits declined on a year-over-year basis reflecting the previously discussed balance migration related to the business merger of a large financial client. This migration impact on deposits continues to moderate. Slide 7 indicates that credit quality was relatively stable in the fourth quarter. Notably, our non-performing assets declined 1.5% compared with the third quarter and decreased 17.6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Turning to Slide 8, you'll see highlights of fourth quarter earnings results. We reported earnings per share of $1.10, which included several notable items amounting to $0.03 per share. Slide 9 lists notable items that affected earnings for the fourth quarter of 2018. Fourth quarter 2018 notable items included a gain from the sale of our ATM servicing business and the sale of majority of the company's covered loans as well as charges related to severance, asset impairments, and accrual for certain legal matters. The company also had a favorable impact to deferred tax assets and liabilities related to changes in estimates from tax reform. As a reminder, we recognized several notable items during the fourth quarter of 2017, including $825 million of expenses related to settlement of regulatory matters, a special employee bonus, and a contribution to the company's charitable foundation. Along with the tax impact of revalue and deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the enactment of the tax reform bill, the net impact of notable items in 2017 was $0.09 per common share. My remarks throughout the remainder of this call will be referencing results excluding notable items incurred in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2017. On Slide 10, linked quarter and year-over-year net interest income growth was supported by higher interest rates and earning assets growth, which was partially offset by higher deposit costs and a shift in funding mix. In the fourth quarter, net interest margin was 3.15%, flat with the third quarter of 2018, but up 4 basis points compared with a year ago. Slide 11 highlights trends in non-interest income. On a year-over-year basis, we saw strong growth in payments revenue and trust and investment management revenue, partly offset by a decrease in mortgage banking revenue and treasury management fees. Lower ATM processing servicing fees reflected the sale of the company's ATM servicing business in the fourth quarter of 2018. In 2019, ATM processing servicing revenues will decline by approximately $150 million and the pre-tax income will decline by approximately $70 million as we continue to provide operational services during a transitional conversion period. Lower mortgage banking revenue reflected the continued, but moderating declines in the industry refinancing activity. Mortgage gain on sale margin was relatively stable in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. The decline in treasury management fees reflects the impact of changes in earnings credits, which typically -- which is typical in a rising rate environment. The beneficial revenue impact of compensating balances reflected in net interest income more than offset the decline in treasury management revenue. Turning to our payments business, we had double-digit growth in credit and debit card revenue and corporate payment products revenue, each supported by higher sales volumes. During the fourth quarter, the federal government completed its renegotiation of certain payment services. While we expanded our market share of future government spend, the business margins will compress in the next few quarters. Additionally, we expect commercial spending volume growth to moderate in 2019. As such, we expect mid single-digit growth in corporate payments products revenue next year. Strong merchant acquiring sales volume growth drove mid single-digit revenue growth in the fourth quarter in line with our expectations. Trust and investment management fee growth was primarily driven by business growth, offset somewhat by unfavorable market conditions late in the quarter. Turning to Slide 12, the year-over-year increase in non-interest expense reflected higher compensation expense, primarily due to the impact of hiring to support business growth and compliance programs and a higher variable compensation related to business production. This was partially offset by lower costs related to tax advantage projects and lower FDIC assessment costs. Slide 13 highlights our capital position. At December 31st, Our common equity tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach was 9.1%. This compares to our target of 8.5%. I'll now provide some forward looking guidance. For the first quarter, we expect fully taxable equivalent net interest income to increase in the low single-digits on a year-over-year basis. Net interest income is typically lower in the first quarter of each year due to the impact of day accounts and that will be the case again this year. Additionally in the first quarter, year-over-year net interest income growth will be negatively impacted by the sale of the acquired loan portfolio yield curve. We expect fee revenue to increase in the low single-digits year-over-year, including the negative impact of the sale of the ATM business. We expect to deliver positive operating leverage on a core basis for the full year of 2019, in line with our previous guidance. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the provision for income taxes resulted in a taxable equivalent tax rate of 14.6% or 20.1% excluding the notable item from changes in estimates related to deferred tax assets and liabilities. In the quarter and for the full year of 2019, we expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 21%. We expect first quarter credit quality to remain relatively stable compared to the fourth quarter. I'll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks. Andrew Cecere : Thanks, Terry. As expected, our financial performance gained momentum in the second half of 2018. Long growth accelerated and our key businesses benefited from new strong sales activity and the expansion of existing customer relationships. The economy is strong and resilient and the credit environment continues to be stable. However, we are mindful and we manage this company for the long-term and we are mindful of the cyclical nature of the banking business. Disciplined credit underwriting is the hallmark of this company and one that has differentiated our credit performance over the entire business cycle. We continue to be very focused on generating high quality credit asset growth. In the fourth quarter, the OCC terminated its 2015 consent order, following several years of significant investment to improve our Anti-Money Laundering and Bank Secrecy Act programs and controls. The exit will give us more flexibility to optimize our existing branch network and to selectively expand into new markets with a digitally led branch-like strategy. While technology and innovation investments, such as digital, data analytics and real-time payment capabilities remains a priority for us, we will continue to manage expenses for whatever revenue environment we are operating in. We expect to deliver positive operating leverage on a core basis in the range of a 100 basis points to a 150 basis points for the full year 2019. In closing, I'm pleased with results we reported this morning, and I'm confident that we will continue to build on the momentum we are seeing across our businesses. I'd like to thank all our employees for their hard work throughout the year and for their commitment to serving our customers with the expertise and integrity they have come to expect from us. That concludes our formal remarks. We'll now open up the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Can I ask you to elaborate a little bit more on your outlook for just the loan side, understanding the -- excluding the covered loan sale at a pretty good clip, how would you just walk us through just what you're seeing out there in the crowd? You talked about the improving on the commercial side and reasonable pipelines, but just the nature of the loan growth that you're seeing in those pipelines. So do you expected to be able to improve from here or do you expect that this is about again the same type of growth that we've seen for a bit? Terrance Dolan : Yeah. Ken, this is Terry. So I would say that when we look at the economy, GDP continues to be strong, unemployment is low, consumer confidence continues to be strong and we see that in the consumer spend numbers that we have in our payments business. On the commercial C&I side, the pipelines at the end of the year continue to be pretty strong. Fourth quarter activity was driven, to some extent, by M&A activities, but we see that continuing into the first quarter. Again, customer spending was generally pretty strong. The other thing that I would say is that if you end up looking at kind of the mix of business, we saw pretty good growth across all the different categories. The one thing that I would point out is that commercial real estate was actually up this quarter. That was principally due to the timing of some third quarter deals moving into the fourth quarter and some acceleration I think from first to fourth. If you look at ending loan balances within commercial real estate, in fact we\u2019re down a little bit. And when we think about the first quarter, we expect commercial real estate to be flat to down similar to what it's been in the past. So generally, pretty optimistic with respect to what our outlook of loan growth is. Andy? Andrew Cecere : I agree. And the only thing I would add to what Terry said is the first quarter is seasonally typically a little lower just in terms of activity, but we've seen strength throughout the year. We were at 0.3, 0.9, 1.5 the last three quarters and I think that's reflective of what we're seeing from a pipeline and from an economic standpoint. Ken Usdin : Got it. And then just on the flip side, just -- loans have been growing faster than deposits, you still had pretty good underlying deposit growth. Is that a dynamic that we should continue to expect where the loan growth would likely be still ahead of the deposit growth? Terrance Dolan : Yeah. With respect to deposit growth, just kind of breaking it down a little bit, we saw -- we continue to see good deposit growth with respect to our consumer or retail business. In fourth quarter, our wholesale deposits were up on a linked quarter basis, which is good. At this particular point in the cycle, if we do see loan growth the way that we saw it in the fourth quarter, it would outpace probably deposit growth a little bit. Ken Usdin : Okay. All right. Understood. I'll leave it at that. Andrew Cecere : Thanks Ken. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald from Bernstein. Your line is open. Andrew Cecere : Hey, John. John McDonald : Hi, good morning. Good morning. Andrew Cecere : Good morning, John. John McDonald : Wanted to talk a little bit about the plans for a positive operating leverage. You're planning for an increase to the 1 to 1.5 range in 2019. And this quarter looks like you came in even above that range or so, 180 basis points or so after adjustment. So I\u2019m just wondering, how you think about the puts and takes to delivering on that positive operating leverage for this year? What should we keep in mind? And what could push you to the high end of that 1 to 1.5 range? Terrance Dolan : Yeah. Well, definitely, our focus is on positive operating leverage. The fourth quarter always tends to be stronger because of -- and this year particularly because of tax credit amortization on a year-over-year basis was lower and that is really tied to the enactment of the tax reform bill. The amount of deliverables of deal closings with respect to tax credits just needed to be less and that favorably impacted this year and the fourth quarter. As we certainly think about going into next year, I think there's just a number of different things that are moving in the right direction, and all the mortgage related costs continue to come down. I think that we -- if you remember in November, we had kind of a reorganization redesign, where we looked at management spans and layers and just a number of levers like that that we are using to kind of set us up for our success next year. Andy? Andrew Cecere : You know what I'd add, John, is we're going to continue to invest in all the initiatives we talked about the digital, the payments, the data analytics and so forth, so that'll be a continued investment. At the same time, I think exiting the consent order gives us more flexibility in our physical asset optimization, so I think you're going to see us being more proactive in terms of optimizing our branch network, which will offer us expense opportunities. So those are the big -- two big puts and takes from the perspective of a high level. John McDonald : Okay. And just I guess as broad comparison, how should we think about expense growth in '19 relative to what we saw in 2018, particularly with the FDIC surcharge rolling off as a bit of a tailwind? Terrance Dolan : Yeah. I think that it's probably going to be in line with the expense growth that we saw kind of on a full year basis with probably a small amount of improvement from there. John McDonald : Okay. Just expenses in 2019 versus '18... Terrance Dolan : Yeah. On a quarter-on-quarter basis. John McDonald : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Terrance Dolan : Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Yes. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to ask a little bit more about the funding mix dynamics. I think the market is starting to assume that the fed will be on a long pause after this December rate hike. And I'm wondering, how we should think about whether or not the mix shift will continue? And how many quarters until after the fed stops raising rates? Do you typically see a drop off in deposit repricing? Terrance Dolan : Yeah. So I guess, if you're looking at rate hikes under the yield curve kind of where it is, I would expect that the real driver with respect to deposit mix and pricing as also where that is going to be both competition in the market and that competition is going to be based upon what sort of loan growth we see. So I think you end up having to kind of look at both sides of the balance sheet to kind of figure out what sort of dynamics you're going to have with respect to deposit flows. Once the fed stops moving rates, I think you start to see stabilization with respect to deposit betas, for the most part with the exception of the penny pressure you have from a competitive standpoint to fund loans. And then kind of coming back to your question, if rates start to move down, we typically move deposit rates fairly quickly because the betas associated with things like corporate trust and wholesale are -- tend to be higher. Erika Najarian : Got it. And just to confirm, a very strong message on the positive operating leverage for full year 2019. If the revenue environment is a little bit short of expectation, we should still expect a 100 basis points to 150 basis points of operating leverage is how we should think about it? Terrance Dolan : Yes, Erika. We're going to manage the company reflective and incorporating the revenue environment, so yes. Erika Najarian : Got it. That's clear. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore. Your line is open. John Pancari : Good morning. Andrew Cecere : Hey, John. Terrance Dolan : Good morning John. John Pancari : You mentioned in your commentary around loan growth that you're seeing -- you saw some shift in the competitive environment and became a bit more accommodative to produce. Is that mainly on the real estate side, on the commercial real estate side, where you saw that or are you seeing that a little bit on the broader commercial? Andrew Cecere : Yeah. No, I would say that we saw that on the commercial real estate side. Earlier in the year, there was a lot of competition on what I would say a lot of structures that we just wouldn't do. and I think as we are getting later in the cycle and the yield curve has shifted down, the competition has pulled back from commercial real estate and so the structures that we have seen most recently are things that we feel pretty comfortable about and that's why there was a little bit of a shift. I would say though that when you end up looking at areas like auto lending, mortgage lending, price competition continues to be very, very strong. In fact, we -- in auto lending, you'll notice that growth has slowed there a little bit and that's because we haven't chased yields down. We've been willing to give up some volume in order to maintain profitability. So it's just probably more so on the commercial real estate side than anywhere else. John Pancari : Got it. Okay. All right. And then on the corporate payments side, I know you indicated mid single-digit growth for the full year '19. How has that changed from your previous expectations? How has that been trajecting? And then also, how would you view that growth versus what you expect for the broader industry? Are you still in a position of regaining market share there and should it exceed the industry levels? Thanks. Terrance Dolan : Yeah. So a couple of different things. I think government spend will change a little bit. In terms of the renegotiation of the contract, we actually captured more market shares on a long term basis. We feel good that our spend is going to grow. But because of the margin compression really over the next several quarters, it will take a while to kind of lap that. That's a big driver. And then the commercial spend in the -- on the business side has been particularly strong this year, certainly double-digits, I want to say close the 12% in the fourth quarter. We would expect to see that kind of moderate in 2019, so there's a couple of different factors that are really driving that as we think about commercial product revenue. Andrew Cecere : But it is a function of more of a moderation of the corporate spend as well as the renegotiation. In both cases, we expect continued market share growth, so it's not a market share issue at all, it's a -- in the corporate side, it's more of an environment issue, on the government side it's more the renegotiation and really taking market share. Yeah. John Pancari : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Betsy Graseck : Hey. Thanks so much. Good morning. Andrew Cecere : Hey, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Andy, I wanted to just understand a little bit more about your comments around optimizing the brand strategy. Maybe if you could give us some color on what your thoughts and plans are there? And when you mentioned selectively expand, is this organic? And -- or not? Or is it inorganic? And give us some color on what hits your bar. Andrew Cecere : Right. Betsy, one of the most impactful components of the consent order was our inability to open new branches, which also put a little bit in terms of constraints on us in terms of closing branches because we couldn't optimize the structure and the footprint. So if you think about the last few years, we've been closing in the neighborhood of 1% to 2% of our branches. I would expect that to accelerate to really optimize the footprint, think about where we have branches close to each other, given the transaction exodus that's occurring in the branches. While at the same time, looking at selective markets, where we are not in, so that could be either in our footprint in better locations and/or some out of footprint where we have a large customer base, which we would go in with a very digitally focused branch-like strategy. So it just allows us a lot more flexibility and I think that 1% to 2% will -- net closures will become a higher number, which would allow more savings on a go forward basis. Betsy Graseck : And the digital focus and it's a little -- it's either adjacent or a little bit separated geographies to get the deposit growth that you're looking for from those markets, is this going to be a rate led as well? Will you be leaning into higher yielding products or is it going to be in line with the kind of pricing that you have in your branched areas? Andrew Cecere : I would expect it to be in line. And as we talked about in previous calls, Betsy, the focus would be to leverage current customers who already have either a home mortgage, an auto loan, a credit card that's US bank in their wallet, but don't have a full banking relationship and trying to leverage those relationships in a more full expansion standpoint with the current similar deposit rates that we're currently offering. Terrance Dolan : These are customers that know us and like us with respect to those particular products, we're just trying to deepen that relationship on the deposit side using digital capability. Betsy Graseck : Okay, that's clear. Now, that's super thank you. And then just a ticky-tacky on the ATM, you went through in 2019, the revs and operating income that you'll have in 2019. In 2020 as we think out to that timeframe, does it -- do those revenues and expenses come out in 2020 or is this something that's going to continue for a while? Andrew Cecere : Yeah. There is roughly a two-year transition period and -- but I do expect in 2020 that those expenses will start to come down. And the reason for that is as you go through the conversion process, you will slowly ramp down that business and the transition period is intended to cover that entire time frame. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And the expenses and revenues come down ratably, I assume? Terrance Dolan : Yeah. The expenses come down ratably, yeah. Betsy Graseck : Yeah. Okay, got it. All right. Thank you. Terrance Dolan : Thanks, Betsy. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Kevin Barker : Good morning. Andrew Cecere : Hey, Kevin. Terrance Dolan : Hey, Kevin. Kevin Barker : Hey. You guys mentioned that some of the business spending may impact your payments or maybe slow the growth there just a bit, but you've kept overall guidance for fee income in mid single-digits, I believe. Could you just talk about the puts and takes for fee income going into 2019, absent some of the things that we're seeing in mortgage banking that you've said could be a little bit better or just on a comp basis year-over-year? Terrance Dolan : Yeah. Well, again, going within payments, we continue to expect that credit cards is going to do well. We could look into 2019, again sales volumes have been particularly strong and we continue to believe, based upon the consumer spending, consumer confidence that that will hold up. Merchant acquiring is an area that we would continue to expect to accelerate some in 2019. We made some nice investments in integrated software solutions and in kind of the e-commerce sort of areas over the course of the last 18 months and more and more revenue from that kind of starts to come online. So I think within payments, I think that is an area. I think the other thing is that in broad brushes, mortgage banking revenue, which has been a big drag, a big headwind with respect to fee income we really believe in 2019 starts to moderate. For a couple of different reasons is that the vast majority of our business is purchase money as opposed to refinance at this particular point in time. The other thing is that about two years ago, two and a half years ago, we started to shift more toward retail channels as opposed to correspondent mortgage production and margins there had been holding up and we would expect them to be stable or expand. Home sales currently are projected to be positive, so it may not be exactly in the first quarter, but certainly when we look at the second half year, we think that becomes at least neutral, if not a little bit positive. So those would be kind of big takes. Kevin Barker : Okay. And then could you just provide a little bit more detail on the impact of integrated software on your merchant acquiring business and what your outlook is for the growth year-over-year with the merchant acquiring? Andrew Cecere : Sure. This is Andy. As we talked about, there's a few focus areas, the merchant acquiring, one of them is the integrated software providers, another is the e-commerce as well as omni channel and those are areas we continue to both invest in as well as acquire. You saw that we did a couple of transactions in the last 90 days, both focused in those areas. So that is an area of continued focus and one of the reasons we expect our merchant acquiring business to grow in the mid single-digits. Kevin Barker : Okay. Thank you for taking my questions. Andrew Cecere : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby from Vining Sparks. Your line is open. Andrew Cecere : Hey, Marty. Marty Mosby : Thanks. Hey. I had two questions. One was on merchant processing. The other fees in the processing business are growing double-digits. We're still not seeing merchant processing kind of kicking in. So I just wanted from the business standpoint, I know that there has been some dynamics in that competitive environment, where five years ago, it was very favorable. And then now, the big players kind of back in the toes. So just your thoughts about the competitive environment and what you're seeing in merchant processing. Terrance Dolan : Yeah. From a merchant processing standpoint, again, I think that from a competitive standpoint, there had been a shift over the years really from what I would call financial institution portfolio type of business to really more tech led sort of business growth, relying more on digital and integrated software providers, being focused on industry segments and those sorts of things. And we -- as part of our investment, we've been making that shift as well. And so that's why when we think about next year, we continue to see and expect same-store sales, but also a new business accelerate and grow. And I think that's going to be a big driver, but that's been kind of competitive shift that's been taking place. I think that the positive thing as we shift more to that tech led is that it has higher growth rates and better margins than the kind of the traditional business. As we talked about, Marty, in the past, this is really a business that has moved away from just transaction processing to being able to really provide to merchants information. And that's why that tech led sort of investment and spend and initiative is critically important. Marty Mosby : The other thing is you have a higher percentage of your portfolio that's held to maturity, but you still have some left and available for sale. As interest rates are still at a higher level than what the portfolio rates that you have are actually on the balance sheet, are you thinking about any deployment of capital into restructuring to take advantage and lock some of those rates in because it is a fragile opportunity like we saw here in the last quarter when rates can kind of reverse on this pretty quickly? Terrance Dolan : Yeah. I think your question, if I understand it and you kind of focus on that one area, but just what would we think about in terms of duration of assets and shifting maybe our focus from our asset growth perspective and it is kind of when the yield curve flattens, certainly strategies you end up looking at is emphasizing a little longer duration fixed rate sort of assets. So whether that's mortgage or auto or whatever might be the case. And then in the investment portfolio, as we see maturities and as we have the opportunity to invest cash, our expectation is we probably will go a little bit longer in terms of the duration of new purchases. So we are thinking about that. Marty Mosby : And any willingness to take some losses and restructure what's unavailable for sale to round up to the current rates? Terrance Dolan : We don't have any plans at this particular point in time to do that. Marty Mosby : Thanks. Terrance Dolan : Yeah. Andrew Cecere : Thanks, Marty. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez from UBS. Your line is open. Saul Martinez : Hey. Good morning, everybody. Andrew Cecere : Hey, Saul. Saul Martinez : Hey. A couple of questions, First, now with a consent order sort of in the rearview mirror, can you just give us what your updated thoughts are on your M&A strategy in organic growth opportunities? Just what are some of the parameters around which you might gauge any opportunities or if that's not part of the thought process, also that would you just let us know if there's any update on your M&A? How you're thinking about M&A right now? Andrew Cecere : So Saul. This is Andy. Actually the consent order doesn't really change our M&A strategy. I think the types of transactions you've seen us do in the last few quarters and as well as the last few years, we've been consistent with what we've focused on going forward, which are smaller payments, services deals, building capabilities around technology, the integrated software vendors that we talked about and so forth, so that isn't going to change. As I talked about, I think the opportunity that the exit of the consent order provides is physical asset optimization really optimizing our branch structure and that's both optimizing from the perspective of reducing space and/or the footprint as well as investing in certain locations to take advantage of where the market is going. So I think that's where you'll see us being a little bit more active. Saul Martinez : Okay. So there's really no thought -- no updated thought in terms of specifically how you might think about a deposit for you? Andrew Cecere : And throughout the consent process, we -- as we've talked about, there really hasn't been a transaction that's come across our desk when we look at all things, that we would have wanted to do. As we've talked about in this new environment, which is one where transactions are migrating away from the branch, we have more digital capabilities. The whole math around depository is very different, so I would expect our focus to be, as I said, on payments, transactions, software -- integrated software providers and optimizing the branch pressure. Terrance Dolan : And so the thing that I would add and things that we talked about. If you think about doing a, let's say a more significant depository sort of transaction, we have so many things that we think are critically important with respect to digital capabilities and kind of that whole transformation over the course of the next few years that if you did a fairly sizable transaction, there's a fair amount of management disruption that takes place as a result of that and -- but honestly we just don't think that should be our priority right now. Saul Martinez : Okay. Now, that's very clear. And the outlook for credit quality, and forgive me if you addressed this, I jumped on a little bit late, but what are your update -- did you give any expectations for what you think -- how you think NCOs or loan loss provisions may track or ALLL levels? And if not, just any color on how you're thinking about the credit quality outlook here? Terrance Dolan : So as we've said on the past, when you think about our particular portfolios on the commercial side, typically high investment grade on the consumer side, prime, super prime type of portfolios, our net charge off stay at 1 roughly around 50 basis points, little shy of that. And our outlook when we think about 2019 is credit quality continuing to be very stable and we don't see a significant change with respect to either the rate of net charge offs. From a provision standpoint, the provision will really track loan growth more than anything. Andrew Cecere : This quarter's increase to reserve and the $50 million is really a function of loan growth number just [indiscernible]. Saul Martinez : Got it. So we should expect ALLL level more or less to stay where they are at? Terrance Dolan : Yeah. Yeah, I would agree. And the other thing, early delinquencies and all those sort of statistics, we're just not seeing any real significant movement or change in that. So pretty stable. Saul Martinez : Okay, got it. Thanks so much. Terrance Dolan : Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, guys. Terrance Dolan : Good morning, Gerard. Andrew Cecere : Hey, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Andy, when you look out over the next 12 months, and if you agree that we are not likely to go into a recession in the United States and if you just take the geopolitical kind of episodic risk out there, what are the risks that you guys kind of talk about for the business over the next 12 months? Andrew Cecere : Well, you take out probably the principal risk that we talked about, the geopolitical risk. That is impactful. The outcome on tariffs impacts certain of our companies, I think that is a function of what decisions will be made, the confidence in those decisions deferring certain investments. Those are all encompassed in geopolitical and tariff component. I think the other factor for us and for many banks is what's happening with rates and the yield curve that's something at a high level that we're very focused on and some of the questions that came up in this call in terms of the balance sheet position and so forth. And then finally, the investments that we're making, the business the banking environment is changing very rapidly. And as we think about what we're doing with our payments businesses, with our branch footprint, with our structure, with our -- the ways we connect with our customers and the way we use data for the benefit of the customer, those are all the things we are focused on. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then maybe Terry, can you give us an update and I apologize if you've addressed this already, on just your views of Cecil and what you're expecting? And I assume you're expecting it will go live in the first quarter of 2020? Terrance Dolan : Yeah. I mean, purely from a timing standpoint, I think the entire industry has been in the process of developing and building models over the last couple of years. And we're in pretty good shape with respect to that. 2019 from our standpoint is kind of the final dimensioning of that as well as kind of running parallel with respect to our existing models to make sure that at -- will we go live on January 1, 2020, we're in good shape. If you end up thinking about, Cecil ends up getting impacted by where you're at in the business cycle at the time that you end up adopting this. And as you know, it'll create a little bit more volatility. But based upon current conditions, I think, some of the other estimates that are out there, 20% to 30% sort of impact is kind of a reasonable estimate on day one. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. And do you -- just to follow up on that, do you guys expect to kind of come out with something in the middle of this year or you're going to wait until the end of the year to get a full 12 months of the parallel systems and then obviously be very strong on the number that you know it's going to be? Terrance Dolan : Yeah. I think we'll probably -- I mean, our expectation right now is that midyear will start to be able to provide some ranges, but again the cautionary factor there is that that will be a point in time. And if conditions change between then and the end of the year, we would end up having to adjust. Gerard Cassidy : Sure. I appreciate it. Okay. Thank you. Terrance Dolan : Yeah, thanks. Operator : And we have no further questions in queue at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters. Jenn Thompson : Thanks for listening to our call. If you have any further questions, please contact Investor Relations Department. Operator : This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Following a review of the results by Andy Cecere, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Dolan, U.S. Bancorp\u2019s Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay, beginning today at approximately noon, Eastern Standard Time, through Wednesday April 24 at 12 :00 midnight, Eastern Standard Time. I\u2019ll now turn the conference call over to Jenn Thompson, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. Jenn Thompson : Thank you, Jeff, and good morning to everyone who\u2019s joined our call. Andy Cecere and Terry Dolan are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp\u2019s first quarter results and to answer your questions. Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. I\u2019d like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today\u2019s call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today\u2019s presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Andy. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Jenn, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry and I will be taking your questions. I\u2019ll begin on Slide 3. In the first quarter, we reported earnings of $1 per share. The slide highlights a number of financial metrics, but at a high level, growth in net interest income and fee revenues were in line with our expectations, credit quality was stable, and we delivered positive operating leverage. Our balance sheet is strong and growing and we continue to see good account and volume momentum across our fee businesses, which is driving market share gains. Turning to capital management; our book value increased by 8.6% from a year ago. During the quarter, we returned 77% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Slide 4 provides key performance metrics. In the first quarter, we delivered an 18.4% return on tangible common equity, and a 1.49% return on average assets. Now let me turn the call over to Terry, who\u2019ll provide more detail on the quarter as well as forward-looking guidance. Terry Dolan : Thanks, Andy. If you turn to Slide 5, I\u2019ll start with the balance sheet review and follow up with the discussion of our first quarter earnings trends. Average loans grew 0.9% on a linked-quarter basis and increased 3.7% year-over-year, excluding the impact of the second quarter 2018 sale of our federally guaranteed student loan portfolio and the fourth quarter 2019 sale of FDIC covered loans that had reached the end of the loss coverage period. On the consumer side, we saw good growth in our residential mortgage, retail leasing and installment loan portfolio. Digital acquisition of customer accounts across platforms continues to be robust. Commercial loan growth accelerated in the first quarter, driven by M&A-related lending, slower pay down activity, partly due to timing. New business pipelines are healthy, although, pay down activity is likely to remain elevated and chop in near term. As expected, commercial real estate loans decreased on a sequential and year-over-year basis. This quarter, commercial real estate contributed a 40 basis point drag to linked-quarter average loan growth and an 80 basis point drag to year-over-year average loan growth. Given what we consider to be a still unfavorable risk reward dynamic in certain areas of commercial real estate lending, we expect pay down pressure, which has moderated from peak levels, but continue \u2013 but will continue to restrict growth in this portfolio. Turning to Slide 6, deposits increased 0.3% on a linked-quarter basis and 0.2% year-over-year. As previously discussed, balance migration related to the business merger of a large financial client continues to impact deposit growth on a year-over-year basis. This migration impact on deposits will continue to moderate through mid-year. Slide 7 indicates that credit quality was relatively stable in the first quarter. Nonperforming assets increased modestly versus the fourth quarter, but were lower by 16.5% compared to the first quarter of 2018. Slide 8 highlights first quarter earnings. We generated earnings by $1 per share in the first quarter of 2019 compared to earnings per share of $0.96 a year ago. Turning to Slide 9, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was lower by 1.4% compared to the fourth quarter, but increased 2.8% year-over-year, which was in line with our expectations. Both linked-quarter and year-over-year comparisons benefited from loan growth and interest rate hikes. As is typical in the first quarter, linked-quarter growth was negatively impacted by two fewer days. The first quarter of 2019 also experienced lower interest recoveries than the fourth quarter of 2018. Slide 10 highlights trends in noninterest income. On a year-over-year basis, we saw mid-single-digit growth in both merchant processing revenue and corporate payments products revenue, each driven by higher sales volumes. Credit card and debit card revenue declined by 6.2% from a year ago despite strong average account growth this quarter. There were fewer processing days in the first quarter of 2019 than in the first quarter of 2018, which created an approximate 500 basis point headwind to year-over-year revenue growth. Also a favorable change in accounting for prepaid revenue in the first quarter of 2018 negatively impacted the credit and debit card revenue growth rate by approximately 400 basis points on a year-over-year basis. The billing cycle impact is simply a timing issue within the full year of 2019 credit and debit card revenue. Both of these items are idiosyncratic our business. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we sold our third-party ATM servicing business. However, we continue to provide operational services during a transitional conversion period. Given the sale, we have combined ATM processing revenue with debit \u2013 deposit service charges for recording purposes. The transition services revenue associated with ATM business is included in other income. As a result, for the decline and deposit service charges in the first quarter was driven by the impact of the sale of our ATM business. The increase in other income was driven by the inclusion of the transition services revenue, which will decrease over time as well as higher tax credits indications and equity investment revenue. Lower mortgage banking revenue in the first quarter was primarily driven by relative changes in MSR valuations. However, mortgage origination revenue grew in the first quarter and application volume was up 10% from a year ago. We continue to expect growth in mortgage banking revenue for the full year of 2019. Decline in treasury management fees continues to reflect the impact of changes in earnings credits, which is typical in a rising rate environment. The beneficial revenue and impact of compensating balances, which is reflected in net interest income, more than offset the decline in treasury management revenue. Turning to Slide 11, the year-over-year increase in noninterest expense reflected higher compensation expense, primarily due to the higher \u2013 impact of hirings to support business growth. This was partially offset by a decrease in other expense, primarily reflecting lower costs related to tax advantage projects and lower FDIC assessment costs. Slide 12 highlights our capital position. At March 31, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel 3 Standardized approach was 9.3%. This compares to our target of 8.5%. I\u2019ll now provide some forward-looking guidance. For the second quarter, we expect fully taxable equivalent net interest income to increase in the low single digits on a year-over-year basis. We expect fee revenue to increase in the low single digits year-over-year, including the negative impact of the sale of the ATM business. We expect to deliver positive operating leverage of 100 to 150 basis points for the full year of 2019, in line with our previous guidance. We continue to expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately 20% on a full year basis. Credit quality in the second quarter is expected to remain relatively stable compared with the first quarter. Loan loss provision expense growth will continue to be reflective of loan growth. I\u2019ll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Terry. The start of the year is saving enough of cash we expected. The U.S. economy is healthy and supportive of growth and a credit quality environment is stable. Macro environment aside, we are confident in our ability to execute and win market share across our lending and fee businesses, supported by our scale, our skill and our risk management discipline. Success in the banking industry will increasingly depend on our ability and determination to adapt to the evolving demands of our customers. The investments we\u2019re making in technology and innovation will play a critical role in our long-term success. And the payoff will be increasingly visible in the form of customer acquisition or retention as well as operational efficiency. One area we\u2019ve been placing a lot of attention is our digital capabilities. We recently launched our newly developed mobile app, which incorporates improves sales functionality and enables a more seamless experience for our customers. Early, feedback from users has been very positive. If you turn to Slide 13, I want to share a few digital metrics we track. You can see from these slides that digital engagement with our customers is growing and an increasing percentage of transactions and lending activities are occurring outside of our physical locations. Particularly encouraging is the trend in digital loan sales. Approximately one-third of all loan sales are now completed digitally up from 25% a year ago. Mortgage lending and small business lending are early digital lending success stories. Currently, nearly 75% of all mortgage loans are completed digitally end-to-end, and that percentage is growing. This past September, we lost the fully digital lending solution for small businesses that can significantly reduce the customers\u2019 time to credit decision and funding to in some cases, as short as one hour. Migration of sales and transactions to our digital platform will enhance customer experience, improve operational efficiency and enable expansion into existing markets, where we currently have customers, but little or no physical footprint. In closing, we\u2019re off to a good start to the year and momentum is building across our businesses. I\u2019d like to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication throughout the year. That concludes our formal remarks. We\u2019ll now open up the call to Q&A. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. John McDonald : Thank you. Andy and Terry, hi, good morning. I wanted to ask you guys about the operating leverage target for this year. You came in at the low end of the range, the 1 to 1.5 this quarter, but that included some pressure from the billing cycle processing days issue. So as you look ahead, do you have a bias towards the lower or the higher end of that 1 to 1.50 range? Or I guess, may be said differently, what kind of environment would get you at the lower end of the operating leverage target and what would it need to do to get to the higher end? Terry Dolan : Yes, John. This is Terry. And I think that where we end up in the range will partly driven by what sort of revenue growth we see throughout the year. The extent that revenue growth picks up a little bit gives us the opportunity to be close to the higher end, but if it\u2019s a challenging revenue environment, we\u2019re more likely to be closer to that lower end of the range, I think we\u2019re just going to continue to manage to and make decisions based upon both short-term and long-term sort of objectives of the company. John McDonald : Okay. And what\u2019s the right level of expense growth for USB in this kind of environment? You have got a little less pressure from compliance spend and some relief there, but on the other hand, you\u2019re stepping up investments and you\u2019re getting a little help from FDIC\u2019s surcharge roll off. How should we think about our expenses? And what you think about this year? And what\u2019s kind of a good target for you guys? Andy Cecere : Hi, John. This is Andy. Yes, you\u2019re right about both of these items. The pressure on compliance cost is eased as well as we\u2019re getting some benefit from FDIC. We will continue to make technology investments for all the digital capabilities that I referred to in my comments. I think another important factor is what the lifting of the consent order. We have a lot more flexibility and physical asset optimization. So I think the other lever that you\u2019re going to see us utilized is branch optimization, which over the next couple of years, I would expect 10% to 15% reduction in our actual physical account of branches. We\u2019re going to open up some in places, we\u2019re going to be remodeling and changing the footprint, but the net of it will be down 10% to 15%. John McDonald : Okay. And then just one follow-up on the operating leverage. Is there any cadence or seasonality to kind of the operating leverage and did that billing issue with the processing days hurt you in the first quarter and keep you at the lower end? Thanks. Terry Dolan : Yes. So from a seasonality standpoint, certainly the impact of the credit card revenue growth did end up impacting it. But as probably narrows just a little bit midyear and then tends to expand in the fourth quarter, it\u2019s fairly consistent through the year. Andy Cecere : That\u2019s right, Terry. Typically over the past many years, I think our strongest and weakest quarters just in terms of principally driven by revenue seasonality, a lot of it\u2019s the payment businesses, but a lot of businesses, three, four, two, one strongest to weakest. John McDonald : Okay. But in terms of year-over-year operating leverage that doesn\u2019t necessarily apply, that\u2019ll depend on the environment more so whether you get up to that 1.5? Terry Dolan : Yes, on the revenue environment, right. Andy Cecere : Yes, where the revenue grows because some of it\u2019s variable expense. John McDonald : Okay. Thank you. Andy Cecere : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open. John Pancari : Good morning. Andy Cecere : Hi, John. Terry Dolan : Hey, John. John Pancari : On the margin side, first on the \u2013 actually more specifically around deposits, we saw pretty good decline in the non-interest-bearing in the quarter. Can you give us a little bit more color around the driver of that and if you expect a continued shift at that pace into interest-bearing? I want to get your thoughts on that first. Terry Dolan : Yes. So there\u2019s certainly continues to be some migration to interest-bearing sort of deposits by our customers. We\u2019re seeing it mostly on the wholesale side as well as a little bit on the trust side. And that\u2019s a function of them looking for higher yield. It\u2019s also a function as earnings credit rates have come up with rising rates just more excess deposits that they have the opportunity to be able to shift. I do think that that moderates a bit simply because with short-term rates kind of on hold, there\u2019s going to be a lot of less pressure on earnings credit rates and then that is going to not reduced, but at least lower the increase of the any excess deposits. So, I do expect it to moderate a bit. John Pancari : Okay. So how would that play into your margin outlook here, as you saw about a bit of expansion in this quarter. Is it fair to assume relatively stable despite that continue to flow into interest bearing but with the expected abatement? Thanks. Terry Dolan : Yes. So as saw, our net interest margin was up a one basis point on a linked-quarter basis. Given the current rate environment, my expectations from a deposit standpoint is that deposit base will compare, the pricing will continue to creep up a little bit. It will be more driven by the loan growth than, where that loan growth is occurring. Our expectation is really no rate hikes for the rest of the year, that the yield curve stays relatively flat. And given that environment, our outlook for the rest of the year is a fairly flat net interest margin. And then the other thing I would just point out is that there is a little bit of seasonality for us because of our credit card portfolio. In the second quarter, it\u2019s usually flat to down a little bit one basis point or two. So just kind of expect that in the second quarter, but for the full year and through the rest of the year, we pretty much expect it to be flat. John Pancari : Got it. All right. Thanks, Terry. Operator : Your next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Hi, Good morning. Terry Dolan : Good morning, Erica. Erika Najarian : I just wanted to follow-up on John\u2019s question on positive operating leverage. Just wanted to be clear because I think there\u2019s a little bit of confusion how the market interpreted your comments on the previous call. So in the environment we\u2019re both NII and fees are going low single-digits, can we assume that expenses will be flat to up 1% if that\u2019s the revenue environment that we are in? I\u2019m just trying to make sure we\u2019re interpreting it correctly. Terry Dolan : Yes. Erika, we clearly don\u2019t understand the revenue environment that we\u2019re in right now. And we\u2019re looking at every opportunity to be able to manage our expenses down. So I think your expectation is right that we\u2019re going to be very prudent with respect to our spending. We look at -- from a leverage standpoint, Andy talked a total bit about physical optimization you\u2019re looking at any discretionary spending. You remember from the fourth quarter, we went through kind of an organizational redesign that will have some benefits to us throughout this year and also in the first quarter with the Tim Welsh taking over our consumer banking business. That gives us the opportunity to kind of look at the organizational design structure. So it\u2019s little whole variety of different things. And then if you remember FDIC surcharge going the way giving us some flexibility in order to be able to get there. So, I think there are number of different levers, but it is challenging, but we\u2019re going to end up having to manage in that environment and that\u2019s our expectation. Erika Najarian : Got it. Perfect. And underneath your outlook for flat net interest margin, you\u2019ve often talked to us about the concept of terminal betas especially on the commercial side. In the environment of no Fed rate hikes, what kind of flexibility do you have on your pricing? And if you could, because we\u2019ve done so well in the past, give us a sense of how you think pricing will trend on the commercial side versus the retail side? Terry Dolan : Yes. I think that given the right environment without rate hikes, again, I think, the deposit pricing and how that changes will be a function of what sort of loan growth you see and the need to -- and the competition you have with respect to deposits in that situation. I do expect that on the wholesale trust side, there is still going to be -- continue to be some pressure, but I do believe that, that alleviates itself quite a bit. The other thing is that, if you end of \u2013 looking at our deposit growth, we\u2019re seeing the deposit growth in terms of consumer balances, and as you know, the pricing flexibility on that site is a little bit better. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open. Scott Siefers : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Terry Dolan : Moring, Scott. Scott Siefers : Terry. I was just wondering if you could spend just a second digging into your loan growth outlook. I guess, my understanding was sort of the 1Q would be sort of seasonally weaker and then maybe things accelerate a bit from there. But in your prepared remarks, you\u2019ve mentioned, the pay down pressure and particularly on the CRE side a couple of times. So just curious for any updated thoughts you might have on the overall loan growth trajectory? Terry Dolan : Yes. So when we end up looking at the loan growth. I think, it\u2019s hard to look also too far. Certainly when we think about the second quarter, our expectations is that loans will grow kind of in line with a linked-quarter growth that we saw in the first quarter. But may be let me give a little bit of context in terms of some of the dynamics. The middle market loan growth was stronger in the first quarter, on a linked-quarter basis, it was up about a 1.3%, and year-over-year, its closer to about 5%. So we saw a nice growth in the middle market space. We saw a good growth with respect to our auto lending. It was a little bit less price competitive during the first quarter, and we kind of expect that to continue. Residential mortgages are -- our mortgage volume was a strong in the first quarter and so we continue to believe that\u2019s going to be a positive thing. C&I, in general, was good. I mean, I think the economy is solid, our C&I pipelines are strong at this particular point in time and businesses continue to spend and makes some business investment. And so I think there is a lot of different factors that would suggest that sort of growth will continue. I think there\u2019re two things in terms of overall total loans that created a bit of a drag. We talked little bit about our Commercial Real Estate portfolio, and our expectation is that will continue to slowly -- to continue to be a bit of a drag throughout the rest of the year just based upon where we\u2019re at in the business cycle. And then within C&I kind of buried there is tax exempt loans. And when the tax rates change for a corporates coming down, but individuals staying pretty high, the appetite I guess what where the opportunity build to grow tax exempt in the corporate size equation or a banking size equation is a little bit more challenging. So that on a linked-quarter basis in the first quarter was about 20 basis points drag for us. So it is kind of a number of puts and takes, but overall, we feel good about where the economy is and where our businesses are spending. Scott Siefers : Okay. Perfect, that\u2019s a good color. I appreciate that. And then if I could, one more \u2013 take that one, just maybe your other fee income, I think there was kind of not too long ago where you were doing about $250 million a quarter. That be definitely a big outsized quarter, but more recently, it\u2019s kind of crapped up there kind of steadily, consistently been in sort of a $225 million to $250 million range. If you look at $247 million this quarter, is that a pretty good base to go off of or was there anything volatile or unusual in there? Terry Dolan : Yes. That\u2019s a little bit of lumpy in terms of other revenue. Probably the guidance that I would end up giving you is that, through the rest of the year, we would expect the range to be somewhere between $175 million to $225 million on the quarterly basis. So if you\u2019re modeling kind of in between there, I think that\u2019s a good estimate. Scott Siefers : All right. That\u2019s perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Andy, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve spoken since the up mergers of equals transactions we got last quarter. And I think we all know where you have stood as far as the current strategic imperatives of work on the digital strategy consolidate some of the branches. Just wondering as where you stand on your view of our U.S. banks size and scale? And how you think if any differently just about either the need or desire to think about Bank M&A down the road even, if not today, but just from a bigger picture strategic point? Andy Cecere : Sure, Ken. First, let me say we consider all options for growth and we look at anything that is available and/or any strategic initiative that would be sensible for our company. But I will tell you, I think our near-term focus will likely be on the fee businesses, the working processing to trust businesses that we\u2019re focusing on. We have a lot of momentum across our digital activities, you have a lot more flexibility and now that we\u2019re out of the consent order, we\u2019re making a lot of progress across all of our business plans, and I feel very comfortable with where we are today. Ken Usdin : Okay. And then two just small ones. First, on the card spending rate of growth slowing, I know part was a billing cycle, but just can you just talk to us about what of it is just the underlying in terms of any changes you\u2019re just seeing or feeling in terms of just the consumer? That was the first one. The second one was just, commercial loans are up a lot sequentially about 30 basis points, I\u2019m just wondering what was underneath that increase? Thanks guys. Terry Dolan : Yes. So maybe on the consumer spend, again we talked about the fewer processing days necessarily was an impact. But one of the thing that we saw kind of post holiday is that consumer spend did drop pretty dramatically, came back in January, a little stronger in February and it is kind of that 4% year-over-year growth rate in March. Our expectation on a full year basis is that, that will continue to get stronger kind of in that 5% to 6% sort of range in terms of continuing to accelerate from a sales standpoint. From a revenue perspective, I think that, again, it\u2019s going to continue to get stronger in the second and third quarter. We\u2019ll recapture some of those processing days. But our expectation for our credit and debit card revenue for the full year, given the impact of the first quarter, is really low single-digits at this particular point in time. Andy Cecere : And, Terry, that first quarter, it was the period government shut down, there was some turbulence in equity market, there was weather impacts across our geographies sales, those things and all passed us right now, that\u2019s why we look more confident and what more. Terry Dolan : Yes, it is hard to identified any single or anyone of those things. But I think every one of them had some impact in the early part of the first quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Terry Dolan : Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Recently, you\u2019ve announced the hiring of a new Chief Digital Officer, Derek White, and I just wanted to understand what your expectation is for how Derek is going to be impacting our U.S. Bancorp? He\u2019s a pretty senior higher, I know you did a whole revamp of our mobile platform, so I\u2019m wondering what\u2019s left? Andy Cecere : There is a lot left. So we have a lot of activity going on from the digital perspective. We have a 20 agile studios in growing. We have just developed a new app and we\u2019re to continue to enhance and we continue to improve that. We have real-time payments that\u2019s impacting the consumer side of the equation as well as the wholesale, and ultimately, payments. We have AI going on. We have block chain. We have initiatives across all the business lines focused on digital activities and Derek\u2019s goal will be to really bring that altogether into a common U.S. bank sort of vision and theme, so that we\u2019re really optimizing with their customers across all business lines and really leveraging capabilities across our all of our business lines for the benefit of the customer. So we\u2019re excited to have Derek on board. He has great capabilities, a great background, and I think he\u2019s going to fit in the team perfectly. Betsy Graseck : Okay. So it\u2019s beyond consumer and also in areas like B2B? Andy Cecere : Yes. It is. Terry Dolan : Yes. I think one of the other things that kind of ties into that is continuing to enhance and to improve our anti-digital marketing sort of capabilities into that all digital strategy, data analytics and a lot of those other things that will help drive growth in the future. Betsy Graseck : And when we think about the impact on the P&L, the improvement in digital and improvement in real-time is, obviously, very positive for clients. Does it -- how does it impact your P&L? Is it neutral? Do you give up slowed, but get back volume? I\u2019m just trying to think through how you think about the ROIC and all of this? Andy Cecere : Yes, Betsy, as I think about this, I think these enhancements to both revenue and expense. Because from a revenue standpoint, I think, it is going to allow for additional customer acquisition as well as retention, building the customer from a centrality standpoint. On the expense side of the equation , I think, it offers operational efficiencies. If you think about check processing, carrier cost and things of all those source of things, overtime, I think, it will offer benefits on both sides. Betsy Graseck : And the flows give up really is in that bigger deal? Andy Cecere : No the flow \u2013 there\u2019s positive and negative with that. And I think the negative is not going to be that material. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Vivek. Vivek Juneja : Good morning. A couple of questions for you. One is, did I cash this correctly the prepaid cards, the accounting change in the first quarter of 2018 that benefited by 400 basis points or did I miss to hear that? Terry Dolan : Yes, the impact was favorable a year ago. So it actually had a negative impact to the growth rate this year of about 400 basis points. If you think about we\u2019re down 6.2%, there was a 500 basis point drag where I did three fewer processing days, 400 basis points drag related to the accounting change, and then the drag associated with the consumer spend dynamics that we saw early in the first quarter. Vivek Juneja : Okay. And that favorable accounting change, Terry, did that benefit all of 2018 then or is this something that reversed in the rest of 2018? How did it play out? Terry Dolan : No, it was a onetime item in the first quarter of 2018, so it was one time. So it won\u2019t impact anything related to our future quarters from a comparison standpoint. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Got It. And this 500 basis point fuel processing days that should completely reversal with the course of the next quarter or is it take multiple quarters to do that? Terry Dolan : Yes, it is not necessarily in the second quarter. We would expect it to reverse principally in the third quarter. By year-over-year basis, 2019 versus 2018 they\u2019re actually two fewer processing days in total. So we\u2019re going to get some of it back, but not all of them this year. Vivek Juneja : Yes, okay. Okay, great. Thank you. Terry Dolan : You bet. Andy Cecere : Thanks for that. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Kevin Barker : Good morning. I just want to follow up on some of the comments you made about commercial real estate, is it feels like there is a distinct shift here as we go into 2019 versus the outlook for the competitive environment that we saw on the latter half of 2018. You mentioned in where we are in the business cycle in some of your remarks, I am just wanted to get a little more color on where you\u2019re seeing either outsized competition now or maybe some softness in certain parts of the commercial real estate market. Terry Dolan : Yes. So we\u2019re certainly seen, I think with respect to the capital markets with rates coming down we saw, I think, opportunity for some of that project financing to be refinanced in the first quarter. I think that\u2019s part of it. We\u2019re also seeing insurance companies, pension plans that have been a little more active with respect to taking out construction lending and providing the permanent financing maybe then what we have seen in the past. Fourth quarter was a little bit of an anomaly for us, because the first quarter kind of got \u2013 some of the first quarter activity got pulled forward into the fourth order. But when we think about commercial real estate, going through the rest of the year the type of pay down activity, I think we expect it to continue. So, the coin in the portfolio is probably going to be fairly consistent through the year. In terms of type of product, in terms of where we\u2019re seeing it, I just really kind of across the board in terms of all the different areas, but it\u2019s really from construction to that permanent financing stage. And part of that is, we\u2019re at this particular point in the business cycle, we\u2019re just not willing to extend out terms and go deeper with respect to commercial real estate at this particular point in time. Andy Cecere : lower funding cost in the spots in the curve\u2026: Terry Dolan : Yes. Andy Cecere : That we typically would go. Terry Dolan : Yes. Kevin Barker : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then to follow up on some of the comments around in the mobile strategy, you introduced the small business mobile app and from the lending you did last year. Can you just give an update on the progress that you\u2019ve seen from that rollout, what the growth looks like and what it has done incrementally to your overall loan growth. Andy Cecere : Yeah. So we spent a \u2013 I mentioned the agile teams, that was a great example of the agile team coming together in a matter of months to develop a product that allowed for funding and what was typically days or weeks to hours. And it\u2019s in early innings of the project, but it\u2019s been very favorable in terms of offering customers convenient choice. Your questions before the approval process to get them approved, funding much more rapidly and it\u2019s all part of the mobile app activity that we talked about that allows for just a more convenient, simple or set of navigation options and also sales and information. So it\u2019s part of a larger strategy. And also I want to highlight that the mobile app that we are introducing out it\u2019s just phase one. It will continue to be updated and enhanced and you\u2019ll see more and more of these capabilities. I also mentioned in my prepared remarks that currently 75% of our mortgage apps are now done in a digital fashion end-to-end which is a huge improvement and a great convenience from a customer standpoint. Terry Dolan : And I think that is one of the drivers in terms of why we are seeing application really stronger, and it\u2019s one of the reasons why we feel pretty bullish on mortgage origination through the rest of the year. Kevin Barker : Okay. Thank you Andy and thank you Terry. Andrew Cecere : Yes. Terry Dolan : Thanks, Kevin. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Your line is open. Saul Martinez : Hey, good morning guys. A couple of questions, sort of granular questions. First on your deposit service charges of $217 million. Obviously, it\u2019s not comparable to the prior quarters because of the ATM processing, the ATM sale \u2013 business sale, which had been consolidated in prior quarters. And I think it was in there one month in the fourth quarter, but my understanding is that not all of that goes away. So how do I think about the $217 million on a like-for-like basis versus previous quarters versus the fourth quarter and the first quarter. I think they were doing like $45 million a quarter, but what kind of adjustments do we need to make to the prior quarters to get more of an apples to apples comparison? Terry Dolan : Yes, the ATM business was sold of mid fourth quarter. So the change and deposit service charges fourth, excuse me, first quarter to first quarter is a pretty good metric or indicator with respect to the type of impact that it will have on deposit service charges going forward. And I think that\u2019s probably the best way of kind of thinking about it. Saul Martinez : Okay. So, sorry. So the best ways to sort of look at the year-on-year Delta versus where it was in the first quarter of 2018. Terry Dolan : So the Delta was about $44 million, $45 million, I think the Delta is a pretty good metric. Saul Martinez : Okay. So it\u2019s a about $40 million to $45 million. So not all of it goes away from what you previously were posting in that ATM processing services line, which was like $80 million to $90 million a quarter. Terry Dolan : That\u2019s right. Because it included in that was third party service provider fees as well as that branded ATM fees. Saul Martinez : Got it. And then on your C&I loan yields, it tipped up quite a bit this quarter. They were up like 30, almost 30 basis points, I think 29 basis points, which is fairly high even in a quarter where you have a hike and LIBOR obviously moved up. The average LIBORmoved up less than in prior quarters, if anything unusual in that tick up and commercial loan yields that we should be aware of or it seems like a pretty big increase. Terry Dolan : Yes, typically I think you would expect to see about maybe 60% of the rate hike that would be probably more normal, so maybe in that 20 basis points. The rest of it is really kind of driven by the mix of the growth in the portfolio. So it\u2019s really more of a mix issue. Saul Martinez : Okay. So you get some rate hike and then you\u2019re benefiting obviously I guess from the mix as well. Terry Dolan : Exactly. Yes. Saul Martinez : All right. Okay. Got It. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Mike Mayo : Hi, can you hear me? Terry Dolan : Yes, Mike. Andy Cecere : Yes, Mike. Mike Mayo : Great, so I know Betsy asked one question about Derek White, I guess comes from BBVA, which is considered one of the leaders in digital banking. That\u2019s a pretty big higher. So what metrics should we on the outside look to see if the digital banking effort will be successful? Say in one, two or three years, is it percentage of customers that are engaged digitally? Is it customer satisfaction? What would be your metrics for success for whatever Derek White will be doing there? Andy Cecere : Thanks Mike. And it is all those things, it\u2019s digital engagement. It\u2019s going to be sales activity and be as a digital platform. It\u2019s going to be customer activity via digital platform and we\u2019re going to share more of those with you on this call and in our quarterly earnings and starting with what we did today because it is something we\u2019re very focused on from a company perspective and because we\u2019re focused on, I want to make sure you\u2019re aware of it. Mike Mayo : And you were \u2013 I think pretty recently said you might be going out of footprint with some digital banking efforts, kind of joining in on the national digital banking wars, so to speak. That\u2019s my term, not yours. But it does seem like everyone\u2019s doing that around the same time. How does this hiring impact your plans to go out of market for more retail customers? Andy Cecere : That is still our plan. And as a reminder, we have a number of customers outside of our 25 states that are either credit card, mortgage or on loan customers. We also have large employee bases. And I think what we\u2019re focused on is expanding and what I\u2019ll call it digital light strategy, branch light strategy, digital first strategy, which is with a few branches with this digital capability that we\u2019re talking about and encompassing the current customer base and becoming a more full bank experience for those customers. Mike Mayo : And then one short follow-up by last one. You\u2019ve been around a long time, the industry and the business, it\u2019s just we haven\u2019t found too many examples of cross selling to a credit card company. A lot of other say deposit and other products. You are changing a single product customer, whether it\u2019s in credit cards or auto and making them a full relationship customer. So why is now different? Or maybe there\u2019s examples that you see that I don\u2019t. Terry Dolan : Yes, a fair question, Mike. I think what\u2019s changed over the past few years is the capabilities that you can do from a digital platform. So historically, you really need a physical presence to expand the customer relationship. And if you didn\u2019t have a branch in that location or many branches, the density of branches, you weren\u2019t able to really extend the relationship. I think with the capabilities today, the two thirds of transactions happen on a mobile device. The fact that 70% of our customers use the digital platform, all those facts allow you to enter a market with this branch light concept with a digital platform that is different from a few years ago. And I think that\u2019s the major change. Mike Mayo : All right, thank you. Andy Cecere : Yeah. I think the other thing that I would add is that I think a big part of the digital world is the experiential aspect associated with it. And if you think about Millennials and Gen Z et cetera, being much more digitally attempt, and I think that \u2013 as that continues to occur, it\u2019s going to continue to create that opportunity. Mike Mayo : Thanks again. Andy Cecere : Thanks Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your lines is open. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you, good morning. Andy and Terry, how are you? Andy Cecere : Good morning, Gerard. Terry Dolan : Doing well. Gerard Cassidy : Could you guys share with us, obviously credit quality is very strong throughout the industry and for you folks as well, are there any issues on the horizon that you\u2019re keeping your eye on that we should be aware of just as a general trend on credit and then also as you answered that question, can you think about also your exposure to retail malls in the stuff that\u2019s increased activity and retailers shutting down stores and maybe there might be some pressure in that type of portfolio down the road? Terry Dolan : Yeah, good question. Certainly with respect to our portfolio, there\u2019s nothing really on the horizon that we\u2019re too concerned about as you know that our portfolio is principally prime based and that\u2019s true across all of our consumer sort of product and on the commercial side of the equation typically is an investment grade, high investment grade type of customers that we do business with. So I don\u2019t think there is a particular areas that we have that it stands out as a concern for us, certainly in commercial real estate. And one of the reasons why we\u2019re not extending terms and those sorts of things is just that at this particular point in the business cycle, we think it\u2019s prudent just to continue to hold our own as opposed to expand and grow. And then maybe coming back to your question with respect to retail malls, it \u2013 I think that will continue to be an area of pressure if you think about the industry. But for us, the exposure I believe is less than $250 million. So it just isn\u2019t a big exposure for us at this particular point in time. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then shifting to deposit betas back in 1994, 1995, Chairman Greenspan shifted his policy and interest rates from raising rates to cutting rates within six months in 1995. If Chairman Paul decides to cut fed fund rates this fall and some futures markets are suggesting he might do that. How quickly would your deposit betas start to fall following the Fed reducing short end rates? Terry Dolan : As soon as the rate starts moving down, we and I think the industry would be fairly proactive in terms of bringing deposit pricing down along with it. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you. Terry Dolan : Yeah. Thanks, Gerard. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Jenn Thompson for closing remarks. Jenn Thompson : Thank you all for listening to our earnings call. Please contact the Investor Relations department if you have any follow-up questions. Operator : This concludes the U.S. Bancorp\u2019s first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to U.S. Bancorp's Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Following a review of the results by Andy Cecere, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Dolan, U.S. Bancorp's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon, Eastern daylight time, through Wednesday, July 24, at 12 :00 midnight, Eastern daylight time. I will now turn the conference over to Jen Thompson, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. Jennifer Thompson : Thank you, Jack, and good morning to everyone who's joined our call. Andy Cecere and Terry Dolan are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's second quarter results and to answer your questions. Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com.  I'd like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Andy. Andrew Cecere : Thanks, Jen, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry and I will take your questions. I'll begin on Slide 3. In the second quarter, we reported earnings per share of $1.09. Despite our more challenging interest rate environment for the banking industry that has seen in some time, we delivered strong financial results supported by top line revenue growth and positive operating leverage of 1%. Loan and deposit trends improved compared with the first quarter, and we saw a broad-based momentum across our key businesses driven by account and volume growth. Credit quality remained stable, and we continue to prudently manage operating expense, while appropriately investing for the future.  Turning to capital management. Our book value per share increased by 9.7% from a year ago. During the quarter, we returned 79% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. In June, we received the results of our CCAR submission, and the Federal Reserve did not object to our capital plan, which included a dividend increase of 13.5%.  Slide 4 provides key performance metrics. In the second quarter, we delivered a return on average common equity of 15% and a return on average assets of 1.55%. Our return on tangible common equity was 19.2%. Our efficiency ratio improved both on a linked-quarter and year-over-year basis. Now let me turn the call over to Terry who'll provide more detail on the quarter as well as forward-looking guidance. Terrance Dolan : Thanks, Andy. If you turn to Slide 5, I'll start with the balance sheet review and follow-up with the discussion of second quarter earnings trends. Average loans grew 1.1% on a linked-quarter basis and increased 4.5% year-over-year, excluding the fourth quarter 2018 sale of FDIC-covered loans that had reached the end of the loss coverage period. Solid year-over-year growth in mortgages, credit cards and installment loans supported solid consumer loan trends, while commercial loan growth reflected strength in both large corporate and middle-market lending, partly offset by paydowns related to active capital markets.  New business pipelines remained healthy, although paydown activity is likely to remain elevated and choppy near term. Commercial Real Estate loans decreased on a sequential and a year-over-year basis. This quarter, Commercial Real Estate contribute a 20 basis point drag to linked-quarter average loan growth and an 80 basis point drag to year-over-year average loan growth. Given what we consider to be unfavorable risk/reward dynamics in certain areas of Commercial Real Estate lending, we expect paydown pressure to continue to restrict growth in this portfolio.  Turning to Slide 6. Deposits increased 2.9% on a linked-quarter basis and 3.1% year-over-year. Compared with the prior year period, growth in consumer wealth management and corporate trust balances was offset by lower Corporate and Commercial customer balances. Balances continued to migrate to higher yielding savings and time deposits from noninterest-bearing deposits. The decline in Corporate and Commercial banking balances were also affected in part by migration related to the business merger of a large financial client. This migration has stabilized and will be less impactful in future quarters.  Slide 7 indicates that credit quality was relatively stable in the second quarter. Nonperforming assets decreased 5.2% versus the first quarter and were down 12.6% in the same period a year ago. Commercial loan 90-day delinquencies were elevated this quarter as a result of an administrative matter related to a single customer and is expected to be resolved in the third quarter without a credit loss. Slide 8 highlights the second quarter earnings results. We reported earnings of $1.09 per share in the second quarter of 2019 compared with earnings per share of $1.02 a year ago. Turning to Slide 9. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis grew by 1.4% compared with first quarter and increased by 3.3% year-over-year, which was in line with our expectations. Both linked quarter and year-over-year comparisons benefited from loan growth, offset by the impact of a flatter yield curve. Linked quarter growth also reflected an additional day in the quarter and higher interest recoveries. Slide 10 highlights trends in noninterest income. On a year-over-year basis, we saw mid-single-digit growth in credit and debit card revenue, corporate payments revenue and merchant processing revenue driven by higher sales volume in each category. Trust and investment management fees grew 3.5% due to business growth and favorable market conditions. And 6.4% growth in commercial product revenue was driven by higher corporate bond fees and trading revenue partly offset by lower syndication fees. Mortgage origination revenue decreased on a year-over-year basis. Strong origination and sales volumes were offset by an unfavorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights, net of the hedging activity. The year-over-year decline in deposit service charges reflected the impact of the sale of our third-party ATM servicing business in the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase in other income was partly driven by the inclusion of the related transition services revenue from this sale, which will decline over time as well as higher tax credit syndications and equity investment revenue.  Turning to Slide 11. The year-over-year increase in noninterest expense reflected higher personnel costs and professional services and technology expense tied to business growth initiatives. This was partially -- partly offset by a decrease in other expense primarily reflecting lower costs related to tax-advantaged projects and lower FDIC assessment costs.  Slide 12 highlights our capital position. At June 30, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, estimated using the Basel III Standardized approach, was 9.5%. This compares to our target of 8.5%. I will now provide some forward-looking guidance. For the third quarter, we expect fully taxable equivalent net interest income to increase in the low single digits on a year-over-year basis. We expect fee revenue to increase in the mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. We expect to deliver positive operating leverage of 100 to 150 basis points for the full year 2019, in line with our previous guidance.  We continue to expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately 20% on a full year basis. Credit quality in the third quarter is expected to remain relatively stable compared with the second quarter. Loan loss provision expense growth will continue to be reflective of loan growth. Now I'll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks Andrew Cecere : Thanks, Terry. The U.S. economy remains healthy, the jobs market is robust and the business and consumer confidence remains supportive of favorable consumer spending, parent as well as related business investment. While the flattening yield curve has created a more challenging interest rate environment, our core deposit franchise, interest deposit mix and consistent risk management philosophy puts us in a strong relative position from which we will navigate. Fundamental transient needs for our major key businesses are healthy and importantly, are being fueled by growth in new accounts and expansion of existing relationships, which in turn is driving strong volume growth.  Our loan growth came in a little better than we had anticipated in the second quarter, and we are confident in our ability to win market share across our consumer as well as commercial portfolios.  We are investing in the future with digital initiatives a key focus. As you can see on Slide 13, loan sales are being increasingly sourced through our digital channels. We expect this trend to continue with the expected outcome a better customer experience, higher account and volume growth and improved operational efficiency. The success of our digital mortgage program continues to meet or exceed our expectations. Currently, over 80% of all mortgage loan applications are completed digitally.  Small business lending is another area where meaningful digital migration is occurring. As a reminder, last fall we launched a portal that allows small business customers to apply for and fund a loan up to $250,000 entirely, digitally and [indiscernible] consumer reaction has been extremely positive. In June, about 25% of applications for loans of this size used our digital portal. And year-to-date, book loan volume in this category is up 7% versus the same period a year ago. To summarize, the second quarter came in as we expected, and we are well positioned as we head into the second half of the year. I'd like to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which drove these results. That concludes our formal remarks. We will now open up the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matthew O'Connor: I'm sorry if I missed this, we've just been jumping around here. But the margin was a little more resilient this quarter than I would have thought, given some of the growth and things like securities and other earning assets, but basically lower-yielding asset bucket. So even though the NIM was in line with what you guys had said, it just seemed a little more resilient and was wondering what drove that and then if you gave any NIM outlook. Terrance Dolan : Yes. This is Terry. So I think part of that resiliency is just loan growth and where we end up seeing so that -- kind of a mix of loan growth. I think that was one of the major drivers. The -- we continue to have a little bit of accretion with respect to the investment portfolio and of course, the change in yield curve came very late in the quarter. So I think there's just a number of drivers like that. Then the -- if you think about net interest margin, our outlook, if you think about for the third quarter, our current forecast assumes a 2-rate decline for the rest of 2019, one in the end of July and one in September. And the long end of the curve staying essentially kind of where it. And as a result of that, we're going to see some pressure with respect to net interest margin during the second half of the year, okay? When we think about the margin, our expectation is, it is going to decline in the high single digits in the third quarter, and there are two reasons for that : the first one has really no impact on net interest income. And let me talk a little bit about that. So while half of the impact is due to a change in the regulatory -- in a European regulatory policy that has the effect of restricting our ability to include these balances in the LCR ratio. It is an industry-wide policy change by the European regulatory agencies, but because LCR is a binding constraint for us, we will have to increase our liquidity position by purchasing HQLA securities and funding this growth through borrowings that'll have similar sort of rates. So earning assets will grow, and that will offset the impact of about half of the change in net interest margin. The other half of net interest margin will decline because -- directly related to our expectation of the decline in rate as well as where the long-term yields are right now. Andrew Cecere : So good summary, Terry. And just to reiterate about half of that decline in net interest margin is not impactful at all to net interest income. It's just a little higher asset offset by a little lower rate due to that regulatory change that you talked about. And I think when we're all set and done that we expect on a year-over-year basis, net interest income to be up in that very low single digit range given the rate declines that we expect here, and as Terry talked about, in the second half of the year. Matthew O'Connor: Okay. And I mean there's obviously, some moving pieces on rates between here and the October call, but I just -- as we think about, say, the fourth quarter NIM, the impact of building liquidity is that could be fully in the run rate in 3Q? Or is there going to be kind of a stop impact of that in 4Q? And then should we think about a similar kind of core decline in the NIM in the 4Q if we get another rate cut in September? Terrance Dolan : Yes. So let me answer the first question first. So on the fourth quarter related to the build in liquidity, that will be fully in the run rate because it really becomes effective for us July 1. So we are already kind of executing against that. So that'll be fully in the run rate. As we think about the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter, we will -- in the third quarter we will see -- we expect to see a rate cut at the end of July and then in September. And so that -- obviously, assets will start to price down immediately and deposit will -- deposit pricing will kind of come down over time. So I would expect that in the fourth quarter, you're going to continue to see more pressure with respect to net interest margin, and that's just kind of the dynamics of the balance sheet. Matthew O'Connor: Okay just last one to squeeze in. Some banks are also giving guidance that if rates stay kind of stable -- if rates are stable, the NIM ex the liquidity. Is that kind of flat to down just a little bit? Or would you comment on more of a stable rate environment as well? And I'm done. Terrance Dolan : Stable to hear. Yes, I think that -- I mean essentially, again, we think about net interest income being relatively stable relative to where it is in the second quarter, relatively flat. Operator : John Pancari with Evercore. John Pancari : Given your outlook for two cuts before the end of the year, the -- how does that impact your expectation for expense growth at all? Does that impact how you're thinking about expenses? I know you had expected full year expenses to be flat to up 1% or so for the full year '19. And then also, I know you saw a little bit of pressure this quarter on expenses. So curious how that growth expectation has changed. And then separately, about operating leverage as you look for 2020, how are you thinking about that? Terrance Dolan : Yes. So John, again, this is Terry. So when we think about the second half of the year, clearly there's going to be pressure on net interest income, but one of the things I think we're seeing is good momentum on the fee income side of the equation, which I think will help to offset some of that, at least a fair amount of that. So if you think about it, we are seeing acceleration or momentum growing in our payments businesses. The consumer spend issues that were occurring in the early half of the year, they really kind of normalized. You -- we're seeing good momentum with respect to our mortgage banking revenue, and while it was down about 1 percentage point year-over-year this quarter, we would expect that to have hit that inflection point and start to grow in the third quarter. I think that, that will help. We're seeing good momentum, continuing momentum, with respect to trust and investment securities, and I think with the decline in the rate environment, I think you'll see more fund formation, I think in the third quarter with respect to corporate trust. So my point is that when you look across all of our fee categories, we see some pretty nice strength in that. I think that's kind of one of the benefits of our business model. And the diversification that we have on the revenue side of the equation is that fee income tends to help offset some of that pressure on the net interest margin side of the question. Andy? Andrew Cecere : And John, specifically to your question, we'll continue to manage expense reflective of the revenue environment. And we still continue to expect that full year operating leverage in that 1% to 1.5%. The revenues [indiscernible] will be at the lower end of that range. John Pancari : Got it, that's helpful. And if -- just one other follow-up. How would you think about operating leverage for 2020? I'm assuming obviously that's still very much part of it. But again, we could get a tougher backdrop as we go from the top line. So how do you think about what's attainable in 2020? Terrance Dolan : Yes. So our goal, I think, in 2020 continues to be that 100 to 150 basis points. We'll end up having to manage through the rate environment, of course, making decisions short term versus long-term investments that we end up needing to make. But as we think about 2020, we'll continue to have that as our goal that we expect to achieve. Where we might have saw more expansion in a -- based upon what conditions were at the beginning of this year, that may continue to stay more at the lower end of the range. But we'll have to just see how revenues develop. Operator : John McDonald with Autonomous Research. John McDonald : I wanted to follow up on John's question, Terry. For the operating leverage for this year, you came in the first half of the year towards the lower end of the 1%. Just kind of wondering, I think you mentioned some things that get better in the second half, what are the puts and takes towards maybe we're getting to the middle of the range in the second half of the year, maybe closer to the 1.5%? Terrance Dolan : Yes. I think for us -- I mean in the second half of the year -- again, I think just given the revenue environment on the net interest income side of the equation, that, that will be harder to achieve. But again, I think it depends upon how strong the fee income growth is as we go into the second half of the year. And again, we're seeing nice acceleration with respect to our payments and our mortgage banking businesses, et cetera. So that's going to be kind of the wildcard there. Andrew Cecere : And then, John, this is Andy. On the expense side of the equation importantly, we continue to invest in a number of our technology and digital initiatives, while at the same time optimizing the current business structure, and I think that put and take of those 2 things will drive the expense growth to the low side, so that we're managing consistent with the revenue environment. John McDonald : Okay. And then just a follow-up on some of the NII questions, Terry. Is there a way to size how much 125 basis point cut hurts in terms of NII or NIM, everything else equal? Terrance Dolan : Yes. So if you think of -- and again, you can kind of do the math based upon some of our asset liability disclosures, but 25 basis point cut on a short end only probably has a $40 million to $45 million sort of impact to us. So that's kind of how we dimension it. And then the -- if you end up looking at kind of on a shock basis I guess, if you will, that would be $80 million to $90 million of the cost of -- across the curve. John McDonald : Okay. $80 million would be like a parallel? Terrance Dolan : Yes. John McDonald : Okay. And then just for the -- yes, so I guess that's the other point of it, like right now are the current investment yields where the long end is, are current reinvestment yields accretive, dilutive a kind of breakeven-ish? Terrance Dolan : Yes. So our expectation, when we think about the third quarter, is that it certainly has come down in terms of the amount of accretion that you have. We still think there's opportunity for 20 to 25 basis points of accretion on the investment portfolio. I think in the short term though, we're going to see some pressure with respect to premium amortization that may offset that. John McDonald : Okay. Got it. But those securities that you plan to put on in terms of the -- some of the pressure that you mentioned for the next quarter, are those kind of -- are you thinking of those as NII accretive? Terrance Dolan : We're thinking of those as in terms of the liquidity position and the regulatory issue, specifically? John McDonald : Yes. Terrance Dolan : Yes. So we think that, that is -- that's neutral from a net interest income perspective. John McDonald : Got it, got it. And a little bit hurtful to the NIM percent. Terrance Dolan : Yes, it'll hurt NIM, but it'll be neutral with respect to net interest income. Operator : Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : So just to make sure, I understand it's neutral for the coming quarter, but does it flip positive when premium amortization goes away? Terrance Dolan : You mean in terms of the investment portfolio? Betsy Graseck : Yes. Terrance Dolan : Yes. And again, it kind of depends on what ends up happening with respect to yield curve. So if premium amortization starts to neutralize, it would have a little bit of a positive impact. Betsy Graseck : Right. Okay. And then I wanted to just ask a little bit around the mortgage business. Obviously, strong quarter there. Can you give us a sense as to how you're thinking that plays out over the rest of the year? Does this quarter reflect the significant pickup in applications? And when you close, there's only a tail -- little tail left? Or do you feel like this will continue to ramp throughout the rest of the year? Terrance Dolan : Yes. I think it continues to be beneficial through the rest of the year and it -- for a couple of different reasons. Some of the benefit is because of the refinance activity on the -- because of the change in the long end of the curve. But refinancings continue to be only about 30% of our overall volume. So a lot of that volume pickup for us, I think, is driven more by things like the investments we've made in our digital channel, the investments we've made in terms of the retail side of the channel versus the corresponding side of the equation. And the fact that -- because of that investment on the retail side of the equation, we've expected margins to start to improve. So we're going to see the benefit of higher margins because of that mix of business, but also on the purchase side of the equation, volumes have been very strong. So we expect the -- to see a pick up in the second half and start to continue. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then could you talk a little bit about consumer spending? And how that impacted you in the quarter? Andrew Cecere : So Betsy, this is Andy. That's starting to come back. As we talked about late in 2018 into the first quarter of '19, that started to weaken a little bit. But we've seen sequential improvement in each month, and now it's closer to that 5%, 5.5%, 6% range which is still a little bit below early last year, but starting to get back to normal levels. Terrance Dolan : And if you think about our payments base, that 5% and 5.5%, which Andy talked about, but on the merchant side that's closer to about 9%. Andrew Cecere : Merchant acquiring volumes [indiscernible]. Terrance Dolan : Merchant acquiring volumes. And again, I think that is tied to some of the investments that we've been making in the business on the integrated software solutions, et cetera. And then the sales volumes on the corporate payment side of the equation continue to hold up. That's really more kind of in the 6% range, so it's lower than it was a year ago, but it's still quite strong. And those types of things give us some confidence with respect to where the economy is as well. Betsy Graseck : That's interesting. Just linking that to Commercial loan growth, you had a nice pickup Q-on-Q. I know you mentioned that the forward look will have some impact from paydowns, and I guess the question I have here is, have you seen paydowns accelerate at all in 2Q? Terrance Dolan : Yes. I would say that with respect to loan growth in the second quarter, not a lot of acceleration in terms of paydowns. We continue to see it in the Commercial Real Estate side of the equation. And so where we say that there's going to be pressure, I think it's really more in Commercial Real Estate. And I guess based upon where we're at in the economic cycle, I think we're fine with that. And those paydowns will come because of increased capital market, sort of, activity based upon where Commercial Real Estate developers can't refinance their projects. But if you -- when we think about kind of our outlook from a loan standpoint, again, I think consumer spending continues to be strong. GDP is holding up okay, unemployment is just fine. The -- we're seeing good growth in terms of the middle market space and really kind of across most regions in the country. So we just think that there's a lot of signs that would suggest that, that loan growth is going to continue, M&A activity pipeline, et cetera. So we feel fairly confident about where we're at right now. Betsy Graseck : And just one last question for me on the middle-market side in those regions doing better. I'm wondering if you're seeing any particular industries accelerate because as we look at the macro data, we've had some pullback in some of the manufacturing area, trade, ag or transportation, I should say, agriculture. So one of the things that I've been getting from folks is, \"Hey, where's this strength in C&I coming from?\" I don't know if you have any things you can share with us on that. Terrance Dolan : Yes. And again, on the middle-market side of the equation, it -- if you think about just kind of core commercial C&I, our growth was on a linked-quarter basis, 2-plus percent. I think it did -- there was a little bit of an offset or drag because of the agricultural lending that we have. And again, that's just kind of where the farming economy is at this particular point in time. We don't do a lot of land financing, our's is really tied more to farm operations, and the exposure to ag for us is really not that significant. So the -- I think manufacturing continues to hold up reasonably well. It may be a little bit lower than what it's been in the past, but for us, our middle-market business is pretty diversified across many different industries and across our entire footprint. So based upon what we're seeing right now, we would expect that to continue to hold. Operator : Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Thank you so much for the detail on net interest margin sensitivity to rate cuts. I'm wondering if could give us some insight on how you're thinking about deposit repricing in terms of both lag and a magnitude of repricing relative to each 25 basis points? Terrance Dolan : Yes. So again, just to kind of give a reminder. If you think about our deposit base, about half of it is retail and about half of it is corporate and trust. And the retail deposit betas in the movement up was fairly inelastic, so you didn't see a lot of moment with respect to deposit pricing there. But our corporate trust and our wholesale deposits tended to be much more sensitive, as you can imagine. So when you think about a declining rate environment, we believe that deposit betas are going to come down in the corporate trust world reasonably fast as rate cuts are occurring, but you're just not going to see as much with respect to retail. Erika Najarian : Perfectly fair, but the betas in corporate and trust were I think higher than expected. So as I think about full year 2020, it seems like there's an opportunity for actually net interest margin either stability or accretion relative to 4Q '19 even in the face of rate cuts, if we assume rate pricing on just 50% of that book and assuming the curve stays where it is. Is that too optimistic of a conclusion? Terrance Dolan : Yes. I think if you end up looking out to 2020 and you're assuming the rate cuts are occurring, I think that because of our mix of corporate trust and wholesale, that we, on a comparative basis, are going to perform pretty well. So that's going to be more sensitive and deposit price is going to come down more quickly in the [indiscernible]. Andrew Cecere : I think, Terry, what you said was the betas for corporate trust and wholesale will continue to be high if they come down, something like that. Terrance Dolan : Yes. Absolutely, absolutely. Erika Najarian : Got it. And I noticed that comp expenses rose only 2% year-over-year. It's -- it had been trending in the 8% to 9% range annually previously, and I'm wondering if this is really an -- the opportunity that always existed even despite the change in the rate environment. And I'm wondering as we think about those comp levels or the rate of growth of comp, is it between 2% to 8%? I mean how should we think about the slowdown of that pace of growth? Terrance Dolan : Yes. So if you think about compensation of that 8% range, I mean that really was a period of time when we were building our risk and compliance in different areas with respect to investments in the business. So that was unusually high. And as we've said that kind of started to moderate in late 2017, certainly 2018. 2019 I think is kind of -- all of that has normalized. When I think about a 2% to 3% sort of compensation range, we certainly think that we can manage within that level for an extended period of time, and I think that will help us. Some of that compensation obviously, is tied to revenue, for example, in the capital market space or some of the wealth management areas. But -- so it'll be somewhat dependent upon what sort of revenue streams we see on the P side of the equation, but that would be a good thing. Operator : Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Kenneth Usdin : So I'm just going to ask a couple of clean up ones. Can you help us understand the magnitude of the interest recoveries that came through the NIM this quarter relative to last? Terrance Dolan : Yes. I mean, Ken, we always have interest recoveries that are occurring. I think the reason why we want to highlight that a bit is simply because we're at the -- at -- we're at the late end of the business cycle and just given where credit has been for an extended period of time, we just don't know whether or not that will continue. So it's more of just trying to highlight that a little bit because of where we're at in the business cycle. Kenneth Usdin : Okay. So was it above normal? Or -- I mean that you always -- you have the -- was it above normal even? Terrance Dolan : I would say it was kind of normalized, but maybe a little bit high given where we're at in the business cycle. Kenneth Usdin : Got it. Okay. You mentioned in other, you had some elevated -- you've been successfully harvesting some gains, and do you see a lot of opportunities on that front, especially where we are in the equity cycle? Should that continue to also be relatively strong as far as the other income -- other fee income line is concerned? Terrance Dolan : Yes. I mean other income includes a lot of different things. It includes tax indication revenues, it includes some of the transition revenue related to our ATM sales -- leading the sale of our ATM business. And that will continue through 2020, but it'll start to dissipate as we go through that conversion. On the equity investment side of the equation, we still think there's opportunity there. Kenneth Usdin : Okay. And then last one, just as we get hopefully closer to the Feds making some of the rules finalized at some point on the tailoring front, can you just talk through where you're seeing or anticipating to be the potentially business opportunity sets? And can you get ahead of any those at all? Or do you have to wait till they get formalized? Terrance Dolan : Yes. Certainly, from a capital management standpoint, there's going to be benefit because of the AOCI and then on the liquidity side that'll help us as well. We really -- we'll have to wait until -- or we're going to wait until we have clarity with respect to the adoption of that and then, kind of, make decisions, both with respect to capital management and LCR. We've talked about in the past that we think that there's the opportunity to bring down HQLA by that $10 billion to $15 billion range and either redeploy it or think about the investment security portfolio. On a capital management side, we're at 9.5% today. And once we have clarity around CECL and the tailoring rules, we would expect are managing that back down closer to the 8.5% target. Operator : Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Marlin Mosby : Had one big strategic question and a very specific accounting question. We'll start with the accounting side. When you talked about premium amortization, you talked about maybe a headwind, you kind of said well there's some headwind coming. What I was curious about is most of the other calls we've actually heard management's talking about how they had accelerated. So I know you can, from an accounting standpoint, estimate amortization and so when rates move, you get kind of whipsawed around or you can kind of pay as you go. I was just curious in the sense of how you're amortizing that premium. Are you really more kind of a pay as you go or are you estimating what you think the rates are going to do to you? Terrance Dolan : Well, we're certainly taking into consideration what we expect rates to do to premium amortization. I think the -- for us anyway, there is just a little bit of a lag. Most of the -- most significant change is that of occurring very late in June. And so I know the way that we end up accounting for it, it'll end up coming really more so through the third quarter than it was in the second quarter, just the way we end up accounting for it. Marlin Mosby : So it's just a quarter lag more than anything else, and that's it? Terrance Dolan : Yes. And again, that's assuming that the rate curve kind of stays where it is in terms of what the impact's going to be going forward. Marlin Mosby : And that happens in the third quarter and then if rates stay where they're at, that's kind of behind you and you go into the fourth quarter's end with no impact in the since that rates don't change anymore? Terrance Dolan : That's what we're hoping. Marlin Mosby : All right. All right. And then the other thing I was trying to get at was merchant processing. You were talking about growth in the 8% or 9% when revenues are kind of growing in the 4% to 6%. How is the competitive environment for merchant processing? It seems like you've been picking some momentum back up there, but do you feel like you're going to be growing with kind of the same-store sales and maybe a little bit of market share gain? How do you envision that merchant processing as you're looking at the competitive environment right now? Terrance Dolan : Yes. So certainly, the difference between the two is the churn that you have in the book of business. Our growth rate I do think that we'll -- from 4.5% or so will continue to accelerate as that new business comes on board. The other thing is that you have effects of foreign exchange and other things that are dampening that growth rate on the revenue side of the equation. So there's just a number of kind of dynamics. But when you think about the underlying business, we think it's accelerating, and we think it's strong. Andrew Cecere : And I'd add, I think the team has done a terrific job of accelerating our greatest software vendor capabilities as well as our omnichannel capabilities and importantly, integrating with the other banking components so that we have a full set of products and capabilities that we can offer our middle-market and small business customers. So those activities are, I think, also driving the growth in a very positive way. Operator : Antonio Chapa with UBS. Saul Martinez : This is Saul Martinez at UBS. So a couple of questions. First of all, wanted to follow-up on Erika's question on the trajectory of deposit cost and fully get the difference between retail and corporate and trust deposits. But if I bring all of that together, how do we think about just the overall trajectory of your cost of interest-bearing deposits? Because historically, there's typically a sort of a 1- to 2-quarter lag between when cost of deposits start to decline and when the Fed starts to cut. So as we think about 3Q, 4Q, should you see an immediate benefit from, say, a July hike? Or -- I'm sorry, July cut? Or does it take a couple of quarters for that to start to filter in the 1.12% costs start -- interest-bearing cost to deposits starts to come down later in 2019 or 1Q? Or is it -- or should we start to see that all in 3Q? Terrance Dolan : Yes. So let's take corporate trust or the wholesale side of the equation. That'll be fairly quick in terms of the July rate cut. Some of it is the timing of the fact that the July rate cut would probably happen at the end of the month. There's just opportunities for us to be able to incorporate that into our process, but -- so on the corporate trust side of the equation, it'll be pretty quick. But there is always a little bit of a lag in terms of it kind of getting incorporated in the process. So the benefit will be stronger in the fourth quarter certainly than in the third. Saul Martinez : Right. In your guidance -- I mean are we assuming -- are you assuming that the overall cost deposit come in from 2Q levels? Terrance Dolan : Yes. Yes. Saul Martinez : Okay. Right, in 3Q. All right. Change gears a little bit, on your branch strategy. You've highlighted 10% to 15% branch reductions now over, I guess, a couple of years. On the surface, the 3,000 branches, that doesn't seem like a huge number. But it's about 300 to 450 if that's -- if I'm thinking about it right on 3,000 branches. And I think what you've said in the past is your community bank branches, which are like a little over 1,000 and in-store branches, which would take you cumulatively on those 2 to about 2,000, aren't really subject to being rationalized. So effectively, your Metro markets, you're cutting a huge amount of your existing branches in urban markets, if my logic is right. Something like 30% to 45% of your Metro markets. First -- so I guess my question is first, am I thinking about that right? Are the cuts going to be exclusively or almost exclusively in the Metro markets, which are like 1,000 branches? And what's driving this? Because it seems like a pretty substantial repositioning of your branch network? Andrew Cecere : Yes. We have three sort of segments or branches, 1,000 in community, just under 1,000 in-store and outside and just over 1,000 in Metro. What we said is we're not going to exit communities. So we are not going to exit and have no branch standing in the community market we're currently in, but we do have some opportunity in community markets to rationalize or consolidate branches particularly, those that are close together, and that's also true for the in-store. So it is not only focused in Metro. The other thing I mentioned to you is that, that 10% to 15% is a net number. That includes optimization, moving 2 branches to a better location, entering new markets like we've announced in Charlotte, so forth. So that's a net number across all categories. Saul Martinez : Okay. But should we assume that the vast majority of the branch rationalization occurs in Metro markets? Because even if there is some rationalization in community -- the community banking and in-store branches, it seems like -- especially considering that's a net number of branches you'll open in Charlotte, Atlanta, Dallas, whatever. It seems like a pretty big proportion of your existing branch network gets rationalized in urban markets. Terrance Dolan : Yes. No. We're looking at optimization of our branch network. It's really across all 3 categories. We do believe that there's opportunity with respect to all categories. I mean think about community as an example, it includes some sizable markets like at the [indiscernible] or in Omaha, [indiscernible] et cetera, where we do have fairly significant branch networks. So it'll be across all of our -- we will tilt of the Metro markets, but it will include all markets. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. David Long with Raymond James. David Long : You guys have -- I guess this is a follow-up to that last question, but talking about some of the areas where you're looking to add branches and just curious how the rate backdrop plays into how aggressive you are in pursuing that strategy? Andrew Cecere : I don't think the rate backdrop is directly impactful to it. I think what we're trying to do is enter new markets where we already have a large employee base, a customer base that have 1 or 2 or 3 other products that, that U.S. Bank in their wallet, but don't have a full banking relationship and trying to extend that relationship using the data and things that would be valuable to that customer, regardless of the rate environment. Terrance Dolan : Yes. And so it's about building the overall relationship with the customer and then when you think about it, I mean this is really a long-term strategy. So the current rate environment is only one consideration on data point. David Long : Got it. And then second question I had was related to CECL and the impact that may have. Are you guys at a point where you can talk about what the impact may be on your overall reserve levels and also your appetite to make loans into certain categories? Terrance Dolan : Yes. So yes -- and I think what we have talked about in the past is 20% to 40%. And in the third quarter, we'll be kind of going through a more substantive parallel run. And I think we'll have better insights with respect to the implications associated with that particular point in time. What -- we've said it's a range of probably 20% to 40% increase in the reserve, and I think we've even said that's kind of closer to that 30% sort of range, so you can kind of do the math. But we're probably going to wait until we get through that third quarter assessment. The other thing is I think we'll have better visibility with respect to what the economy will look like. And of course, that's certainly a driver in that process. As we've thought about the different products and what we'll emphasize or deemphasize, we're really making decisions more based upon the economics of the product profitability than we are allowing the accounting model to influence, that sort of a decision. So at this particular point in time, we haven't really said we're going to change that approach. Operator : Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Gerard Cassidy : Can you guys give us some color -- obviously, payments is a very important part of your business model. And we've seen that the announcement on Libra and what they're going to try to do, have you guys read the white paper and can you give us your thoughts on what you think? Andrew Cecere : We have read the white paper, and we've had a number of discussions on it. I think it's in the early stages, Gerard, so I don't think there's immediate impact, but we have a number of initiatives going out with our payments. We're trying to understand the impact, but not only that but really optimizing the new real time reals that have been built and are being used -- a number of used cases across the company. The migration of treasury management moving to corporate payments activities and the impact on the consumer side to all the real time activity that's occurring. So it is one component of a more substantial change that's occurring in the environment, which is around payments overall, which is very impactful and very much something we're focused on. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then coming back, over the years, obviously, you guys have been very successful in making depository acquisitions as well as other nondepository acquisitions. Can you give us your view on what you're thinking over the next maybe 12, 24 months on depository transactions as well as nondepository transactions? Are you interested or is that something that could happen if the right opportunities came up? Andrew Cecere : Yes. So as you know, most of our recent transactions have been nondepository. They've been either current portfolio's payments capabilities, trust, things of that sort, technology capabilities. And I think that will continue to be a focus for us. As we talked about, we are working on entering new markets without an acquisition, but in it's concept of a digital-first branch-light strategy. So I think that is a new way to enter a market. It might be more efficiently and effectively without paying a big premium and having attrition that occurs after the back. So if we were looking at anything larger, and we'll look at all opportunities, it would have to be substantial, it would have to be meaningful. And we'd also have to wait that transaction against the great momentum that we have across the company right now across many of the businesses and think about it from a long-term perspective. So we'll consider all those things, but I wouldn't expect us to enter a new market with a small depository acquisition, given our other opportunities to do that. Gerard Cassidy : And speaking of the other opportunities, Andy, can any early redid on that the digital strategy that you guys have launched into these markets or is it too early to tell? Or what are you guys seeing from the early results? Andrew Cecere : It's just starting, Gerard. So we -- in fact, in the next month, we will have the first branch there and we'll -- the others are -- will come after that, so it's too early in the game to tell. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to the presenters for final remarks. Jennifer Thompson : Thank you for listening to our earnings call this morning. Please contact the Investor Relations department if you have any follow-up questions. Operator : This concludes the U.S. Bancorp's Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Following a review of the results by Andy Cecere, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Terry Dolan, U.S. Bancorp\u2019s Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 12 :30 PM Eastern through Wednesday, October 23rd at 12 Midnight Eastern Standard Time. I will now turn the conference over to Jen Thompson, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. You may begin. Jen Thompson : Thank you, Polly and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Andy Cecere and Terry Dolan are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp\u2019s third quarter results and to answer your questions. Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. I\u2019d like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today\u2019s presentation, in our press release, and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Andy. Andy Cecere : Thanks Jen. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry and I will take your questions. I'll begin on Slide 3. In the third quarter, we earned $1.15 per share. Despite a more challenging interest rate environment, we reported record levels of revenue and net income, driven by healthy loan and deposit growth and continued momentum across our key businesses. Credit quality remained stable. Turning to capital management, our book value per share increased 10.6% from a year ago and during the quarter, we returned 80% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Slide 4 provides key performance metrics. In the third quarter, we delivered a return on average common equity of 15.3% and a return on average assets of 1.57%. Our return on tangible common equity was 19.4%. Positive operating leverage drove improvement in our efficiency ratio on both a linked-quarter and a year-over-year basis. Now, I'll turn the call over to Terry, who will provide more detail on the quarter as well as forward-looking guidance. Terry Dolan : Thanks Andy. If you turn to Slide 5, I'll start with the balance sheet review followed by a discussion of third quarter earnings trends. As expected, average loans grew 1.1% on a linked-quarter basis and increased 4.7% year-over-year excluding the fourth quarter 2018 sale of FDIC-covered loans that had reached the end of the loss coverage period. Strong residential mortgage and credit card loan growth supported both linked-quarter and year-over-year performance. Commercial and industrial loans grew 0.4% sequentially and 4.7% on a year-over-year basis. Paydown activity picked up in the third quarter, primarily reflecting the rate environment and robust capital market conditions. New business activity remains healthy, although paydown activity is likely to continue at elevated levels near term. Commercial Real Estate loans decreased on a sequential and a year-over-year basis. This quarter, Commercial Real Estate contributed a 33-basis-point drag to linked-quarter average loan growth and an 89-basis-point drag to year-over-year average loan growth. Turning to slide 6, deposits increased 1.4% on a linked-quarter basis and grew 6.0% year-over-year. Compared with the prior period, we continued to see migration from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing accounts. That migration along with deposit growth momentum in both our Wealth Management and Corporate and Commercial Banking divisions, helped drive average savings deposits up 8.4% year-over-year. As you can see on slide 7, credit quality remained stable. On dollar basis, non-performing assets increased 2.7% versus the second quarter, but decreased by 2.5% compared with a year ago. The ratio of non-performing assets to loans plus other real estate owned was stable at 33 basis points compared with the second quarter and modestly improved versus 36 basis points a year-ago. Slide 8 highlights third quarter earnings results. We reported earnings per share of $1.15 compared with $1.06 a year ago. Turning to slide 9, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis declined by 0.5% compared with the second quarter and increased by 0.8% year-over-year, which is in line with our expectations. Both linked quarter and year-over-year comparisons benefited from healthy loan growth, offset by the impact of declining rates and a flatter yield curve. Our net interest margin declined by 11 basis points versus the second quarter, in line with our expectations. About 4 basis points of the decline was due to higher cash balances, primarily reflecting changes in policies related to deposits by the European Central Bank. Slide 10 highlights trends in non-interest income. Middle-single-digit year-over-year growth in each of the three payment fee lines, credit and debit card, corporate payments products, and merchant processing was driven by higher sales volumes. As a reminder, processing day account will end up affecting year-over-year credit and debit card revenue growth comparisons in several quarters in 2019. In the third quarter, three additional processing days versus a year ago benefited revenue growth. In the fourth quarter, two fewer days will be a drag on year-over-year growth. We continue to expect low-single-digit growth of credit and debit card fee revenue for the full year. Commercial product revenue increased 11.1% from a year ago, primarily due to higher corporate bond fees and trading revenue related to strong capital markets activity. Mortgage banking revenue increased 56.3% year-over-year on strong origination and sales revenue growth. Compared with the third quarter of 2018, mortgage production volume increased by 40.3%, and mortgage application volume increased by 53.1%. Refinancing activity represented about 40% of production in the third quarter of 2019 compared to about 30% in the linked-quarter. Refinancing represented 51% of applications in the third quarter. The year-over-year decline in deposit service charges reflected the impact of the sale of our third-party ATM servicing business in the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase in other revenue was partly driven by the inclusion of the related transition services revenue, which will decrease over time, as well as higher equity investment income and a gain on sale of assets. Turning to slide 11, the year-over-year increase in non-interest expense reflected higher personnel cost, partly due to higher variable compensation related to business production within mortgage banking and the capital markets business lines as well as increased medical costs. Professional services expense increased primarily due to business investments and enhancement in risk management programs, while higher technology expense growth was primarily tied to business growth initiatives. A decrease in other expense primarily reflected lower costs related to tax-advantaged projects and lower FDIC assessment cost. Slide 12 highlights our capital position. At September 30, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach was 9.6%, and this compares to our target of 8.5%. As previously discussed, our goal has been to manage the capital level closer to our target once we had clarity related to adopting CECL and the final capital rules were promulgated by the Federal Reserve. With the recent release of the final rules, we plan to make a request to the Federal Reserve to increase our share repurchase program to enable us to begin reducing our common equity Tier 1 ratio from 9.0 -- 9.6% to approximately 9.0%. I'll now provide some forward looking guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect fully taxable equivalent net interest income to decline in the low-single digits on a year-over-year basis. We expect middle \u2013 mid-single-digit fee income growth on a core basis year-over-year. We expect to deliver positive operating leverage for the full year 2019 on a core basis in line with our previous guidance. We continue to expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately 20% on a full year basis. Credit quality in the fourth quarter is expected to remain stable compared to the third quarter, loan loss provision expense growth will continue to be reflective of loan growth. I'll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks. Andy Cecere : Thanks Terry. The record results and industry-leading returns that we delivered in the third quarter, despite a more challenging interest rate environment is a testament to our well-balanced business model, our numerous competitive advantages and our risk management discipline. As we head in the final quarter of 2019, we feel good about our loan and deposit trends and our ability to continue to gain market share across our franchise. As indicated on slide 13, we are seeing good digital update trends. As loans are increasingly sourced through our digital channels, we expect better customer experience, higher account and volume growth and improved operational efficiency. Our core fee businesses are performing well. Investments made over the past few years in our payments and mortgage business lines are delivering anticipated results in the form of improving sales and volume growth. Our scale and differentiated service model is helping us win new business and expand existing relationships in our trust and Investment Services business which is driving strong asset under management and fee growth. Importantly, we are deepening relationships across our entire franchise, as we bring the power of one U.S. Bank to each of our business customers and consumers. Credit quality remains stable and we are not seeing any early indicators in our portfolio that causes concern. However, we are mindful that at some point industry will experience a credit downturn and we remain disciplined in terms of our origination quality and our long-term strategy of remaining within our defined credit box -- regardless of the competitive environment. In closing, I'd like to reiterate the message I delivered at a recent Investor Day. We are in a position of strength and will continue to leverage the core competencies and competitive advantage that carry us to where we are today. However, the world is changing rapidly and we are adjusting -- investing for the future, so that we can continue to deliver the industry-leading growth and return to our shareholders that come to expect from us. I'd like to thank our employees for their hard work and commitment they bring to the job every day. We will now open up the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Matt. Jen Thompson : Polly, we're not hearing. We're not hearing, Matt. Operator : Matt, your line is open. Jen Thompson : We can go to the next caller and maybe Matt can dial in again. Operator : Okay. And your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. John McDonald : Hi. Good morning. Terry Dolan : Good morning, John. John McDonald : I was wondering -- Hi, Terry. I was wondering if you could just give a little more color on the request for the capital increase, just over what timeframe you might be looking to do the 9.6% down to 9%? Is that over the course of a year or a couple of months or? And, again, what gave you the -- what was the clarity you're looking for, was it CECL and tailoring, I think, you mentioned? Terry Dolan : Yes. Well, with respect to the second part, I think, that we've now been through parallel run for a couple of different quarters, and the outlook from an economic standpoint is still relatively solid, and so I think we feel comfortable that we have a good range, and it's consistent with what we talked about at Investor Day. And then, obviously, the final rule coming out is helpful. From a timing standpoint, it won't be accelerated. I think it will be bringing that 9.6% down to 9.0% really during the 2019 CCAR cycle, so by the end of the second quarter. John McDonald : Okay. Got it. So, it is for this cycle to do it by the second quarter of next year. Terry Dolan : Yes. Yes. John McDonald : Okay. Got it. And then, I wanted to ask you guys just more broadly about your outlook, just in terms of kind of generating positive operating leverage in what's proving to be a difficult -- more difficult rate environment. As you turn the corner into 2020, is that a goal? And is that 100 basis points kind of a bogey still? And Terry you had mentioned at Investor Day that 2020 was a tougher year when you're talking about your three-year targets. Terry Dolan : Yes. John McDonald : And maybe also, Terry, you could just kind of clarify, I think, at Investor Day you said part of that outlook is --you thought your net interest income might grow faster than your fees and maybe if you could give a little follow-up color on that? Terry Dolan : Yes. So a lot of different questions there. Certainly, in terms of positive operating leverage, it's a balancing act between certain long-term and we always kind of take that into consideration. 2020, as I said at Investor Day, I think, it is going to be a challenging year, because of where interest rates are today versus where they were a year ago. I mean, the long end of the curve, 10 years, is I think down 150 -- almost 150 basis points from where it was last year. So, the landscape certainly has changed relative to when that guidance came out. When we -- right now, I think our outlook, with respect to positive operating leverage, is to achieve that in 2019 on a quarter basis, and as we kind of think about different initiatives, the certain things that we will take into consideration is the fact that our -- we continue to transform from a digital perspective. Derek talked about kind of a do-it-yourself sort of, a focus, so I think, you know, we're going to end up looking to add a lot of different things that we can do in order to try to manage expenses as prudently as we can. But you know, I think part of it is just what happens with interest rates, I mean, as it\u2019s volatile right now, it's hard to really know and having an outlook that's much beyond a quarter is pretty tough. Coming back to net interest income versus fees that guidance, right, those comments are really focused around what we think between now and three years out where that growth is going to come from, and I think part of that is an assumption that once we get beyond 2020, the interest rate environment starts to normalize and either stabilizes or starts to come up, and so I think that's part of the thought process between where that mix is going to come from. Andy Cecere : And I\u2019d just reiterate John that the theme that we talked about at Investor Day \u2013 talked about at Investor Day continues to hold which is delivering in the short-term while investing for the long-term. So we're going to manage short-term performance, understanding the rate environment on in the economic environment, but deliver on what we talked about in terms of positive operating leverage but at the same time investing for the long-term growth that we're seeking. John McDonald : Got it. Thank you. Andy Cecere : Sure, John. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hey, good morning. Hi. One follow-up there on the tailoring rule. There's also a benefit I think to the LCR and how your \u2013 reports calculate that and carry cash around that? And I'm wondering, does that have any impact on how you think about either the portfolio that you're holding or your ability to be more competitive for, you know, loans because you can value non-operating deposits or any other benefit from that that maybe we could get a loan under the hood on? Andy Cecere : Yes, so with the rules related to the LCR coming out, you know, all it was essentially kind of reducing it to an 80% to 85% level. And as we\u2019ve talked, it really helps free up our liquidity probably in the range of $11 billion to $15 billion kind of in that ballpark. And, you know, we're still formulating kind of what our game plan is, but \u2013 I think that we'll look at kind of remixing the investment portfolio in order to be able to both extend duration and possibly enhance the yield a little bit. We may look at reducing our debt level in the wholesale markets, and I think that \u2013 a number of those different actions would be beneficial to the company, and it's going to be basis points, it's not going to be a major change I think in terms of net interest income just based upon kind of where the yield curve is, et cetera, but we're looking at all sorts of things. Betsy Graseck : Right. And I get that. Every little bit helps so. Andy Cecere : Yes. It does. Betsy Graseck : And does it impact all the competitiveness with regard to commercial lending or not really? Andy Cecere : I don't think so. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Andy Cecere : I mean we end up driving from a competitive standpoint based upon what the pricing is in the marketplace. And I just don't see it impacting that a lot. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Terry Dolan : And given our debt rating and our low cost of funds we're already in a pretty good position regarding our loan pricing. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay. And then any just separately at Investor Day, really interesting kind of sidebar tech showcase that you had and I want to just understand how you're thinking about the offering that you've got for merchant acquiring Merchant Services? And understand where you think there's more that you can do there to expand your offering either to other verticals take what you've got and your restaurant hospitality, et cetera to other verticals? Or if there is more that you can do with adjacencies on some of the things that you've been adding to over the past year or so? Terry Dolan : Yes, I think it's a three-pronged strategy. One is, continued focus on e-commerce and ISVs which we made good progress in over the last year, we'll continue to focus on it going forward. Secondly is the focus on certain verticals. You may have a couple of airlines, hotels, industry, and healthcare. And thirdly and importantly and probably the biggest opportunity is just combination of banking, products and services together with merchant products and services. The fact is all of our merchants need a bank, many of our small business customers need a merchant provider, and our ability to weave and put those products together in a comprehensive set that helps the customers run their business and give them information I think is the key to our focus and one of the areas I think where we see the most potential. Betsy Graseck : And is it primarily U.S. or is it also Europe? I know you have a more global footprint in this business. Terry Dolan : Yes, so the first two would be global across the board, that combination of banking and merchant processing would be principally in the U.S. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks. Terry Dolan : You bet. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Terry Dolan : Good morning, Ken. Andy Cecere : Hey Ken. Ken Usdin : Hey good morning guys. How are you doing? Just a couple of fee follow-ups, obviously, mortgage banking was very strong and I'm sure built into your outlook for the fourth quarter growth, but can you just talk about how much more pipeline you expect to pull through on the mortgage side and what you're just seeing in terms of the gain on sale outlook and the loan officer side of the equation there? Terry Dolan : Yes, so if you think about mortgage banking, I mean obviously, there was a very strong quarter from refinancing. When we end up thinking about the fourth quarter, it's very dependent upon where long-term rates are. With the rates kind of acting or coming up a little bit most recently, it probably will not be as strong. But I think it will still be a good year-over-year story from a mortgage banking perspective. The application volume is a little strong in production. It was strong in the third quarter. We continue to see that momentum. The other thing Ken is we talked about this; we've been over time making good investment in mortgage loan officers on the retail side of the equation, enhancing that. The digital platform that we talked about has a very high percentage of application capture and that just helps -- and it helps because those fee to market and our ability to be able to service those customers and get the loans booked. We went through the last what I would say cycle of refinancing and our processing times were relatively short compared to competitors and certainly what we have experienced in the past and it's all because of those investments. Ken Usdin : Got it. And a second question, I know this comes up from time-to-time, but inside the other, you always mentioned that the PE gains are there. We know that the ATM agreement is in there as well. Can you help us just understand the magnitude of the PE gains even on a comparison basis if not the number? And then also just the ATM services -- how much is that in revenues and expenses today and how does that work going forward? Thanks Terry. Terry Dolan : Yes. So, in terms of other revenue, it is a lumpy category. It ends up going up and down depending upon what's happening within the various categories. It includes a lot of different things and equity investment is just one piece of it. But if we end up looking at the overall increase on a year-over-year basis, I would break it down kind of like this about half of it is related to the transitional services revenue and about 25% of it's related to equity investment and then it's kind of combination of a lot of other things that are kind of driving that. So, when we think about it, because I know this question is out there when we think about other revenue, we talked a little bit about this. Over the course of last eight quarters, it has ranged anywhere on a quarterly basis from $160 million to as high as $300 million and when we end up looking at what is a core reasonable level that $200 million range is in that ballpark give or take. It'll be up a little bit some quarters and down a little bit in other quarters. And that's how we think about it. Ken Usdin : And then could you just -- on the expense side of the ATM, is that a decent part of the growth on the expense side as well the services agreement? Terry Dolan : Yeah, it is. That service agreement was really negotiated in order to be able to cover the cost and so the cost level associated with making that transition service agreements is fairly similar to the revenue that we\u2019re generating. And from a timing standpoint that will start to go away as conversions are taking place between now and the end of 2020. Ken Usdin : Got it. Thank you. Terry Dolan : Yeah. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Ken. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Andy Cecere : Hey, Mike. Mike Mayo : Hi. I know we just had your Investor Day, you are talking about positive operating leverage, driven by the digital transformation, so I guess I have a front office and a back-office question. The front office question, I guess you closed what like 150 branches in the last year, but it's still a decent deposit growth, so how much growth are you getting through digital channels, or some sort of metric that you can give us? And then the harder question, the back-office, I mean, you're retooling the inside of the company. Can you give us any metrics when, like data centers, the peak where you are now where you expect them to go, or what percent of your applications you expect to migrate to the public cloud or anything else about the internal retooling too? Andy Cecere : Mike I'll start and then Terry can add on. So from a sales perspective as we think about the digital initiatives, the revamping of our app and the focus on the digital capabilities it's focused on a couple of areas, one is insights and improving the ability to connect with the customers. But secondly, it's also the ability to improve sales activity and you see some of our loan stats in the deck that we provide as part of the earnings call. Well, I tell you that both loan activity from a sales perspective as well as deposit activity is growing quite rapidly and we will see a continued movement of more sales activity, transactions is already high as you know digitally, but more sales activity to digital channels I think over time, which will allow for our continued opportunities on the expense side of the equation, and if you think about the backroom. Terry Dolan : Yeah. So, I mean, was it in the back room or even was in the branches is a big part of the decision around closures related to branches and reinvestment in branches as well is really kind of the intersection of our employees, our people to digital and our customers, obviously, the customer behaviors are changing. The amount of transaction activity that's happening in the branch is significantly less than where it was and in fact 80% of it roughly \u2013 70%, 80% of it goes through the digital channel today. So, that gives us the opportunity to really reconfigure the branch network both in terms of size and numbers et cetera. And -- but also to changed the focus from a service oriented type of location to something that's much more either sales and/or advice focus. And so I think, those trends are going to continue, I don't necessarily have specific metrics. On the deposit side, I would say that there are still room and opportunity for the percentage of sales from the deposit perspective to continue to grow. And I think, Derek at Investor Day had said, you know when you think about the opportunity from a digital perspective from sales and -- we would include deposits in this is that, you know that should get us closer to that 40%, 50% overtime. It'll take a while for us to get there because of the customer adoption that has to take place. Q \u2013 Mike Mayo : Okay. And then, as far as the back-office, do you give any metrics on number of data centres? Or how many apps you expect to migrate to the public cloud or anything else just on the inside of the company? Andy Cecere : We haven't disclosed a number of data centres. But I will tell you Mike, as we continue to migrate activity to the cloud and Jeff -- Jeff Von Gillern spoke a little bit about that at Investor Day, but most of our new activity in development will occur in the cloud which offers number of our advantages both in the capacity as well as cost development. Q \u2013 Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Mike. Operator : And your next question comes from Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Scott. Q \u2013 Scott Seifers : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just Terry, may be some updated thoughts on the margin, given that the noise from some of the transitory stuff in the third quarter, should presumably be settling in the fourth quarter? I guess; one, when -- and apologies if you said this, when do you have any additional rate cuts baked into your own outlook there? And then, just as we go forward, we still thinking kind of $40 million to $45 million sort of all up will some impact from these rate cut? A \u2013 Terry Dolan : Yeah. Well, let me kind of talk a little bit about kind of our guidance. And hopefully these will kind of get to some of your points. So our guidance with respect to low-single digits is really kind of looking at the implied market where rates in terms of where they're at in the first couple of weeks of October. And kind of implied in that is an assumption that you know rates are going to decline and our assumption is that, it will be in 25 basis point cut in both October and in December. And I think there is still question as to December occurs. The long end of the curve, we are assuming that it's roughly kind of where it is right now. So, that's kind of the assumptions that we're baking into kind of our perspective regarding margin or net interest income. From a margin perspective, it's down about 11 basis points on a linked-quarter. There's about 4 basis points that's really related to those cash balances supporting the balances. And so, when we think about the fourth quarter, we would expect our net interest margin to decline, but kind of in the range of that core level which is 7 to 8 basis points. Q \u2013 Scott Seifers : Okay. So 7 to 8 basis points of margin decline in the fourth quarter? A \u2013 Terry Dolan : In the fourth quarter. Yeah, I think, the other thing is that, it's just kind of interesting, if you think about third quarter, third quarter from an average perspective, short-term rates are actually up about 29 basis points, 30 basis points, although the long end was down about 100 -- a little over 100. In the fourth quarter, that would be the first quarter on a year-over-year basis, when the short end is down, kind of in the range of that 40 to 50 basis points and the long end is down 150 basis points. So in the industry, that's why people are looking at. And we would expect fourth quarter to become more challenging as it will go into the quarter end and into 2020. Q \u2013 Scott Seifers : Okay. And then, so with that, just so I understand with that 7 to 8 basis points presumably that kind of moderates as we would look at additional rate cuts or is that, that sort of a new, new price that is I want to make sure, I'm sort of understanding that? A \u2013 Terry Dolan : Yeah. I mean, I would say that given the fact that, that it's so volatile right now and we don't really know where rates are going take a look out beyond the fourth quarter. Q \u2013 Scott Seifers : Okay. Fair enough. All right, thank you very much. I appreciate it. A \u2013 Terry Dolan : Thanks, Scott. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Q \u2013 Erika Najarian : Hi. Good morning. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Erika. Q \u2013 Erika Najarian : I wanted to follow-up on John's line of questioning, so even outside of mortgage the fee income trends are quite strong. Payments up 5% year-over-year, trust and investment management up 2% year-over-year, and I'm wondering, as we tie that back to your long-term revenue targets, is a 5% fee income clip over that three-year period, too optimistic or about in line with what you're thinking? I guess, the reason I'm focusing on fees is because, like you said Terry, nobody has any idea on what the curve -- forward curve is going to look like, right? I mean, the probability of October changed over the past two hours. So I'm trying to think about the contribution of fees. And I have a follow-up on balance sheet growth. Terry Dolan : Yes. Well, maybe, just kind of, again, this kind of ties a little bit to Investor Day and some of the guidance associated with that. The outlook for fee income, in part, will depend upon what happens with rates. I mean, the puts and takes with respect to mortgage banking and so all kind of a function in terms of what happens from a rate perspective. But, I think, we\u2019re confident when we think about the investments that we've been making both in the payment space of business and our corporate trust and some of the digital capabilities, our capital markets business, all of those, we feel like we have a position of strength at this particular point in time and that momentum will continue to carry. I mean, there will be puts and takes. It kind of depends upon what happens in the environment. Consumer spend continues to be strong. We don't see anything in the short-term, but where that ends up turning, I wouldn\u2019t get into 2020, is anybody's game. Q \u2013 Erika Najarian : And on the balance sheet growth contribution to those long-term revenue targets, fully acknowledge the 2020 is going to be challenging. If the rate curve doesn't normalize as you think, but doesn't necessarily get worse than what's in the current expectation. Is there enough opportunity in terms of delivering all of the bank into your current customers, with regards to loan growth. In other words, that implies to me that we would need mid single-digit loan growth over that three-year period in order to potentially mitigate some of the net interest margin volatility, or lack of help from the yield curve rather. Terry Dolan : Yeah, maybe a couple of things. The target that we set are kind of based upon where we think the growth rates are going to be as we get into the second and third-year. I tried to be clear that that's not our expectation with respect to 2020 and it's not necessarily a compounded rate over the three years because of the challenges that will happen in 2020. But when you end up -- when we think about the balance sheet right now. And again, this all kind of depend upon what happens in the economy and that's a little bit hard to predict, but consumers spend and consumer confidence continues to be strong, I think business activity continues to be strong, I think it's moderated somewhat because of tariff policy and that sort of thing or trade policy, but generally, I think the economy is solid. And when we end up thinking about 2020 from a loan growth perspective, we think that some of the trends that we're seeing this year will continue. And as we talked, third quarter loan growth of about 4.7% on a core basis, we think that's achievable. And I think from the U.S. bank's perspective, we have the lowest cost of funds in the industry and we have some competitive advantages from a pricing perspective that will enable us to be able to achieve those type of things. So I feel reasonably confident. Andy Cecere : Yeah. And, Erika, if you think -- if you step back and look at the third quarter, our earning asset growth was just under 5%. Our deposit growth year-over-year was just about 6%. So thinking about the balance sheet growing in that mid-single-digit, I think it\u2019s about right. Terry Dolan : Yeah. Erika Najarian : Got it. Great. Thank you. Terry Dolan : Yeah. Andy Cecere : Sure. Operator : And your next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Vivek. Terry Dolan : Hey, Vivek. Vivek Juneja : Good morning. Hi. Sorry, we've been jumping on multiple calls. I'm apologizing, if I'm making you repeat something. The other income, did you give any sort of way to think about what's the sort of run rate that seems reasonable? Terry Dolan : Yeah. We did talk a little bit about that, and maybe just to reiterate, we end up looking at the back and when we think about it, we end up looking at that level on a quarterly basis, it's gone anywhere from $160 million to $300 million. And as a function of the lumpiness that exists across a lot of different categories of income within that, including equity investments, et cetera. But if I were to \u2013 when we think about kind of that core level on a quarterly basis, $200 million, plus or minus is kind of the where we believe that is a reasonable kind of range. And if you remember in the past I had said, somewhere between $175 million and $225 million, and that's kind of in that ballpark. So, when you end up looking at the year-over-year for the third quarter, but half of that growth is related to the transition servicing agreement that's tied to the ATM business, and so that goes away over time during 2020 tied to when those conversions occur. Andy Cecere : Together with the expense. Terry Dolan : Together with the expense. And the expense is pretty similar to the increase related to the transitions service agreement from a revenue point of view. Vivek Juneja : And then, another one which is positive operating leverage. Your previous guidance you used to have the 100 to 150, which went to 100. Are you thinking full year 2019 given everything going on you've obviously got positives on mortgage banking, other income running higher, but then NII softer? Is it still closer to 100 basis points or do you think given where rates have gone it's \u2013 that's going to be harder to get to? Andy Cecere : We're consistent with what we talked about Investor Day, Vivek, which is somewhat below 100 basis points, but still positive operating leverage. Vivek Juneja : Okay, great. Thank you. Andy Cecere : Thank you. Yes. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Terry Dolan : Hey, Matt. Andy Cecere : Welcome back, Matt. Matt O'Connor: Hi. Thanks. Sorry about that before. Just stepping back kind of a bigger picture this whole operating leverage question. You've got the best revenue growth year-to-date I think of the big banks about 4%. It seems like the expense growth is also the highest. And I guess I am just conceptually wondering like is that the cost of doing business like to get that much revenue growth, that's the expense growth that you need or is there still some catching up in terms of infrastructure or something you are working on a few years ago? Or is there something trying to get ahead of kind of to help drive revenue growth in the future. And obviously, I'm not looking for specific numbers, but just conceptually, some people would look at you and say, okay the revenue growth is really good but the expense growth was a bit higher, and it might just cost that much to generate that much revenue growth. So maybe you could just comment on something like that. Andy Cecere : So I will start it Matt and Terry will add on. So first from a big picture standpoint, three big puts and takes. Number one is we're going to continue to optimize the number of initiatives from an operation standpoint, the way we\u2019re delivering products and services. The way we are operating in the back room and all those things will allow for some saves because that's a positive. Secondly, we are going to continue to invest with the long-term. In the digital initiatives we talked about Investor Day, so that's going to cost bit more, a lot of that\u2019s already in the run rate. If you look at the third quarter specifically though, there were a couple of areas of revenue growth, specifically mortgage and capital markets that have expenses related to missions associated with them and that was one of the reasons for a little higher expense growth. Terry Dolan : Yes. I think I would just kind of maybe add to that because -- we see that in mortgage and we see that in capital markets specifically, but from an optimization standpoint, we talked about this Investor Day -- very focused on how the customer behaviors are changing making sure that we are staying lockstep with that and I think there is both opportunities in front office from a branch perspective and will continue to look at that and as I said, we may accelerate or increase you know some of the activity associated with that, but it's going to be tight what happens from a customer standpoint. And then you know as we continue to move to a digital platform I think there is back-office opportunities in terms of optimization. And then the other thing in this kind of gets back to the digital activities that Andy was talking about, we're making important investments in all of our lines of businesses and we want to and will continue to do that because it's important for us to look both short-term as well long-term so. Matt O'Connor: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I just -- I think sometimes we're also focused on the absolute level of operating leverage and the fact of matter is 80 bps of operating leverage with 4% revenue growth is a lot better than 1% plus operating leverage with 1% revenue growth just the way the math works so. Okay. That\u2019s right. Thank you. Terry Dolan : Yeah. No, that\u2019s right. And -- that 0.8 positive operating leverage on 54 -- efficiency ratio 54 is a lot different than 1% on 62. So, -- it's all of those things, part of it as the starting point. Andy Cecere : Thanks Matt. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Saul Martinez : Hey, good morning, guys. So, you guys addressed -- a lot of my questions. I was going to ask you to speak to some of the loan growth trends which are pretty pronounced not only in terms of the absolute level balance sheet growth, but just a mix with commercial on an end-of-period basis commercial going 3% and consumer 7% even with home equity declining for the core even faster than that. So, I guess a couple of parts though -- maybe you can adjust how much of that growth is related to exogenous factors? Or is dependent on a strong macro environment continuing how much of growth is a function of things you're doing at the company level to deepen relationships used analytics and whatnot? And I guess the second part of my question though is around CCEL and whether -- do you guys even -- to you guys consider the impact of CCEL when addressing this growth because a lot of the growth is occurring in lending segments that are going to be disproportionally impacted by CCEL in longer term -- longer weighted average lives in higher loss content like cards. And you I think yourself Terry mentioned at Investor Day that you will have higher ALLL -- to maintain that ALLL ratio, you have to provision more, but with this mix shift that ALLL ratio will continue to migrate upwards and is that something you guys think about or do you guys just say that hey that's accounting noise in the economics of this lending activity is the same, it doesn't really matter and over the life of the loan, the loss is the loss. So, just kind of whether -- the CCEL impact on your growth is something you guys think about and how we should think about in terms of modeling it? Andy Cecere : Good question. And like -- we kind of talk a little bit about this in the past, when we think about loan growth and where it comes from and kind of our focus within the company. You already think about it more on an economic basis than we do on the accounting. But I do think there's a lot of accounting noise that occurs within CCEL for a lot of different reasons. One is that every company is going to have their own forecasts with respect to what happens in the economy and all the things that we talked about. So, we really think about it more from an economic standpoint. In terms of loan growth, again just comes back in terms of what we're seeing today and what we see today is that consumer happen to be strong and consumer spend is strong and those things should tend for good growth from a consumer perspective. Even on the business side that while it may moderate, it's still a very solid business. So some of it is driven by macroeconomic, other especially as we kind of think out on a longer-term basis is driven by initiatives. We started ABS lending sort of platform a year ago, but this focus and Andy talked about it, we have merchants and the merchant side of the equation and small businesses and there is a significant opportunity for us to build leverage both. So when you think about loan growth, we also begin to tighten some of our initiatives. Saul Martinez : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much. Terry Dolan : Thanks. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Terry Dolan : Good morning, Gerard. Andy Cecere : Hey, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning guys. You guys have been very good at sharing with us the competition in Commercial Real Estate lending and what's going on in different loan markets. We hear from many of the smaller commercial banks that they're building out there treasury management products. Are you guys seeing any increased competition in that part of the commercial customer base that you deal with that gives us products? Terry Dolan : Gerard, I would say it's not any different than we've seen historically. I would say probably the change is occurring to treasury management. You continue to see it going forward is the migration and the use case is really the real-time payments that have been developed and the new products and services as a result of that. So, I think that is going to continue to be a change and as you think about our capabilities in treasury management combined with our corporate payments, I think you're going to continue to see those things coming together and changing with this new rails that have been developed. Gerard Cassidy : And do you think -- speaking on that Andy, do you think Zelle will play a role on that and a go forward basis as Zelle goes from a P2P to possibly a B2B? Andy Cecere : Well, Zelle, we\u2019ll start to use those new rails as a component of their mechanism, for sure that\u2019s one. Number two, is I think Zelle has a lot of opportunity for growth in different aspects and there are also used cases, request for payment and other things there in the Zelle side. So you\u2019re going to see changes on the business to business side related to the real-time rails. You\u2019re going to see continued migration and changes and enhancement on the consumer side related to Zelle and at some point, some of those things particularly small business may come together a little bit. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Terry Dolan : Yeah, and the other thing Gerard, I would just say is that, I think the challenge or the competitive landscape is going to be one based upon who is able to make the investments in connecting the rail -- real-time rail or Zelle or where we made the case to the customer. And that's where our area of focus has really been around the used case is that creates a value proposition to the customer and that investment is very important, it\u2019s an area of focus for us. Andy Cecere : That's absolutely right. Thank you. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. And then to pivot, you guys have been very conservative in your construction lending; the portfolio is about $10.7 billion down, just under 5% on a year-over-year basis, but there seems to be recently a resurgence in housing, today the National Association of Home Builders there market index rose bidding and consensus and there seems to be recently some pickup in activity here. Are you guys seeing that in any of your markers and are there opportunities for you to capture some of that growth? A \u2013 Terry Dolan : Gerard, we have a housing capital group that does focus on home builders and we are seeing good growth there -- there West Coast and South principally is where our focus area is, and that -- that business is doing well on growing. Some of the other aspects of Commercial Real Estate and some of the declines you're seeing are really a function of some of the credit components that we're seeing our competitors move to that we're not comfortable with. So yes, some positives, but we have some negatives and we're sticking with our core customers and within the credit box that we participate in. Q \u2013 Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. A \u2013 Terry Dolan : Thank you. All right. Operator : And there are no further audio questions. Are there any closing remarks? Jen Thompson : Yes. Thank you for listening to our earnings call and please call the Investor Relations Department if you have any follow-up questions. That concludes our call. Operator : And thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Following a review of the results by Andy Cecere, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Terry Dolan, U.S. Bancorp\u2019s Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question and answer session. If you\u2019d like to ask a question, please press star, one on your touchtone phone, and press the pound key to withdraw. This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 12 :00 pm Eastern through Wednesday, January 22 at 12 :00 midnight Eastern. I will now turn the conference over to Jen Thompson, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. Jennifer Thompson : Thank you James, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Andy Cecere and Terry Dolan are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp\u2019s fourth quarter results and to answer your questions. Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today\u2019s call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today\u2019s presentation, in our press release, and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Andy. Andy Cecere : Thanks Jen, and good morning everyone, and thank you for joining in our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry and I will take your questions. I\u2019ll begin on Slide 3. We reported earnings per share of $0.90, which included $0.18 per share of notable items which Terry will discuss in more detail in a few moments. Excluding these notable items, we reported earnings per share of $1.08 for the quarter.  Loan growth was driven by new client wins and deepening relationships across all our loan portfolios, and we delivered very strong deposit growth. We continue to see strong account and volume growth across our fee businesses. Credit quality was stable and our book value per share increased 6.7% from a year ago.  In November, we received approval from the Fed Reserve for an incremental share repurchase plan authorizing the purchase of up to $2.5 million of common stock in addition to our existing authorization of $3 billion. In the fourth quarter, we returned $2.9 billion of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. As indicated on Slide 4, digital uptake trends remain strong. We are significantly wrapping up the launch of our DIY digital experiences that will continue to drive more and more customer interactions both on and off the mobile app, as well as higher digital transaction volume.  Slide 5 provides key performance metrics. On a core basis, we delivered an 18.1% return on tangible common equity in the fourth quarter. For the full year, our core return on tangible common equity was 18.8%.  Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Terry to provide detail on the quarter as well as forward-looking guidance. Terry Dolan : Thanks Andy. If you turn to Slide 6, I\u2019ll start with a balance sheet review followed by a discussion of fourth quarter earnings trends. Average loans grew 0.8% on a linked quarter basis and increased 3.9% year-over-year. Linked quarter growth was driven by strength in residential mortgages, commercial real estate, and credit card loans. The C&I pay down activity muted overall growth in the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting the rate environment and robust capital markets conditions. New commercial business activity is healthy; however, pay down activity is likely to continue to be a headwind near term, albeit a diminishing headwind assuming that the interest rate environment is stable. Turning to Slide 7, deposits increased 1.9% on a linked quarter basis and grew 6.6% year over year. Notably, average savings deposits grew by 11.1% driven by across-the-board growth in wealth management investment services, consumer banking, and commercial banking. Turning to Slide 8, credit quality was stable in the fourth quarter. On a dollar basis, non-performing assets declined approximately 15% on both a linked quarter and a year-over-year basis. The ratio of non-performing assets to loans plus other real estate owned also improved linked quarter and year-over-year. The new accounting standard related to credit losses, commonly known as CECL, became effective January 1 and has no impact on our 2019 results. We estimate that the adoption of CECL will result in a $1.5 billion cumulative effect adjustment to our allowance for loan losses compared with December 31, 2019, which is in line with our previous guidance. Slide 9 highlights fourth quarter earnings results. We reported earnings per share of $0.90, which included several notable items which reduced earnings by $0.18 per share. Excluding these notable items, we reported earnings of $1.08 per share. Slide 10 lists the notable items that affected earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2019. Fourth quarter 2019 notable items included restructuring charges, including severance and certain asset impairments, and an increased derivative liability related to Visa shares previously sold by the company. As a reminder, we recognized several notable items during the fourth quarter of 2018, including a gain on the sale of our ATM servicing business, the sale of the majority of the company\u2019s covered loans, as well as charges related to severance, asset impairments, and an accrual for certain legal matters. Along with the favorable impact of deferred tax assets and liabilities related to changes in estimates from tax reform, the net impact of notable items in 2018 was an increase of $0.03 per share. My remarks for the remainder of the call will be referencing results excluding notable items incurred in the fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018. Turning to Slide 11, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis declined by 3% year-over-year, in line with our expectations as the impact of loan growth and higher yields on reinvestment of securities was more than offset by the impact of a flatter yield curve and deposit funding mix. Our net interest margin declined by 10 basis points versus the third quarter. About four basis points of the decline was due to higher premium amortization expense in the investment securities portfolio. The remainder of the pressure can be attributed to the yield curve compression and earning asset mix, partly offset by lower deposit costs. We expect the net interest margin to be stable in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter.  Slide 12 highlights trends in non-interest income. On a year-over-year basis, we saw good growth in merchant acquiring revenue driven by account and volume improvement. As expected, credit and debit card revenue declined 1% year-over-year due to fewer processing days in the fourth quarter of 2019. We look for credit and debit card revenue to return to the mid-single digit growth pace in 2020. Corporate payment products revenue declined 3.1% driven by lower commercial business sales volumes; however, in the past few weeks, sales volume growth has returned to a mid-single digit growth rate. Trust and investment management growth reflected business growth and favorable market conditions. Deposit service targets were impacted by the sale of the company\u2019s ATM servicing business in the fourth quarter of 2018. The decline in treasury management fees from a year ago reflected the impact of changes in earned credits, a residual effect of the raising rate environment in 2018. Notably, treasury management fees increased on a linked quarter basis, reflective of the recent interest rate declines in the third and fourth quarters of 2019. Mortgage banking revenue increased 42.7% year-over-year on strong origination and sales revenue growth. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2018, mortgage production volume increased by 92.3% and mortgage application volume increased by 83.8%.  Refinancing activity represented approximately [indiscernible] in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to about 40% in the linked quarter. Refinancings represent 52% of applications in the fourth quarter. As of November, our digital mortgage app was being utilized by about 86% of all mortgage applications. Turning to Slide 13, the 3.1% year-over-year increase in non-interest expense reflected increased personnel expense, higher technology and communication expense, and higher net occupancy and equipment expense, reflecting actions to support business growth.  Slide 14 highlights our capital position. At December 31, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel 3 standardized approach was 9.1%. I will now provide some forward-looking guidance. For the first quarter of 2020, we expect fully taxable equivalent net interest income to decline at a low single digit pace year-over-year, but to be relatively flat linked quarter normalized for day count. We expect mid-single digit growth in fee revenue year-over-year. We expect low single digit growth in non-interest expenses on a year-over-year basis. Credit quality in the first quarter is expected to remain stable compared to the fourth quarter, and we expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately 20% on a full year basis. I\u2019ll hand it back to Andy for closing comments. Andy Cecere : Thanks Terry. We are operating in a dynamic environment and this quarter\u2019s results reflected the challenging interest rate environment facing the entire industry, as well as the impact of actions we took to better position our company for the future. However, as our core financial metrics indicate, we ended the year on a solid note and we are in a strong position as we head into 2020. We view the interest rate environment as a manageable headwind and we are confident in our ability to prudently grow our balance sheet and gain market share in our fee businesses. Fee growth was negatively impacted by several headwinds in 2019. As Terry discussed, we expect a return to normalized growth in credit and debit card revenue this year. In a more stable interest rate environment, as the refi-driven market shifts to a purchase-driven market, the investments we have made in our mortgage business over the past several years will become increasingly evident in the form of market share gains. We are proud of our strong and consistent financial track record, but we are always looking for ways to improve. That means we are changing the way we think, the way we work, and the way we do business. As we move into 2020 and beyond, we will continue to increase workflow agility and speed to market for our products and services while at the same time optimizing our core operation to fund investment for the future. Our ability to leverage the combined power of our rapidly improving digital capabilities and our complete payment ecosystem will lead to higher customer satisfaction, stronger revenue growth and efficiencies, and ultimately improved returns. In summary, we remain focused on managing this company for the long term while delivering [indiscernible] pathway to the future. I\u2019d like to thank our employees for all we accomplished this year, supported by their hard work and commitment to creating value for our customers.  We will now open up the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore. Go ahead, please, your line is open. John Pancari : Morning. Just wanted to talk a little bit about the operating leverage expectation. I got your comments around the quarter, but for full year 2020, I know you had previously indicated that it could be a challenge to attain positive operating leverage for the full year, given the rate backdrop, etc. I wanted to get your updated thoughts on that, if you see that there is a chance that you can get--you could see positive operating leverage, and what type of magnitude could you see? Terry Dolan : Yes John, thanks. As a reminder, we had a goal of achieving positive operating leverage in 2019, and we did that on a core basis for the full year. When we think about 2020, our objective is to target positive operating leverage and we expect our expense growth to continue to remain in those low single digits. I think we have a number of levers that we continue to look at and pull in terms of optimization. We continue with our physical asset optimization of the branch system, our back office activities, and a number of different things. That\u2019s our goal, that\u2019s our objective at this point in time. That said, as you said in your question, 2020 is a more difficult year simply because of the revenue outlook, and I think part of being able to achieve it is going to be really based upon what happens with respect to interest rates, etc. That\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it. John Pancari : Okay, great. Thanks. Then in terms of some of the headwinds that had impacted your fee progression, I know there was an accounting change that impacted it as well as a couple other items. Can you just talk about where do you expect underlying momentum to build in the fee businesses as you look at 2020? Terry Dolan : Yes, when we end up looking at fee income, I think there\u2019s a number of different things that we end up looking at. I think the credit card revenue is stronger - again, mid-single digits as we think about next year, and that particular line item was impacted by both an accounting item in 2018 as well as a pretty slow first quarter, which we had talked about. I think merchant acquiring continues to accelerate and get strong, and we expect mid-single digits there; and then the CPS revenue, while we saw a decline in the fourth quarter because of a little slower commercial spending, that has come back in the first several weeks of the year, so our expectation in that category is kind of mid-single digits as well. Deposit services charges has been a drag this year because of the sale of the ATM business in 2018, so that kind of normalizes or is at least flat in 2020. I think treasury management revenue is another area that we would expect has kind of hit an inflection point, so while it\u2019s down on a year-over-year basis, it is up on a linked quarter basis and we would expect that to be better than 2020. I think there\u2019s a number of different things. I think the offset to that is if we think about mortgage, when we talk about mortgage, mortgage has been particularly strong the last couple of quarters, but in 2019 it was also quite a bit of a drag in the first several quarters. So again, depending on what happens with interest rates, in the current environment I think that continues to be a positive story. I think there\u2019s a number of different areas. John Pancari : Okay Terry, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Yes, good morning. Terry Dolan : Hey Erika, how are you doing this morning? Erika Najarian : Good, thank you. I heard you loud and clear on your expense growth, and I\u2019m wondering though if the increased severance charges that we\u2019ve seen could lead to a different geography in terms of expense growth. I\u2019m just looking back at your headcount, which seems to have risen along - coincident with the consent order, and I\u2019m wondering if part of the initial statement up front, Andy, in terms of continuing to transform the business is trying to take some of the compensation growth that you experienced over the last three years and really putting that back in technology. Is that how we should expect the geography could change underneath that low single digit expense growth that you\u2019re expecting for 2020? Andy Cecere : I think that\u2019s not an unfair description, Erika. It\u2019s not just technology but it\u2019s people and technology, but it\u2019s optimizing the way we\u2019re doing business to continue to invest in the future. Our expense growth was higher during the consent order periods, but as you know, it\u2019s been in the low single digits the last couple of years, including notable items - 2.4% year-over-year in 2019, and that includes optimization and expense take-out while at the same time investing in technology and people for the future, and I would expect that to continue into 2020. Erika Najarian : I guess I\u2019m wondering if our takeaway from that is because that seems like it\u2019s behind you, and again it feels like the severance charges are setting up for further optimization and rationalization, that you\u2019re accelerating the amount of dollars that you\u2019re putting into the future, so to speak, whether it\u2019s headcount related to that or technology itself. Terry Dolan : Yes, I think that that\u2019s a fair comment, Erika, and again I think the shift is optimizing what I would call the back office and the branch network, which are being impacted by customer behaviors as we transition to more of a digital environment, but at the same time we\u2019re reinvesting that in technology spend to support that digital transformation, so maybe a little bit of a shift from compensation to technology type of costs. But our expectation when we think about 2020 is to continue to make the investments in the business that we have been making over the last couple of years. Erika Najarian : Thank you. Just one more, if I could squeeze it in. Deposit costs were down15 basis points quarter over quarter, and I\u2019m wondering underneath the 1Q NII outlook what you expect for deposit cost trends for the first quarter, and also if the curve outlook continues to be stable from here, could net interest margin for the rest of the year stabilize or potentially increase from 1Q levels? Terry Dolan : Yes, well certainly if the rate environment continues where it is today, our expectation is that 2020 net interest margin would be pretty flat to the fourth quarter with some possible positive bias depending upon what happens on the long end of the curve. That\u2019s kind of our thought process, and the reason for that is the premium amortization that we\u2019ve experienced in the third and fourth quarter is stabilizing at this particular point in time. When we think about deposit costs, deposit pricing, we have been pretty responsive on the institutional deposits in terms of bringing those, re-pricing those down as rates have come down, and I think from here on out, deposit pricing will be a function of both competition and what happens on the short end of the curve. Erika Najarian : Got it, thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler. Go ahead, please, your line is open. Scott Siefers : Morning guys. Thank you for taking the question. Just curious if you might be able to offer any top level comments on the overall pace of loan growth and overall demand. If you look at the H8 data, it\u2019s definitely been held up or supported by the consumer side, but it\u2019s been a little surprising to see the slowdown in growth on the commercial side, however. I\u2019m just curious given the breadth of your franchise and different types of customers you look at, what you\u2019re seeing at a very top level. Terry Dolan : Yes, at a very high level, again I think economically we feel pretty optimistic in terms of what the outlook there is. If you end up looking at the components of loan growth, I think we saw pretty strong and good growth with respect to consumer lending. The area that was a little bit softer in the fourth quarter was really our C&I or our corporate lending, and that\u2019s principally while we saw production and the pipeline continuing to be reasonably strong, we saw pretty significant pay downs that were taking place in that space driven by capital markets activities, and that\u2019s a function of the long end of the curve coming down in the third and fourth quarter. With that stabilizing, while we would expect some of the pay downs to continue into the first quarter, I think that will moderate. Scott Siefers : Okay, perfect. Thank you. Then just any additional updates on ramification from the LCR rules? I think you guys have been talking about $11 billion to $15 billion of liquidity free-up. Any updated thoughts on how you\u2019re thinking about that dynamic? Terry Dolan : Yes, that\u2019s in the ballpark in terms of the amount of--what the impact is with respect to LCR. We\u2019re continuing to look at different alternatives, and part of it is thinking about extending duration a little bit, possibly investing a little bit more in agency mortgage-backed securities, which would provide a little bit better yield. But I think it will be on the margin and it won\u2019t be anything dramatic. Scott Siefers : All right, that\u2019s perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : There are no further questions in queue at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Jennifer Thompson for closing remarks.  Oh, it looks like we did get one question. We do have a question from the line of Vivek Juneja from JP Morgan Chase. Go ahead, please, your line is open. Vivek Juneja : Thank you. Hi Andy, hi Terry. Just wanted to clarify on credit-debit card fees, what was the impact from two for your processing base? How should--what does that do, and is there a reversal in 2020? Terry Dolan : Yes, good question. There was an impact of two days that ended up really taking our fee income from low to middle single digits to negative 1% in the fourth quarter. There is one extra day in 2020 relative to 2019, but let me just dissect it a little bit because I think that that is maybe helpful. When you end up looking at the growth rate for 2019, it was really impacted by three different things. One is that there was an accounting change that occurred in the first quarter of 2018 that, because of the lapping effect, ended up depressing growth rates in 2019. In addition, if you remember the consumer spend level in the first quarter was significantly lower and was kind of at an unusually low level, and of course as concerns around the economy stabilized, that consumer spend has come up. That has been in the mid single digits in the second, third and fourth quarter in terms of sales volumes. Then as you know, getting back to the processing days, quarterly results can be lumpy, but when we think about 2020 in terms of on a full year basis, we really think that mid-single digits is a good target for us and a good estimate for us. Our sales volumes over the last several quarters have been in that range, and when you think about it on a day-adjusted basis, it\u2019s been pretty consistent from quarter to quarter. So in 2020, there is one more day and that will help a little bit, but mid-single digits for 2020, I think is a good estimate. Again, quarterly results will be a little bit lumpy, but when we think about the year, that\u2019s kind of how we\u2019re thinking about it. Vivek Juneja : When I look back over the prior couple of years, you\u2019d had--you know, this line item was growing at sort of more like 9% to 9.5% when you look at \u201917 to \u201918. Going to the mid-single digits, has there been any reduction in pricing, a shift in the kind of contracts, or is this higher reward expense? What, Terry, is driving that slowdown from that high single digit level to the mid-single digit run rate? Terry Dolan : Yes, the growth rates in 2017 - 2018 were influenced in some respect because of some portfolios that we were acquiring during that particular time frame, more so than other factors, so when we think about pricing, there hasn\u2019t been a lot of compression with respect to pricing. We feel pretty good about that. Andy Cecere : And rewards have been relatively flat, so actually that isn\u2019t a factor. That mid-single digit number is a good way to think about the next 12 months. Vivek Juneja : Okay. As you think in terms of other fee revenues, Andy and Terry, you said treasury management should be good. Corporate card fees, when I look at that, that was also a little bit softer this quarter. It\u2019s actually down year-on-year. Any color on that, because I know the--yes, I\u2019ll just let you answer that. Andy Cecere : Yes Vivek, the impact of that is because we saw in the last half of the fourth quarter, corporate spend activity slowed. That had been running in the mid-single digits, a little bit higher in the first few quarters. Fourth quarter saw a slowdown to almost flat, and as Terry mentioned in his prepared remarks, we did see a pick-up in the first two weeks of January back to the mid-single digits. So that was attributable to that slowdown, but it seems to have come back. Terry Dolan : I think that one of the reasons for that is if you think about where the yield curve--how rates were moving, there was concern about a recession, people were uncertain with respect to economic data, and then you had the hangover of tariffs. I think the sentiment on the corporate side appears to be looking better. We\u2019re going to be signing trade agreement with China today, I believe, in terms of phase one, and the US-Mexico-Canada agreement is well on its way, so I think that some of that uncertainty that might have been impacting discretionary spend in the commercial side of the equation has been alleviated, so we feel pretty good. Vivek Juneja : I want to confirm one last thing - CECL Day 2, could you talk a little bit about what you see that doing to your provision expense, Andy, Terry? Terry Dolan : Yes, we\u2019ve talked about certainly Day 1 and Day 2 as part of investor day. The provision will increase. We think that in terms of loan growth, providing it\u2019s kind of that 2% level versus 1.5%, is kind of how we\u2019re thinking about it, but there\u2019s going to be more volatility related to CECL and I think one of the things we\u2019ll end up looking at is just what is the stability in the overall portfolio and what are net charge-offs doing on a quarter to quarter basis. Vivek Juneja : All right, thank you. Operator : We do have another question from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Go ahead, please, your line is open. Amanda Larsen : HI everyone, this is Amanda Larsen on for Ken. Terry Dolan : Yes Amanda, how are you doing? Amanda Larsen : Great, thanks. I think it\u2019s understood that 2020 will likely be an aberration versus the long term trends that you set out at investor day related to revenue growth headwinds, but that you\u2019ll still strive to achieve positive operating leverage in \u201920. But I\u2019m wondering, how negative could negative operating leverage be in \u201920 before you do take actions related to slowing the pace of investment spend or creating more saves? Andy Cecere : As Terry mentioned again earlier, we expect and target positive operating leverage for 2020. We have a number of levers that we continue to pull to optimize the current organization structure to continue to invest in the future. Amanda, the way we think about is a balance of optimizing today and investing in the future while always targeting that positive operating leverage, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re managing the company. Amanda Larsen : Okay, great. Then, can you guys talk about the capability add of Sage Pay and how you see U.S. Bank\u2019s position evolving in the ecommerce payment arena over the medium term? Thanks. Terry Dolan : Yes, we\u2019re very excited about Sage Pay. It is a leader in the ecommerce space within the U.K. and Ireland, and we also have the opportunity to be able to extend that into the rest of Europe. We have a pretty big footprint across Europe, so pretty excited about that as we think about next year. We ended up rolling out sort of similar ecommerce capabilities over the course of the last 12 to 18 months here domestically, so we believe that that gives us more capabilities in terms of being able to take advantage of ecommerce in the future. Amanda Larsen : Awesome, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous. Go ahead, please, your line is open. John McDonald : Hey guys. Sorry, I jumped on a little bit late. Did you give an update on the Charlotte expansion, Andy, and how that\u2019s going and whether you\u2019re targeting new areas for this year to expand on the retail side? Andy Cecere : Good morning, John. Charlotte is going well. We opened the branch about three months ago. We\u2019ve had new customer acquisition growth and current customers. Employees are fired up. We are targeting a number of new branches to be opening up this year and still targeting that number of 10. We\u2019re learning a lot from that investment. We continue to track that and measure our activity and I would expect us to continue to expand in new markets, but our first focus is expanding to our target number in Charlotte. John McDonald : Got you, okay. Then Terry, just a couple clean-up things on NII. I think you mentioned the amortization kind of stabilizes early this year - is that right? Then the roll-off rates, where the 10-year is today, are those breakeven or slightly accretive, and where you\u2019re putting money to work in the bond portfolio today relative to what\u2019s rolling off? Terry Dolan : Yes, so addressing your second question first, the reinvestment with respect to securities is still about 15 basis points or so accretive, so we would expect that based upon where rates are today. The premium amortization does stabilize in the first quarter, so when we think about net interest margin for the year, we think it\u2019s going to be relatively flat, maybe a little bit of positive bias relative to the fourth quarter of 2019. John McDonald : Okay, so the down NII for the year is just the tough comps of where you started last year? I guess from a sequential standpoint, though, sales relatively stable? Terry Dolan : Yes. John McDonald : Okay, thank you. Operator : With that, there are no further questions in queue. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Jennifer Thompson for closing remarks. Jennifer Thompson : Thank you everyone for listening to our earnings call. Please contact the Investor Relations department if you have any follow-up questions. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Following a review of the results by Andy Cecere, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Dolan, U.S. Bancorp's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 12 o'clock p.m. Eastern through Wednesday, April 22nd at 12 o'clock midnight Eastern Time. I will now turn the conference call over to Jen Thompson, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. Jen Thompson : Thank you, Jenika, and good morning everyone. With me today, as usual, are Andy Cecere, our Chairman, President and CEO; and Terry Dolan, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us on the call today are our Chief Risk Officer, Jodi Richard; and our Chief Credit Officer, Mark Runkel. During their prepared remarks, Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release, and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. I'd like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page two of today's presentation in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Andy. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Jen, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our call. After Terry and I finish our prepared remarks, Terry, Jodi, Mark and I will take any questions you have. I'll begin on slide 3. In the first quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.72. Our performance this quarter was adversely impacted by the COVID-19 in the U.S. and global economies. The stay at home orders across the country, while necessary and temporary, are significantly restricting economic activity. Consumers and businesses are dealing with the fallout, which is affecting sentiment and business activity and resulting in financial distress for many. These dynamics are affecting the banking industry in a number of ways. And our first quarter results were reflective of these developing economic conditions. We saw strong loan growth and related deposit growth, particularly in the last few weeks of the quarter as we supported our customers\u2019 liquidity needs. During this timeframe, the Company funded approximately $22 billion of loans for our customers while continuing to strengthen our cash position. Our fee businesses were affected to varying degrees. Our payments businesses were negatively impacted by a sharp decline in both consumer and commercial spend activity, in line with the drop in global economic activity in March. Demonstrating the importance of having a well-diversified business mix, mortgage revenue growth was strong this quarter as the declining interest rates allowed many more consumers to refinance their mortgage at more attractive terms. We also saw strong growth in our commercial products revenue, reflecting robust capital markets activity. Nonperforming assets started to turn higher in the first quarter, reflecting the increased economic stress. We increased our allowance for loan losses in response to the current economic conditions. And as you can see in the lower right quadrant of this slide, we remain well-capitalized. Book value per share grew 5% compared with a year ago. Slide 4 provides key performance metrics. We delivered a 12.6% return on tangible common equity in the first quarter, impacted by lower earnings due to the current economic environment. Slide 5 shows our continually improving digital uptake trends. The significant investments we've made in our digital capabilities over the last several years are helping our customers continue to do banking as social distancing has become more widespread. Because of our agile development activities, we've made a number of updates in recent weeks to digital tools and processes to help customers who choose to bank at home. We've added the ability to accept treasury checks via mobile check deposit, which will help customers more quickly and seamlessly get access to funds being distributed through the government stimulus efforts. Our teams work quickly to design and deploy a new digital forbearance tool. Within a week of this feature being launched, more than 50% of all customers requesting forbearance were doing so in a digital way. Digital is a core part of our strategy, and we\u2019ll continue to look for innovative ways to help our customers bank from home and to meet financial goals through this social distancing period and beyond. Now, I'll turn the call over to Terry to provide more color on the quarter. Terry? Terry Dolan : Thanks, Andy. If you turn to slide 6, I'll start with the balance sheet review followed by a discussion of first quarter earnings trends. Average loans grew 0.9% on a linked quarter basis and increased 4.0% year-over-year. Linked quarter growth was primarily driven by growth in commercial loans and mortgage loans. Business customers drew down lines to support business activity, and toward the end of the quarter to support future liquidity requirements. Strong residential mortgage loan growth reflected the low interest rate environment. On a period-end basis, loans increased $22 billion or 7.5% linked quarter and 10.6% year-over-year. Turning to slide 7. Average deposits increased 1.8% on a linked quarter basis and grew 8.2% year-over-year. Average savings deposits increased 14.1% year-over-year, driven by growth in wealth management and investment services, corporate and commercial banking, and consumer and business banking. On a period-end basis, deposits increase $32.9 billion or 9.1% linked quarter and 14.1% year-over-year. Turning to slide 8. While the net charge-off ratio was relatively stable on both the linked quarter and year-over-year basis, nonperforming assets increased 14.1% sequentially, reflecting recent economic stress. We have taken a proactive approach to evaluating risk ratings across the entire commercial loan portfolio and considered the risk rating changes in the evaluation of our allowance for credit losses. Our credit loss provision was $993 million in the first quarter, reflective of $393 million of net charge-offs, and reserve build of $600 million. The increase in the reserve was related to changes in risk ratings and deterioration in economic conditions, driven by the impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. and global economies, and our expectation that credit losses on non-performing assets will increase from current levels. The increase in the allowance for credit losses as considered our best estimate of the impact of significantly slower economic growth and higher unemployment, partially offset by the benefits of government stimulus programs as of March 31st. Slide 9 highlights our key underwriting metrics and exposures to certain at-risk segments, given the current environment. We have a strong relationship-based credit culture in U.S. Bank, supported by cash flow based lending that considers sensitivity to stress, proactive management and portfolio diversification, which allows us to support growth through the economic cycle and produce consistent results. However, while actual credit quality results will depend on the duration of the COVID-19 situation, the impact of shelter and -- shelter-in-place orders on consumer and business activity, as well as the extent of the benefit of government stimulus programs, it is likely that changes in risk ratings and net charge-offs will continue to assess the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses as credit conditions change.  Slide 10 provides an earnings summary. In the first quarter of 2020, we reported $0.72 per share. Turning to slide 11. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis declined by 1.2% year-over-year, in line with our expectations as the impact of declining rates and a flatter yield curve was partially offset by deposit and funding mix, loan growth and one additional day. The net interest margin declined by 1 basis-point versus the fourth quarter. The lower margin reflected lower net -- lower interest rates and a flatter yield curve as well as approximately 5 basis points of drag due to intentionally higher cash balances being maintained for liquidity to accommodate customer demand. These factors were mostly offset by beneficial shifts in loan and deposit mix. We expect to see more pressure on our net interest margin in the second quarter, primarily due to the timing and extent of changes in interest rates late in the first quarter with significant build-up in liquidity to support the significant loan growth -- loan demand being experienced, changes in loan mix and the impact of floors on deposit pricing. Slide 12 highlights trends in non-interest income, which came in higher than we expected, primarily due to better than expected mortgage banking results and strong fixed income capital markets activities. Compared with the first quarter a year-ago, higher mortgage production and stronger gain on sale margins was partially offset by changes in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights net of hedging activity. Slide 13 provides information about our payments services business\u2019s lines, including exposures to impacted industries. In the first quarter payment services revenue declined 6.9% on a year-over-year basis, reflecting lower corporate payment products revenue and lower merchant acquiring revenue, driven by significantly lower sales volume in March as shelter-in-place orders impacted many of our customers. Within the merchant acquiring business, sales volumes declined between 50% and 60% on a year-over-year basis in the second half of March compared with an increase in the mid to high single-digits in the first two months of the quarter. Within our corporate payments business, commercial sales volumes declined between 30% and 40% in late March, due to the worldwide impact of the economic slowdown on business spend activity. Government sales volumes declined between 15% to 20% in late March. The government business accounts for about 20% of the total corporate payments revenue. Commercial products revenue benefited from higher corporate bond fees and trading revenue, partly offset by credit valuation losses related to customer derivative portfolio. The valuation losses reflect hedging effectiveness, given the significant volatility in the markets during the first quarter and changes to credit risk ratings for customers. It is likely that mortgage production will continue to be relatively strong in the near-term, but may begin to slow later in the year, in line with the trend in refinancing activity. Payments revenue is likely to be adversely affected through the remainder of the year, reflecting significant declines in consumer and business spend activity. Trust and investment revenue will likely decline from first quarter levels, due to recent trends in the equity markets. Turning to slide 13. Non-interest expense increased 7.4% year-over-year, reflecting business investment including digital capabilities as well as higher revenue-related expenses of approximately $49 million related to mortgage production and capital markets activities. Additionally, we incurred incremental COVID-19-related costs of approximately $100 million, principally related to increasing liabilities for potential future delivery claims related to the airline industry and other merchants, but also including expenses related to premium paid for frontline workers and expenses tied to providing a safe working environment for our employees. Slide 14 highlights our capital position. At March 31st, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, reflecting the full implementation of the current expected credit loss accounting methodology was 8.6%. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio calculated in accordance with transitional regulatory capital requirements related to the current expected credit loss methodology implementation at March 31st was 9.0%. I'll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Terry. The banking industry is operating in a challenging environment and we are not immune from the economic stress brought on by COVID-19 pandemic. However, I'm confident that we'll manage through this difficult period, just as we managed through difficult periods in the past. Our balance sheet is strong, our businesses are diverse and our culture has proven to be a differentiating factor over time, and perhaps especially during adverse situations. The interest rate environment is not ideal, but we view it as manageable. And we will continue to benefit from our strong core deposit base, our reputation as a flight to quality bank and our best-in-class debt rating on a global basis. And economic downturn will need higher credit costs for the entire industry, but we have a strong track record. And it's at times like this when portfolio diversity and disciplined and consistent underwriting really pay off. It's unclear at this point how the situation will develop or how long it will be until the economy opens up and when we'll start to rebound. However, our strong capital position and ample liquidity give us the ability to weather even a severe downturn. We've recently suspended our share buyback program to give us more flexibility. We are continually evaluating potential scenarios, and we believe that even if an economic downturn persisted through most of the year, we would be able to maintain our dividend at its current level. I believe we will emerge from this stronger on the other side. But in the meantime, we are intently focused on doing what we can for our customers, communities and employees as they deal with their unique situations. We stand ready with the necessary liquidity to support this significant loan demand we expect to see in the coming weeks as the government continues to roll up facilities to support businesses, such as the Small Business Administration, Paycheck Protection Program, and the Main Street Lending Program. We've made adjustments to certain consumer and small business lending products and services to make them more affordable and accessible to existing customers who may be experiencing financial stress. We also raised mobile check deposit limits for many customers using our mobile app. Recognizing the precarious situation many of our communities are in, we announced a number of initiatives including a $30 million new and redirected investments, $26 million of which are to local non-profit across the country to continue to support individuals and families with financial education, affordable housing and work assistance. We've taken a number of steps to support and protect our employees. Within a short period of time, we have transitioned 76% of our employees to be able to work from the safety of their home. We announced a premium pay program to provide office critical frontline employees a 20% hourly wage increase during these shelter-in-place conditions. We also expanded our flexible leave policies and we're keeping our employees safe with personal protection equipment at our customer facing sites. I want to end this call by saying thank you to our employees, those working from home and those on the frontlines. I'm proud of the way you\u2019ve come together and the work you're doing to partner with and support all of our constituents in this very difficult time. We will now open up the call for Q&A. Q - Erika Najarian : Thanks for your comments on the credit. And we're wondering, as we think about the Company-run DFAST results, so 4.5% cumulative losses over nine quarters. Could you talk about how you think this recession would look like relative to that stress, what's different for the better, for the positive, and what's worse for the negative? Clearly the unemployment rate is -- was capped at 10% in the DFAST results. And also with the reserve at 2.07, you told us before that CECL is very pro-cyclical. And from here, I'm wondering how much more reserve build we could potentially see? Terry Dolan : So, let me try to address maybe the DFAST questions first. And, when we end up thinking about the allowance maybe at current state relative to losses that we're experiencing, we think that the coverage ratio associated with that is relatively strong. That is over kind of a nine-quarter period of time. We have a lot of capacity with respect to our pre-provision net revenue capability in terms of being able to produce that. So, we have the opportunity to be able to absorb a pretty substantial amount of losses if need to, especially when you kind of think about where our capital level is, where we\u2019d need to progress before it become problematic. So, when we think about the coverage ratio, 2.7%, when we think about the reserve from here on out, I think that things will continue to progress and evolve and change. How this recession I think is different and clearly the rapid development of the situation in terms of the healthcare crisis, the impacts obviously to people from an employment perspective and having to either work from home or being unemployed peaks pretty quickly. As we think about it and certainly as we were thinking about the reserving process, we took into consideration, tried to take into consideration the rapid increase that would take place and then the impact that it would have on unemployment over a more sustained period of time before it starts to come down. It's hard to judge, particularly right now because there's just a lot of moving parts. I think, the other thing that comes into play, which is kind of difficult to get your arms around is the whole stimulus package. I think, the governments put a lot of programs into place, both to stabilize the markets quickly as well as to be able to bridge customers and businesses between now and when they're able to get back to employment. And that's one of the things that will continue to play out over time. But, we do expect that the credit quality statistics related to nonperforming and delinquencies and things like that will continue to progress upward and we'll have to watch and manage it. Erika Najarian : The second question is -- I know this is another impossible question. But, given what happened to payments related revenues, down 7% year-over-year, but clearly a tale of two different points in the quarter. What's -- how should we expect this to progress? Should we expect down double-digits through at least the second quarter? And what are increased liabilities driven by future delivery exposure related to merchant and airline processing? Terry Dolan : Yes. So, one of the things we tried to do on slide 13 is to give you a good sense in terms of both the percentage of revenue that our payments businesses represent as a percentage of the total revenue of the Company as well as industries, the mix of the industries that are more severely impacted. So, let me kind of break it down. But, I do believe at a high level when we think about and how we're kind of stress testing the next several quarters, we do believe that second, third and possibly through the end of the fourth quarter that consumer spend and business spend is going to be at relatively low level. So, as we're modeling and we're thinking that, for example, merchant is going to continue to be down at 50% to 60% on a year-over-year basis that CPS is going to continue to be down in that 25% to 30% sort of range, and that RPS is probably going to continue to migrate downward, it's kind of in that 30% to 40% range today. But I do think that it starts to migrate closer to that 50% as well. And that's, as we are stress testing and thinking about the future quarters, that's how we're thinking about it. And it's a function of the mix of the businesses. So, if you think about the merchant acquiring business, we have a -- about 28% of revenue from that business is directly tied to travel and hospitality and another 27% is directly tied to retail. And both of those businesses are pretty significantly impacted, and the airlines as an example being 85% to 95% down depending upon the week. So, it's -- as we think about second, third and even into the fourth quarter, we're stressing it down quite a bit. Erika Najarian : The follow-up question on the... Terry Dolan : Oh, yes. Future delivery, I'm sorry. Yes, future delivery. So, future delivery, if you think about the airline industry, we process transactions for the airline industry as well as some other merchants where customers are paying upfront for their tickets for a future travel or flight. And the merchant kind of stands in between -- the merchant acquirer stands in between the customer that is buying that ticket and the airline that will provide that future service to that customer. So, to the extent that that airline is unable to provide it, then the customer has the right to go back against a merchant acquirer. Now, what ends up happening over time is and what has been happening is that exposure gets -- starts to dissipate and it dissipates when the airline either refunds the customer or the customer decides not to fly the flight or the airline provides future credits to that particular customer. And so, that future delivery risk to us continues to dissipate over time. But, we wanted to make sure and we're required from an accounting standpoint to recognize the potential risk associated with that future delivery exposure and we'll continue to manage it. Andy Cecere : And Erika, I'm just going to add a little bit to Terry's comments on the merchant card and corporate payments spend. So, if you think about the first quarter, three months, we really saw the stress in the last half of the last month. So, we sort of had a one-sixth impact on the quarter on those payments businesses. And what Terry is telling you is that what we saw in those last two months of March in merchant, in corporate and retail was a spend and particularly in merchant down in that 50% plus range. Now, no one knows exactly when that's going to come back. And what Terry -- as he indicated is we're stress testing it, understanding that that\u2019s the impact we wanted to provide you with detail. But when it comes back, it\u2019s uncertain for sure. But that's the impact and the exposure we would have. Erika Najarian : And just to clarify, that\u2019s spend not revenue? Terry Dolan : Well, it\u2019s spend, and revenue is pretty closely tied to the same sort of trends. And again, as Andy said, it really is a function of when do businesses relaunch, when the people get back to work and what is the duration of the situation. And that is really hard to get your arms around. But we're stress testing it, based upon what I talked about. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Nomura. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good morning. First, Terry, I wanted to ask you a question following up on your response to Erika's question about expecting certain credit metrics like delinquencies to head higher from here. If we think about CECL in theory, it's supposed to capture lifetime losses. And so, shouldn't that upward trajectory in delinquencies and losses already be contemplated in your allowance at 3/31. [Ph] And so just, I guess, wondering if you could help us understand what it will take to drive incremental reserve building versus -- from here versus what's already baked into that allowance. Terry Dolan : Yes. So, great question, Bill. And so, if you -- if we had perfect insight into exactly what was going to happen and we knew exactly how bad GDP and unemployment and everything else was going to get, the CECL process would take that into consideration. But, as you know, nobody has perfect insights. In fact, the expectations around unemployment and GDP and when people get back to work and all sorts of things are constantly changing. So, at any particular point in time, we have to make our best estimate of what that forecast looks like, knowing that it's likely to continue to progress based on how conditions change. So, if you end up -- when we go through that process, we end up looking at things like Moody's Analytics, and Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, a whole variety of different. And even over the course of last seven days or so, those projections with respect to how the economy is going to change, and what the potential impacts might be, has been pretty significant. So, we're going to have to take all those things into consideration as part of that process. Then, of course, the models are never perfect. There is a lot of things that we have to take into consideration from a judgmental standpoint. Think about the impact of the stimulus package. It's really hard at this particular point in time to know exactly what the benefits are that are going to come into play, et cetera. So, there's just a lot of different factors that we have to try to consider. So, we believe that it's going to continue to evolve really over the next several quarters. And that's going to impact the reserve build over time. Bill Carcache : That's super helpful, Terry. But, I guess, as we think about where you guys were in terms of like, the economic forecast that you were using through, let's say, the end of March, and the first quarter. And then, to the extent that new information became available in early April before earnings, that suggests that the rate of deterioration in unemployment and real GDP would be greater than what was thought at March 31st. Is that information that it was still I guess it existed at the balance sheet date, but you didn't find out about it until after? Would that be something that you contemplate in your 3/31 allowances, or is the 3/31 allowance literally just based on information through 3/31, or is there room for judgment there? Just trying to get a little bit of I guess sense of how that works? Terry Dolan : Yes. Well, obviously, we do try to take into consideration what we know and apply judgment with respect to what we think the trends are going to be. But eventually, you have to kind of snap the chalk line and say this is what we're going to base our assessment on. And we really have to do that right around the end of the quarter. So, as things change, we'll have to take that into consideration. The other thing, in terms of the whole reserving process, just maybe to kind of put some context around it. So, there's obviously a lot of judgment that kind of comes into play and you have to kind of come up with what's your economic forecast is. But, as we think about it, and the reserve at the end of the first quarter, when we end up looking at the coverage ratios that we have in terms of charge-offs and in terms of the overall loan book et cetera, we feel like those coverage ratios are at least reasonable at this particular point in time. Also kind of keep in mind that on day one, we had to make certain judgments and assessments with respect to the amount of the CECL judgment at that particular point in time. And to kind of give you some insight, when we made that assessment of the economic forecast, a little over 50% of it we have shown, would either be a slower growth environment or moderate recessions, or a severe recession. So, there were lots of different views with respect to where the economy was going to go. So, we have taken some of that into consideration as part of our day one. And then, it's also very important to take into consideration where you're starting from? And if you think about our portfolio in terms of determining the allowance, our portfolios on a consumer side are principally prime or super prime sort of customers with very high FICO scores and good coverage in terms of loan-to-value ratios on the secured side of the equation. And our commercial book of business tends to be high investment grade where we stress cash flows, based on cash flow and ability to be able to withstand. So, we start from good credit underwriting, a good risk profile, strong coverage ratios, all those things are taken into consideration in terms of our estimate of the allowance. Bill Carcache : That's very helpful. If I could squeeze one more in for Andy. Andy, you mentioned in the press release, you commented on how USB is going to emerge stronger on the other side of the pandemic and proving a reliable partner to your customers. In the I guess period, when we think about the great recession, there was -- you guys really used that as an opportunity to win relationships with new partners, in part because you were in a stronger position versus many other banks. As we think about where you guys stand today, do you see opportunities for USB to differentiate itself in this environment, or is it more difficult because the banks, I guess generally speaking, are coming into this downturn in a stronger position relative to the great recession? Andy Cecere : I think generally speaking, all banks are in a good position right now, which is why we're all able to help our customers while protecting employees, which is exactly what we're focused on. One of the other things I said is, we have been stressing across all the dynamics, margin, fees, all the things we've talked about as well as credit losses. And importantly, based on what I know today, even if the economic downturn persisted through the most of the year, we still believe we can maintain the dividend, which is also an important factor for shareholders. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Chris on behalf of Mike. This is just related to the questions you had previously. How have you -- I mean, what is your view of the economy since the end of the third quarter, and how has that changed? Just again, I know you kind of addressed that to a degree, but we -- just a little more specifics on what you think the economy has done in the last few weeks, given what you saw at the end of March? Terry Dolan : Yes. Again, I think, since the end of March, I think, there are a number of forecasts that have come out with respect to GDP declining dramatically, particularly in the second quarter. I think, there are other forecasts that try to take into consideration not only what I would call a V-shaped sort of recovery, but more a maybe U-shaped sort of recovery. So, the duration has changed a fair amount. And then, where unemployment either peaks or at least what level it\u2019s sustained at over a period of time, I think whether you look at Moody's Analytics, you look at the reports that have come out from Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan since the end of the quarter, most of those have started to at least incorporate downside risk related to the environment. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then, on reserving, just a couple of questions on the reserves for unused commitments. And then also, can you relate your reserve levels today and a coverage ratio today versus what you might have seen during the financial crisis? Because it's much lower today, and even with all the adjustments you've made and builds you've made since the GFC. So, just how has your portfolio changed to give you so much more confidence today in the coverage ratio versus what you might have had, say 9 or 10 years ago? Terry Dolan : Yes. So, I mean, I think that -- and I'll have maybe Mark pipe in here a little bit. But, if you think about how our portfolios have changed since 2008 or 2009, certainly if you end up looking at on the consumer side of the equation, I think across the industry, including ourselves, the underwriting standards are tighter than they were back then, certainly on the mortgage side, if you think about the mortgage product, it is underwritten to take into consideration a customer's ability to manage cash flows, even in different rate scenarios and rate environments, et cetera. On the commercial side of the equation, I think the exposure is related to leverage lending and some of those sorts of things is different. But Mark, could you kind of address that? Mark Runkel : Yes. I would just say, in addition to what Terry has mentioned, like I said, on the retail side or the consumer side, the portfolio continues to be very strong. I think, we're better positioned at this point of the economic cycle than we were going into the last downturn, the quality of the portfolio in terms of the average borrower profile from a credit perspective is stronger, the loan to values are lower, especially in real estate portfolios. That would be true as well with our auto portfolio, both loan and lease is stronger today, as well as our credit card portfolio. So, we feel good. But, the quality of the portfolio as Terry said is very much prime, on the commercial side continues to be pretty much investment grade or equivalent. As you know, we capitalized during the last downturn to really what I would say -- move towards large corporate strategy and with that we've got higher quality borrowers today than we had going into the last downturn, which has provided some of the funding of that $22 billion and some of the draws that we talked about earlier. And then, the commercial real estate, we've been in that business a long time and that's really a relationship based. And I would say we've really gone upmarket and focused in on stronger sponsors today, compared to where we were at the last downturn. I think, from a credit quality perspective, the portfolio is very strong as we enter into this changing economic environment. Terry Dolan : And Chris, maybe one of the last things on the commercial real estate side of the equation, for the last two years, we have really been tightening the underwriting and bringing down our exposure with respect to construction lending. I think, that's a pretty significant difference. And we have been doing that in contemplation that ultimately we have some form of a downturn. And we've been relatively conservative associated with that. If you end up looking at the peak, one of the questions you had is, really kind of in the last cycle kind of what sort of peaks did we see. Ultimately, I think, the reserve at that time ended up building to about 2.9% of loans and the charge-off rates ended up kind of increasing to about 2.4% kind of overall. So, there's -- that's why I say, I think we end up looking at charge-offs and some of these other statistics, they're going to continue to migrate. But, we have good, strong -- if you end up looking at the -- even the allowance today, and while I said I think that future quarters it\u2019s going to continue to build, you look at the allowance today in terms of coverage ratios relative to net charges-offs, non-performing assets, et cetera. Our coverage ratios are very strong. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Just a quick follow-up on that then. So, the slight decline in the allowance for commitments? Terry Dolan : Yes. I think part of that is, what commitments have now funded. But, what we try to do is take into consideration from a reserving perspective what unfunded commitments exist out there and probabilities that they will become funded and then the loss rates that you have to apply to it. But, Mark, can you... Mark Runkel : Yes. I would just say that the unfunded commitments, we also look at the credit quality of those borrowers. And so, what remains is some of the stronger quality borrowers on the balance sheet as well. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja of JP Morgan. Vivek Juneja : Sorry. Multiple calls. A quick question. Just a question that I have to you is what -- and you may have already mentioned this, but multiple calls. So, pardon me. What reserves are you putting aside against credit card loans in your reserve build? Terry Dolan : So, your question is, what are we reserving or taking into consideration with respect to credit cards themselves? Vivek Juneja : Yes. Terry Dolan : Mark, why don\u2019t you answer that? Mark Runkel : Yes. Reserve rate was 8.83% at the end of Q1. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Thanks. That's -- presuming you've already given some detail, which I have missed. Thanks. So, I'll follow up with IR about whether you\u2019ve given any metrics on unemployment where you're expecting that to pan out next year, where do you expect it to settle out. Did you already give that? Terry Dolan : Yes. We didn't talk about that. In the modeling process as of the end of March, we talked about the fact that this will continue to evolve and change as estimates change. But in the modeling process, we tried to take -- we considered a number of different forecasts, ultimately in the high single digits between 8% and 10%. And that is being sustained at a certain level for a period of time and ultimately dissipating as we get into 2021. Vivek Juneja : And I noticed you took a little bit of reserve for the merchant processing library. Is that your best guesstimate as to what you have to take or do you think that if this continues for a while, there's more likely than the $100 million you took? Terry Dolan : Yes. At this particular point in time, we feel like that's a pretty good estimate of what we think the exposure is. And again, it's a liability for what the exposure might be related to that future delivery. In this particular area, that exposure tends to dissipate again for a whole variety of different reasons, including airlines making refunds, them using their government stimulus programs in order to be able to do that, customers choosing not to fly the flights, or being given future credit by the airlines. So that will dissipate it quite a bit. And then, the other thing you guys have to kind of keep in mind is that for these airlines to relaunch, they need a merchant acquirer. And so, from a prioritization perspective, they want to make sure that their merchant acquirer is onboard and ready to go. So, they tend to prioritize the resolution of those future delivery exposures, to make sure that that merchant acquirer is helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rahul Patil of Evercore ISI. Rahul Patil : Hi. This is Rahul Patil in on behalf of John. I just want to revisit the whole discussion around reserve level and cumulative loss. So, for your 2019 DFAST results, so you had $16.3 billion of losses per the Fed's projections over nine quarters and I believe it was $12.5 billion losses per your own model. Your reserve right now stands around $6.6 billion. I just want to get a sense for what portion of that accumulative losses are you assuming right now when you are sizing up the current reserve level and/or potential incremental reserve builds in coming quarters? Terry Dolan : Yes. So, I think, you're trying to get at when we think about DFAST and how our reserve would kind of compare to DFAST results. And again, that $15 billion is pretty close to that estimate, both by the Fed as well as ourselves. And that is really what sort of losses you would experience over a nine-quarter period with pretty severe unemployment taking place and being sustained over a substantial amount of that time. Our allowance today represents just shy of 40% of that. And we certainly have the capacity both from a capital perspective as well as from a earnings perspective to be able to manage any losses that might be above that reserve level. We don't necessarily -- as we think about it necessarily come up with a percentage of losses relative to DFAST, but I think the coverage is pretty strong at this particular point in time. And again, it will progress as the quarters go on. Rahul Patil : Got it. All right. And then, you said it's $5.7 billion of loans that you've modified. Is that mainly consumer loans or have you begun restructuring commercial loans as well? Mark Runkel : That would be both portfolios. We've helped a number of customers. What I would say is, those are programs or modifications that we've drawn kind of in the past on a forward-looking view. On the consumer portfolio over the last few weeks, we have granted programs and extensions of about 181,000 customers, which is about 4.9% of on and off-balance sheet exposure. In addition, we've helped 3,400 business customers or about $2 billion of total of exposure as well. So, those would not be included in those restructured numbers that you're looking at. Rahul Patil : And then, just one last question. So, I'm looking at your LCR disclosures as of yearend where it seems like you assumed around $18.6 billion of line draw-downs. That compares to the $22 billion that you cited today. So, just two-part question. So, what sort of stress scenario is baked into that LCR disclosure over a 30-day period, and how does that compare with the environment today? And then, secondly, was there some impact of the line draw-downs you saw in March due to window dressing by companies or do you expect another wave of draw-downs in coming weeks? Terry Dolan : Sorry. The draw-downs were high in the third and fourth week of March and started to level out in early April. So, I think, we saw the peak already occurring. You broke up a little bit on your first question. What was the question around December 31st? Rahul Patil : Yes. So basically, I was just looking at your LCR disclosures where it seems like you were assuming, $18 billion to $19 billion of draw-downs over a 30-day stress period. And I'm just wondering, like what sort of stress scenario were you assuming in your LCR disclosures and how does that compare with the scenario that you're seeing today? Terry Dolan : Yes. So, there's actually two different tests, there's LCR and there's kind of a liquidity stress test. And with respect to liquidity stress tests, the coverage ratios which aren't disclosed are much higher than the LCR itself. So, under a stress scenario, we have the liquidity and the ability to be able to manage that very effectively. In terms of liquidity today, right now, we have about $40 billion of cash that we're maintaining that's kind of what we're targeting. And we have substantial kind of off-balance sheet liquidity, whether that is through a variety of different lines and sources. And then, within the investment portfolio, there is probably realistically about another $20 billion that we could draw down if we had to. So from a liquidity perspective, even under a pretty significant stress, we feel pretty comfortable. Rahul Patil : Okay. Thank you. Terry Dolan : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of John McDonald of Autonomous. UnidentifiedAnalyst: Hi there. This is David Smith [ph] filling in for John. The figures you mentioned that you're modeling for payments, merchant down 50% to 60% for the next few quarters and big drops in CPS and RPS also. Were those stress cases or are those your base case for now that you're modeling? Terry Dolan : Well, I think it's probably base case for purposes of the second quarter, so with near term. And when I talked about stress test, it's really trying to understand if the COVID situation continues on in the third and fourth quarter, what that would look like. So, I think near term, that's kind of what we would expect until businesses start to recover and consumers kind of get back to full employment, so to speak. Jen Thompson : Operator, do we have any other callers on the line? Operator : There are no further questioners in queue. Jen Thompson : Okay, great. Thank you for listening to our call today. If you have any other questions, please contact Investor Relations. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Following a review of the results by Andy Cecere, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Terry Dolan, Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 12 p.m. Eastern through Wednesday, July 22 at 12 midnight Eastern. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jen Thompson, Director of Investor Relations and Economic Analysis for U.S. Bancorp. Jen Thompson : Thank you, Matis and good morning everyone. With me today are Andy Cecere, our Chairman, President and CEO and Terry Dolan, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us on the call today are our Chief Risk Officer, Jodi Richard and our Chief Credit Officer, Mark Runkel. During their prepared remarks, Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today\u2019s call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today\u2019s presentation in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Andy. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Jen and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry, Jodi, Mark and I will take any questions you have. I will begin on Slide 3. In the second quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.41. Consistent with the industry, our performance is being impacted by the current economic environment. Loan growth reflected the impact of defensive draws by corporations in March and early April, strong mortgage loan growth, and the impact of the Paycheck Protection Program, which supported small businesses impacted by the COVID-19 situation. Increased liquidity in the financial system and a flight to quality drove strong deposit growth in the quarter. Our healthy fee income growth this quarter is a testament to our diversified business model. Some fee lines, including our payments businesses, were negatively impacted by slower economic activity. However, we saw very strong growth in our mortgage and commercial products businesses. And while consumer spend activity remains pressured compared with a year ago, volume trends in each of our payments businesses have improved as some economies have started to reopen. Expenses were held relatively flat compared with the first quarter. We continue to manage our cost structure prudently and in line with the slower revenue growth environment. Credit quality metrics in the second quarter reflected increased economic stress offset by the beneficial impact of governance stimulus and forbearance and deferral programs. During the quarter, we increased our allowance for loan losses in response to economic conditions. We believe our reserve level at June 30 is appropriate based on the information we have available. Changes in the allowance will be dependent on actual credit performance and changes in economic conditions. In the lower right quadrant of this slide, you can see that book value per share grew 2.8% compared with a year ago and we remain well capitalized. Slide 4 provides key performance metrics. We delivered a 7.1% return on tangible common equity in the second quarter impacted by lower earnings owing to the current economic environment. Slide 5 shows our continually improving digital uptake trends. Shelter-in-place orders early in the quarter and temporary branch closures due to the COVID-19 have increased an increase in digital adoptions. Digital now accounts for more than three quarters of all service transactions and about 46% of all loan sales. We expect digital adoption by customers to stick even after the economy fully reopens. Now, let me turn over to Terry who will provide more color on the quarter. Terry Dolan : Thanks, Andy. If you turn to Slide 6, I will start with the balance sheet review followed by a discussion of second quarter earnings trends. Average loans grew 6.9% on a linked-quarter basis and increased 10.0% year-over-year. Growth includes $7.3 billion of loans made under the SBA\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program during the second quarter. The average loan size to these small businesses was approximately $73,000. Excluding the impact of PPP, average loans grew 5.4% on a linked quarter basis and 8.5% year-over-year. Excluding PPP, linked quarter growth was primarily driven by growth in commercial loans and in mortgage loans. In late first quarter, business customers drew down their lines to support business activity and future liquidity requirements. We started to see pay-downs of commercial loans in May and the paydown activity accelerated in June as many customers access the capital markets. As of last week, about two-thirds of the defensive draws we saw in the late first quarter and early second quarter have been repaid. Strong residential mortgage growth reflected the low interest rate environment. Credit card balances declined in the quarter due to lower spend activity. Turning to Slide 7, average deposits increased 11.2% on a linked quarter basis and grew 16.8% year-over-year. Average non-interest-bearing deposits increased 30.1% year-over-year driven by corporate and commercial banking, consumer and business banking, and wealth management and investment services. Turning to Slide 8, while the net charge-off ratio was relatively stable on a linked quarter basis, non-performing assets increased 24% sequentially, reflecting increased economic stress. The non-performing assets to loans plus other real estate owned ratio totaled 0.38% at June 30 compared with 0.30% at March 31. We have taken a proactive approach in evaluating credit quality across the entire commercial loan portfolio and considered risk rating changes in the evaluation of our allowance for credit losses. Our loan loss provision was $1.7 billion in the second quarter, inclusive of $437 million of net charge-offs and a reserve build of $1.3 billion. The increase in the reserve was related to changes in risk ratings and deterioration in economic conditions driven by the impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. global economies and our expectation that credit losses and non-performing assets will increase from current levels. The increase in the allowance for credit loss is considered our best estimate of the impact of slower economic growth and elevated unemployment partially offset by the benefits of government stimulus programs as of June 30. While estimates are based on many quantitative factors and qualitative judgments, our base case outlook assumes an unemployment rate of 13% to 14% for the second quarter, declining to 9.0% in the fourth quarter of 2020 and to 7.8% by the fourth quarter of 2021. Slide 9 highlights our key underwriting metrics and exposures to certain at-risk segments given the current environment. We have a strong relationship-based credit culture at U.S. Bank, supported by cash-flow-based lending that considers sensitivity to stress, proactive management, and portfolio diversification, which allows us to support growth throughout the economic cycle and produces consistent results. Slide 10 provides an earnings summary. In the second quarter of 2020, we reported $0.41 per share. These results were adversely affected by the current economic environment and the related impact to consumer and business spend and the expected increases in credit losses. Turning to Slide 11, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis of $3.2 billion was essentially flat compared with the first quarter in line with our expectations as the impact of lower interest rates was partially offset by deposit and funding mix and loan growth. Also as expected, the net interest margin declined by 29 basis points compared with the first quarter. The lower margin reflected lower rates and a flatter yield curve as well as higher cash balance of being maintained for liquidity to accommodate customer demand. While loan mix put pressure on the net interest margin, the earning asset impact was mostly offset by beneficial shifts in deposit and funding mix. Slide 12 highlights trends in non-interest income. Strength in mortgage banking and commercial product revenue more than offset declines in the payment revenues. Mortgage banking revenue benefited from higher mortgage production and stronger gain-on-sale margins partially offset by the net impact of change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights and related hedging activity. Commercial product revenue reflected higher corporate bond issuance fees and trading revenue. Slide 13 provides information about our payment service businesses, including exposures to impacted industries. Payments revenues were pressured \u2013 was pressured by the impact of COVID-related shutdowns and reduced economic activity in the quarter. However, consumer sales trends improved throughout the quarter and that trajectory has continued in early July. Credit and debit card revenue declined 22.2% year-over-year and merchant processing services revenue declined 34.2% year-over-year, both categories performing somewhat better than what we had expected. Corporate payment products revenue declined 39.5% year-over-year in line with our expectations as business spending continues to reflect cautious sentiment. Slide 14 \u2013 turning to Slide 14, non-interest expense was essentially flat on a linked quarter basis in line with our expectations. Second quarter expense reflected an increase in revenue related costs from mortgage and capital markets production and expense related to COVID-19 situation. During the quarter, we incurred incremental COVID-19 related costs of approximately $66 million. These expenses consisted of about $30 million related to increasing liabilities for potential future delivery claims related to the airline industry and other merchants and about $50 million related to premium pay for frontline workers and costs tied to providing a safe working environment for our employees. We expect these incremental COVID expenses to begin to dissipate in the second half of the year. Slide 15 highlights our capital position. At June 30, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio calculated in accordance with transitional regulatory capital requirements related to the current expected credit loss methodology implementation was 9.0% at June 30. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, reflecting the full implementation of the current expected credit loss accounting methodology was 8.7%. I will now provide some forward-looking guidance. For the third quarter of 2020, we expect fully taxable equivalent net interest income to be relatively flat compared to the second quarter. We expect mortgage revenue to continue to be strong on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter, but it is likely to decline compared with the second quarter reflecting slower refinancing activity for the industry. Payments revenue is likely to be adversely affected through the remainder of the year on a year-over-year basis due to reduced consumer and business spending activity. However, we expect continued gradual improvements in sales volumes. We expect non-interest expenses to be relatively stable compared to the second quarter. Future levels of reserve build will depend on a number of factors, including changes in the outlook for credit quality, reflecting both economic conditions and portfolio performance and any beneficial offset from government stimulus. We will continue to assess the allowance \u2013 the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses as credit conditions change. For the full year 2020, we expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately 15%. I will hand it back to Andy for closing remarks. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Terry. I will end my remarks on Slide 16, which highlights a few of the recent actions we have taken as a company to help support our customers, communities and employees. We are operating in uncertain times, not only for the economy, but for our society in general. However, I am confident that together we can make lasting and impactful changes that will leave us all better on the other side of each trying times. We are well positioned for near-term challenges and we continue to manage this company with the long-term lens and focus on maximizing shareholder value. Our capital and liquidity positions are strong and our unique business model remains a differentiator for us. I would highlight three things that will continue to support our ability to deliver industry leading returns through the cycle. First, as our second quarter results indicate, our diversified business mix reduces revenue and earnings volatility. And this quarter it allowed us to deliver good revenue growth even against the challenging interest rate backdrop and an industry-wide slowdown in consumer spending activity. Second, our time-tested credit underwriting discipline puts us in a strong position to navigate through an economic downturn, while setting us up to return to prudent and consistent growth in the more favorable economic environment. And third, our culture remains the foundation which informs not only what we do at U.S. Bank, but how we do it. I couldn\u2019t be more proud of our employees have come together to support our customers and communities and they faced significant economic and social disruption. I want to take this opportunity to thank them for all their hard work and resiliency. We will now open up the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Scott. Scott Siefers : Good morning, guys. Hey, thank you for taking the question. Let\u2019s say, I guess, Terry, a question for you just on, you gave the NII expectations for the third quarter, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the sort of the puts and takes, meaning balance sheet growth and where you would see the margin trajecting from here? Terry Dolan : Yes. From a loan perspective, again, we would expect that we will see year-over-year growth, but on a linked quarter basis, clearly, it\u2019s going to be down. We are going to continue to see pay-downs associated with those defensive draws that we had at the end of the first quarter and early second quarter. So, that will put downward pressure on a linked quarter basis. PPP will actually, probably help from a growth standpoint as we think about second quarter, but it does start to dissipate in third quarter and fourth quarter simply because of the loan forgiveness program. So, on the consumer side, auto lending has generally been a little bit. It was weak in April and May, but it\u2019s gotten stronger in June. So, we believe that, that\u2019s going to be a bright spot as we think about the third quarter, but overall consumer lending is likely to be down simply because consumer spending has been down, so that\u2019s kind of the puts and takes you think about loan growth. Margin, we believe is going to be relatively stable. It will be helped a little bit by PPP, but impacted a little bit, there will be a little bit of pressure on the yield curve side of the equation, but relatively stable to the second quarter. Scott Siefers : Okay, perfect. Thank you. And then just given the absolute level of interest rates, do fee waivers start to become an issue for in the money market area, and if I recall correctly from the last time rates were this. I think those show up in trust fees if they are sort of something you guys are thinking about where would they show up and what\u2019s kind of the impact you guys would see? Terry Dolan : Yes. I think the impact would be probably similar to what we saw last time given, but it will maybe a little bit more simple because of growth, but it will show up in trust and investment management fees, because that\u2019s where our money market fund revenue gets recognized. Scott Siefers : Okay. Alright, perfect. Thank you guys very much. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. Just to clarify on the net interest income outlook of stable quarter-to-quarter, does that include some of the kind of benefit from PPP repaying or forbearing and if so what are your assumptions on that in terms of the next couple of quarters? Terry Dolan : Yes. So, it includes all the puts and takes. Like I said, it will reflect a decline on a linked-quarter basis in terms of commercial loans because of the draws, but there will be some benefit associated with PPP. So, it includes essentially all the puts and takes associated with net interest income. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then I am wondering on the PPP, it seems like your kind of approach was more granular or to go after kind of smaller really the small, small businesses if I just look at your total amount funded versus applications. And just wondering if you could talk to that approach and maybe give us some insight in terms of the cost that you have incurred to originate those loans? Andy Cecere : Matt, this is Andy. We took the applications as they came in serving our customers initially, and then ultimately outside of the bank. As you saw, we had over 101,000 applications and the average balance was in the 70,000. So, a lot of our customers are small business and we helped a lot of employees. So, the team did a great job. We started with a bit of a manual process and went to a much more automated process certainly in the second round. So, it was just based on the request that came in and the priority was really time based. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then just the cost to originate, was it just kind of moving resources from one part of the bank to another or? Andy Cecere : Yes, yes it was, Matt. We actually had individuals from throughout the entire company help us through this process, particularly the manual process that started and the technology as well, but yes the entire bank was supportive. Matt O'Connor: Okay, thank you. Andy Cecere : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Saul Martinez : Hey, guys. Good morning. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Saul. Saul Martinez : Hey, good morning. I wanted to drill down a little bit on your comments, Terry, on the payments business and sort of a gradual improvement there. I guess, first of all, could you just give us a little bit of a sense for the \u2013 how much the consumer recovered and then they seemed like in June the year-on-year declines in acquiring volumes and card volumes is really, really lessened, but can you just give us a sense of what say the exit rates were in terms of volumes in those categories in June versus March? And I guess as an adjunct to that, why wouldn\u2019t that suggest that at least sequentially you should see pretty sharp improvements in terms of the sequential growth in issuing and acquiring revenue versus release versus the second quarter. Obviously year-on-year is tough, but versus the second quarter, it would seem to suggest that you could see a nice improvement sequentially and I just wanted to get your sense as to whether I am thinking about that right? Terry Dolan : Yes, Saul, I think you are right on. I think we end up looking at our payments business on a sequential basis. You know we will see growth, particularly in the credit card and the merchant, the corporate payments we would also expect growth, but maybe not at the same level, simply because the sales volumes there, our commercial spend, our commercial customers are still fairly cautious, but kind of give you some perspective at the end of \u2013 or in April, we saw on the merchant side of the equation, consumer spend was down almost between 50% and 55% kind of in that ballpark and today it\u2019s really back to spend levels that are closer to about 20%. So that has come back really very nicely. The things that are going to continue to impact for a while is the mix associated with the airline industry and some of the entertainment, but it has come back very nice. Your point on sequential growth is right on. With respect to credit card, credit card we have said was down kind of in that 30% range in April. And that has come back nicely as well. In terms of credit card, it is still down. It\u2019s down around 10% to 12%. We would expect that trajectory to continue so \u2013 into the third quarter. Debit card revenue or sales, excuse me, actually have been pretty strong and the sales on the debit card side has been kind of up 10% to 12% kind of in that range. And while we wouldn\u2019t expect it to be maybe quite at that higher level in the third quarter is still I think going to be relatively strong. And then on the CPS side of the equation, CPS, again, the commercial spend has been pretty cautious. It was down kind of in the magnitude of 30% to 35% in that April sort of timeframe. And it\u2019s still down around somewhere between 25% and 30%. We do expect it to get a little better than that in the third quarter for a couple of reasons, simply because government spend tends to be strongest in the third quarter. So hopefully, that gives you some insights or perspective. Saul Martinez : Yes, that\u2019s super helpful. If I could squeeze another one in on the fees, the deposit service charge is obviously down a lot and you commented about fee waivers related to customer, related to COVID. I mean how do we think about that going forward and I don\u2019t know if you can quantify that or how do we or just give us a sense of how that I think $133 million, how that could compare to maybe a more normalized level in the coming quarters? Terry Dolan : Yes, similar sort of impacts as consumer spend and just activity has declined and then you have the stimulus checks and all sorts of different types of things just incidence levels related to NSF and fee waivers in terms of helping our customers has impacted the second quarter. On a sequential basis, we would expect that will come back nicely in the third quarter, but on a year-over-year basis, it\u2019s still going to be down simply because consumer activity is down similar to merchant or credit card. Saul Martinez : So, it will take some time to get back to that sort of a more normalized or what was a more normalized level I guess? Terry Dolan : Yes, that\u2019s right. Saul Martinez : Alright, alright. Awesome. Thank you very much. Terry Dolan : Yes, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Erika. Erika Najarian : My first question is on the reserve and this is a question that all your peers have been getting during this earnings season. So, I always like to think in the CECL world that your reserve to loan ratio of 2.54% represents a cumulative loss rate for the recession that represents, let\u2019s say, 2 years? And I guess the question here is that, is that your view? I guess, it\u2019s another way of asking, are you done in terms of reserve building? And related to that, your peers have also talked about the base case, but that the base case tends to be one of, let's say, five or so different scenarios and those scenarios are weighted. And so I am wondering if you could give us some insight in terms of as you have had built your reserve, how much weight that base case was taken to account versus perhaps other scenarios? Terry Dolan : Yes. So, let me take the first question. And when we think about the reserving, you are absolutely right, you make your estimates at the end of any particular quarter based upon the information that you have available at that particular point in time and not certainly at June 30. We believe that the reserve is appropriate for the cumulative losses that are there. So, we wouldn\u2019t expect future increases in the reserve, but again, that is going to be highly dependent upon what changes either in terms of economic factors or if our credit quality changes differently than what we had expected. So, the important thing is that we are going to continue to assess the reserve every quarter based upon the information that we have available to us, but you are right, theoretically that is how CECL works and that\u2019s how we are trying to apply it. Coming to your second question, the information that I ended up giving to you with respect to unemployment now, keep in mind, unemployment is an important factor, but there is like 200 different multiples that are part of the modeling process. So, it\u2019s pretty complex, because you got a lot of different types of portfolios, etcetera. But unemployment, the information I gave you was really the weighted average across many different multiple scenarios that we ended up looking at. So, you are right, when we look at this, we look at information from many sources in terms of things like unemployment, GDP, etcetera, etcetera. We develop a base case if you will, but then we look at multiple scenarios around that base case and weighted. But the information that I gave you was weighted based upon those multiples. So, it should give you some comparability when you think about that. Andy, you have anything to add? Andy Cecere : No, you have said it well. Erika Najarian : Got it. And my second \u2013 my follow-up question is to Andy. So, Andy, I think what was particularly impressive about this quarter is your PPNR resiliency. And obviously, the forward look would imply that this will continue. And Terry just told us that we could be done in terms of reserve building. As we think about the future and as we think about a more difficult operating environment for banks, how are you thinking about inorganic growth strategies from here? Andy Cecere : Well, Erika, first, as you mentioned, I think our diversified revenue mix helps a lot. This is a \u2013 this quarter probably represented it very well. We had some pressure on payments, because of the spend activity that Terry talked about. But mortgage and commercial products had \u2013 it hit it out of the park this quarter in terms of positive so. And then the other part of a diversification is how much of our revenue comes from the balance sheet or net interest income as well as fee revenue sort of a mix back, 50-50 there. So, that really helps in environments like this and different businesses do well in different economic cycles. As we think about the future, I think we are planning for a future that has continued lower rates. It will take a while for spend to get back to normal. So we are going to manage our expenses in that \u2013 with that thought in mind, which is what we are doing today. And we are going to continue to invest in the businesses that have opportunity as well as the digital initiatives I talked about. And those digital initiatives will offer not only the opportunity for our customers to connect with us in virtual means I think it will also offer expense opportunities in the long run. So, those are the ways we are thinking about it. Erika Najarian : And just any thoughts on inorganic strategies acquisition? Andy Cecere : Yes. Erika Najarian : I think you say it more importantly? Andy Cecere : Yes. Thanks for being one. So, we will look at opportunities have come up. The only thing I would say is in this environment, Erika, there is a lot of uncertainty and it\u2019s certainly not a clear vision in terms of the future even for us. So, to look at someone else with that lens will be challenging, but I do think opportunities will come up because of the stresses that are out there and we will take a look. Erika Najarian : Okay, thank you. Andy Cecere : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Andy Cecere : Hey. Mike. Terry Dolan : Hey, Mike. Mike Mayo : Hi. Just I want to challenge \u2013 look, you are one of the most conservative banks, but I want to challenge some of your conservatism So, on the \u2013 your base case, again, 9% unemployment by the end of this year, I know it\u2019s a lot of scenarios and it\u2019s weighted average and all that, but at least one of your peers was more conservative than that. And I know that\u2019s the Fed base case. So there is nothing crazy about it. It\u2019s just, I thought, why not be more conservative if you have the flexibility or when you take the weighted average or the different scenarios, I am pushing back a little bit more like this seems like peak reserve builds and you said that, but if your economic assumptions are wrong, then that won\u2019t be the case. So, why not be more conservative there? And along those lines, your payments comment that it should improve sequentially kind of makes sense. But look, we just had a big increase in COVID cases, which leads to more deaths, which leads to some closing down and how are you feeling about that progression? Terry Dolan : Yes. So maybe to address the first question, when you end up establishing the reserve, you have to establish what you believe is appropriate based upon the information that you have available to us. And you know what we use things like Moody\u2019s Analytics and other sources in order to kind of come up with that projection of what unemployment as an example looks like. So, you have to make sure that that your reserve is appropriate based upon the information that you have. You can\u2019t build in tons of conservatism so to speak into it. But again, part of it is we will have kind of wait and see on the payment side of the equation in terms of COVID cases. Based upon our estimates, right now, I think that this go round versus last go around, I think that states are continuing to try to stay open to the best that they can. I think you have different sort of health treatments and all sorts of different things that exist based upon better information or different information than what existed before, but quite honestly, it\u2019s we are going to find out. There is a lot of uncertainty and it\u2019s too early to know. Andy Cecere : Yes, and I\u2019d add on. Mike, I think you are right, things are changing every day and the facts change daily, weekly sometimes hourly. So, we are just going to continue to assess and manage the company given the changes that are out there. What Terry is telling you what he is seeing right now. And as he said, we get data everyday and we are going to continue to assess what we think is going to happen. We are running a lot of models. We are sharing with our board a lot of scenarios, including a much harsher scenario and understanding what would occur in that. So but you are right I mean there is a lot of unknown yet and we are being conservative in the way we are approaching our financial modeling. Mike Mayo : And then one follow-up question look your third slide of substance at Slide A5, but the digital engagement trends, I mean you are certainly putting that front and center, can you bring us up to date like as of like to the moment of what\u2019s happening with your digital engagement and what does that mean in terms of branches and national expansion and anything else, because if you are putting this as your third slide in your earnings deck, it\u2019s clearly \u2013 I know it\u2019s always been important, but it seems like it\u2019s \u2013 now it\u2019s being put on steroids in terms of the way you are highlighting this, which must be in some bigger part of the strategy? Terry Dolan : So, Mike, it has always been important, but I do think the recent events and the customer behavior changes, has even accelerated that further. And you can see that in the numbers, nearly 80% of transactions now occurring in a digital fashion. The branch activity as far as transactions is down a lot. In the sales side, I talked about the loan sales. But actually, total sales in the branches have doubled since you are, excuse me on a digital platform have doubled versus a year ago. And so we do expect those digital investments both do it yourself and do it together in other words co-browsing or virtual activity is going to continue to be important not just for the consumer, but across many business lines. So that investment that we are making is important on two fronts. It\u2019s important to make sure we are giving the customer the best experience in connecting with them in the ways they choose to and it\u2019s also offering efficiencies in long run. As we talked about, we announced over a year ago that we expect to have 10% to 15% fewer branches. And I would expect that number to increase in terms of the number of fewer branches that we have, because of this changing customer behavior. Branches will still be important, but the number of them and the size of them will be fewer and less. Mike Mayo : Any number on those branches, the updated number? Terry Dolan : We don\u2019t have a number. Yes, we continue to assess and as we think about the changes that are occurring and the closures that are out there will continue to assess what we expect, but I do expect it to be higher than the 10% to 15%. Mike Mayo : Okay, thank you. Terry Dolan : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Long with Raymond James. Terry Dolan : Good morning, David. David Long : Good morning, everyone. Going back to the Paycheck Protection Program, we talked a little bit about the expectations for forgiveness there, but do you have a timeline on where you think your $7 plus billion in PPP loans may start to be forgiven? Terry Dolan : Yes. Well, we do expect that there is going to be some forgiveness that\u2019s going to take place as early as the third quarter. So there is going to be some run-off of the balances just because of that. I think the vast majority of it happens late third fourth and early first quarter in terms of timing. That\u2019s our expectation right now. David Long : Got it, okay. And then on the deposit side obviously very good deposit growth there, how do you see the trajectory of that playing out taking into consideration the PPP and all liquidity that\u2019s built in now and how does that impact the size of the balance sheet through the rest of the year? Terry Dolan : Yes. Our expectation is that deposit growth is going to continue to be strong at least through the end of the year, if not into early next year and it\u2019s really high correlated to the amount of liquidity that the Fed is continuing to pump into the system. The impacts from a balance sheet perspective is I think certainly have a funding benefit associated with that. The challenges I was trying to identify, if you get the loan growth great, if you don\u2019t, you are going to have to look for opportunities on the investment side of the question so, but we do expect strong growth in deposits in the foreseeable future, because of the fed programs. David Long : Got it. Thank you. Terry Dolan : Thanks, David. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hi, hey guys. Hey, good morning. Just one question on the expense side, obviously much stronger than expected revenues especially at a mortgage, but noting that you are talking about some of the COVID costs coming off and that even some of the like costs I would think incentive-related costs type of stuff like mortgage will be softer sequentially. You are still talking about flattish expenses sequentially. And can you \u2013 I was wondering if maybe you can kind of put that in context with some of the broader reaching comments you just made about the future of the expense base in terms of why you would only expect to see flat expenses sequentially? Thanks. Terry Dolan : Yes. The areas that we are going to see growth or not, I mean, on a sequential basis, I do think you are going to see revenue related sort of expenses coming down that you will see COVID-related expenses coming down. There is still going to be a fairly significant amount of PPP and cost associated with all sorts of things that will end up happening in the third quarter. The other thing that I think that ends up coming into play is just timing with respect to, for example, other loan expenses when they end up getting recognized relative to the mortgage production that occurred. So, we recognized revenue in the quarter in which the application is taken unlocked, but lot of the expenses end up happening in the quarter that\u2019s following that simply because of the timing of closing loans and that sort of thing. So, that\u2019s a big driver that ends up impacting the sequential growth from second quarter to third quarter that you have to keep in mind? Ken Usdin : Okay. And a follow-up on the money market fee waivers, you had mentioned earlier that you would expect them to be larger than last time, can you put that into numeric context for us, how much were you waiving either on an annual basis or at peak through the last cycle and how is the asset management complex differ in terms of mix today versus then? Thanks. Terry Dolan : Yes. In terms of the mix of the product that we end up offering, I think there is probably a more government or govy based sort of money market as opposed to prime base. The prime base declined fairly significantly. But the overall \u2013 when you end up looking at assets under management, it certainly were at a higher level today than 10 years ago. That\u2019s the reason. I think that the rate of the fee waivers will be pretty similar, but just the assets under management in the wealth management phase is higher. And I am trying to put my fingers on kind of what that looks like right now, but we certainly can kind of get back to you, Ken. Ken Usdin : Okay, thanks a lot. I will follow-up. Andy Cecere : Terry, I think fee waivers will \u2013 when they are implemented we will be somewhere in that $30 million a quarter range plus or minus. Terry Dolan : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of the Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Vivek. Vivek Juneja : Hi, thanks. Thank you for taking the questions. Couple of ones. Firstly, on credit cards, can you give us the reserves to cards and also what are you seeing in terms of card customers, where deferrals are coming off? Have you started to see deferrals come off and what\u2019s the reaction been in terms of customers paying the full amount or asking to extend the deferrals? Andy Cecere : Thanks, Vivek. I am going to ask Mark Runkel, our Chief Credit Officer to respond to that. Mark? Mark Runkel : Yes. The reserve ratio on the credit card was 10.14% at the end of June. That\u2019s question number one. The second in terms of those customers that have come off some of the programs that we have got in place we have seen very strong payment performance today. About 70% of those customers have started to make normal payments after those periods of time. We have seen a few of those about 20% reenroll and then the rest has moved into delinquency, so so far, so good on customer performance. Vivek Juneja : Okay. That\u2019s great. Terry, if I may sneak in one for you. Other income, I know it had a lot of noise this quarter, what would you suggest as a run-rate for us to use? Terry Dolan : Yes. So if you kind of think about the \u2013 when I end up looking at the current run-rate just given the environment that we are in, Vivek, I would end up looking at second quarter is a pretty good estimate of what future quarters are going to look like at least for a while. Vivek Juneja : Meaning at this $130 million that you had? Terry Dolan : Yes, yes. Vivek Juneja : Yes, okay. Yes. Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Gerard? Gerard Cassidy : Hi. Andy. How are you? Hi, Terry. Andy, we have seen some real crosscurrents in economic information, for example, the Empire State Manufacturing Index came out today positive first time since February and industrial production coming a little better today as well. But on the other hand, the initial unemployment claims numbers remained very elevated. What are your customers when you talk to your customers and they understand the restaurants and the leisure guys are still feeling a lot of pain but can you give us some color on what are your commercial customers telling you? What are they seeing? Andy Cecere : Yes. So first, you are absolutely right. There are some mixed signals. And I think the mixed signals is sort of the competing factors of distress in the economy from the shutdown offset by the stimulus that\u2019s occurring across many categories, unemployment benefits, the stimulus checks, PPP, all those things. And those are competing forces which makes modeling and projecting very difficult in this environment. I would say small businesses are struggling the most for a lot of different reasons, principally because they have less cushion than the larger companies. The larger companies as Terry mentioned, initially they were very defensive drawing down in excess of $22 billion, but about two-thirds of that is paid back. So while certain industries continue to be stressed, you\u2019re seeing under industries that are actually doing a little bit better in this environment, so small, challenged; middle and large, mixed; some doing well and some not so much. Terry, would you add a remark? Terry Dolan : No, I think that\u2019s well said, I mean, I think it\u2019s right. Gerard Cassidy : And then as a follow-up, in the reserving, in the provisioning you guys did this quarter, I know you mentioned there is a lot of moving parts as you just touched on it, Andy. But how much would you say the provisioning was allocated to specific credits that you\u2019re now starting to see obviously distressed versus just building up the general reserves? Andy Cecere : Yes, I mean I will have Mark kind of add to this. But certainly when we end up looking at net charge-offs and things like that there hasn\u2019t been a lot of movement, especially on the consumer side of the equation. We are starting to see non-performing assets on commercial starting to grow, as we talked about, but it\u2019s still, what I would say, relatively early. I think the government stimulus programs and things like that have kind of at least for some period of time muted some of those underlying credit characteristics that you typically see. More of it or most of it is really driven based upon kind of our outlook when we think about the economic conditions going forward. And then at the end of, looking at kind of split between products, it\u2019s probably more heavily weighted 60% plus of the reserve build really more focused on wholesale and commercial real estate as opposed to consumer at this particular point. Mark what would you add? Mark Runkel : The only thing I might add is, you mentioned this in the early comments we have gone through the portfolio very granular and downgraded the credits appropriately. So we feel like all of that has been factored into the analysis. But the bulk of our change is really the economic assumptions as Terry noted. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Andy Cecere : Hey, Ken. Coming back to your question on fee waivers, the impact second to third quarter was a sequential basis of fee waivers. So we have about $30 million in that ballpark. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of David Smith with Autonomous. David Smith : Good morning. Thank you for taking the call. Andy Cecere : Good morning. David Smith : Just to clarify on the expense guidance; 3Q stable to 2Q relatively, does that include the COVID expenses in 2Q? Andy Cecere : Yes it\u2019s total expenses, it is all inclusive. And again we will see benefit of COVID coming down, but some of those production-type costs that I talked about earlier going up. David Smith : Thank you. And also, any, any particular color you could give on the jump in non-performing loans and commercial real estate? Andy Cecere : Mark? Mark Runkel : Yes, I would just say they are really focused in on a couple of different industries that we have highlighted. One is on the commercial side is really heavily energy and the retail sector. And then on the commercial real estate it\u2019s going to be some of the retail related exposure as well. It\u2019s coming off a very low point as you note, but those are the industries that have been most impacted today. David Smith : Alright, thank you so much. Operator : At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks. Jen Thompson : Thank you everyone for listening to our earnings call. Please contact the Investor Relations Department if you have any follow-up questions. Operator : Thank you for participating in today\u2019s teleconference. You may now all disconnect.",

Following a review of the results by Andy Cecere, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Terry Dolan, Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 12 :00 o'clock PM Eastern Time, through Wednesday, October 21, at 12 o'clock Midnight Eastern. I will now turn the conference over to Jen Thompson, Director of Investor Relations and Economic Analysis for U.S. Bancorp. Jen Thompson : Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone. With me today are Andy Cecere, our Chairman, President and CEO; and Terry Dolan, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us on the call are our Chief Risk Officer, Jodi Richard and our Chief Credit Officer, Mark Runkel. During their prepared remarks, Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today\u2019s call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today\u2019s presentation in our press release, and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Andy. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Jen, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry, Jodi, Mark and I will take any questions you have. I\u2019ll begin on Slide 3. In the third quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.99. Our revenue of $6 billion was higher in both our linked quarter and year-over-year basis, driven by strong fee income performance across a number of business lines. Credit quality metrics deteriorated in line with our expectations, primarily reflecting more challenging operating conditions for some commercial sectors impacted by COVID-19. However, our reserve build in the third quarter was limited to the addition related to our acquisition of $1.2 billion of credit card loans from State Farm. Our capital and liquidity positions remained strong and our deposit mix improved in the third quarter, as demand deposits increased sharply while higher cost time deposits declined. The bottom right quadrant of this slide shows our strong capital position. At September 30, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 9.4%. Slide 4 provides key performance metrics. In the third quarter, we delivered 16.6% return on tangible common equity. Slide 5 shows steady improvement in digital activities. Notably, digital sales now account for more than half of all loan sales, highlighting how our business investments are supporting our customers\u2019 evolving behavior. Digital remains a focused investment area for us and its more activity moves to the digital channel that will drive customer loyalty and topline growth, as well as cost savings and efficiency opportunities. Now let me turn the call over to Terry, who will provide more color on the quarter. Terry Dolan : Thank, Andy. If you turn to Slide 6, I'll start with the balance sheet review followed by a discussion of third quarter earnings trends. Average loans declined 2.2% compared with the second quarter. In early July, we added $1.2 billion in credit card loans, required as part of our new alliance with State Farm. Additionally, loans made under the SBA Paycheck Protection Program increased by $2.8 billion on average in the quarter. Excluding the State Farm and PPP loans, average loans declined by 3.5%, as strong residential mortgage growth was more than offset by the impact of pay downs in the C&I portfolio, given strong capital market activities during the third quarter. Turning to Slide 7, average deposits increased 0.6% compared with the second quarter, and the overall deposit mix continues to be favorable. Our non-interest bearing deposits grew 15.0%, while the time deposits declined 21.7%. In early October, we closed on the acquisition of $10 billion of deposits from State Farm, which will add to deposit balances and increase liquidity in the fourth quarter. Turning the Slide 8, as expected under the current economic environment, credit quality deteriorated in the third quarter. Our net charge-off ratio was 0.66% in the third quarter, up 11 basis points compared with the second quarter, as higher losses in our commercial and commercial real estate portfolios were partially offset by lower credit card and total other retail net charge-offs. The ratio of non-performing assets to loans and other real estate was 0.41% at the end of the third quarter, compared with 0.38% at the end of the second quarter. Our loan loss provision was $635 million in the third quarter. The provision amount included a $120 million related to the credit card loans acquired from State Farm at the beginning of the quarter. Our allowance for credit losses as of September 30, totaled $8.0 billion or 2.61% of loans. The allowance level reflected our best estimates of the impact of slower economic growth and elevated unemployment, partially offset by the consideration of benefits of government stimulus programs. While estimates are based on many quantitative factors and qualitative judgments, our base case outlook assumes an unemployment rate of 8.9% for the third quarter, increasing slightly to 9.1% in the fourth quarter of 2020, before declining somewhat to 7.8% by the fourth quarter of 2021. Slide 9 highlights our key underwriting metrics and loan loss allowance breakdown by loan category. We have a strong relationship based credit culture at U.S. banks, supported by cash flow based lending, that considers sensitivity to stress, proactive management and portfolio diversification, which allows us to support growth throughout the economic cycle and produces consistent results. Turning to Slide 10, exposures to certain at risk segments and given the current environment are stable compared with the second quarter. The top left table shows that the volume of payment relief has declined meaningfully since the second quarter. New requests have reached a steady states and peaking in April. Slide 11 provides an earnings summary. In the third quarter of 2020, we earned $0.99 per diluted share. Turning to Slide 12, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis of $3.3 billion was up 0.9%, compared with the second quarter as a 5 basis point increase in our net interest margin offset the impact of a decrease in loan volume. The increase in the net interest margin was driven by lower cash balances. We expect cash balances to increase in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the recent acquisition of the deposits from State Farm. Slide 13 highlights trends in non-interest income, strength in mortgage banking and commercial product revenue drove the year-over-year increase, while linked quarter growth reflected higher payments revenue and deposits service charges, as consumer spend activity continue to recover from second quarter lows. Slide 14 provides information about our payment services business lines, including exposures to the impacted industries. Year-over-year payments revenue was pressured by reduced consumer spend compared with pre-COVID levels. However, consumer sales trends improved throughout the quarter as state and local economies continue to improve and spend activity increased. In the third quarter, credit and debit card revenue benefited from the processing of state unemployment distribution programs that utilize our prepaid cards. We expect this activity to moderate in the fourth quarter. Over the long-term payments revenues are closely tied to spend activity and the resultant sales volume trends. Turning to Slide 15, non-interest expenses increased 7.2% on a year-over-year basis, driven by higher costs related to the pre-card business, COVID-19-related expenses and higher revenue related costs from mortgage and capital markets production. On a linked quarter basis, non-interest expenses increased 1.6%. Relative to our expectations, we saw an increase in medical claims expenses, as employees regained access to medical services following the stay-at-home orders, and higher revenue related costs tied to the mortgage and capital markets activities and most notably, higher prepaid card processing activities. Slide 16 highlights our capital position, our common equity tier 1 capital ratio at September 30 was 9.4%. I'll now provide some forward-looking guidance. For the fourth quarter of 2020, we expect fully taxable equivalent net interest income to be flat to down slightly. We expect mortgage revenue to decline somewhat compared to the third quarter, reflecting slower refinancing activity for the industry and seasonality. Payments revenue is likely to continue to be adversely affected on a year-over-year basis due to reduced consumer and business spend activity. We expect non-interest expenses to be relatively stable compared to the third quarter. We expect net charge-offs and non-performing assets to continue to increase from current levels reflective of economic conditions. Future levels of reserves will depend on a number of factors, including loan production, size and mix, changes in the outlook for credit quality, reflecting both economic conditions and portfolio performance, and any beneficial offset from government stimulus. We will continue to assess the adequacy of the allowance for losses as credit conditions change. For the full year of 2020, we expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately 19%. I will hand it back to Andy for closing remarks. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Terry. The economy is showing signs of recovery but consumer spending remains below pre-COVID levels. The unemployment rate is high by historical standards, and the outlook remains uncertain. However, we are well-positioned to navigate through a more challenging economic and interest rate environment. We are well reserved, well capitalized and our liquidity position is strong. We remain committed to creating long-term value for our shareholders by delivering above average returns on equity through this cycle, driven by both superior PPNR results and credit performance. Our third quarter earnings results highlights the benefits of our diversified business mix and our credit underwriting discipline. We are optimistic that we continue to win market share over time across our high return fee businesses, such as mortgage, payments and trust and investment services. We will continue to adjust our strategy as consumer preferences evolve, including adjusting our distribution network. Our alliance with State Farm, which brings our digital banking capabilities together with over 1,900 State Farm agents is an example, how we can meaningfully expand our reach in a low cost highly efficient way. Separately, about 18 months ago, we announced the branch transformation initiative aimed at better serving our customers in light of their evolving preferences. At that time, we announced that we would close 10% to 15% of our branches by early 2021. To-date, we have closed about 10%. We now plan to close an additional 15% by early 2021. The rate majority of these additional closures were branches that were impacted by COVID-19 and they will remain closed. While physical branches and personal interactions will always be important, we need fewer branches today than we did even a few years ago. And the branches of the future need to be more advice centers and locations where transactions take place. I'll conclude on Slide 17. Our culture has always been a key differentiator of the U.S. Bank story, and we remain committed to supporting our customers, our communities and our employees in the good times, as well as the more challenging times. While it has always been important to us, today there is even a greater emphasis on ensuring that we do that in a deliberately inclusive way. I want to thank our employees who bring our culture to life every day and for all their hard work throughout the year. We'll now open up the call to Q&A. Operator : Your first question is from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Good morning. Andy Cecere : Good morning, John. Terry Dolan : Hey John. John Pancari : Just on that comment regarding the branches. Is that -- can you help us think about the cost impact of the step up in the consolidation of the branches? Is that factored into your expectations on expenses? I guess, if you can kind of just elaborate on how you see expenses projecting and if this could impact your efficiency expectations? Thanks. Terry Dolan : Yes. John, great question. And when we think about expenses, our goal is especially in this environment to be able to manage expenses relatively flat. And it is one of the things that we have kind of considered or factored into that process. The cost saves associated with the branches will be important, part of that we do expect will flow to the bottom line. And part of it, we will continue to use to reinvest in our business, particularly in the digital capabilities. And as you can imagine the more we're investing in that the greater the opportunity with respect to future cost savings will come as well. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it. John Pancari : Okay. And then just one more thing on that front. Are you also -- do you also see opportunities to ratchet up corporate real estate rationalization outside of the branches? And could that be incremental savings on top of this? Terry Dolan : Yes. So we will look not only at the branches, we'll also look at our corporate real estate. One of the things that we're still kind of working through is what does the next horizon from a workforce management perspective look like, because that will obviously impact corporate real estate. But I do think that there's opportunity for us to be able to consolidate as we think about 2021. John Pancari : Okay. Thanks, Terry. And then just one more thing on the revenue side. I know that your fees definitely came in better this quarter helped by the card and processing fees. And I just want to get your thoughts on your payments revenues given just where you see payment, consumer and corporate payments, projecting through over the next several months? I know you commented on the prepaid card expectation, but wanted to get your thoughts more broadly on the payments trajectory here? Terry Dolan : Yes. So, one thing I would say is that since the second quarter we\u2019ve continued to see improvement in consumer and business span which is good, across all of those different areas. And at the end of looking at the one slide you\u2019ll see that excluding the airline travel and entertainment the sales consumer spend has actually come back very nicely. So I think that on a go forward basis the impacts will be really some of those at risk industries for some period of time. Ultimately, the trajectory of growth in the payments business will be tied to that consumer business spend overall. There will be a little bit of lumpiness in the third quarter, for example with respect to the prepaid card which is really driven by the stimulus programs. If we see a stimulus program in the fourth or first quarter, that might give us a little bit lift but it\u2019s not that something that we are contemplating at this particular point in time. Andy Cecere : And I would just add, this is Andy John that as Terry mentioned, we see a continued improvement across all three categories merchant acquiring, credit card issuing as well as the corporate payment system. The trough for all those were occurred in April, and each and every month since then there has been slight improvement in spend across those categories. John Pancari : Got it. Okay, great. Thanks Andy. Thanks Terry. Andy Cecere : Okay. Terry Dolan : Yep. Operator : Your next question is from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Bill Carcache : Thanks. Good morning Andy and Terry. It sounds like you guys have the unemployment rate rising from here. Is that just conservatism? Or is there something else that you guys are seeing, if you could just give a little bit of color on that one? Andy Cecere : Yes. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything specific that we\u2019re seeing. I do think though that maybe our expectation -- and if you think about corporate America you are starting to see some reductions in force, whether it\u2019s in the airline industry and some of the entertainment industries. I think that, because of the stimulus programs that have existed some of those companies have differed taking some of those actions. Our expectation as we think about the fourth quarter is some of those actions are going to impact unemployment levels, before they start to come back down. Bill Carcache : Understood. And I guess a separate question is, how would you characterize your gearing to the short end versus the long end of the curve? And if there is sensitivity that you could give that would be great? Terry Dolan : How we\u2019re -- I am sorry. Andy Cecere : Interest rate sensitivity [Indiscernible]. Terry Dolan : Yes. So, maybe just stepping back, our balance sheet is about 50% floating, 50% fixed. We\u2019ll continue to see a little bit of turn on the fix side for some period of time. We\u2019re always looking for opportunities to be able to reinvest in the investment portfolio with a little bit more duration, and we kind of continue to manage that. Our asset liability position widened, so we\u2019re asset sensitive and that widened in the first quarter quite a bit. And since then it\u2019s been relatively stable. And we\u2019ll continue to kind of manage that way for some period of time. When we bring on the deposits as an example we\u2019ll hold that generally on the short end by increasing liquidity levels, because I think that future opportunity in terms of rate increases is a better trade off in the industry and immediately today. Bill Carcache : Got it. Thanks, Terry. And if I could squeeze in one last one. Some of your competitors have hedging programs in place that have served as a source of support for their net interest margins, but you guys haven\u2019t benefited materially from hedges. And I guess as hedges begin to roll off that should benefit you guys relative to others, because you don\u2019t have to deal with those future headwinds. Is that by design or I guess just wondering if there is any color that can give around hedging strategy and positioning? Terry Dolan : Yes, historically we typically just use the balance sheet as a way of kind of hedging or setting up our assets liability position. So we utilize for example duration and composition of our investment portfolio in order to do that, so we don\u2019t do a lot of active hedging. I will tell you though we did do some hedging middle of last year. And when rates came down nicely we were able to lock in the gains associated with it, which I think will help a bit. But it\u2019s not a major part of our program. Bill Carcache : Understood. Thank you for taking my questions. Andy Cecere : Thanks Bill. Operator : Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC. A \u2013 Andy Cecere : Hey, Gerard. Good morning. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Terry. Good morning, Andy. Can you guys give us some additional color? I noticed and you pointed out in the call that you took some charge-offs some commercial and commercial real estate in the COVID-related sectors. Can you give us some color on what you're seeing in terms of the write-downs that are required to move through this period of time with these types of sectors? Mark Runkel : Hey, good morning, Gerard. This is Mark Runkel, I'll answer that question. First off, I would just start off by saying our credit quality is performing in line with our expectations at this point. And as you know, we have a couple of guiding principles in how we think about managing credit. First being, is that we stay very consistent in our underwriting throughout the cycle. Number two, as we're very proactive at identifying and working through problem credits when they arise. And so what I would say is, the result of that is, and as you have seen, this is our criticized commitments did increase early in the downturn in this particular cycle. And so, as we think of our charge-offs, the level of charge-offs, at least this quarter did increase as a result of that. So it's really a timing issue. And in the end, we think we're going to continue to have very superior credit quality performance throughout the economic cycle. Andy Cecere : And I know, Mark, we've been very actively managing that portfolio, the at-risk industries in order to bring that exposure down. Mark Runkel : That's right. Andy Cecere : That's the driver behind the net charge-off levels. Mark Runkel : That\u2019s right. Gerard Cassidy : And within these portfolios, I don't know if there was any hotel properties or maritime biz [ph] to be written down, what you were actually seeing in terms of on an individual credit basis? Are you seeing 10% or 15% write-downs, the ones that you do have the write-down? Mark Runkel : Yes, I think, I mean, that's exactly the range that we're currently seeing on those properties. And it's really property specific, so it does vary greatly. But those that are the most distressed are in that kind of range that you talked about. Gerard Cassidy : I see, I mean, just as a follow-up, some of the bigger universal money center type banks have discussed that the consumer net charge-offs because of the support from the fiscal programs and other types of programs may be pushed out into the second-half of 2021. So it's not necessarily avoiding them there is just the timing of it. Do you guys have any color on the consumer side what you're seeing in terms of the potential for charge-offs? Andy Cecere : I would echo those comments. Gerard, this is Andy. The credit stats for the consumer portfolio are really good right now, and the indicators the delinquencies, all those facts are more positive than you would expect, given the economic environment that we're in. Part of that certainly is due to the stimulus plans, the unemployment benefits, all of those things, which is creating a bit of a bridge. I do expect that at some point in 2021, we'll start to see an acceleration of credit deterioration, the consumer portfolios, once those benefits start to wear down. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you. Andy Cecere : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from Erika Najarian, from Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Good morning. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Erika. Erika Najarian : I'm wondering, a big incremental announcement on identifying another 15% of your branches that you will take offline. And I'm wondering if you could help quantify the cost savings that you expect to derive from those closures and the timing of when that starts impacting your run rate positively? Terry Dolan : Yes, when we end up looking at the potential savings associated with those branches, it's kind of in that $150 million range, plus or minus. We do expect to see that that impact will really start to hit our run rate even in the first quarter. But again, just as a reminder, some of that will come through in terms of expense opportunity or benefit. And some of it's going to get reinvested in digital capabilities, which will also have an impact in terms of expenses. Andy Cecere : And Erika, I want to reiterate a point I made in my prepared remarks, which is that, as you think about the additional 15%, the great majority around 75% or so of those branches already have been closed as a result of COVID during this period. So what they really are is resulting in a permanent closure. And again, all of this reflects changes in customer behaviors and activities. We saw an acceleration of digital transactions and sales. You saw the sales numbers on lending activity. And that only accelerated during the COVID period and that's the result is what we're doing. And again, about 75% of those have already been closed over the last few months. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you. And as a follow-up to that outside perhaps of those potential savings, you have been pretty good at calling out COVID-related expenses. I guess it was 49 this quarter, 79 last quarter. And as we think about your statement in terms of running expenses flat, shall we think about of those expenses dropping off in the 2021 run rate? Or are those expenses related to COVID all going to be reinvested elsewhere in 2021? Terry Dolan : Well, it\u2019s a little bit of both. So, when we think about 2021, we do expect that some of those COVID-related expenses will continue at least into the early part of the year, until the kind of return to work environment starts to settle in. And then, savings associated with that again, part of it will accrue to the bottom line, part of it will be a part of our reinvestment in our business as we think about going forward. Erika Najarian : Got it. And just one more follow-up question, clearly a strong quarter. I think we continue to get pushed back from portfolio managers in terms of owning banks due to the interest rate outlook. And as we think about your outlook for the fourth quarter of NII flat to down slightly, are you confident that without any further changes in the rate outlook that we'll see the bottom net interest income in the fourth quarter? And anything from here, whether it's higher inflation better growth or yield-to-yield curve re-steeping it would be an opportunity? Terry Dolan : Yes, I think it's a little hard to call exactly when net interest income kind of hits the trough. I mean part of it -- and there's just so many different puts and takes in terms of loan demand and where interest rates kind of go from here, what the impact of premium amortization is. There\u2019s just a lot of puts and takes. So, I think it's a little bit early for us to say for example it's in 2020. Erika Najarian : Got it, thank you. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Erika. Operator : Your next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan. Vivek Juneja : Hi Andy, hi Terry. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Vivek. Vivek Juneja : Good morning. So first I'm going to make just a request, especially since you're on the call Andy, since I know you this wouldn't happen without you. I know you guys just put out your list of earnings calls dates for 2021. Two of them overlap at exactly the same starting time as another major bank, so I'm hoping that you can give Jen and team the authorization to do something so that we all don't have to choose between which one to listen to, just trying to listen to two is never going to work. So, since it's one is in April and one's in October and it\u2019s six and 12 months away, I'm hoping between the two banks you all can find the time, and I can follow-up with Jen as to which those two are. So that\u2019s just a\u2026 Andy Cecere : Okay. I know you [Indiscernible] yesterday. Vivek Juneja : You know what, we keep trying. And I've been told by IR if I don't ask the question on the call I can't get the answers to my questions. So Terry, little bit of color your hotel exposure, can you give us some sense of the mix, type of hotels is urban versus small town, upscale, budget, any color on that? And also the percentage of credit size in your COVID-related exposures? Terry Dolan : That's a perfect question for Mark. Mark Runkel : Yes, I'll answer with the lodging exposure. I'd say we have a great diversification by geography and property type. So it\u2019s a mix between urban and suburban, so we've got great distribution there. So we felt really good before that. And in terms of the credit size commitments for those impacted industries we\u2019ll have to follow-up and get you that offline. Vivek Juneja : Okay, that's great. And then, Mark I'm going to follow-up on credit the comment that I think Terry made. NCOs to rise further but Andy you said consumer charge-offs to come more next year. Terry's comment was NCOs rise further in fourth quarter. Is that therefore still to come in commercial and which categories are you expecting that, any color on that? Mark Runkel : Yes, I think as Andy noted the consumer side continues to be very strong and our delinquencies where they ended -- the end of the quarter we're in a really good spot. So we think that will continue to hold true through the remainder of this year. I think we're continuing to work through some of those impacted industries on the commercial and commercial real estate side, really in the commercial real estate side it's going to be more in the malls as well as our lodging exposure that we'll continue to work through the remainder of this year. Andy Cecere : Part of that Vivek is Mark and team being very active in terms of reducing our exposure where we think the highest risk categories are. So we've talked about in the past, we try to be very proactive around this and managing our exposures down in a very early fashion. Vivek Juneja : Okay, great. Thanks, Andy, Terry, Mark. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Vivek. Operator : Your next question comes from Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Peter Winter : Good morning. I'm just curious with the outlook for the unemployment rate to move higher. Would that suggests that there could be some additional reserve building in the fourth quarter? Terry Dolan : No. Peter, no. That was something that has been a part of our outlook for when we were looking at the analysis in the second quarter. And so, we don't think that that would have any impact on CECL. In fact, at this particular point in time, based upon what we know, we wouldn't expect any additional reserve build. Peter Winter : Okay. And then, Andy, I look at the capital ratios and the reserve levels, which are of course are very strong. If the Fed were to lift that restriction on share buybacks, and just keep it to the fourth quarter. Can you just talk about your view on buying back stock assuming no more Fed restrictions? Andy Cecere : If we have capacity, we'll do that, Peter. We're all a bit large banks are going through the CCAR resubmission process right now. I think that'll inform a lot of us in terms of the Feds direction into 2021. So that's where we're looking at. Peter Winter : Okay, thanks. Andy Cecere : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from Christopher Spahr with Wells Fargo Securities. Christopher Spahr : Good morning. Hi, how are you? Good morning. So regarding the payments growth this past quarter, how much do you think that it's kind of green shoots? And how much of that was kind of temporary from the say from the stimulus? And what do you think is going to trend into the fourth quarter? Terry Dolan : Yes, certainly when you think about the third quarter, I think the trajectory was helped, because of the stimulus program. And I think that's the reason why you saw such a strong kind of recovery from the second quarter. So clearly it's been impacted. When we think about the fourth quarter, I think the increase in sales levels will be more commensurate with what we have seen kind of pre-COVID, just in terms of the -- what I would call the excluding the airline, travel and entertainment. So on a year-over-year basis, clearly, it's still going to be down because of those at risk industries and the impact that consumer spend has had on that. But regarding kind of the core other spend level, it's recovered very nicely. Christopher Spahr : Okay. And then as a follow-up, Andy, you've talked about your digital opportunities, whether it's merchant processing, and B2B. But your metrics that you gave are mostly consumer oriented. Can you give some additional color on what you think could be like -- how your commercial customers change their behavior? And what do you think are going to be the revenue and expense benefits say in 2021? Andy Cecere : Yes, Christopher. So I think the consumer probably is a little bit ahead of the corporate commercial in terms of migration to digital activities. Part of it is because many of them are already there, and some of the new rails that are being built will impact that on a go forward basis. And that continues to remain a huge opportunity, probably more into 2021, as we think about the platform around merchant processing, business banking, treasury management and corporate payments, all coming together to serve our corporate, commercial and business customers. So that's probably a little bit more 2021 event, and we'll continue to report on that for you so we could report our progress. Christopher Spahr : Thank you. Andy Cecere : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Scott. Scott Siefers : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Terry, just sort of a quick question on your thoughts on liquidity deployment. Everybody's sort of I guess struggling with this high class problem of excess deposits. Just curious about how you're thinking about willingness or appetite to deploy some of that, just given the challenging interest rate environment. So just very top level question. Terry Dolan : Yes. Again, when you end up looking at kind of the investment alternatives that are out there, you hate to kind of lock in to low rates over a long period of time. That's as a result, I think you're going to see not only for us, but in the industry liquidity levels being fairly high and waiting for the longer end of the curve to kind of come up a bit. That said, in the investment portfolio, we'll look for opportunities to extend duration to some extent and to make some investments a little bit further out of the curve in order to be able to deploy it. We feel like, the liquidity levels that we have today are pretty good, taking into consideration the incremental $10 billion that will come in, which will keep pretty much on the short end. Scott Siefers : Okay, perfect. Thank you. And then maybe on the other side of the balance sheet, you can see through the HA data and in all the numbers that are coming out. Everybody is kind of struggling with this evaporation of loan demand. Just curious at a high level, what signs you guys are looking to or what sort of mile markers there are as to when that would begin to reverse? So I guess the answer is it could be whether it's vaccine, election, more certainty who knows? But just curious, given how much of the country you guys see what you're thinking? Terry Dolan : One of the greatest impacts in the third quarter was the bond issuance. So if you think about the decline in corporate commercial, about 40% of that was from companies take advantage of a low interest rate environment and issuing debt. And about 60% was related to companies just reducing their balance sheet because they're seeing strong earnings, they're seeing high productivity. So those two factors, the debt issuance will really be a function of the interest rate environment and the yield curve going forward. And I would expect that to moderate because there was so much activity in the third quarter. Scott Siefers : Okay, perfect. Thank you guys, very much. I appreciate it. Terry Dolan : You bet. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Your next question comes from David Smith with Autonomous. Terry Dolan : Good morning, David. David Smith : Good morning. First off, you said that you expected the non T&E card spend to have the growth recovery to around where it was pre-COVID. But just in terms of the mix there, are you still expecting a bigger mix in debit than was the case pre-COVID? Andy Cecere : I'm sorry, the second part of your question was? David Smith : In terms of the mix in the consumer card spend between debit and credit, are you still expecting the mix of debit versus credit to be more weighted towards debit in the near-term? Terry Dolan : Yes, I do. I think that people, again, are being fairly cautious and so they are utilizing the debit card because they can more effectively manage their liquidity. So when they have cash balances in their savings account and as you know savings levels are fairly high still on the consumer side, I think they're using their debit card a little bit more than what they have in the past. And so throughout the entire timeframe debit card sales have actually strengthened during that time frame, compared to credit cards. So I do think the mix will continue to change a little bit. David Smith : And then on the branch closures, it sounds like the gross savings there will be around $150 million, but are you expecting any one-time costs from stepping up the branch consolidation? And can you help us get any sense of the timing and magnitude we might expect there? Terry Dolan : Yes. So in the third quarter, we did take a charge associated with the closure of the branches, that is included in other revenue, because it's principally related to asset impairments, offsetting that though were some equity investment gains that if you end up looking at those two things on a net basis, we're essentially neutral to the fee income and the bottom line. David Smith : Great. So you're not expecting any major process going forward? Terry Dolan : We don't expect any further. David Smith : Great. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Jen Thompson : Hey, everyone, thank you for listening to our earnings call. And please call the Investor Relations department if you have any follow-up questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Following a review of the results by Andy Cecere, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Dolan, Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 12 :00 PM Eastern through Wednesday, February 3, 2021 at 12 :00 midnight Eastern. I will now turn the conference call over to Jen Thompson, Director of Investor Relations and Economic Analysis for U.S. Bancorp. Jen Thompson : Thank you, Natalia, and good morning, everyone. With me today are Andy Cecere, our Chairman, President and CEO; and Terry Dolan, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us on the call are our Chief Risk Officer, Jodi Richard; and our Chief Credit Officer, Mark Runkel. During their prepared remarks, Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. I'd like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Andy. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Jen, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry, Jodi, Mark and I will take any questions you have. I'll begin on Slide 3. In the third quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.95. Revenue totaled $5.8 billion in the fourth quarter, and we delivered a record $23.3 billion for the full-year 2020, in spite of the headwinds caused by the low interest rate environment and the economic shutdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The value of our diversified business model was evident this past year, as strength in our mortgage banking, corporate trust and capital markets businesses offset pressure on our net interest margin, which we expect to be stable in the near-term and lower payments revenue due to reduced spend activity. While uncertainty remains, I'm encouraged by economic data that have generally been coming in better-than-expected in recent months and an improving economic outlook, given progress on the vaccine and the potential for additional governance stimulus. In the fourth quarter, we saw a continuation of improving sales trends in our own payments data, with the exception of some pressure on our merchant acquiring businesses, European operations, which was affected by the economic shutdown in the second-half of the quarter. While we expect European operations to continue to experience pressure in the first quarter, we expect payments volume trends to continue to improve, in line with consumer spend activity. Non-interest expenses were stable compared with the third quarter and we continue to target flat sequential expense levels, as long as revenue growth remains challenging. Our balance sheet is in a strong position. Credit quality metrics were a little better-than-anticipated this quarter. And as expected, we neither built nor released reserves in the fourth quarter. We continue to maintain strong capital and liquidity positions, which will allow us to continue to support our customers in this environment. Following the results of the Fed stress test in December, which indicated that we will continue to be subject to the minimum stress capital buffer, we announced a $3 billion common stock repurchase program with buybacks beginning this quarter. Slide 4 provides key performance metrics. In the fourth quarter, we delivered a 15.6% return on tangible common equity. Slide 5 shows that we continue to see migration to the digital channel. Now, let me turn the call over to Terry, who will provide more color on the quarter. Terry Dolan : Thanks Andy. If you turn to Slide 6, I\u2019ll start with the balance sheet review followed by a discussion of fourth quarter earnings trends. Average loans declined by 2.8% compared with the third quarter. The decline was primarily driven by lower commercial loans, reflecting continued paydowns by corporate customers, partly offset by higher mortgage loan balances. While paydown activity continues to slow, we expect it to remain somewhat elevated in the early part of 2021. Turning to Slide 7, average deposits increased 4.2% compared with the third quarter and overall deposit mix continues to be favorable. Our non-interest-bearing deposits grew 5.3%, while time deposits declined 3.8%. On Slide 8, you can see that credit quality continues to perform better relative to our expectations. Our net charge-off ratio was 0.58% in the fourth quarter, which was down compared to 0.66 basis points in the third quarter, reflecting improvement in both commercial and credit card loss rates. The ratio of non-performing assets to loans and other real estate was 0.44% at the end of the fourth quarter compared with 0.41% at the end of the third quarter. Our loan loss provision was $441 million in the fourth quarter, which was equivalent to our net charge-offs during the quarter. Our allowance for credit losses as of December 31 totaled $8.0 billion, or 2.69% of loans. The allowance level reflected our best estimate of the impact of slower economic growth and elevated unemployment, partially offset by the consideration of benefits of government stimulus programs. Slide 9 highlights our key underwriting metrics and loan loss allowance breakdown by loan category. We have a strong relationship-based credit culture at U.S. Bank, supported by cash flow-based lending that considers sensitivity to stress, proactive management, and portfolio diversification, which allows us to support growth through the economic cycle and produces consistent results. Turning to Slide 10. Exposures to certain at-risk segments, given the current environment, are stable compared with the third quarter. The top left table shows that the volume of payment relief declined meaningfully in the fourth quarter to 1.4% of total loans. Slide 11 provides an earnings summary. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we earned $0.95 per diluted share. Slide 12 shows that notable items that impacted earnings in the fourth quarter of 2019, we had no notable items in the fourth quarter of 2020. Turning to Slide 13. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis of $3.2 billion declined 1.6% compared with the third quarter, reflecting lower average loan balances and a 10 basis point decline in net interest margin. The decrease in the net interest margin was primarily driven by higher cash balances, which hurt our NIM by 8 basis points and higher premium amortization. We expect stability and cash balances in the near-term and given the current outlook for mortgage refinancing activity, we believe that fourth quarter 2020 will prove to be the peak level for premium amortization expense. Slide 14 highlights trends in non-interest income. Excluding notable items in the fourth quarter of 2019, non-interest income declined 1.0%, reflecting the impact of lower industry-wide consumer spending activity on our payments businesses and deposit service charges, partly offset by a strong mortgage banking revenue and higher commercial product revenue. Slide 15 provides information about our payment services business lines, including exposures to impacted industries. Year-over-year payments revenue was pressured by reduced consumer and business spend activity compared with pre-COVID levels. However, consumer sales trends generally improved throughout the fourth quarter, albeit at a slower pace than we saw in the third quarter. As expected, card sales volumes were impacted by lower prepaid card volumes in the fourth quarter as payment activity related to the stimulus programs moderated in the fourth quarter. Merchant acquiring volumes were negatively impacted by the mix of sales volumes and a decline in spending activity in Europe, following an increased economic shutdowns related to COVID-19. Commercial business spend within our corporate payments business continued to improve during the fourth quarter. Turning to Slide 16. On a linked-quarter basis, non-interest expenses were stable as expected. Excluding notable items in the fourth quarter of 2019, non-interest expenses increased by 5.1% on a year-over-year basis. Growth was driven by higher compensation related to revenue-generating business production, technology and communication costs and COVID-19-related expenses. Slide 17 highlights our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio at December 31 was 9.7%. I'll provide some forward-looking guidance. For the first quarter of 2021, we expect fully taxable equivalent net interest income to decline in the low-single digits, in part, due to seasonally fewer days. We expect our net interest margin to be relatively stable. Loan balances are likely to decline in the first quarter as PPP loans are forgiven and as corporations continue to use attractive capital markets funding alternatives and their strong cash flow to continue to pay down loans. However, we expect to start to see average loan balances growing in the second quarter. We expect mortgage revenue to decline on a linked-quarter basis, in line with the industry, as refinancing activity continues to moderate. In the first quarter, we expect both merchant acquiring revenue and corporate payments revenue to decline between 10% to 15% on a year-over-year basis; reflecting lower travel and hospitality volumes compared with pre-COVID levels. However, we expect sales volume trends excluding travel and hospitality to continue to improve on a sequential basis, in line with consumer and business spend activity. The recovery of travel and hospitality spend will be dependent upon the timing and efficacy of vaccinations and changes in consumer behavior and business activities. We expect credit and debit card revenue to increase in the low-double-digits on a year-over-year basis as growth in debit and prepaid card volumes more than offset lower travel and hospitality volumes. We expect non-interest expenses to be relatively stable compared with the fourth quarter. Recently, economic indicators have generally been better than market expectations, and the outlook has improved in the past few months. However, given current uncertainties that exist related to recent trends in COVID-19 cases and related state level restrictions, we expect non-performing assets remain elevated and we expect net charge-offs to remain relatively stable in the first quarter. We continue to expect net charge-offs to increase in the second half of the year. We expect the allowance for credit losses to begin to decline when there's more certainty regarding the economic outlook and the timing of when peak net charge-offs will occur. We will continue to assess the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses as conditions change. For the full year 2021, we currently expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately 20%. I'll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Terry. 2020 was a challenging year for many, and I'm proud of how our employees came together to support our customers and communities to help them find solutions for their individual needs. As we move into 2021, I'm confident that U.S. Bank is well positioned to continue to deliver industry-leading results. Our diverse revenue stream will continue to serve us well as we move through the various phases of the economic cycle. We continue to carefully manage operating expenses, while our scale, our innovative culture and our focus on optimization will allow us to invest in our businesses and our digital and payments capabilities. We view a prudent and consistent approach to credit risk management, and our track record is good stewards of shareholders' capital as meaningful differentiators for this company, which is why we will always manage this company with a long-term lens. I want to thank our employees for all the resiliency, flexibility and hard work over this past year and for all they do to bring our culture to life every day. We'll now open up the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Terry Dolan : Good morning, Betsy. Andy Cecere : Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : I wanted to just understand a little bit about how you are thinking about the progression of loan growth as you go through the year and any kind of timing or drivers that you can speak to on the consumer side and the commercial side? Terry Dolan : Yes. So, Betsy, when we end up looking at loan growth, we do expect, as we said, that in the first quarter, it's likely to be down because of the factors that we talked about, but we are starting to see an inflection point. I think there's better activity from an M&A perspective than business spend in terms of CapEx, it seems to be getting a little bit stronger. So our expectation is that in the fourth quarter, we kind of hit that inflection point and loans start to grow. The biggest challenge for us has really been on the commercial side of the equation as we've gone through 2020, and it's really when that starts to change in which overall loan growth starts to improve. We do expect that as consumer spend and consumer behaviors continue to get stronger throughout the year, some of the pressure on credit card will alleviate. And so, I do expect that as we get into second quarter and the second-half of the year, that credit card balances will start to come up as well. And so that kind of gives you a little bit of flavor with respect to consumer and commercial. Betsy Graseck : And can you give us a sense on how you're thinking about your own appetite for M&A? We've had, obviously, in the industry, quite a bit of consolidation activity over the past couple of quarters. And I know from prior comments, you've mentioned that, look \u2013 you'll look at \u2013 but you have a high bar. Just wondering, given flush with capital liquidity and reserves, is \u2013 if that changes at all, the opportunity set from your perspective for any M&A? Andy Cecere : Hey, Betsy, this is Andy. Our position on that is consistent with what we talked about. We'll continue to look at opportunities for -- in addition to organic growth, partnerships, alliance like we did with State Farm as well as M&A if it meets the hurdles, both from a financial and strategic sense to really increase our capabilities, our scale, our customer acquisition opportunities. So we'll be open-minded about that. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks. And then just lastly, on the State Farm and the Charlotte market expansion and some of the other locations where you're doing digital-first, branch-light strategy, could you give us a sense as to the, kind of, pace of benefit to growth that you anticipate those strategies will drive over the next couple of years? Andy Cecere : Yes. Let me start on the State Farm side. So as you know, that was an acquisition of card balances as well as deposits. And so we would expect continued increases in both of those categories, in addition to other opportunities and small business and other banking products with that alliance, and that is going very well and the conversion was very smooth. Charlotte is also exceeding our expectations, both in terms of extending current customer relationships, as well as new customer acquisition. We slowed a little bit in terms of the additional branches because of COVID, but we're going to get back on track there. So I would say, in both cases, they're exceeding our expectations. State Farm, a little bit more material just given the size than the Charlotte acquisition -- Charlotte increase. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Andy Cecere : You bet. Operator : Your next question is from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Andy Cecere : Hi, John. John Pancari : Good morning. On the credit front, I just want to see if you can perhaps give us a little bit more color on your thought process regarding the reserve and why not release here? I know you indicated that you're watching the macro backdrop, what economic factors are you looking for to give you that signal around reserve releases? And then separately, I know you mentioned a peaking of charge-offs, so are you implying that you have to see that -- the charge-off peak before you release? I just want to see if you can elaborate there. Thank you. Terry Dolan : Yes. I mean, maybe with respect to your second question, no, I don't think we need to see them peak. I think we need to just have confidence in terms of when that's going to occur. And I think that as time continues to move on, I think that the economic outlook continues to get better and stronger. I mean that's generally our expectation. Obviously, unemployment and some of the high level economic factors continue to improve, which is great. I think the biggest thing that we're waiting to see is just when we thought about the fourth quarter, COVID cases and things like that continue to be spiking. There were a number of state economies that continue to put more and more restrictions on. And we just kind of wanted to see that change or reverse, which I think as we're starting to see now, that's positive. But I think there's enough uncertainty, and we want to be conservative as we think about the appropriateness of the reserve, we want to just see those \u2013 some of those uncertainties alleviate. John Pancari : Okay. All right. Thank you. And then separately, on the loan growth front, I hear you in terms of the likely inflection that you're beginning to see. So as you think about it, could you help us frame how you think loan growth could shape up for the year as this inflection materializes and you see the strengthening through the year? How should we think about full-year loan growth versus GDP? And then separately, what do you think will be the greatest contributors to loan growth in terms of your asset classes for 2021? Terry Dolan : Yes. So relative to GDP, obviously, GDP is projected to be pretty strong. So I think that we're -- from a loan growth perspective, I think, the entire industry is going to see that lag a little bit behind that. But -- as the economy continues to get stronger, that loan growth will occur. The biggest challenges, I think, that the industry has had and certainly, what we've seen is that with very low rates, strong companies with good cash flows have been able to go out to the markets and refinance and/or use their own cash flows to pay down balances. And so, similar to what we saw the last time, deposits, there's a lot of liquidity out there with corporate America. And they need to start using some of that liquidity themselves in terms of capital expenditure, M&A activity and all sorts of things. So the positive thing that we see now is that there are some green shoots associated with all those things, and that's kind of the front end of loan growth starting to reverse and take off, similar to what we saw last time. Andy Cecere : That's right, Terry. And I think the areas that, like you just said, the areas that probably offer the most opportunity are corporate loans as companies start to increase CapEx spend and M&A accelerates and credit card spend starts to increase. Most of the credit card increase activity right now is transactors as opposed to those using balances. John Pancari : Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys. Andy Cecere : You bet. Operator : Your next question is from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Andy Cecere : Hey, John. Terry Dolan : Hey, John. John McDonald : Hi. Good morning. Andy, Terry gave some detailed guidance items for 2021. I guess, at a higher level, how are you thinking about what kind of year 2021 will be in terms of maybe headwinds and tailwinds on the revenue front? And how you're thinking about managing for operating leverage? Andy Cecere : Yes, John. So let me start by thinking about the year 2020, because I think one of the great attributes of our company is their diversified revenue model. So we had headwinds in a couple of businesses like payments and NIM, offset by positives in mortgage and auto and our corporate trust business and our corporate -- and our commercial products businesses. As we think about -- as I think about 2021, I think some of those headwinds, particularly in payments, will begin to dissipate. We have some pressure in the fourth quarter because of our European operations. But, as you know, spend is starting to get back to normal, particularly those areas outside travel and hospitality. And I think that will start to come back, particularly in quarters two, three and four. So that will be a positive. Mortgage continues to be strong. Maybe not as strong as what it was in 2020, but we have a high retail activity and a new purchase activity, given the expansion and the investments we've made there, so I see positives there. Our Trust business is an investment and will continue to do strong. And then, as Terry talked about, I think, the other area of opportunity is in loan growth. So as we think about the year, that diversity of revenue is going to be very helpful. And we'll continue to manage expenses, given the revenue opportunities we have. And as we said, as we think about the first quarter, we expect it to be relatively flat. John McDonald : Okay. And in terms of the operating leverage achievability this year, how would you handicap that? I know it's a tough call. Andy Cecere : Yes. A little -- it's always our goal, John, let me start there. We're going to make the investments we need to, but also recognize the current environment and try to perform as best we can, given the revenue. So positive operating leverage is always our goal and we'll strive for that in 2021. There's still a lot of uncertainty on the revenue front. So we'll see how that plays out, and we'll continue to give updates. John McDonald : Okay. And then, Terry, maybe you could just weigh in on terms of capital management, just remind us where do you think you should be running the company? You've got a fair amount of excess here in terms of common equity Tier 1? And how you think about using buybacks beyond the first quarter over the course of time? Thanks. Terry Dolan : Yes. So, our overall target is 8.5%, and we typically operate somewhere between 8.5% and 9% in terms of Tier 1 ratio. Currently, as you know, we're at 9.7%. So, there is capacity and there's certainly opportunity for us to be able to bring that down. I think the thing that we'll do is we'll continue to watch the uncertainties as the economic outlook continues to strengthen and earnings strengthen. We'll take advantage of, but there's clearly plenty of opportunity from a capital management perspective to use that capital in a variety of ways. John McDonald : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Scott Siefers : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Andy Cecere : Hey Scott. Terry Dolan : Hi Scott. Scott Siefers : Maybe, Terry, I was hoping to ask you to expand a bit on one of the comments you touched on a second ago with regard to corporate liquidity. Just on deposits, generally, the whole world is kind of a wash in all these deposits. Just your top level thoughts on sort of when and how those kind of get drawn down if they come down, just overall kind of what you're thinking there? Terry Dolan : Yes. Certainly, our expectation for 2021 is that from a policy perspective, the Federal Reserve is going to continue to support a fairly high level or accommodative sort of an environment. Our expectation is that deposits will continue to grow, but certainly not maybe at the pace that they were in 2020. So, that's going to be both an opportunity for us as we have the deposit flow to be able to look at investing, for example, in the investment portfolio, et cetera. But it's also going to create a challenge from Corporate America in terms of the amount of liquidity that they have. Scott Siefers : Okay, perfect. Thanks. And then I was hoping you could touch on the commercial products revenue line a bit. In a sense, it's kind of reversed some of the trends we see at peers where it sort of peaked earlier in the year and has been declining. And just curious if you can sort of talk about some of the underlying trends there and expectations. Terry Dolan : Yes. Certainly, when we think about commercial product revenue, I mean, the peak really was kind of in the second, third quarter sort of timeframe. For us, our focus is really more on the high investment-grade sort of customers as opposed to high yield. And I think that you -- because of that mix in terms of what's happening in the marketplace ends up impacting our growth rates maybe relative to the industry. Fourth quarter is always -- there's always a little bit of seasonality for us, it kind of comes down. When we look at 2021 though, we're generally bullish with respect to capital markets activities. Scott Siefers : Okay, perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Terry Dolan : Good morning, Erika. Andy Cecere : Hey Erika. Erika Najarian : Hi good morning. My first question is just teasing out the NII outlook for the rest of the year. As I think about your comments on loan growth and that fourth quarter will be peak for premium NIM, should we expect the first quarter of 2021 to represent a bottom in net interest income? And do you -- if so, would you expect it to grow from there? Sorry, Part B of this question, is there any PPP-related income that you're putting into guidance? Terry Dolan : Yes. Well, maybe with respect to the last one. I mean, PPP, obviously, will impact net interest income as forgiveness occurs, et cetera. But it's not a big driver associated with it for us. Maybe kind of coming back to your first question, though, our expectation from here is that starting point, net interest margin is going to be stable, certainly in the first quarter and our expectation is through the year. I mean the pressures associated with the yield curve and all sorts of things that we saw last year actually will probably be helpful to us. As we see that inflection point in terms of loan balances, that's going to be a big driver in terms of the inflection point with respect to net interest income as well. And then certainly as deposit flows, if they continue to be strong, we don't believe that we need to build any more liquidity. And so, we'll look at opportunistically reinvesting that in the market. Erika Najarian : Got it. And as we think about the trajectory for payments related fee income and is $799 million this quarter versus -- the fourth quarter versus $945 million in 4Q '19. As you think about your outlook for the global economy, do you think you could go back to the run rate of $945 million by 4Q 2021, or do you think that certain part of payments will take a little bit longer to come back? Terry Dolan : Yes. Well, generally, I would say that when we think about the payments business, we're optimistic with respect to sales volumes as the year progresses. We do -- certainly, when we saw fourth quarter, here we saw good sales expansion in terms of credit card, debit card and in the commercial spend in our corporate payments space. The domestic spend from a merchant perspective was kind of flattish in the fourth quarter, but we do expect that to continue to expand and grow throughout the year. I think the thing that -- getting back to your question though, in terms of how quickly do you get back to pre-COVID revenue levels. A driver of that is just the travel and entertainment piece, which is going to be probably a little bit more subdued at least in 2021. Erika Najarian : Got it. And if I could sneak a final question here and this is for Andy. As a follow-up to Betsy's question, I do get a lot of questions from investors on whether or not U.S. bank would do something more transformational from a non-organic growth perspective, seeing that your closest peers in terms of size did something either transformational or somewhat transformational. And the question here is, with assets at $554 billion as of year-end, does the -- is $700 billion a bright line for you as it indicates a different tier in terms of regulatory treatment? Andy Cecere : I think, Erika, the short answer is I don't think about that as a bright line. As we talked about, we're making investments across all of our businesses, particularly in the digital channels. We spent $2.5 billion a year. We have good scale, but we'll look at opportunities to increase that scale and increase the customer acquisition opportunity across all the businesses. So -- but there aren't any bright lines in terms of what we look at or would do or wouldn't do. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you. Andy Cecere : Sure. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. Terry Dolan : Good morning, Matt. Matt O'Connor: First, a clarifying question, sorry if I missed it. But the expense guidance, I think you said stable in the first quarter versus 4Q, but did you give full year 2021 guidance on costs? Terry Dolan : Yes, we didn't necessarily give full year guidance. I would just kind of come back to what Andy said, and that our goal and our expectation is to manage expenses flat, especially given the revenue environment. And our target is always to achieve positive after leverage, it's going to be challenging in the \u2013 especially in the earlier part of the year. Matt O'Connor: Okay. That's helpful. And then separately, the alliance that you have with State Farm, just talk about some of the, kind of the longer-term opportunity there, I think you brought in about $10 billion deposits and a little bit north of $1 billion of card loans. But what do you think the revenue and earnings contribution from that can be overtime? Terry Dolan : Yes. I mean, so the dollars that you mentioned in terms of deposits and credit card is pretty close. When we think about the business though, and Andy has talked about this before, there's just a lot of opportunity, and they have 19,000 agents that are out there. And they're one of the biggest organizations with respect to small business customers. And so when we think about it, we think about there's opportunity in terms of deposit gathering, there's certainly early opportunity to enhance and improve the credit card program that has existed. But we have a number of different initiatives that are going to focus around really expanding that and also expanding our relationship with them in terms of auto lending as well as \u2013 as well as small business opportunities. Matt O'Connor: And I guess what I'm getting at, like if we look out five years, like, is this something that could all of a sudden start moving the needle, right? Like, so mortgage, you're investing heavily in it for a number of years and all of a sudden, activity picked up and it's just massive number. And even if it's not sustainable, it just shows kind of the fruits of the investments. Is this something that could move the needle, or is it just kind of a building block along with some other initiatives? Thank you. Terry Dolan : No, I think it is one of those things that can move the needle for us. I mean, any time you have access through 19,000 agencies, we think that, that's very significant. And the other thing, Matt, is that we've invested a lot in digital capabilities. We plan on leveraging all of those digital capabilities in order to be able to support their customers and ours. So we're very bullish. And we're very excited about the State Farm alliance, a lot more to come. Matt O'Connor: Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Terry Dolan : Hi, Ken. Ken Usdin : Hey, morning guys, morning. Just a couple of quick follow-ups, first of all, on the point about premium am and at bottoming, is there a way you can help us understand, how much of an impact that currently is either in numeric terms or how much directional change there has been to get to this point, given your point that it's \u2013 to the point that it's bottoming? Terry Dolan : Yes. I mean, we haven't necessarily disclosed any dollars associated with premium amortization. If you end up thinking about the 10 basis points this quarter, eight of it is really related to card balances, so the rest of it is really driven by premium amortization or significant amount. So I think with respect to first quarter, it's \u2013 or fourth quarter is really peaked. First quarter, it's really end into 2021. It's really going to track, I think, along with how refinancings occur within the mortgage industry. Ken Usdin : Okay. And as you look into this year and consider the stimulus that's already started to flush through and potentially more stimulus. How does that impact, what you expect to see in the payments businesses, at least domestically? So, does that net help revenues? Does it weigh on revenues? And what other kind of through the income statement, the FX, do you \u2013 are you anticipating given the prospect for even more stimulus to come through? Thanks. Terry Dolan : Yes. I mean, when you think about stimulus, certainly, in the short-term, it helps our prepaid card businesses pretty significantly. And with respect to the most recent one and if there's another round of it, I think, that that would continue to help throughout the year. But I do think that it will, and we did see in the last stimulus, it does stimulate consumer activity in terms of buying and that is going to help and did help and will help our payments businesses as we think about 2021. So that, to me, is a very favorable thing. I think the other thing is that when you think about it from a credit standpoint, the $900 billion maybe was a little bit lower than what had been hoped for, but it's a nice start, and I think there is most likely thoughts in terms of more to come. The real question there is does that create the bridge for the consumer customers from a net charge-off perspective to really keep those at base, so to speak. And I think that stimulus is going to be a positive both in terms of revenue as well as on the net charge-off side if it occurs. Ken Usdin : Yes. And just one follow-up on the European side of the payments business. How quickly can -- does lockdown changes move into the revenue stream? Meaning that is it coincident, does this start to lag from what you've observed in the prior -- first lockdowns as opposed to this one, that's happened now and wait on the fourth quarter results. What's the experience that you've seen and would expect? Terry Dolan : Yes. The bounce back is pretty fast. I mean it certainly is within that 30 days to 90 days timeframe, you start to see it. It does take a while for it to -- for that trajectory to get back, but it does happen pretty fast. The other thing to keep in mind is the European revenue impact to U.S. Bank. Total revenue is probably around 1%, so it's a very small amount in terms of total revenue. And -- but we'll continue to see what happens with respect to lockdown. Ken Usdin : Okay. Thank you. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Ken. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Hi. Andy Cecere : Hey, Mike. Terry Dolan : Hi, Mike. Mike Mayo : Well, I guess, you stand out, unless I missed it. So no reserve releases pandemic related, or did I miss that? You built up with about $2 billion of reserves the prior three quarters, but no releases in the fourth quarter. Did I get that right? And if so, why no releases? Terry Dolan : Yes. Mike, that is correct. When we end up looking at the allowance for credit losses, we still see, as I said a little bit earlier, I think we end up looking at the uncertainties that exist out there or at least existed out there at the end of the year. And just have -- what we want to be able to see is we want to see, kind of, a reversal of some of the restrictions and the reversal associated with some of the COVID cases. And I think that we're starting to see that happening, which is a good sign. But that's one of the reasons that we really held back with respect to the allowance for credit losses at this point. Mike Mayo : So it's not your clients. It's just -- you're just being conservative with the environment? Terry Dolan : Well, yes, I think it's just the uncertainty in the environment. We'd like to see a few of those continue to improve. Mike Mayo : Okay. My bigger question relates to your presentation from December, which talks about recreating the ecosystem and going after more of the payments business with your middle market companies and small businesses, and basically improving the share of payments with your business customers. And I didn't completely understand the endgame for that. Any specific metrics around how you're trying to improve share, for example. One metric could be, you have X percent share of the payments business with your middle market companies and you want to move it to Y? Or, anything concrete that you can put around what feels like a newer or enhanced strategic direction and that coincides, I guess, with your closing of one-fourth of your branches, and if you can give an update on that also? Andy Cecere : Yes, Mike, this is Andy. Let me start with the branches. So, we did complete the branch closures early in January. So, as we talked about, we were just over 3,000 branches. We're down about 25%, so just over 2,300 branches. And that's really a function of consumer behaviors. As you saw from the chart, 77% of our customers are using the digital channel. Those using the branch channel, while still important and still seeking advice and consult, it's down to about 40%. So there's a behavior change that's accelerated as a result of the pandemic and the closures reflect that. That's number one. On the small business, business banking front, I think it's a very significant opportunity. We have a great payments business. We have a great banking business, and weaving those two together to offer a full set of capabilities for that ecosystem is critically important. And I think there's three metrics that we're going to focus on. Payments customers that add banking capabilities, banking customers that add payments capabilities and new customer acquisition. And we haven't articulated those goals, but we have goals for all three of them and we'll update as we go forward, but I think it's a huge opportunity. Mike Mayo : Okay. And as far as, last question, extra spending, I mean, if you closed all your branches, it's done in January, so you certainly have savings. Your tech spend went up quarter-over-quarter in the fourth quarter. So are you looking to increase your tech spend while you create this kind of newer ecosystem? Andy Cecere : So, Mike, we talked a little bit about our guidance on expense, which is relatively flat. And as you think about that flat expense guidance, there's really two components. One is, achieving savings through optimization on the current business model while at the same time, investing for the new. So, we're going to be able to continue to invest to allow us to expand in these areas, while retaining flat expenses by saving on the current business model. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Andy Cecere : You bet. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Vivek Juneja with the JPMorgan. Andy Cecere : Hi, Vivek. Vivek Juneja : Hi, Andy. Hey, Terry. Andy Cecere : Good morning. Vivek Juneja : Thanks for taking my questions. I\u2019m good. Thanks. A couple of questions. Firstly, branch closures, you obviously did a lot in early Jan. What's your thinking for the rest of the year? Are you done for this year? Do you think there's more to come? And in line with that, given that this is all about consumer behavior with the pandemic. How is that changing your thinking about opening more branches? I know you said you want to open more in Charlotte, but that whole expansion strategy. Do you need as many branches? If you could sort of talk to both those pieces. Andy Cecere : Sure, Vivek. So as you think about Charlotte, we were targeting a dozen branches. If you think about the twin cities, we have nearly 85 to 100. So, the way we would open in a new market would be significantly different than the current business model. In terms of the number, I think we're at a relatively stable point right now. We'll continue to look at opportunities to optimize branches, at the same time opening new branches. But I wouldn't expect substantial changes in the near term. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Great. Different question. What percentage of your merchant processing revenues is small to mid-sized merchants versus the large? Terry Dolan : Well, I don't necessarily have that at my fingertips. But if you end up just kind of looking at the overall mix, we have a pretty good mix of small and medium-sized sort of businesses that are part of that equation. And they have tended to be kind of omni distribution sort of merchants or customers as well. One of the things we continue to expand and grow is our e-commerce sort of capabilities, and that has grown very nicely over the last year or so. Vivek Juneja : Would you expect that they are half your business? Over half? What would you guess? Terry Dolan : Yes. If I were -- if I were to venture a guess, I'd say maybe a little bit -- it depends upon how you end up characterizing small and medium, et cetera. I think that's the thing I'm struggling with here a little bit, Vivek. Andy Cecere : Vivek, one thing I'd add because I think where you're going in terms of the recovery. One way we look at it a lot and very focused on is the component of our merchant acquiring that is travel, entertainment, and airline. And a year ago, back in 2019, that was nearly 40%, and so it was 37%. And today, it's about 20%. So, the decline that's occurred has been principally in that area as opposed to small or large business, it's been in that focused area of travel and airline. Everything else has actually got back to normal. And that 20% is where the opportunity exists for continued improvement in spend as we think about the future. Vivek Juneja : Great. All right. Thanks. And one last one, if I may. Mortgage banking stayed still very strong. I know it's down. You -- I'm presuming you've been able to pass on the GSE refi fee thus far, is that the case? And what's the plan for that as you look forward? Terry Dolan : That would be the situation for the case. Again, when we think about the mortgage banking business too, we talk a lot about the refi. But the thing that I'd maybe remind people is that we've made a lot of investment in that business in terms of the purchase money, purchase mortgage, and that continues to do very well. I think it's -- if you end up looking at the production of applications in the last quarter, it was about 52% purchase versus refinancing. So, I know that, that people will look at that and I actually think that, that's an area of opportunity as we think about the future. Vivek Juneja : All right. Okay, great. Thanks. Thank you very much. Terry Dolan : Thanks Vivek. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Terry Dolan : Good morning Bill. Andy Cecere : Good morning Bill. Bill Carcache : Good morning. Thank you for all the color that you guys have given on payments. But I wanted to follow-up with a bigger picture question. Broadly speaking, how would you guys respond to concerns of some investors that USB's merchant acquiring business is tethered to the physical point-of-sale and is competitively disadvantaged against some of the more digitally native names like PayPal, Square, and Stripe? And also, more broadly, if you could discuss what USB is doing to compete against those kinds of players? Andy Cecere : Yes. Good questions, Bill. And twofold, number one, is most of the investments we've made and most of the expansions occurred over the last two years has been on the e-commerce side of the equation. It's not just e-commerce; it's really capabilities to help those businesses run their businesses. And I think one of the advantages against those payments players you described is our banking business and that's why we're so darn focused on weaving together banking and payments because those customers need not just the payments mechanisms, they need small loans, they need deposit advice and acceptance, so they need a full array of services. And I think if we can offer those in a convenient, easy fashion that solves their problems and helps them run their business. So I think that's where our advantage is. And that's a combination of banking and payments, it's so darn important. Q \u2013 Bill Carcache : Thanks, Andy. That's super helpful color. If I could squeeze in another one, I'm sorry if you guys discussed this already on the securities portfolio. But what kind of reinvestment rates are you guys seeing relative to what we saw in the fourth quarter? And maybe a little bit on what kind of opportunity a steeper curve could represent? A \u2013 Terry Dolan : Yes. Certainly, when we see the securities portfolio, I mean, the differential from our reinvestment has shrunk some relative, for example, third quarter, fourth quarter got a little bit better and that we would expect it probably get better as well. I do think as the long end of the curve starts to come up, I think that, that is another inflection point. It's just a matter of kind of what the timing of that is. Q \u2013 Bill Carcache : Got it. Thanks very much for answering my questions. A \u2013 Terry Dolan : Yes. Thank you, Bill. Operator : Our final question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. A \u2013 Terry Dolan : Hey, Gerard. Q \u2013 Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Andy and good morning, Terry. A \u2013 Andy Cecere : Good morning. Q \u2013 Gerard Cassidy : A question for you on the outlook for loan loss reserves. Clearly, you guys have always been very conservative, and you still are, as we look out into the future. Maybe, Terry, can you share with us, I think if I read the number correctly, your reserves to loans today are about 2.69% and that's of course, higher than where we were in January 1, when you guys had your CECL adjustment, I think it was about 1.99%. Do you eventually see the reserve to loan number coming back to where it was pre-pandemic at about 2%? A \u2013 Terry Dolan : Yes. It will be kind of really around timing. But certainly, when we look at the overall mix of our business and our portfolio, and our underwriting that 2% to us makes sense, as we get through the pandemic sort of environment. Q \u2013 Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then, Andy, maybe a bigger picture question. Clearly, your guys' outlook is maybe a little more conservative than some of your peers, but there seems to be the expectation that is the vaccines are widespread, hopefully, by the middle of the year that the economy will come back strongly in the second half. There are calls for real GDP growth of 5% to 6%. The equity markets are at record levels, as you know. When you go down the elevator at night, what risks do you worry about as you think about the next 12 to 24 months? A \u2013 Andy Cecere : Well, the principal risks are the ones you described, which are the economic risks, the headwinds and the flat yield curve. But I think the economic headwinds that we faced in the second half of 2020 are starting to dissipate for sure and starting to come back. And again Gerard, you mentioned we have a diversified revenue stream and different businesses do well in different environments. And those businesses that struggled with some of the headwinds that we saw regarding to NIM and loan growth and payments, I think it will start to turn the other way as we start to see the recovery for all the reasons you described. So \u2013 and then different businesses will be impacted in different ways, so the value of diversified revenue stream really is very helpful. And one of the ways that helps us perform in whatever economic cycle we're in. But the principal thing that we all think about is, how the stimulus and how the actions of the government, as well as some of the forbearance and plans by the banks will help us get back into a normal economic recovery. I think that's the principal area of concern for all of us right now. Q \u2013 Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you. A \u2013 Andy Cecere : You bet. Thanks, Gerard Operator : There are no further questions. Jen Thompson : Thank you for joining our call today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions.

Following a review of the results by Andy Cecere, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Dolan, Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 1 o\u2019clock PM Central Time, through Thursday, April 22, 2021 at 10 :59 PM Central Time. I will now like to turn the conference call over to Jen Thompson, Director of Investor Relations and Economic Analysis for U.S. Bancorp. Jen Thompson : Thank you, Kara. And good morning, everyone. With me today are Andy Cecere, our Chairman, President and CEO; and Terry Dolan, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us on the call are our Chief Risk Officer, Jodi Richard; and our Chief Credit Officer, Mark Runkel. During their prepared remarks, Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. I'd like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page two of today's presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Andy. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Jen. And good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. Following our prepared remarks, Terry, Jody, Mark and I will take any questions you have. I'll begin on slide 3. In the first quarter, we reported earnings per share of $1.45. Credit quality trends were better than expected and the economic outlook has improved meaningfully over the past several months, given the pace of the vaccine rollout and the ongoing impact of significant government stimulus. Based on these factors, we released a little over $1 billion in loan loss reserves this quarter. Revenue totaled $5.5 billion in the first quarter. As expected, net interest income decreased compared with the fourth quarter. However, we expect loans to grow as the year progresses and given that securities reinvestment rates are now accretive to asset yields and our belief that premium amortization expenses likely peaked, we expect that the first quarter will be a low point for net interest income. Improved economic activity is driving better consumer and business spending trends, which in turn is translating into improving payments volume. In each of our payments businesses, volumes, excluding COVID impacted travel, hospitality, and entertainment sectors exceeded first quarter 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Our expenses were relatively stable compared with the fourth quarter. In the lower right quadrant, you can see that our capital and liquidity positions remained strong. And during the quarter, we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders in the forms of dividends and share buybacks. Slide 4 provides key performance metrics. This quarter, our returns benefited from improved credit performance and reserve release. Longer term, we believe we will continue to deliver industry-leading returns on tangible common equity driven by strong PPNR performance, consistent through the cycle credit performance and prudent capital management. Slide 5 shows the pace of migration to the digital channel. Digital uptake is correlated with higher customer satisfaction, ease-of-use, and lower cost of service, which we measure very closely. Digital transactions now account for nearly 80% of all transactions. In the lower right hand chart, you can now see that more than 60% of loan sales now occurred digitally, which compares to less than 40% a year ago. Now let me turn the call over to Terry who will provide more detail on the quarter. Terry Dolan : Thanks, Andy. If you turn to slide 6, I'll start with the balance sheet review followed by a discussion of first quarter earnings trends. Average loans declined 2.8% compared with the fourth quarter as the low interest rate environment continues to impact borrower behavior. Elevated corporate paydown activity late in the fourth quarter negatively impacted average commercial loan growth in the first quarter. Recently, we have seen improving pipelines, and we expect inventory building and M&A activity to pick up as we move further into 2021. Similarly, lower interest rates impacted consumer loans as increased refinancing activity impacted real estate loan balances. Credit card revolve rates continued to decline this quarter causing balances to contract as consumers used excess liquidity from government stimulus programs to pay down debt. Turning to slide 7. Average deposits increased 0.9% compared with the fourth quarter, reflecting the level of liquidity in the financial system. As a reminder, our deposits are typically seasonally lower in the first quarter of the year. Our overall deposit mix continues to be favorable. In the first quarter, our non-interest bearing deposits grew 2.8%, while time deposits declined 17.7%. Slide 8 shows our credit quality trends, which continue to be better than our expectations, reflecting improving economic conditions, supported by additional stimulus and increased vaccine availability. Our net charge-off ratio totaled 0.31% in the first quarter compared with 0.58% in the fourth quarter. The improvement reflects lower total commercial, credit card and other retail net charge-offs. The ratio of non-performing assets to loans and other real estate was 0.41% at the end of the first quarter compared with 0.44% at the end of the fourth quarter. We released reserves this quarter reflective of better-than-expected credit trends and an improving economic outlook versus our previous expectations. In the first quarter, our loan loss provision was negative $827 million or $1.1 billion less the net charge-offs of $223 million. Our allowance for credit losses as of March 31st totaled $7.0 billion or 2.36% of loans. The allowance level reflected our best estimate of the impact of improving economic growth, lower unemployment, and changing credit quality within the portfolios driven in part by the benefits of continued government stimulus programs. Slide 9 highlights our key underwriting metrics and loan loss allowance breakdown by loan category. Turning to slide 10, exposures to certain at-risk segments given the current environment are stable compared with the fourth quarter. The left table shows that customer balances included in payment relief programs continued to decline meaningfully in the first quarter to less than 1% of total loans. Slide 11 provides an earnings summary. In the first quarter of 2021, we earned $1.45 per diluted share. These results include a reserve release of $1.1 billion. Turning to slide 12. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis of $3.1 billion declined 3.5% compared with the fourth quarter due to fewer days in the quarter, lower average loan balances, and a 7 basis point decline in net interest margin. The decrease in the net interest margin was primarily driven by higher premium amortization expense, lower portfolio reinvestment rates, and mortgage loan prepayments. As mentioned earlier, we expect loans to grow as the year progresses, also given that securities reinvestment rates are now accretive to asset yields and I believe that premium amortization has likely peaked, we expect the first quarter will be the low point for net interest income. Slide 13 highlights trends in non-interest income, which as a reminder is typically seasonally lower in the first quarter of each year. Non-interest income declined 5.7% from a year ago, primarily driven by lower mortgage revenue. On a year-over-year basis, strong refinancing activity drove higher production volumes and related production revenue. However, in the first quarter, we recorded a reduction of $120 million to the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights, net of hedges, which compares with a favorable increase in the valuation net of hedges of $25 million a year ago. With prepayments speeds declining, we would expect future changes in the MSR fair value adjustment to be more moderate. Business activity and strong underlying market conditions drove growth in trust and investment management fees, treasury management revenue, and commercial product revenue, although deposit service charges were negatively impacted by lower consumer spend and increased consumer liquidity from government stimulus. Slide 14 provides information on our payment services business, including a breakdown of segment volume for the first quarter of 2021 compared with more normalized 2019 levels. Slide 15 indicates that sales volumes across our payments businesses have continued to rebound since bottoming in April of 2020. In the first quarter, total payments fee revenue was essentially flat compared with the first quarter of 2020. Credit and debit card revenue increased 10.5% on a year-over-year basis, driven by higher interchange revenue and higher prepaid card fees as a result of government stimulus programs. Merchant Services revenue decreased 5.6% compared with a year ago, which was better than what we had expected coming into the quarter. Improving sales growth in North America was more than offset by expected declines in European sales due to COVID-related shutdowns. Corporate payments revenue declined 13.1% year-over-year as travel and entertainment revenue continued to lag. Turning to slide 16. Non-interest expenses were relatively stable on a linked quarter basis as expected. Year-over-year growth of 1.9% was driven by increased mortgage and capital markets production incentive costs and expenses related to business investments in digital and technology, which was partly offset by a decline in costs related to COVID-19 and a future delivery liability incurred in the first quarter of 2020. Slide 16 highlights our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio at March 31st was 9.9% compared with our target CET1 ratio of 8.5%. Given improving economic conditions in the first quarter, we bought back $650 million of common stock as part of our previously announced $3.0 billion repurchase program. I'll now provide some forward-looking guidance. For the second quarter of 2021, we expect fully taxable equivalent net interest income to increase in the low single digits compared with the first quarter, and we look for modest loan growth. We expect payments fee revenue to continue to improve sequentially as economic activity continues to accelerate. Starting in the second quarter, growth rates will be meaningfully impacted by favorable year-over-year comps given the 2020 COVID environment. We expect non-interest expenses to be relatively stable compared with the first quarter. The outlook for credit quality has improved in the past two quarters, along with the improving economic environment. However, we think that the net charge-off ratio is likely to remain low as the first quarter level of 0.31%. As we move further into the year, we expect the net charge-off ratio to normalize toward pre-pandemic levels. We will continue to assess the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses as conditions change. For the full year 2021, we currently expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately 21%. I'll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Terry. One year ago, we were at the beginning stages of a pandemic-driven economic downturn, which had no precedent. We are confident in the strength of our balance sheet and our ability to support our customers, employees and communities through a difficult time. But we, along with the entire industry, faced an uncertain outlook. A lot has changed in the year. Our first quarter results were reflective of the lingering impact of an economy that continues to heal, but has not fully recovered to pre-pandemic activity levels. However, we are optimistic about the trajectory from here. We believe we are well positioned to benefit from what many expect to be the strongest economic growth this country has seen in decades, as we capture the potential of increased consumer and business spending across all of our business lines, most directly related to our three payments businesses. Importantly, we expect our multi-year investments in digital and payments to continue to pay off well beyond any cyclical benefit that we see in the upcoming quarters. These investments aimed at enhancing the customer experience and leveraging the power of our payments ecosystem, will position us at the forefront in banking and drive market share gains for many years to come. Ultimately, our goal is to deliver industry-leading returns through this cycle. And as such, we invest to drive top line revenue growth, while prudently managing expenses, credit quality and capital with the best interest of our long-term shareholders in mind. In closing, I'd like to thank our employees for all their hard work. And their commitment to serving our customers with the expertise and integrity they have come to expect from us. We'll now open up the call to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Rochester with Compass Point. David Rochester : Hey. Good morning, guys. Andy Cecere : Good morning, David. David Rochester : On - just on fee income, you guys mentioned payment activities should continue to recover in 2Q. I was just hoping you could frame that potentially in a range. And then, as you look out to a more normalized back half of the year versus where we are today, what kind of year-over-year growth in transaction volume do you think we could see at that point? I just heard some other players in the space talk about pretty robust year-over-year growth as we move into the back half of the year. I was just curious what you guys are expecting. Terry Dolan : Yeah. I mean, it's a great question. So when we end up, obviously, the comparables on a year-over-year basis kind of going forward is going to be pretty strong, simply because of what was happening in 2019. As we kind of look at different components of our revenue, let's take merchant acquiring as an example. In the first quarter, we saw \u2013 you know, overall, it was down about 15%. But as Andy said, the non-airline, non-impacted sort of industries was actually up about 10%. And the airlines continued to be depressed kind of in that 70% to 75% level, but we do expect all those different things -- all those different categories to continue to improve. Our expectation when we end up looking at payments revenues kind of overall across the categories that by the time we get to 20 - by the end of the fourth quarter or certainly very early in the 2022 sort of time frame that we will be back to pre-pandemic levels on a total basis in terms of total merchant acquiring, total credit/debit card as well as the CPS businesses. David Rochester : Great. That's great color. I appreciate that. Maybe just switching to NIM real quick. You mentioned new securities yields are accretive to the book yield and prepays are declining, so that should bring down securities premium and expense. I know you mentioned NII was moving higher from here. Are you also saying you think you'll get some margin expansion here as well? Terry Dolan : Yeah. Well, here's the way I would kind of frame it. First of all, NIM is kind of an output with respect to how your balance sheet is changing. And of course, there's a lot of different dynamics that are occurring within the loan portfolio today. Our expectation from a NIM perspective is that in the second quarter, it's probably reasonably flat, but expanding from there. And the dynamics are going to be really around loan growth balances, which will probably continue to be a little bit of a pressure, but offset by expanding and improving investment portfolio. And that's a driver of premium amortization. It's a driver of the fact that the differential from a reinvestment rate is getting much stronger because of the steepening yield curve and other factors. David Rochester : Great. So flattish in 2Q, expanding in the back half of the year, potentially? Terry Dolan : Yeah. Yeah. David Rochester : Great. All right. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Good morning. Andy Cecere : John, good morning. John Pancari : Yeah. So on the loan demand side, I know you acknowledged that you do expect loans to be pressured near term. I guess, can you just talk about when do you see a more notable inflection in loan growth? And what do you see as the drivers? And I guess also within the commercial side, can you just talk about the demand that you are seeing in terms of pipeline and utilization? Thanks. Terry Dolan : Yeah. John, great questions. So what we are seeing in terms of loan - so let's just talk about loan growth. As we've said that in the second quarter, we do expect us to start to expand, but it's going to be modest. I mean there's still - there's still, for example, pressure that will exist in certain categories. On the commercial side, what we are seeing is that pipelines are getting stronger really across most areas in most geographies. In addition, when we think about the stimulus that's been put into the system, there's going to be a lot of consumer spend, especially as the second half of the year develops. And I think that business is, what we are starting to see is the businesses are becoming much more optimistic. They are thinking about inventory build and they are thinking about the capital expenditure. And I think that those are all really good signs. And the second thing I would just say, probably more so for the second half of the year is that, we do see and believe that M&A activity is going to start to strengthen, and that will have positive implications with respect to C&I loans, which is all good. We have \u2013 if you end up looking at some of the other categories, the significant amount of stimulus on the consumer side has allowed consumers to be paying down debt, which is I think one of the things that the industry has been seeing. Revolve rates have come down and that necessarily ends up impacting balances. But just as a reminder, we do typically see an increase in credit cards in the second quarter. And so, those factors will offset each other a bit. Our auto lending has been very strong, and I would expect that, that will continue to be strong. So, it's a bit of a puts and takes in the near-term, but we do \u2013 I think the encouraging thing is we are seeing a lot of nice green shoots. And as consumer spend starts to expand and grow, I think that the consumer lending will come back as well. John Pancari : Got it. All right. Thanks, Terry. And then, Andy, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about M&A interest, both on the whole bank side and non-bank. I know a lot of attention out there regarding potential deals and certainly, a big discussion around the scale, the need for scale by \u2013 within the bank space given the competitive backdrop. So, I just want to see if you can give us your updated thoughts on that front both on the whole bank side, obviously, but also non-bank. Thanks. Andy Cecere : Yeah. Thanks, John. And I think our view is consistent with what we've talked about in past calls, which we're open to looking at opportunities would meaningfully move the needle from a traditional bank standpoint in terms of either acquiring customers or new geographies. And then in the non-bank space and we are active in this with as you saw in our payments business, looking to expand our capabilities and our distribution. And those are areas that we continue to focus on, particularly as we think about this payments ecosystem and adding either partnerships or capabilities through M&A. John Pancari : Got it. All right. Thanks, Andy. Andy Cecere : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Hey, a couple of questions. One, just wanted to dig in a little bit on payments and what you think you can do there on the corporate side, especially as you are one of the first to offer the RTP. And I hear from different institutions like clients are not that excited about RTP on the corporate side, but I'm thinking you might have a different point of view. So I wanted to drill into that a little bit and see if there's a needle mover that's coming over the next few years or not? Andy Cecere : Yeah, Betsy. This is Andy. I think there's a pretty significant opportunity here. First of all, there are a number of use cases that we're currently working with a number of customers across many different industries. But I do think that everything from the way request for pay, daily payroll, the way you're managing receivables and payables, the information that comes with it, the auto reconciliation. There is a lot of opportunity. Now the challenge is there's a lot of time zero investment required to get to that opportunity. And that's why we're working with our customers because we want them to understand the opportunity, and we want to work with them on that investment and the change in their processes to gain that opportunity. And \u2013 but I do believe that there's a pretty significant change coming and the payments mechanisms that we have used for years and years, particularly in business to business you're getting about checks and ACH and wires are all going to migrate fairly rapidly over the next few years. Betsy Graseck : And then your monetization of that is through increasing deposits? Or is there hard dollar fees associated? Andy Cecere : I think it will be a combination of both, not unlike how our payments business works today. Part of it is from the balance sheet and part of it is for fees. And part of it might be just having a fee structure to allow you to do the things that RTP will allow as opposed to perhaps a per transaction fee. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then follow-up question just on credit, I know you spoke about normalizing towards pre-pandemic levels over time. Does that mean around a 50 bps NCO rate? Or is that something lower because during pre-pandemic we also had certain asset classes that were net positive on the NCOs, meaning net negative, right? Like you had \u2013 you had recoveries in some of the asset classes. So just trying to understand when you say pre-pandemic, what kind of number you're talking about? Andy Cecere : I'll give you the high level answer then Mark Runkel is here with us. And you will add in. But yes, is the short answer to your question. If you think about pre-pandemic, we were in that 45 to 50 basis point range. As Terry said 31 is probably lower than one is normal over a longer period of time, and I would expect it to migrate back to that level. Mark, what would you add? Mark Runkel : Yeah, that's exactly spot on. There's not much more to add we're just thinking over time, we'll get back to a more normalized level, and we'll see some of those recoveries that you're seeing potentially come down. And we'll see the portfolio start to normalize back closer to that 50 basis point range. Betsy Graseck : And just given your experience and how many cycles you've been through, what should we be thinking about as a time frame for that? Is that next 12 months or that's more like next 36 months or some other time frame? Andy Cecere : First of all, any time I've tried to predict time frames in this environment, it's been challenging. So I don't claim to know any more than anybody else. But as we see the great improvement we have today, I think things start to get back to that normal level in the latter half of this year. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Scott. Scott Siefers : Good morning, guys. Hey\u2026 Andy Cecere : Hey, Scott. Scott Siefers : Thanks for taking the question. Terry, maybe just a little more nuance on the margin, are you able to quantify how beneficial an impact \u2013 the decline in premium amortization could be for the margin and NII going forward? In other words, so where is it now? Where would you to normalize out to? And then just any thoughts on contribution to the margin from PPP in the second quarter? So, I think given the window closure from the FDA in the first quarter, maybe a little lumpier than we might have figured previously? Terry Dolan : Yeah. Let me take the second question first. From a PPP standpoint, first quarter versus second quarter, we don't see that as being a big driver for us just based upon the size of our book of business and that sort of thing that we ended up originating. From a premium amortization perspective, what we have seen kind of on the way up is that on a quarter-over-quarter basis kind of in that anywhere from two to four basis points sort of range, two to five basis points sort of range. And a big part of it, Scott, will depend upon how quickly prepayment speeds do start to come down. So it's a little bit hard to kind of put an exact \u2013 you know, an exact impact in terms of what it will have in the second quarter. But our expectation is that, the prepayment speeds continue to linger a little higher in April, but then start to come meaningfully down in May and June. Scott Siefers : Okay. Perfect. That's great. Thank you. And then maybe, if I could return to the payments business for a second as well. Once we get sort of back to normalization, it seems pretty clear there's a \u2013 a large opportunity here, both in the US and Europe as things kind of normalize. Once we get back to that steady state, maybe just a thought or two on where the growth rate of those businesses in the aggregate, it kind of flushes out? How does it compare to sort of the rest of the \u2013 just the traditional bank part of USB? Maybe any thoughts on sort of longer-term trajectory there? Andy Cecere : Yeah, Scott, I'll take that one. This is Andy again. I think, as you said, we have the short-term cyclical positive that's going to occur as spending activities both for businesses and consumers get back to normal, as well as corporate. I think our longer-term opportunity is in that ecosystem we talked about. So we have over 1 million business banking customers that we define as $25 million in revenue and above. And we believe we can grow these relationships, just overall relationships in the neighborhood of 15% to 20% over the next few years. And in addition, we believe we can grow the overall revenue levels, 25% to 30% because of expanding the share of wallet. Because the fact is less than 40% of our merchant customers have a business banking product and an even lower number of our business banking customers have a merchant product. So there's a lot of opportunity there. And I think the upside is pretty significant. And it's sort of like what I talked about with the RTP, it's just not about card solutions, but it's about managing their payrolls, their cash flows, their payables and receivables, leveraging data, helping them run their business. And that's just in the business banking category. I think there's additional opportunity in commercial and corporate as well. So that will be our focus and I think that will be one of the drivers of growth going forward. Terry Dolan : The other thing that I might add is that we've been making fairly significant investment in e-commerce and tech-led sort of capabilities within our merchant acquiring space. And that is a segment that over the course of the last 12, 18 months have been growing kind of in that 25% to 30% range. And as that becomes a bigger and bigger part of our business, I think that, that continues to help our merchant acquiring space. Scott Siefers : That's perfect. Thank you guys very much. I appreciate it. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Ken. Ken Usdin : Question first, just on the fee side. I was just wondering if you can talk us through some more detail on your outlook for the mortgage business, understanding it had $120 million MSR adjustment this quarter. But you guys have been share takers on the production side, but obviously, you mentioned the gain on sale coming down. Where do you think the mortgage business can go from here and some of those puts and takes? Thanks. Andy Cecere : Yeah. Great question. So when we think about the mortgage business, we continue to think that on the origination side that we have been capturing market share. We think that there's still opportunity to do that. And here's the reason why over the course of the last several years, we've been making significant investment. We've talked about the fact that we've been focused on the retail side of the equation, purchase mortgage and home mortgages that originate from the home sale side of the equation. So even as re-financings come down. We do have the capability and the capacity to be able to continue to ramp up on the home sale side of the equation or the purchase mortgage side of the equation. So I think that, that is an opportunity. I think that our technology continues to outpace the competition and digital capabilities enable us to be able to capture that market share. So that's all good. You're right that there will be impacts with respect to refinancing starting to slow as rates move up. And that's something that we would expect and the gain on sale will start to decline as capacity in the system has gotten stronger. But I think that the implications of the investments that we have made have been positive and will continue to be positive. So while mortgage revenue is likely to come down during the year. It is still going to be a good part of our business. Did that help, Ken? Ken Usdin : Yeah. I was just wondering, do you mean come down on a year - on a full year basis, which is kind of obvious based on where we started? Or do you mean that it could still settle lower from where we just got to the 299? Terry Dolan : No, it's the latter. I'm sorry, the 299, keep in mind, in the 299 is about $120 million MSR valuation adjustment. So when you back that out or when you take - exclude that, we still saw some pretty significant production and origination revenue in the first quarter. And while it will settle down a little bit from there, we still think it's pretty strong through the year. Ken Usdin : Right. Andy Cecere : And Terry, that MSR valuation was more of a temporary phenomenon, and we wouldn't expect that to continue at that level going forward. Terry Dolan : That's right. That's right. Ken Usdin : Right. So it was more of a - okay, just to check you again, it was more of a - obviously, it's going to be a tough comp on a full year, full year basis, but this might not have been the top tick for mortgage banking revenues going forward? Terry Dolan : Absolutely. That's absolutely correct. Ken Usdin : Okay. Got it. Second question, just on costs, you mentioned flattish year-over-year. The first quarter had a really high comp number even with the seasonal benefit in it. And so I just want to make sure that, that, as usual comes off and much of that seasonal adjustment is in there? And then I know you said the COVID cost came down, but how much of a burden is that still in the cost number as well? Thanks. Terry Dolan : Yeah. Well, with respect to COVID, we had more costs last year. We continue to have those costs. And while it's come down some, that hasn't been an impactful change relative to for example a year ago. We still have all the cleaning costs and things like that, that we need to do. And I think that's going to continue until people get comfortable being back in the office, et cetera. When you end up looking at compensation costs, again, part of it is seasonal. Part of it is also when you end up looking at our performance-based incentives, you know, every year, we have to reset that to be fully funded. And last year, just given the performance and the payouts being significantly lower, there is the impact of kind of refunding that on an annual basis, so. Andy Cecere : And Terry, the third part is a stock-based comp for retirees is higher in the first quarter just because of the - that's the seasonal matter that you talked about is higher because of the way we account for it all at times zero. Terry Dolan : And that will come down in the second quarter. Ken Usdin : All right. Thank you. Terry Dolan : Thank you, Ken. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Hi. I want to follow-up first on Ken's question just on expenses. Yes, so the outlook for flat in 2Q is good. But can you give us some comments kind of looking to the back half this year and beyond? Because it does feel like the costs are still bloated. And as we think about revenue accelerating from some of the things that you talked about, maybe you can give us a sense of what you think you can do on the expense side and the operating leverage? Terry Dolan : Yeah. Well, Matt, as we've said, our goal is always to manage the expenses as best we can and keep them flat, especially in a kind of a challenging revenue environment, which we're still in. Certainly, as we get into a more normal revenue environment, we do expect that we would be able to achieve positive operation, but the timing of that is still difficult to kind of get your head around. And then have to see things like either rising or steepening yield curve, kind of a normalization of the payments space and just settling out of where mortgage ends up being. So a little bit hard to end up predicting kind of the timing associated with that. We do have a very strong focus with respect to expenses, though, as we think about the rest of the year and going into 2022. Matt O'Connor: And then, maybe, asking a little bit of a different way and segue into like some broader business metrics. You laid out financial targets at the Investor Day, it goes back in 2019. Obviously, the world has changed. Those feel kind of stale. What would be some updated targets if you look out two to three years? And I'm thinking the efficiency ratio, which has gotten quite high. And then any kind of ROE metrics that you'd like to update as well would be helpful. Thank you. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Matt. This is Andy. I think we talked about a 17.5% to 20% tangible return on common. And I'm going to focus on that ratio. While it was higher in this quarter, that was all because of the credit reserve release, and we know that's not a repeatable item. And as I think about this year, it's going to be below that, to your point, but we still feel comfortable that in a more normal environment, where the economy continues to strengthen, the rates continue to normalize and we get back to the normal spend levels. So all the things we talked about on this call, we still believe we can get to that 17.5% to 20%. And that number is what we think we get to when we get to that normal environment, which likely will be later this year, more likely as we get into 2022. From an efficiency ratio standpoint, same point and building on what Terry talked about, it's higher than normal right now, but the higher is principally because of new - the dominator, which is revenue. And again, as we get to more normal levels, our expectation and our focus is to continue to get to the low 50s. Matt O'Connor: Okay. So from the 62 in this quarter to - I'm sorry, you said the low 50s or the mid-50s? That have been the target once before? Andy Cecere : The long-term target is the low 50s. Matt O'Connor: Okay. All right. So that would obviously imply outsized operating leverage. Again, look, the revenue needs to be there. I think everybody gets that. Andy Cecere : Yeah. Matt O'Connor: But I think there's concern that if revenue grows 5%, and it's being driven by rates and loans, you can't have 3% expense growth against that to meet the efficiency targets. Obviously, if it's driven by mortgage and things like that, that have a lot of comp, I think people understand the higher expense growth. But you would need mathematically a few years of outsized operating leverage. Andy Cecere : Yeah. And if you think about where the revenue opportunities are, they're less directly comp related. So, for example, margin and payments have a different compensation structure than, for example, mortgage, to your point. And Matt, just to tell you, we're managing expenses very closely. We meet with all our business lines on a regular basis, and we're always balancing the investments we're making to get that digital acquisition, the customers, the growth that we've talked about against managing the short-term expenses and looking for efficiencies and operations and the way we're doing business on a day-to-day basis. So that's an area of focus, I can assure you for both, Terry and myself, as well as the entire management committee. Matt O'Connor: Okay. That was helpful. Thank you. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Erika. Erika Najarian : My follow-up question is actually a piggyback off of Matt's question. This is sort of the second straight quarter where results are fine, but the stock has responded less favorably. And Andy, I'm wondering, in the discussion of a normalized ROTCE between 17% to 20%, we hear you loud and clear through this call and other calls that you have made investments throughout the years. And you did hit 20% in 2018. I guess, the investor base is really - the feedback I'm betting is, well, what's the upside from here? And I'm wondering, clearly, rates have to normalize. And to Matt's point, operating leverage will be wider when we actually get short rates going. But can the initiatives get you to at least the top end of the range, again, imagine in a world where you have some normalization in the short end, but also we're past the point of reserve releases. In other words, have the investments potentially reset your normalized ROTCE higher or 20% is sort of the top end of what you see? Andy Cecere : So Erika let me take your question and maybe two parts. From a revenue standpoint, I do think for sure, 2020 was a low point for all the reasons you're well aware of, and particularly the payments business, which had significant headwinds. And those headwinds now have become tailwinds. And I think the same is set kind of - could be set for the margin component, which I think all the reasons Terry talked about net interest income, I think, goes up from these - from the points we are today. And at some point, particularly in the second half of the year, I think loan growth starts to come back. So I think the revenue has positive bias across all categories. If you go back to 2018, a couple of things. Number one is, we were investing in digital capabilities, and we had an increased step-up in that investment that I think is more leveled off right now. So you're not going to see that same increase that you saw the last few years. The second thing is we also have the opportunity from some of the branch closures that we've achieved, a 25% over the last couple of years, some of which will - has been and will be reinvested, some of which will come through the bottom line. And then as I talked about with Matt, we're looking for efficiencies from our tech stack, from the way we're doing business and our operational component. And those investments in digital, not only allow us to gain customer acquisition, but it also allows us to more efficiently run the business. And from an operating cost standpoint, it's favorable. So all those things add up to why I answer the questions I do. Erika Najarian : Got it. And just a follow-up there. Your efficiency ratio in 2018 when you achieved 20% ROTCE was almost 55%. And so I guess the question here is, are we being too optimistic by then concluding that if you do dial back down to the low 50s, that your natural ROTCE in a more normalized rate environment could be above 20%? Andy Cecere : Yeah. I think our return on tangible is that 17.5% to 20% is the way we think about it and the modeling that we have and the projections that we have would get us to that level. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Erika. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolf Research. Bill Carcache : Thanks. Good morning, Andy and Terry. Can you discuss how you think about pent-up demand dynamics and how they may differ across your consumer and commercial businesses, where do you think there's more gearing to the reopening? Is it either - is it consumer side, commercial side, are they pretty similar? And if you could work into your response, how you think the excess liquidity on hand impacts both sides in terms of loan growth outlook that would be great? Terry Dolan : Yeah. Let me kind of take it first, and then Andy can add on. But when we end up looking at the consumer versus commercial, I think that the stimulus that's been put into the system, we'll see that on the consumer side pretty quickly. In other words, consumer spend, we do expect to continue to ramp up from here and really probably through at least the end of the year. And you see that in the GDP growth, predictions or projections that are out there really being driven by that. I do think that, that's going to help us on the fee side of the equation. And it will also as the year progresses, help us in terms of consumer loans, which I talked about earlier. On the commercial side, I think that, again, there are things that the customers will need to do in order to be able to meet that consumer demand, if you will, and that is in the form of continuing to build their inventories and make some capital investments, which say just like many of us have been holding off. So the timing of that, though, is probably a little bit more subdued earlier simply because of the fact that there is a - as you said, a fair amount of liquidity and deposit balances that exist. And so they need to burn through that. Similar to what we saw the last cycle that we kind of went through. So what we're first going to see is that utilizing those deposit balances and then starting to see more robust sort of loan growth. And that's why we think it's really probably more a second half of the year before that starts to happen. Andy Cecere : I wouldn't add much, Terry. I think the last category to come back is going to be corporate T&E. That category is still 75% down versus 2019 levels. We all are experiencing what we\u2019re experiencing with not traveling right now, and I think that's going to be the last category to come back. Bill Carcache : Got it. That's very helpful. On your excess liquidity commentary, I wanted to ask if your mix of investment securities relative to average earning assets grew to just over 31% this quarter, which I believe is the highest that we've seen relative to your history, and it sounds like you guys expect to grow that from here, if I heard you correctly. Can you discuss how you're weighing the incremental NII opportunity there from growing that securities book with OCI risk and just from an overall asset liability management perspective? Terry Dolan : Yeah. I guess, when we think about it, at least in the near term, and one of the things we're going to end up having to do is to kind of weigh the opportunity that the yield curve continues to steepen even further from here. And so we'll kind of pick our points with respect to where we make those investments. But I think in the near term until loan growth and that demand really starts to solidify. I think that the ability to deploy low cost deposits that we see as part of inflows into the investment portfolio makes sense. And you are right, it is kind of a balancing act that you end up having to kind of take a look at and just based upon kind of our expectation that the longer end of the curve continues to move up, the shorter end of the curve probably lags out a bit. That, to us, makes some sense. Bill Carcache : Got it. If I could squeeze in one last one for Andy. Andy, can you discuss how active you are in your discussions with regulators regarding the uneven playing field with many of the fintech players, particularly those who are benefiting from things like unregulated debit interchange, which obviously originally introduced as a small bank exemption under Durbin, not for them. But is there any expectation for a little bit more of a leveling of the playing field? Or is this the competitive landscape that were - is just the new reality? Andy Cecere : I think our focus on that from a banking perspective is on the safety and soundness from a customer's perspective. You think about data protection, liquidity, ensuring that the deposits are there, all those things, which makes banks a very safe industry. We want to make sure that those same - that same level of oversight is there for our customers and for customers using some of those other capabilities, and that's a real area of focus. Bill Carcache : Got it. Thank you for taking my questions. Andy Cecere : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Andy Cecere : Hey, Mike. Mike Mayo : Hi. Okay. I have one, I guess, kind of negative question and one positive question. So we can start with the negative one first, I guess you've heard, but look, there's six years of negative operating leverage at US Bancorp, and there's stories around it, right? You had the regulatory situation and you have the pandemic. You don't have - you're undersized in capital markets, which have been a record versus some of your larger peers and you\u2019re over-indexed in payments, which has been hurt. So I mean, there's certainly reasons here, but, if you look at the cost linked quarter or year-over-year, they're higher. You look at the revenues like quarter year-over-year, they're lower. So, I know you've given some guidance, but just to be crystal clear, are you saying that PPNR is at a low point in the first quarter and should improve from here? Andy Cecere : Well, yeah, I mean, again, when you end up thinking about the dynamics we've been talking about, I do think that the rate environment and what we're going to see in terms of net interest income is going to be positive going forward. I think that, that is a tailwind. I think the tailwind that exists with respect to the payments will also help us as we start to look into, especially the latter half of 2021 and into 2022. So, I think there is a number of things that create tailwinds from a revenue standpoint that actually do help us quite a bit from a PPNR standpoint. Mike Mayo : And you also said flat expenses, at least in the second quarter. So, I guess one question is, with all the branch [ph] closures that you had, why we haven't seen more or less negative operating leverage. I just suspect you're investing more in your digital infrastructure. Can you share any of those numbers, like how much you're investing? I know you haven't disclosed that yet. But more generally, what are you trying to build, and when do you think you can get there? It's kind of like the payment ecosystem, connecting your payments customers with your commercial customers. What's the total addressable market? Can you become like a square like competitor? Just a little more elaboration on where you're spending and what the end game is? Andy Cecere : Yeah, Mike. And to answer your negative question with a short answer, the answer is yes, on positive PPNR from the first quarter levels for the rest of the year. In terms of where we're investing, it's what I talked about - just in the business banking side for our business we have about one million customers. And we believe there's - as I talked about, 15% to 20% growth in customer opportunity, 25% to 30% growth in revenue opportunity. And that's just in the business banking segment, not including commercial and corporate. So I think that's where a lot of opportunity exists. Where we've been investing is exactly in that ecosystem and the ability to acquire customers in a digital fashion, ease of customer use from a customer experience standpoint, reflecting the fact that they're not utilizing the branches. So we're closing the branches, as you talked about, reflecting transactions that are taking place there. They're taking place in the digital way, investing on the digital site. So that - everything you said is correct, and that's the way we're thinking about it as well. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens. Terry McEvoy : Hi, good morning. And thanks for taking my questions. Actually, just one left on my list here. The ACL ratio down for every loan class except CRE, up on a percentage basis. I'm just wondering, is that something to do with the COVID-impacted industries or anything else within that $38 million, $39 billion portfolio? Mark Runkel : Yeah. This is Mark. I'll just add to that. That's an area that we continue to be very focused in on either - you hit it right. There is some of those COVID-impacted industries, but I think there's longer systemic ships, if you will, potentially with office and some of the multifamily that we're continuing to be very focused and on then that could play out a little bit longer as could play out a little bit longer as we work our way through the cycle. Terry McEvoy : That\u2019s great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Andy, Terry, thanks for taking my questions, but more importantly, I applaud you for changing the time on your call. Thank you for listening. It's not always that we see that. A couple of questions. Firstly, you continue to see good growth in commercial products. Pardon me, if I - even though you did move it, there's still been lots of calls today. If I missed that, sorry if I'm making I repeat it. What drove that growth? And what do you see as the drivers there? What do you see as the outlook for that? I'll start with that. Terry Dolan : Yeah. So, on the commercial product side and maybe a couple of couple of dynamics. Part of it is year-over-year. First quarter was fairly volatile a year ago and had some implications on a year-over-year basis. There's some growth that is occurring. When we think about the future quarters, for the rest of 2021, I think one of the dynamics that will help that is that what we are seeing right now is with rising rates there are a lot of companies when they are thinking about their debt or capital structure pulling forward out of probably 2022 into 2021 some of their refinancing activities. And then if you remember from last year, there was a lot of activity in terms of capital markets. Companies really trying to rebuild or build as much liquidity as they could. And a year later, just given the environment and the economic outlook, they have the opportunity to refinance that even after just a year. And so they're taking advantage of that. So, it's kind of those activities related to churn, pulling some things forward, et cetera, that are going to help commercial product revenue kind of hold up through the year. Vivek Juneja : Okay. And then a different question for you folks. I noticed that branches were down a little over 100 or so. Andy, you had mentioned last quarter that you want to - you expect to shrink branches in the double-digit range. Is that still part of the plan? And if so, how much? And is that - what's the timing on that as you look out? Terry Dolan : Sure, Vivek. So, if you look at a couple of years ago, we were just over 3,000 branches, and now we're closer to 2,300. So, we're down about 25%. I wouldn't expect additional major changes in the number of branches. You'll have some puts and takes; in fact, you'll see some additions in certain markets and some subtractions or branch consolidation where appropriate. But I wouldn't expect a significant change from current levels. Vivek Juneja : All right. Thank you. Terry Dolan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line o f Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Terry Dolan : Hey, Gerard. How are you doing? Gerard Cassidy : How are you Terry? Terry Dolan : Good. Gerard Cassidy : Andy, can you touch on - and I apologize if you addressed this, but I know you guys have talked about the low level of net charge-offs this quarter is not likely sustainable and I think you said in one of the answers to a question earlier that, it could start to creep up by the second half of this year to the more normalized pre-pandemic levels that you have identified. Can you share with us why would cause it not to go up? What will you guys have to see that if this would continue at 30 to 35 basis points through the remainder of the year? Andy Cecere : Yeah, I'm going to start and then Mark can add in. Gerard, so some of the things we're seeing right now, individuals have a lot of cash, either because of the stimulus checks that have occurred or not spending money in other things. So our payment rates in credit card, Terry talked about that, that's impacting balances. All those things drive to near record levels of low charge-offs in our credit card portfolio, our delinquencies. And the consumer is just very liquid right now, and that's part of the reason that we're just low level. And we do expect that to continue to normalize over time as they start to utilize those savings and get back to spending money in a more traditional sense. So that's one of the things that we would expect. If there's a delay on that, then we're probably going to be at a low level for a longer time frame. And then the area that we would expect to start to migrate up a little bit as well is on the areas impacted by the pandemic that Mark talked about, and I'll let Mark answer. Mark Runkel : Yeah. The other area that I might focus in on is we've seen strong asset value. So if you look at autos has been strong. We've seen a 6% increase in auto value, for example, Gerard in February alone, as well as the residential real estate continues to be strong. So I think if those trends continue to strengthen, we could continue to be at these lower levels. But I think, RV would be - those start to normalize. And to Andy's point, the liquidity starts to come down, we see spending activity picking back up, which would lead you to kind of more normalized levels as we move through the back half of the year. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then just as a follow-up, Andy, over the past earnings calls, you've often commented about outlooks for mergers and acquisitions. And I don't think you were asked that question today. But what is your outlook for depository type of acquisitions? I know banks are sold, they're not bought. But just to give an update on what you guys are thinking about expanding possibly through that strategy? Andy Cecere : Sure, Gerard. And that did come up a little earlier, but our focus continues to be from a traditional bank standpoint is something that would be meaningful from a customer acquisition or a geographic sense. I do think the value and the importance of scale is even more important than it was 12 months ago or 24 months ago. So that's something we're very focused on. And then the other areas that we're focused on are what I would call, partnerships or M&A-related to capabilities on the payment side, building our ecosystem, building the distribution. And those are smaller deals, technology related deals that we've done already in the payments business, and we'll continue to focus on. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. And I apologize. I think you are answering you know second time. Thank you. Andy Cecere : That\u2019s okay. No problem. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Ms. Jen Thompson. Jen Thompson : Thank you, everyone for listening to our earnings call. Please reach out to the Investor Relations department, if you have any follow-up questions. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Following a review of the results by Andy Cecere, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Dolan, Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 11 AM Central Time, through Thursday, July 22, 2021 at 10 :59 PM Central Time. I will now turn the conference call over to Jen Thompson, Director of Investor Relations and Economic Analysis for U.S. Bancorp. Jen Thompson : Thank you, Ashley, and good morning, everyone. With me today are Andy Cecere, our Chairman, President and CEO; and Terry Dolan, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us on the call are our Chief Risk Officer, Jodi Richard; and our Chief Credit Officer, Mark Runkel. During their prepared remarks, Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation. A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. I'd like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Andy. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Jen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry, Jody, Mark and I will take any questions you have. I'll begin on Slide 3. In the second quarter, we reported earnings per share of $1.28. we released $350 million in loan loss reserves this quarter supported by our outlook on the economy, and continued improvement and credit quality metrics. The pace of which has been better-than-expected. Net Revenue totaled $5.8 billion in the second quarter. As expected, net interest income grew in the second quarter, while our fee businesses benefited from improving consumer and business spending trends. Notably, as of late June, total sales volumes for each of our three payments businesses, credit and debit card, merchant acquiring and corporate payment systems were above 2019 levels for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic. Our expenses were relatively stable compared with the first quarter. Turning to capital, our book value per share totaled $31.74 at June 30, which was 4% higher than March 31. During the quarter, we returned 79% of our earnings to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks.  Following the results of the Federal Reserve's stress tests in late June, we announced that management will recommend that our Board of Directors approve a 9.5% increase in our common dividend in the third quarter payable in October. Slide 4 provides key metrics including a return on tangible common equity of 20.9%. Slide 5 highlights continued strong trends in digital activity. Now let me turn the call over to Terry, who will provide more detail on the quarter. Terry Dolan : Thanks, Andy. If you turn to Slide 6, I'll start with a balance sheet review followed by a discussion of second quarter earnings trends. Average loans were stable compared with the first quarter in line with our expectations. Strong demand for our installment loans drove other retail loan growth, while C&I loans increased 0.9% supported by strong growth in asset-backed lending, partly offset by continued pay down activity in other C&I categories. We saw a decline in residential mortgage loans, increased pay downs and increased pay downs. Average credit card loan balances were stable compared with the first quarter as the payment rates remained high at 38%, reflecting a significant level of consumer liquidity. However, period end balances increased 4.5% on a linked quarter basis as we saw some pickup in activity toward the end of the quarter. Turning to Slide 7. Average deposits increased 0.7% compared with the first quarter and grew by 6.4% compared with a year-ago, reflecting the significant level of liquidity in the financial system. Our overall deposit mix continues to be favorable. In the second quarter, our non-interest bearing deposits grew 5.9% linked quarter, while time deposits declined by 8.1%. The time deposits now account for 6% of total deposits compared with 11% a year-ago. Slide 8 shows credit quality trends which continued to be better than expectations. Our net charge-off ratio totaled 0.25% in the second quarter compared with 0.31% in the first quarter. The ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was 0.36% at the end of the second quarter, compared with 0.41% at the end of the first quarter. We released reserves of $350 million this quarter reflective of better-than-expected credit trends and a continued constructive outlook on the economy. Our allowance for credit losses as of June 30th, totaled $6.6 billion, or 2.23% of loans. The allowance level reflected our best estimate of the impact of improving economic growth and changing credit quality within the portfolios. Slide 9 provides an earnings summary. In the second quarter of 2021, we earned $1.28 per diluted share. These results include the reserve release of $350 million. Slide 10, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis of $3.2 billion increased 2.4% compared with the first quarter, primarily driven by higher yields and volumes in our investment securities portfolio and favorable earning asset and funding mix shifts, partly offset by lower loan yields. Our net interest margin increased 3 basis points to 2.53%. The impact of lower loan yields was more than offset by a favorable mix shift in both our investment portfolio and funding composition as well as lower premium amortization expense. Slide 11 highlights trends in non-interest income. Compared with a year-ago, non-interest income was relatively stable as the expected decline in mortgage banking revenue and commercial product revenue was offset by higher payments revenue, trusted investment management revenue, treasury management fees and deposit service charges. On a linked quarter basis, non-interest income increased 10.0% driven by higher business and consumer spending activity reflecting broad based reopenings of local economies. Both year-over-year and linked quarter mortgage banking revenues were negatively impacted by slowing refinancing activity and reduced gain on sale margins. Linked quarter mortgage revenue growth of 15.7% was primarily driven by the favorable linked quarter impact of a change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights net of hedging activities. Slide 12 provides information on our payment services business. In the second quarter, total payments revenues increased 39.5% versus a year-ago and was higher by 16.4% compared with the first quarter. Each of our three payments businesses saw strong revenue growth on both a linked quarter and a year-over-year basis reflective of the strengthening economy and the increased spend activity. Credit and debit card revenue increased 39.4% on a year-over-year basis driven by stronger credit card sales volumes and higher prepaid card processing activities related to government stimulus programs. Sales volume trends, which are the primary driver of payments revenues are encouraging. The bottom charts on Slide 12 indicate that as of the end of June, total sales volumes across each of the three payments businesses exceeded comparable 2019 levels. Certain pandemic impacted spend categories continue to lag, in particular, corporate T&E. However, consumer travel and hospitality spend volumes are rebounding faster than we expected, and the pace of improvement in recent weeks has accelerated a bit. Turning to Slide 13, non-interest expenses was relatively stable on a linked quarter basis as expected. Slide 14 highlights our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio at June 30 was 9.9% compared with our target CET1 ratio of 8.5%. Given improving economic conditions in the second quarter, we bought back $886 million of common stock as part of our previously announced $3.0 billion repurchase program. I will provide some forward-looking guidance. For the third quarter of 2021, we expect fully taxable equivalent net interest income to be relatively stable compared to the second quarter. We expect total payments revenues to be relatively stable compared to the second quarter, but we'll continue to track favorably on a year-over-year basis. While we expect sales volumes growth in each of our three payments businesses to continue to improve sequentially, prepaid card volumes are expected to decline toward pre-pandemic levels as the impact of government stimulus dissipates. We expect non-interest expenses to be relatively stable compared to the second quarter. Credit quality remains strong. Over the next few quarters, we expect the net charge-off ratio to remain lower than normal. For the full year of 2021, we expect -- we currently expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately 22%. I'll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Terry. Our second quarter results came in as-expected and there are many reasons we are optimistic as we head into the second half of the year. The economy continues to recover towards pre-pandemic activity levels and the consumer and business spending activity continues to improve. Credit quality trends have been a positive surprise. And our payments volumes have come back a bit faster than we expected as recently as a few months ago. We are well-positioned for the cyclical recovery that we expect to play out over the next several quarters. More importantly, we are well-positioned to deliver on superior growth and industry-leading returns on equity over the next several quarters, given our business mix, our comprehensive and holistic payments and banking capabilities, and our expansive distribution model supported by world class digital capabilities. I'd like to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication throughout the year. We will now open up the call to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Terry Dolan : Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Andy Cecere : Hey, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi. I just wanted to dig in a little bit to the guidance and some of the discussion around the payments business. I think you mentioned that payments came in a little faster than expected. I know you were expecting that the payments revenues would accelerate in 2Q. So, it came in a little faster than you're expecting, but then I think you're mentioning that you've got it flat expecting it to be flat Q-on-Q, but I just wanted to dig into that. Is that because the acceleration rate you think is slowing down here, or are you being conservative with the guide for 3Q? Andy Cecere : Yes, I think it's a combination of things, Betsy, and maybe just by kind of talk a little bit about payments, again, overall, I think three things to kind of keep in mind in terms of the payments businesses in total. And that is the sales volume momentum continues to be very strong, especially when you exclude the airline and T&E sort of activities. Airlines and T&E continue to be lagging, but are getting stronger. In fact, if you listen to any of the airline sort of quarterly results, the leisure travel is really back to pre-pandemic levels and business travel is starting to pick up pretty nicely. The other thing I would just say is that corporate T&E continues to be the one area that is still down quite a bit, but it is improving a little bit faster than maybe what we had expected. The one area I would just say or highlight is let me talk a little bit about maybe the three components. If we first take a look at credit and debit card revenue, again, sales volumes are particularly strong in that area, as an example, credit sales in the second quarter, we would expect it to continue maybe slightly lower rate, but credit sales are about 20% when you exclude travel and entertainment. Debit card sales are about 27%. So the second quarter was particularly strong, and we expect that type of momentum to continue. The one thing that I would say though, is that third quarter of last year was the peak with respect to prepaid card processing revenue. And that has been slowly normalizing, but we really kind of expect third quarter to be back closer to what would be a normal level. The second thing that is going to end up impacting credit and debit card revenue for the third quarter is that we are taking the opportunity to invest in growth. So we're giving up some near-term growth opportunity in order to be able to generate customer account acquisition. The other thing that I would just mention maybe from a prepaid card perspective, on a normal basis represents about 10% to 11% of that overall credit and debit card revenue category. And it's that factor of it normalizing plus the investment that's really going to cause the overall payment revenues to be fairly stable relative to the second quarter. Betsy Graseck : Okay. So even though you've got T&E that is ramping, the prepaid is really offsetting that as you go into 3Q, that's really the conclusion? Andy Cecere : Yes, that's right. Betsy Graseck : Okay. All right. Got it. And then maybe you could talk a little bit about the credit box and how you're thinking about that with regard to not only the card space, but the overall loan book? Andy Cecere : Yes. So I think we mentioned this last quarter, but we're now back to fundamentally the credit box that we had on a pre-pandemic level really across all the product categories. Betsy Graseck : And your C&I was good, especially if I consider the PPP. So just wondering what's going on there to generate the strength you saw in the quarter? Terry Dolan : Yes, there's a couple of different things. We mentioned that asset-backed securitization lending has been strong, and it's been continuing to improve. I think that's one of the things that we are seeing in that particular category. The one thing though that we're continuing to watch is that the payoffs, or pay downs continue to occur. And that's simply because the rate environment, the capital markets activities continued to be fairly strong. And I also think it's going to take a little bit of time for C&I to develop simply because the amount of liquidity that customers have and are continuing to generate. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay. Thanks so much, Terry. Thanks, Andy. Terry Dolan : Thanks, Betsy. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. Andy Cecere : Hey, Matt. Matt O'Connor: So good to see costs flat last quarter, even though you had the beat in fees and you guided to kind of similar in the third quarter. But as last quarter as the fees pick up, hopefully different by payments and if rates rise and loan growth picks up, can you get outsize operating leverage? And last quarter you thought you could and that was a plan to hope. I know you don't give kind of formal guidance beyond one quarter out, but thematically, is that still the case that while there's investments to make, you would hope for outsize operating leverage as the revenues pick up? Andy Cecere : Yes. I mean, we certainly have that expectation. We've made some very nice investments across many different categories within our business, whether it's in the mortgage business, we see the benefit, especially as that starts to shift toward refinance -- away from refinancing toward the purchase mortgage. Our digital capabilities there will be very beneficial. I think that we continue to see strong growth with respect to auto end of term gains, the payments businesses where we've made investments, for example, in treasury management sort of capabilities and things like that, that is starting to pay off. So the answer is yes. I think we feel very confident that the investments that we have been making are going to allow us to generate some nice fee growth as we think about the future. Terry Dolan : And, Matt, we're going to continue to manage expenses relatively stable with the headwinds we have in revenue, like you talked about the flat yield curve and margin and loan growth being a little bit challenged, but we will manage flat in this environment and then positive operating leverage in a more normal revenue environment. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then just separately, you recently announced a deal to acquire part of this PFM. Maybe just what is that exactly -- how does it fit into USB. And I had to remind myself, I think you had owned an asset management company that you sold about 10 years ago, FAF. So is this kind of a get back into a certain business exit or a different part of the investment in wealth management segment? Terry Dolan : Yes, Matt, so like you referenced, a few years ago, we did sell but that was equities and bond business. We continue to retain the money market business and in fact have about $161 billion of assets under management. And so this essentially doubles that base with a particular focus on government, which is the space around government investment pools. And it fits very nicely into our government banking business or treasury management, and particularly our corporate trust business. So it's a nice add on to a business we're already in that gives us additional scale on customer acquisition. Matt O'Connor: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Terry Dolan : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Andy Cecere : Good morning, John. John Pancari : Good morning. Good morning. On the -- back on the payment side, just as we continue to see the rebound that you're flagging play out, I guess can you help us think about how you view the long-term growth potential business perhaps beyond this year. What is a reasonable growth rate to expect out of the various payments business? And then separately, are you viewing competition in the space any differently today than a couple of years ago? It certainly seems like it's intensifying and -- so how do you view that as a dynamic as well? Thanks. Terry Dolan : Yes. So let me just talk about maybe how we think about on a longer term basis. Certainly when we think about the payments businesses, we believe that mid single digits is a good target for us to be able to achieve in that particular space. We have been making some --as I said, some really nice investments. The tech-led fees for example, within Elavon, our merchant acquiring space today represent about 28% of the overall Elavon revenue or merchant acquiring revenue. And it's growing at about that pace as well. So, it's a nice business investment that we've made and tech-led will contribute to the overall investment as we go. And then I do think that our investments in the RPS digital account acquisition and in our treasury management space all those different types of investments on the B2B real time payments are going to -- are going to have real opportunity for growth in treasury management as an example. But half of that revenue today represents what I would call digital or forward leaning type of revenue products as opposed to legacy products. And they grow at about a 10% to 11% clip. So I think that there's some real opportunity for mid single digits are in that ballpark anyway. Andy? Andy Cecere : I agree, Terry. And I think in addition to what you said, which is sort of the current case, I would point to our focus on business banking, and this weaving together of the banking and payments capabilities into a comprehensive product set. And as a reminder, we have just over a million business banking customers with less than 40% penetration. I think it presents a lot of opportunity. And we've talked about the fact that we expect to grow that revenue base 25% to 30% over the next few years. So I think that's an additional opportunity in addition to what Terry talked about. John Pancari : All right. Great, thanks. That's helpful. Then separately on the capital front with the CET ratio at 9.9%, your internal target still sit at 0.5% and how should we think about migration down towards that level in terms of timing -- what type of factors are influencing the pace that you migrate back or towards that target? Thanks. Terry Dolan : Yes, great question. And currently I think we have capacity under our buyback program. It's about a $3 billion program and we have purchased about half of that thus far. So we'll continue to purchase under that buyback program. And then we certainly have the opportunity to be able to expand that or replace it in the future. We think about deploying or utilizing capital kind of along the various priorities organic growth being really the top priority and the dividend, as Andy talked about earlier. Then we look at inorganic sort of opportunities to the extent that they might present themselves or product sort of capabilities, and then the buyback program. So, that's kind of how we end up prioritizing it. From a timing standpoint, I think we're going to continue to watch both from an economic standpoint, but we're just going to be opportunistic in the market when it makes sense to be buying back shares. John Pancari : Got it. All right. Thanks, Terry. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Scott Siefers : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Terry Dolan : Sure. Scott Siefers : I Was hoping to sort of revisit this notion of the sort of competitive positioning in payments. I think one of the big things that I hear on USB is that the payments businesses, it's just such a wonderful differentiator vis-\u00e0-vis other banks, but the -- sort of the volume trends versus some of your fintech competitors aren't as striking now. A lot of them are much newer companies and stuff like that, so it makes sense. But we'll just be curious to hear your thoughts on sort of competitive positioning overall, and what do you think you're doing especially well, but would -- might need some work conversely as well. Andy Cecere : So, Scott, this is Andy. We -- as Terry talked about the investments we are making on the digital front and the capabilities around software and tech-led, and I think that has really put us in a great spot. But I think even more important is this weaving together, like I referenced earlier of the banking and the payments into a comprehensive product set to help these companies run their businesses so that banking payments combination, I think is particularly important. And the fact that we have strong banking capabilities and strong payments capabilities as I think, how good we're going to differentiate ourselves. And it's on two fronts. One is to extend the current capabilities to current customers, but more importantly to achieve customer acquisition at higher growth rates. So that's where we're focused on. Scott Siefers : Okay. All right. Perfect. Thank you. And then maybe separately, Terry you talked about maybe the degree to which you're seeing sort of institutional deposit inflows related, if at all to like the largest banks maybe turning them away given their own sort of thresholds and [technical difficulty]. And so what what's the way you\u2019re thinking about the potential for sort of customer acquisition on the deposit side there in the institutional area, but particularly when there's not necessarily a ton of robust loan growth to immediately kind of utilize those funds there? Terry Dolan : Yes, a great question. It's a little hard to know exactly what the implications are of other actions that it has on us. But maybe when I end up looking at where our growth is occurring, that the strongest growth is really coming from our consumer and business banking segment rather than on the institutional side. The institutional has actually probably been staying relatively flat or even coming down based upon rates that are being offered, et cetera. But the strong growth is really on the consumer side and we think that that's because of our digital capabilities and customer acquisition sort of strategies, and then the liquidity that customers have. Scott Siefers : Okay. All right, perfect. Thank you guys very much for taking the questions. Operator : Your next question comes from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Bill. Bill Carcache : Hey, good morning, Andy and Terry. I wanted to follow-up on the comments you just made and ask maybe a little bit more specifically, if you could sort of juxtapose for us the growth outlooks in consumer and commercial and talk a little bit about maybe where you see the greater potential for inflection, given all the moving parts that we're seeing around, the supply chain dynamics and pent-up demand and all the liquidity and all of that. We'd love to hear your thoughts as you kind of look at those businesses next to each other. Andy Cecere : Yes. So, Bill, the opportunity on the consumer side, I think continues to be the economic recovery that's occurring and the strengthen in payments and Terry talked about the trends across all three of the payments categories, particularly card spend, and even things like travel entertainment, while still lower, weaker than pre-pandemic levels coming back strong and rapidly. So that's a positive. And then we have sort of the secular trend that I talked about, which was in the business banking side, which is this combination of payments and business. And so those the economic recovery on the consumer side, and the secular focus on the business side would be the two areas, I would emphasize. Bill Carcache : Got it. Thank you. And then I was hoping that you could give your thoughts on the open banking aspect of Biden's executive order making it easier and cheaper to switch banks by requiring banks to allow customers to take their financial transaction data with them to competitor. Just curious if you had any broad high level thoughts on that? Andy Cecere : Yes, one of the reasons we're investing in all these digital capabilities because we want to be the very best in terms of digital and have great capabilities to serve our customers. And that combined with the human element -- finance is complicated, and having people in addition to digital, I think is critically important. So that's how we think we're going to effectively compete in long run and that's what we're focused on. Bill Carcache : Got it. And if I could squeeze in one last one. Andy Cecere : Sure. Bill Carcache : Is there any concern around to child tax credits? And I guess you talked about the improving -- the payments revenues sort of stable, but improving and like there's been this whole dynamic with payment rates being elevated, but hope that they get better. Does -- the child tax credit sort of extend the recovery, push it further out? Or maybe any thoughts on how you guys are viewing that? Terry Dolan : Yes, I think maybe one of the ways to think about it is the child tax credits, they typically end up getting in great big lump sum. And now when you spread it out kind of on a quarterly basis or more throughout the year, I think it just gives people the opportunity to be able to utilize that maybe a little bit more effectively in terms of paying their lifestyle sort of bills. So I don't think -- I don't -- it might change in terms of timing as much as anything, but I don't think is necessarily a major driver. Andy, do you have a different perspective? Andy Cecere : I agree, Terry. We actually -- we've talked about the payment rate being high 30s or 38% in the second quarter, but it's also stabilized. It was growing for a number of quarters and which has put pressure obviously on the card balances, but stabilization on that payment rate combined with increased spend, I think will perhaps lead to growth in the next few quarters on the card side. Bill Carcache : Got it. Thank you for taking my questions. Andy Cecere : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Andy Cecere : Hey, john. Terry Dolan : Hey, John. John McDonald : Hi, good morning. Terry, I was wondering if you could unpack a little bit the outlook for next quarter NII, just kind of thoughts on puts and takes on margin versus volume as you look at the stable outlook for net interest income. Terry Dolan : Yes, I mean a big part of that is just what rates have done. But let me kind of step back, I mean, we had a really nice quarter in terms of the growth that was driven in part by the investment portfolio growth that we had in the second quarter. We were opportunistic in investing when the 10-year was kind of in that 175 range and we put some cash to work at that particular point in time. We also saw some benefits associated with the premium amortization expense being a little bit lower. When we think about the second, or the next quarter, I think maybe the puts and takes are going to be -- we expect loan growth to be relatively flat, but modestly stronger than what we saw on the linked quarter basis in the second quarter. Our expectation is that the long end of the curve comes up a little bit, but is not much. And then, I think that the margin is relatively stable. So, I think, when we end up looking at the various components of it, that's kind of how we think about it. Loan growth, we are seeing it in that asset-backed securitization lending. We do expect consumer lending to get a little bit stronger, because of the consumer spend activities that are taking place. Andy talked about the payments rates have kind of hit, we think a high in the credit card space. We saw some nice growth right at the end of the June timeframe. And while they'll continue to be at elevated levels, I think that the effects are not increasing, they may be coming down a little bit will help credit card balances as well. And then maybe when we also think about loan growth, auto lending continues to be very strong. And I think it's really kind of a combination of all those different types of things. John McDonald : Okay. And not sure if you touched on it yet, but any thoughts on the outlook for mortgage banking volumes and revenues in the near-term, Terry? Terry Dolan : Yes, mortgage banking, obviously, it hit its high in the second quarter of last year. And then it's been coming down simply because the refinancing activities have been slowing over time. When we think about the mortgage banking business, it has been influenced by that refinancing. But today the mix of purchase versus refinancing is about 60% purchased, 40% refinanced. Mortgage banking revenues are kind of back to what I would call pre-pandemic sort of level that we saw in the fourth quarter of 2019, first quarter of 2020, kind of in that ballpark. So, I actually think that mortgage banking is kind of back to that pre-pandemic level and the investments that we've made in our digital capabilities, our retail, mortgage business, and all those sorts of things will help us compete. We have been taking market share, especially in the purchase mortgage side of the equation, I think that's all kind of beneficial. John McDonald : Okay. Thank you. Andy Cecere : Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Terry Dolan : Good morning, Ken. Ken Usdin : Hi. Good morning, guys. I was wondering if I could follow-up on PFM. And I know details weren't released in the press release, but can you help us think about just what the type of contribution it might bring to revenues pre-tax income, earnings, et cetera, and use of capital? Terry Dolan : Yes. Again, we haven't necessarily disclosed all of that. I mean, from a capital usage perspective, it would be relatively insignificant. I think that one of the benefits may be of acquiring at this particular point in time is that if we do start to see rising rates, the benefit of recapturing some of the fee waivers that business has been experiencing, that's all upside to how we were thinking about the business when we ended up acquiring it. So, again, a nice acquisition for us because it gets us into that local government investment pool market. We will have a number one market share in that particular space. But, overall, from a company perspective, it's just complimentary to the money market asset management business that we have. Ken Usdin : And on that point, Terry, do you know what your second quarter fee waivers were in the core trust and investment management business? And how much that might have changed sequentially and should improve? Terry Dolan : $73 million was Q2, up a little bit from Q1. And I think $73 million is going to be the peak. Ken Usdin : Right. Okay. Last one. You mentioned in the press release that the first quarter NII -- second quarter NII was helped by higher loan fees. I'm just wondering, how much was that of a helper? And also, if you have any color on what the delta in just PPP loans was as you exit the quarter? Thank you. Terry Dolan : Yes, I mean, the delta first to second quarter wasn't significant. And when we think about second or third quarter, we don't think that is going to be significant in terms of, for example, fee recognition. Ken Usdin : For PPP specifically? Terry Dolan : For PPP specifically, yes. Ken Usdin : Okay. And were loan fees meaningful in the second quarter? Terry Dolan : Not really. I mean, no -- I mean, anytime you have recoveries, you have a little bit of a benefit associated with that, but nothing of significance. Ken Usdin : Okay, understood. Thanks, Terry. Operator : Your next question comes from David Long with Raymond James. David Long : Good morning, everyone. Terry Dolan : Good morning, David. David Long : The loan growth for your auto portfolio has been pretty strong. I\u2019m just wondering if you can provide some color on the split between growth in making loans to new vehicles versus used vehicles? Andy Cecere : Most of our activity is from our dealer finance business, and it's mostly new activity. There is some used in there, but I would say majority is new. David Long : Got it. Okay. And then as it relates to the mortgage banking, do you have the dollar amount of the favorable impact from the MSR valuation adjustment in the second quarter? Terry Dolan : Yes, I'm trying to remember in the first quarter, I think the net impact was about $140 million, kind of in that ballpark. So that would be kind of the benefit that we ended up seeing. So the first quarter it was $120 million and it was -- it's probably about $100 million of differential. Andy Cecere : Yes, I think that's right. Terry, it's about $120 million in the first quarter negative and about $28 million in the second quarter, I guess. Terry Dolan : Yes. David Long : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Terry Dolan : Good morning, Vivek. Andy Cecere : Hey, Vivek. Vivek Juneja : Hi, Andy. Hi, Terry. Couple of questions. First one, you mentioned, you'd be giving up some near-term growth in the card side due to investments. Can you talk a little bit about what investments and for how long? And why that would slow down your card growth? Andy Cecere : Yes. Well, anytime you're going through both customer account acquisition as well as the volumes are expanding, et cetera, your rebates, residuals, your card acquisition costs, all sorts of things are part of that revenue line. And so, the extent that is ramping up it's going to moderate -- quarter-over-quarter sort of growth. I mean, Vivek, we're always constantly sort of investing in that business. It's just kind of relative from one quarter to the next, how much we're investing at any particular point in time. We just think that given the strong sales momentum, the opportunity at this particular point in time to make those investments, we just think it's the right thing to do. Vivek Juneja : And then that would hurt third quarter, but then that should from a comparison standpoint not be a drag or flip the other way in the fourth quarter, is that how we should think about that, Terry, from a timing standpoint, as we model out quarter-to-quarter? Terry Dolan : Yes, I don't think that the amount of the drag increases in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter, but that\u2019s right. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Different topic, you said, lower MBS premium amortization helped a little in second quarter. Any color of what it was and how we can compare where you are versus pre-pandemic. So how much more room for that to come down? Terry Dolan : Yes, I mean, I would expect that the reduction in premium amortization in third quarter will be kind of similar to what we saw in the second quarter. And the margin impact over time as it was going up was somewhere between 2 and 4 basis points, kind of on a linked quarter basis. So, I think that you could kind of expect that same sort of benefit in, for example, the third quarter. It starts to dissipate or moderate as we kind of get out into late fourth and into 2022. Vivek Juneja : Okay, great. Thank you. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Vivek. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Terry Dolan : Hey, Mike. Mike Mayo : Hey. Your tech spend is up 20% year-over-year, if you look at the year-to-date numbers. So the question is, how much do you think you'll spend this year? What percent increase do you expect, what are you spending on? And any more meat on the bones you can give on combining the banking and payment businesses. Terry Dolan : Yes. So maybe from a -- from an overall tech spend, we talked about the fact that we make investment of about $2.5 billion in technology kind of broadly. Well, half of that is capital expenditure, but half of that is what I would call kind of run rate, if you will. We have been running at that level for some period of time. And the increase that you're seeing, Mike, is really as you're making those investment, it takes a little bit of a time for it to kind of get into the run rate, if you will. The -- I would expect that -- we don't anticipate when we think about going forward that tech spend amount will change a lot. I think the -- what we end up focusing on I think has been changing over time. For example, if I were to step back 3, 4 years ago, it was less offence more defense. And today it's probably 60%, 65% offence related around our digital initiatives, tech stack modernization, those sorts of things as opposed to playing -- having to play defense. So I think the shift is good, because it's more forward leaning and more revenue generating sort of activities as opposed to defense. And I think -- go ahead, I'm sorry. Mike Mayo : And just to clarify, I run the bank, change the bank, you'd say, now change the bank is like 60% versus 40% run the bank? Terry Dolan : Yes, I think that's a good way of describing it. Mike Mayo : Okay. And then you guys -- I ask this question every quarter and you seem to be playing it very close to the vest. You clearly have been investing a lot in combining the payments and the banking businesses to give -- I think you said on one call to be more time like or go after time, not then specifically, but the concept. Can you give us any more meat on the bones as far as what the strategy is, when we're going to see it? You said you want to serve existing clients better, but also capture a lot more new customers? And I don't know where to look for that in the external releases or when we should look for? Andy Cecere : Yes, Mike, it's Andy. We're spending a lot of time on that internally and I'll tell you what, we're going to put something in the earnings release in deck by the end of the year to give you more information on this. We are looking at it on a regular basis. It's one of our top priorities. I think it's a huge opportunity both from a increased penetration to current customers as well as customer acquisition, and we'll give you more on this before the end of the year. Mike Mayo : All right. I'll look forward to it. Thank you. Andy Cecere : Sure. Terry Dolan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Terry Dolan : The [indiscernible]. Scott Siefers : [Indiscernible]. Just curious, in the President Biden's executive order last week, some language regarding increased scrutiny on bank transactions. Just curious if you have any sort of early thoughts on ramifications or how it might or might not change your calculus on thinking about any opportunities that might come up? Andy Cecere : Sure, Scott. So as we've talked about, we want to be disciplined and have been about -- and opportunistic when it comes to M&A and any deal that we would look at would need to make strategic and financial sense and consistent with our guidelines. And I think the executive order will mean that will be additional attention for bank M&A. But we believe ultimately decisions will be driven by what's best for all stakeholders and that's how we're thinking about it. Scott Siefers : Okay, perfect. All right. Thank you guys very much. Andy Cecere : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Hi, Terry. Hi, Andy. Terry Dolan : Good morning. Gerard Cassidy : Terry, you touched on in your opening comments about loan growth and you mentioned about the C&I growth increased slightly and driven by asset-backed type of lending, but it was partially offset by the continued paying down activity in other C&I categories. The question is on the pay down activity. We know that many of the commercial borrowers have elevated liquidity levels, which may be contributing to this. But can you may be further elaborate on what your customers are telling you? Is it the supply chain problem where they just like your auto dealers, for example, just don't have the inventory, therefore they have this extra cash flow and they're able to pay down and with this then change as the supply chain issues for all companies, not just auto, starts to get ironed out in the next 6 to 12 months, which could lead to accelerated commercial loan demand. Terry Dolan : Yes, I mean, I do think that commercial on demand will start to pick up. I think it's just -- it's a matter of timing, when does that actually occur. And I do think that they have to get through the -- that excess liquidity, or at least some of that. And they also -- I think that they need to start making those capital expenditures, and we're starting to see that. I mean when we talk across our markets, I think that the, for example, middle market customers are certainly much more optimistic today than they were even a quarter or two quarters ago. And that usually translates into making longer term sort of business investment. And so, I think that we'll continue to kind of see that. I do think that we\u2019re -- I do think that supply chain is impacting to some extent. But I think that that's more transitory, I think that will dissipate over time in terms of the impact. Andy Cecere : Terry, I agree. And the only other key factor I think is many companies are awash in liquidity. They have strong balance sheets, they've been becoming more efficient and their balance sheets are strong, which would reflect in our deposits on the left -- on the right side of the balance sheet. So I think that's another factor. Gerard Cassidy : And just as a follow-up on this commercial customer discussions that you've been having with these customers, what's their view about inflation? Are they concerned that they're not going to be able to pass on higher prices to their customers, or any color that you guys are picking up in your discussions with these customers about the outlook for inflation and what it means to them? Terry Dolan : Yes, I think, Gerard, a number of our manufacturing companies in particular are passing on some of the increased supply costs that they're recognizing and it is a factor in their pricing as well. So I do think some of it is being passed on, a lot of it's being passed on. And I think this question around how transitory this is, is one that is often debated. But I can tell you right now, it's impactful, how long it lasts, I'm not sure. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then just as a follow-up. Andy, you touched about the liquidity helping on the deposit side. We also all understand what quantitative easing has done to the deposits of the banking system. Do you think that when tapering takes place, probably end of the year, let's say, there may be some pressure on deposit growth for you folks, or that you really haven't been impacted that materially by the quantitative easing by the Fed, because that's more wholesale oriented and maybe part of hitting their monies in their banks, maybe more so than you folks. Andy Cecere : So I think that we U.S Bank, and we the industry have certainly benefited from a deposit growth standpoint because of the Fed balance sheet. I don't think there's any dispute around that. I do think as that starts to diminish, you'll see some impact in deposits, but I also would point out that some deposits have also or some funds have also moved off balance sheet to money market funds. This is again this mix we have in this opportunity to go either on balance sheet or off balance sheet. So might -- some might migrate more to the on balance sheet component in that environment. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you. Andy Cecere : Sure. Operator : Your next question is from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi. Just a follow-up. A big picture question, Andy. You had 6 years of negative operating leverage. And we all know the reasons for that, from the regulatory to the investing to the pandemic and everything else. And I guess tactically year-over-year it's still a little negative. But quarter-over-quarter this is on the best positive operating leverage you've had in a while and it seems like it's not going negative ahead it seems. So are you willing to call a turn in that 6 years of negative operating leverage or is it too early or is that kind of a next year event? I know I\u2019m getting ahead of where you may be want to go, but it's been a long wait for the revenues growing fast and expenses. It seems like you might be there, but I'm not sure. Terry Dolan : Yes, Mike. So I think like I mentioned before, we're going to manage expenses flat in this challenging revenue environment. And the challenging revenue environment is a function of the things we talked about, which is this lower than normal loan growth is flat and low yield curve and the function of still returning to normalization and things like travel entertainment and so forth. So flat until we get normal and then positive operating leverage when we start to get to a more normalized revenue environment. That's how we're managing the company. Mike Mayo : Got it. Thank you. Terry Dolan : You bet. Operator : Your next question is from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to ask one follow-up. You guys have historically been very deliberate about your use of M&A to create value. As you look ahead, is there an opportunity to think differently, for example, by taking the strength of your existing franchise to expand into new markets and win customers without having to acquire legacy branch infrastructure or is sort of bank M&A likely to look the same as it has traditionally? Any thoughts around that topic would be helpful. Andy Cecere : Yes, Bill. So we've talked about the factors. Here's a few ways that we continue to grow and expand from a consumer and retail business standpoint. One is continued acquisition with our core organic initiatives around digital acquisition and focusing on that which we're making great progress on. The second is this concept of digital first branch light expansion like we were doing in Charlotte, North Carolina, where we've have fewer branches and really leveraging data and digital capabilities. The third is partnerships, like what we've done with State Farm. 19,000 agents who are really working to refer our card and deposit products. It's just an extension nationwide of our capabilities. And the fourth would be more traditional M&A, and we look at all those opportunities depending upon what's in front of us. Bill Carcache : Got it. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Andy Cecere : Sure. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. I will now hand the call back for closing remarks. Jen Thompson : Thanks for listening to our earnings call this morning. Please contact the Investor Relations department if you have any follow-up questions. Operator : That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Following a review of the results by Andy Cecere, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Dolan, Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 10 AM Central Time through Thursday, October 21, 2021 at 10 :59 PM Central Time. I will now turn the conference call over to Jen Thompson, Director of Investor Relations and Economic Analysis for U.S. Bancorp. Jen Thompson : Thank you, Erica, and good morning, everyone. With me today are Andy Cecere, our Chairman, President and CEO; and Terry Dolan, our Chief Financial Officer.  During their prepared remarks, Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation. A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. I'd like to remind you that any forward looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Andy. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Jen. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry and I will take any questions you have. I'll begin on slide 3. In the third quarter, we reported earnings per share of $1.30 and generate total revenue of $5.9 billion. Our linked quarter pretax pre-provision net revenue growth of 2.7% was driven by continued momentum across our fee businesses, growth in average loan balances, and continued focus on expense management resulting in positive operating leverage. We released $310 million of loan loss reserves this quarter, supported by our outlook on the economy and better-than-expected credit quality metrics. Turning to capital; our book value per share totaled $32.22 at September 30th which was 1.5% higher than June 30th. Our CET1 ratio was 10.2% at September 30th. Slide 4 provides key third quarter performance metrics including a return on tangible common equity of over 20%. Slide 5 highlights strong trends in digital engagement. On Slide 6, we are providing initial information about our business banking and payment relationships which we plan to update every quarter. Our complete payments ecosystem is a competitive advantage for us and provides a number of cyclical and secular growth opportunities. Over the next few years, we believe there is a significant potential to expand and deepen relationships within this ecosystem. Our starting point is that we have about 1.1 million business banking relationships, which we define as businesses with under $25 million in revenue. Currently, about half of our payments customers of this size have a business banking product, and just under one third of our business banking customers have a payments product. The opportunity is to both increase the number of business banking relationships and to deepen these relationships by connecting our banking customers with our payments, products and services, and connecting our payments customers with our banking products and services. As we discussed previously, we believe we can grow our small business relationships by 15% to 20% and related revenue by 25% to 30% over the next few years. Now let me turn the call over to Terry who will provide more detail on the quarter. Terry Dolan : Thanks, Andy. If you turn on Slide 7, I'll start with a balance sheet review followed by a discussion of third quarter earnings trends. Average loans increased 0.8% compared with the second quarter driven by growth in other retail loans, primarily installment loans as well as growth in credit card and residential mortgages. This growth was partially offset by lower commercial loan balances which were impacted by lower levels of PPP loans. At September 30, PPP loan balances totaled $2.4 billion compared to $4.9 billion at June 30. Excluding PPP loans, third quarter average loans grew by 1.8% on a linked quarter basis. Turning to Slide 8, average deposits increased 0.5% compared with the second quarter and 6.4% compared with a year ago. On both a linked quarter and year-over-year basis, we continued to benefit from favorable mix shift as average non-interest bearing deposits increased while higher cost time deposits declined. Slide 9 shows credit quality trends. Non-performing assets declined on both a linked quarter and year-over-year basis, and our net charge-off ratio hit a record low of 20 basis points. Our reserve release was $310 million this quarter, primarily reflecting strong credit quality metrics. Our allowance for credit losses as of September 30 totaled $6.3 billion or 2.1% of loans. The allowance level reflected our best estimate of the economic outlook and trajectory of credit quality within the portfolios. Slide 10 provides an earnings summary. In the third quarter of 2021, we earned $1.30 per diluted share. These results include a reserve release of $310 million. Turning to Slide 11, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis of $3.2 billion increased by 1.0% compared with the second quarter. The growth was primarily driven by higher loan fees associated with the Paycheck Protection Program. Excluding PPP-related fees, net interest income would have been stable, reflecting lower loan yields and the impact of change in loan mix offset by the beneficial impact of core loan growth, lower premium amortization, and an additional day in the quarter. Our net interest margin was stable compared with the second quarter. Slide 12 highlights trends in non-interest income. Compared with a year ago, noninterest income declined 0.7% as decreases in mortgage revenue and commercial products revenue more than offset strong growth in payments revenue, trust and investment management fees, deposit service charges, and treasury management fees. On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest income increased 2.8%, reflecting higher than expected payments revenue and a 20% increase in mortgage revenue driven by growth in production volume and related gain on sale margins, as well as higher loan sales. Slide 13 provides information on our payment services business. Our payments business continues to benefit from improving economic conditions and spend activity. In the third quarter, sales volumes for both our credit card and our merchant processing businesses exceeded the pandemic compared period in 2019, while CPS volume was about in line. As expected, prepaid card volume declined in the third quarter as the impact of government related stimulus continues to diminish. The reduced prepaid volume resulted in a slight decline in credit and debit card revenue on a linked quarter basis. However, corporate payment revenues increased by 13%, which was better than expected driven by improving business spend activity. Merchant processing revenue increased by 4.8% due to higher merchant and equipment fees as well as higher sales volumes. Turning to slide 14, non-interest expense increased 1.2% compared to the second quarter. This increase primarily reflected higher revenue related compensation and performance-based incentives. Slide 15 highlights our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio at September 30 was 10.2%, which increased slightly compared to June 30. At the beginning of the third quarter, we suspended our share buyback program due to our recent announcement that we have agreed to acquire MUFG\u2019s Union Bank. We expect that our share repurchase program will be deferred until the second quarter of 2022. After the closing of the acquisition, we expect to operate at a CET1 capital ratio between our target ratio and 9.0%. I will now provide some forward looking guidance. As PPP winds down and we approach the end of the forgiveness period, we expect PPP fees to decline $60 million to $70 million in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter. Excluding the impact of PPP fees, we expect fully taxable equivalent net interest income to be relatively stable on a linked quarter basis. We expect PPP to be immaterial to both net interest income and the net interest margin in 2022. In the fourth quarter, we expect total payments revenue trends to continue to strengthen driven by improving sales volumes. However, the fourth quarter is typically seasonally lower than the third quarter, which affects lead quarter comparisons. In the fourth quarter, we expect to see a seasonal increase in amortization of tax advantaged investments of approximately $60 million, as well as some seasonal impacts in marketing and business investments. Credit quality remains strong. Over the next few quarters, we expect the net charge-off ratio to remain lower than normal. For the full year of 2021, we expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately 22%. I'll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks. Andy Cecere : Thanks Terry. To summarize, our third quarter results were positive on several fronts, highlighted by a solid growth in core loans, good fee revenue momentum and strong credit quality. We're finishing off the year in a strong position heading into 2022. And we're excited about the many organic growth opportunities we see across the franchise supported by our continued investment in people, digital technology and data analytics. Our three payments businesses will continue to benefit for the improved spend activity, particularly as consumer and business travel recovers towards pre pandemic levels. More importantly, we believe our secular growth initiatives aimed at connecting payments with banking provide a meaningful potential for market share gains over the medium and longer term. Our business banking initiatives are still in the early innings, but we're gaining traction. And our partnership with State Farm continues to evolve and grow. We are encouraged by the results we're seeing. Aside from our organic growth opportunities, our recently announced acquisition of Union Bank provides a platform to achieve cost synergies, expand our distribution network and demographically attractive West Coast markets and leverage our broad product set and leading digital capabilities across a loyal but under penetrated customer base. All of this will enable us to accelerate revenue and earnings growth and continue to deliver the industry leading returns on equity that our shareholders have come to expect. In closing, I'd like to thank our employees for all they've done throughout the year. We'll now open up the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC. GerardCassidy: Good morning, Andy; and good morning, Terry. Andy, slide 6 is very interesting, as you pointed out, it's a new slide. Two questions on this slide. You talked about the growth that you are anticipating in that business banking area to get the customers that are business banking only to be both banking and payments. What percent -- can you get it to the 50% that you have on the other circle with the payments area? Can you get it to that area and how long would it take you to get there? And second, if you put in the Union Bank customers, how large will that 1.1 million grow to? AndyCecere: So, Gerard, Union Bank has about 190,000 comparable customers. So that would be added to the 1.1 million. And I do believe we can get to your first question that left hand side to the 50 :50 at least. Again, the way we're thinking about this product set is really a combination, a dashboard, if you will that helps these customers manage their business, payables, receivables, travel activity, payroll, and so forth in one comprehensive viewpoint. And I think that will allow us to both deepen the relationships as well as expand, so I do believe we can give that 50 :50 as well. GerardCassidy: Very good. And then as a follow up you guys are well regarded on your credit through the full cycle. And you're pointed out, Terry, that I think that 20 basis points is a record low on net charge-offs. What do you anticipate \u2013 when will things kind of normalize and I hate that word, because there's no such thing as normal credit card charge-offs, but it seems like how sustainable are these record low levels do you think as we look out over the next 12 to 24 months? TerryDolan: Yes, that's a great question. And your point about it is really being difficult to predict is right on. When we end up looking at and kind of looking at forecasts et cetera., we do expect it's probably going to stay at these lower levels for a few quarters, and that's going to start to normalize, probably doesn't get back there until what we would kind of define as normal, which is kind of 45 basis points to 50 basis points overall until at least the end of 2022 and probably sometime in 2023, but it is very hard to predict. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. BetsyGraseck: Hi, good morning. I had a couple of questions. One was on just loan growth in general. And I wanted to understand where you see some signs of life that might be accelerating as we move into 4Q and into next year, I asked because I saw a nice uptick in the consumer side, but commercial seemed to be a little bit weaker, I am wondering if what you're seeing there. Thanks. AndyCecere: Yes, so when we ended up looking, first of all, maybe the fourth quarter, we would expect probably modest growth going into the fourth quarter on linked quarter basis. And if you just kind of look at the puts and takes, and I think that this will play out over time, as well, but the puts and takes at least in the near term is that we would continue to expect to see reasonably good growth in our auto lending business, which has been very strong of late. And we would also expect that our credit card balances would start to strengthen, and a big part of that is both consumer spend, but we've also been investing in terms of account growth and various sort of promotional activities, so that will help to drive it. And then, as consumers spend, or excuse me, as government stimulus kind of starts to dissipate, which is, I think been slowly doing, we do expect that that payment rate will start to come down. It's really kind of at a historic high right now. And as that comes down, credit card balances should strengthen.  So, certainly on the consumer side, we expect growth in the near term. The C&I as you said, is a little more challenging. And the principal challenge there is that we continue to see a fair amount of payoffs and then PPP forgiveness is also dampening the C&I growth in that particular space, where we are seeing nice areas of opportunity in C&I is in asset backed securitization type of lending, mortgage, warehouse lines, some supply chain finance activities, those are all areas that have been of particular strength. When we end up looking at kind of middle market space, we are seeing lots of confidence in terms of customers and relatively strong pipelines. And so, we do expect that is an area of opportunity once we get beyond the drag of PPP. So, hopefully that kind of gives you some perspective in terms of some of the puts and takes. BetsyGraseck: And the PPP in the fourth quarter, I think you indicated it would be down obviously, Q-on-Q. But is it sizable in the fourth quarter? TerryDolan: Yes, it ends up coming down, and you saw we talked a little bit about the decline this quarter, I think it's going to come down probably half of that, again in the fourth quarter, and then it's hard to tell in terms of does it stabilize at that level or does it come down a little bit further. But our expectation, at least right now, Betsy, is that by the end of the fourth quarter, the vast majority of PPP has been forgiven. And the impact to for example, balances and net interest income and margin will be really immaterial when we think about 2022. BetsyGraseck: And in the fourth quarter, and is the PPP contribution to NII in the fourth quarter, what do you -- how would you size that? AndyCecere: I think it's modest Betsy. The peak quarter certainly was the third quarter and becomes very modest in the fourth quarter. BetsyGraseck: Okay. All right. And then just lastly, as you think about the forward look here on integrating MUFG Union Bank into your operation. How should we be thinking about the trajectory of the efficiencies here? Because when you announced that deal, and we had that conference call, we obviously heard a lot about the cost savings that you're anticipating getting from the MUFG USA side, but I'm wondering, is there a tech angle as well, on your legacy platform that will also be enhanced, and is this one plus one equal two and a half, for example. AndyCecere: So I think, just to remind you of the timeframes, we did actually put, submit our application for the transaction on October 6, so that is in our expectation is a close sometime late first quarter, early second quarter, with a conversion integration in the third into the fourth quarter of 2022. As we talked about on the call, we would expect about 75% of the savings, the efficiencies to occur in that first year 2023. And as we also talked about, Betsy, the real benefit here is we have the platform and it's a lift and shift from what they do to our platform, which allows for the majority of the cost savings and the second enhancement on that is our platform has more capabilities and in my view, have more opportunities, a better customer experience and more products and services. So there's also a revenue component as well. So in that mind in that view, yes, it is more than just one plus one. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. JohnPancari: Good morning. I want to see if you can elaborate a little bit more on the trends you're seeing in your payments business. I know you had mentioned the increased spend activity; I want to see if you can give us a little bit more color on how that breaks out. And then separately, maybe if you can elaborate a little bit on what you're pointing '22 expectation is at this time, based upon the trends you're beginning to see in the payments side. Thanks. TerryDolan: Yes, so maybe let me take the first part and then Andy can kind of pipe in with respect what we're seeing as we go into 2022, so maybe as a comparable to 2019, first of all, as we said the merchant and the card businesses now above 2019 levels. In the third quarter sales were about almost 5% higher than 2019 in terms of merchant processing. And if you end up looking at credit, debit card 20 plus percent above, where it was in 2019. So those have made really nice recoveries. And also kind of keep in mind that when you end up looking at merchant as an example, airline travel, entertainment is still down quite a bit. And probably, I would say, flattened a bit in the third quarter simply because of the Delta variant. But as we kind of think about going forward, and as you know, the Delta variant kind of subsides a bit we would expect that to start to accelerate again. If you end up looking at the card business, as I said, credit card and debit card business, the sales volumes have been quite strong relative to 2019.  And that's driven by consumer spend, the one thing that will end up impacting card revenue, is the fact that the prepaid continues to come down as government stimulus dissipates, but by the end of the year going into 2022, again the quarter-over-quarter impact will be relatively immaterial. And then the last thing I would just kind of talk about is on the corporate payments side of the equation is pretty much at 2019 levels. But the travel and entertainment, or the T&E spend, is still about 50% to 55%, below 2019. And we would expect that to continue to kind of normalize so we think that there's opportunity, still there for that to continue to strengthen. We have seen what I would say other commercial spend, strengthening quarter-over- quarter, and we would expect that to continue as well. AndyCecere: I think that's exactly right, Terry. And just to summarize what Terry said, ex travel, airlines, and entertainment activity spend is up versus pre pandemic levels in that 20% range or so. And I would expect that to continue to increase into 2022. I think the real opportunities in our travel category, which is Terry mentioned, if you think about merchant or card, whatever category you look at it is down in that 35% - 40% range as that recovers, that's where a lot of opportunity exists, as well as what Terry mentioned in the corporate travel, entertainment which is down closer to 50%. JohnPancari: Okay, great, thank you. And then I know you mentioned on the expense side, some marketing and business investments, at least for the fourth quarter, is there anything there that is going to carry through into 2022 as you're putting money into the business? I know you're -- you recently launched the buy now pay later product. So just curious if there's ongoing marketing and business investment that we should consider as we file in expense expectations for 2022? TerryDolan: Yes, I think as we kind of think about 2022, the level of investment probably doesn't go up significantly from here. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. EbrahimPoonawala: Good morning. Just want to one follow up with you on, comments around loan growth, if we specifically if you can address two things. One is the outlook for CRE lending as you think about next year, given potential disruption from -- the just changing work from home et cetera. How you're approaching CRE lending? And on the consumer side, do you expect -- do we need to see a big drawdown in the US savings rate before you actually see consumer lending pick up substantially. Or, as you pointed out, the government's stimulus program fading away are enough to see some next to that growth. TerryDolan: Yes, so maybe, to the first question with respect to CRE, we actually saw some growth on the linked quarter basis in CRE this quarter. The project level of pipelines, things like that are reasonably strong. As we kind of think about the next couple of quarters, though, I think what we're seeing in the marketplace is pretty strong competition. And so we'll have to kind of watch and see what happens with respect to pay downs, regarding with kind of return to office and some of those impacts, when we end up looking at it, maybe, in terms of the areas to watch I think that as returned office occurs, we are starting to see collateral valuations improving, and we're starting to see some of those trends improving as well. And I think that generally would be a positive thing in terms of CRE investment, by underlying developers and financiers. But I think that for right now we're just kind of watching what sort of pay down levels occurs because of competition. AndyCecere: And then on the consumer side of the equation, I mean, we're actually seeing and we do expect that credit card balances from here start to grow, possibly accelerate as we get into 2022. When you think about customers that are kind of revolving type of customers I believe that with government stimulus starting to dissipate that they are going to be looking to credit products, in terms of being able to support their consumer spend. And we've continued to see relatively strong growth in auto lending and I would anticipate that will continue dependent upon supply chain impacts associated with chips and things like that. But overall, we're fairly bullish on consumer lending. EbrahimPoonawala: It's helpful color. Thank you. And just on a separate note, in terms of when you look at the stickiness of the deposit growth that we've seen over the last 18 months, if you could just talk to your outlook in terms of whether do you expect deposit balances to continue to grow. And do you at any point as you look forward in the next year or two, expect deposit growth to actually turn negative in any meaningful way? TerryDolan: Yes, our deposit growth has been reasonably strong. But particularly if you kind of peel back the onion, it's been particularly strong in the consumer and business banking areas with year-over-year growth of about 16% linked quarter growth at about 1% in the third quarter. So I would fully expect that a lot of that will stick dependent upon, obviously, the excess savings rate that we talked about, we're also seeing growth in the wealth management businesses and we would expect that a fair amount of that would stick as well. So as we kind of think about deposits, we think we have been growing what I would call kind of the core balances quite a bit. As liquidity does come out of the system, though, I would expect that we would see some runoff or where investors start to utilize those deposits to invest in like CDO, CLO sort of structure. So within our wealth management investment services business, we would expect to see some runoff. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. ScottSiefers: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Hey, I was hoping that you might be able to address the durability of mortgage revenues at the current level; I thought it was a pretty solid quarter. A little better than I had anticipated and just hoping you can address some of the puts and takes on margin origination levels and just overall durability of this horizontal. TerryDolan: Yes, great question. Obviously in the third quarter, we saw a little bit of an uptick with respect to applications because of refinancing activities when interest rates came down. I would say, Scott, that over the course of the last several years, we've been making a significant amount investment in a couple of different things. One is a strong focus on purchase money area, and a fairly significant amount of our volume is on the purchase money side. So home sales to the extent that continues to grow should allow us to hold up really well. And the second thing is that we've invested a lot in the retail channel, and our digital capabilities, and we're taking nice market share in the mortgage banking space. So while mortgage banking revenue will trend in the same sort of way, as kind of the industry, I think that we do have the opportunity to be well performed in the industry. Andy, what would you add? AndyCecere: Agree. ScottSiefers: All right, perfect, thank you. And then I was hoping for maybe a little more color on expenses, particularly that comment you made earlier about the $60 million seasonal increase in amortization of tax advantages in the fourth quarter. Does that just -- does that go up and then come all the way back down or is there sort of a headwind that emergence in 2022? And then presumably, it's kind of a wash from an earnings standpoint, given a corresponding tax impact? How should we be thinking about as we go through fourth quarter and then -- TerryDolan: Yes. Great question. So what ends up happening in that particular space is about 60% of the overall production for the year happens in the fourth quarter. And so if you look kind of historically, we always see a blip in the fourth quarter, and then it comes back down in the first quarter, and then it kind of slowly builds, then we see another blip in the fourth quarter the following year. So it's usually, it's a seasonal thing in the fourth quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. KenUsdin: Hey, thanks a lot. Hey, good morning, guys. Terry, can you just make sure we understand the offset to that $60 million in expenses where we see that in the income statement? TerryDolan: Yes, where that ends up flowing through is in the tax rate. And usually what that ends up happening is kind of on a lag basis. So you'll start to see the tax rate improving in 2022 as a result of the investments we're making today. KenUsdin: Right, okay. And in the fourth quarter, do you see that in -- the offset to the $60 million in the tax rate, as well. TerryDolan: Very limited in the tax rate in the fourth quarter. That's why we guided, yes; it's really more forward looking. KenUsdin: Okay, got it. Thank you. Secondly, you mentioned in the press release that fee waivers were down a little bit, can you give us an update on what they were in the quarter, and also what you need from rates to get rid of the fee waivers. TerryDolan: So they were about just about $70 million in the third quarter down just a couple million dollars versus the second quarter principally due to the repo rate, we get about 50% of it back with the first 25 basis points and about 95% of it back with the second 25 basis points. KenUsdin: Okay, great. And then just last one, in terms of the payments businesses, again, like so on merchant, when we see growth in, can you just compare and contrast when we see growth in the volumes. I know it's mix dependent, but just with your mix of business, how -- what's the correlation between increases and improvements in merchants vis-\u00e0-vis the improvements that we see in the sales volumes. Thanks guys. TerryDolan: Typically what's happening right now is an exchange. So some what's coming back are some of the areas they have a little thinner margin, which is what's causing the differential on sales being up about 5% and fees being down about 5%. And so that's partly and this is -- I'm using these numbers versus 2020 - 2019. And if you look at it versus 2020, sales are up about 30%. And fees are up about 13%. So there'll be a bit of a gap there partly because of the mix of what's coming back. And as we look forward, I would expect a bit of a differential revenue growth being slightly below sales growth on a go forward basis. KenUsdin: Okay, thanks. Sorry. Can I ask one more? I forgot to ask about the expense you had on the airline and travel, was that a one time update? And was that meaningful? Can tell us how much that was? TerryDolan: The expense on airline and travel. I think are you talking about the investment that we're making on our credit card business or -- because what you really -- KenUsdin: Yes, and echo through expenses. TerryDolan: It goes principally -- Andy Cecere : Are you talking about the merchant airline reserve? KenUsdin: Exactly, yes. TerryDolan: Oh, yes. I mean that has been relatively stable over the last couple of quarters because fundamentally you've got -- people are flying, people are starting to fly. So that has been not material. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. MattO'Connor: Good morning. Can you guys give us an update on your rate sensitivity? The flexibility to add to [Indiscernible] swaps and how the UB deal might impact that? TerryDolan: Yes, so maybe just the last question first, the Union Bank is a little bit more asset sensitive than we are. And we would expect that they would probably add to our asset sensitivity, kind of in that 30 to 40 basis points kind of range to where we're at today. If you end up looking at first, second quarter, we're at about 280 -- 2.8% asset sensitive to a 50 basis point shock, we've been expanding that Matt, in a couple of different ways, we've been holding more cash, looking for a better kind of investment sort of entry point. And so that asset entity has been coming up, in addition to that, we have been just looking at different hedge strategies that have been expanding our asset sensitivity as well. So today is probably about 350, in 3.5% kind of asset sensitivity. And that's kind of the position that we're at right now. We do have the opportunity as and we have the expectation that rates are going to start moving up, at least on the long end. And so we're trying to be patient and be in a position to be opportunistic when rates are in the right spot. MattO'Connor: Okay, that's helpful. And then just separately, clarification question on payments, when you talk about the seasonality in 4Q, maybe remind us what that is. And I guess I was thinking it's on the corporate payment side, which may not be as seasonal this year as normal. But just elaborate on that. And I am kind of dig it in just because last quarter, you said you thought payments would be flat and ends up being a little bit better than expected? And it seems like it might be a conservative guide again 4Q. Thank you. TerryDolan: Yes, usually merchant is flat to down a little bit, but so it's seasonally affected in the fourth quarter card actually performs a little bit better in the fourth quarter because of holiday sales. But CPS is the business that ends up coming down because you have a significant amount of government spending in the third quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. MikeMayo: Hi, we got a new slide, the slide six, talking about combining banking with payments. But if you could just elaborate a little bit more, is it better to say, well, what are we looking at? We're looking at 28% of banking customers. What are we looking at? It's a lot of customer banking, customers don't use payments is the bottom line and you want to get them to use it. And half of your payments customers don't use banking services. You want them to use that too. I mean I think you said you seek to grow the small business relationships by 15% to 20% and related revenues by 25% to 30%. Over what time frame is that? And how are you going to do that? And when are you rolling out some of the new products that are going to help enable that? TerryDolan: Thanks Mike, first, you got the numbers correct. Second, this starts at 1.1 million customers, we have about another 190,000 that would be added with Union Bank. The timeframe is the next few years; we'll continue to add to this slide to give you more specifics, including the progress on these numbers as well as the thinking about revenue. The way we're going to do this is by a combined dashboard and product offering that has payments and banking on that dashboard to help those businesses run their company payables, receivables, travel, payroll, as well as banking products and services. We have been rolling out that dashboard, making enhancement to it as we speak. And we'll continue to do it each and every month each quarter. And that's the way we think about it. MikeMayo: Okay, so what is I guess how do you think about the profit margins on these relationships? I mean, it seems like we provide more one stop shopping. It should be a better service for the customer. And you should be making more on that. So not just the revenues. I mean, what would you expect the earnings to increase by, I assume more than 25% to 30%? TerryDolan: Yes, they will. I was quoting a revenue number. I would expect the earnings to be higher than that because the marginal cost of many of these products and services is not as high because they go on the platforms we are already have established. MikeMayo: Okay, and then lastly, since we're on the topic of tech, it has been six years since U.S. Bancorp shown -- has shown positive operating leverage. You have two quarters in a row, it looks like maybe on a linked quarter basis, and you showed it. Maybe you won't show that in the fourth quarter, you didn't talk about main quarter operating leverage. But can you commit to 2022 having positive operating leverage? I guess there'll be some noise with Union. But are you on that trajectory now, and if so, why? TerryDolan: Yes, Mike, there will be some noise with Union, as you mentioned, it's always our goal, we've made a lot of investments in the company, and those investments are going to do two things, they're going to drive revenue growth. And they're going to also create more efficiency in terms of our operations. And the tech stack modernization in particular creates a less expensive operating environment. So I think those are all positives. As we're looking to '22 that's always our objective; 2022 dependent a bit upon the yield curve and what happens with rates but that's our objective. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. VivekJuneja: Good morning, Andy. Good morning, Terry. Couple of questions. Can you -- investment securities, they shrank any color on the outlook? TerryDolan: Yes, I mean, our expectation, again, is that when we think about longer term rates, we do expect them to be moving up given the inflationary pressures and other things that are kind of just in terms of economic growth. So we have been holding off with respect to reinvestment of maturities and things like that, and building cash balances, kind of to improve our asset sensitivity. And we'll look for opportunities to reinvest that in the future as rates start to move. VivekJuneja: Okay. Thanks. Another one, different topics. Did I hear you say that you expected revenue growth in payments fees to be better than sales trends? And if so, can you elaborate? TerryDolan: No, Vivek, the other way around. So the sales number will be a bit higher than the revenue growth partly because of mix, partly because the investments we're making so for example, in card, as we have the sales growth occurring, some of the investments in new business generation comes through and impacts the revenue growth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. BillCarcache: Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the relatively softer commercial loan growth that you guys are seeing. Are you hearing anything from your commercial customers that suggests that the depressed line utilization rates are really just an extension of the supply chain problems that they're having? And if so, does that suggest that line utilization is unlikely to improve until the supply chain problems are resolved? Any color you can give on that would be great. TerryDolan: Yes, I mean, obviously, the supply chain is impacting customers, in terms of their ability to be able offer products and services, et cetera. But it hasn't necessarily come up in topic conversation with them. Certainly I do think that as supply chain challenges start to resolve themselves that will create opportunity for us in terms of line utilization and bank financing. But it's not something that has been discussed a lot with clients, let's put it that way, or that they brought up. BillCarcache: Understood, that's helpful. Separately on the merchant acquiring business, the Elavon business certainly puts you guys in a unique position to be able to turn on, buy now pay later solutions for your merchant partners in a way that other banks can't. Can you discuss whether you're considering offering buy now pay later solutions to your merchant customers? And separately, I guess a broader question. How do you guys think about BNPL? Does it pose disintermediation risks to your card business? Or is that BNPL customer really more likely someone who typically would not even qualify for a credit card. So BNPL is essentially just something that they're using that allows them to turn their debit card into a credit card and also helps merchants drive incremental sales. Any thoughts around how you guys are thinking about it and the opportunity if you see one? AndyCecere: Yes, Bill, so I think it's a little of both of the topics you brought, most of the ways you described it. So first of all, we have a number of test cases going on. We already offer buy now pay later on a credit card offering. Sometimes a customer wants to have a large purchase specific from a payment plan. And that could be a current credit card customer choosing to have a very planned set of payments going forward. And other times buy now pay later can allow for a customer who would otherwise not have a credit card to have, to acquire or purchase something using the buy now pay later capability. And in that sense you do partner with the merchants to increase the sales base of that merchant portfolio. So we're working on all those fronts. BillCarcache: Got it, and my other questions have been largely addressed. But if I could squeeze in one last one. On a separate topic, you guys recently announced that you'll be providing cryptocurrency custody services for your institutional clients. Could you frame the revenue opportunity there? And some large bank CEOs have indicated that they can't provide cryptocurrency custody services, but it would be great, Andy, if you could discuss what's different in the way that USB is thinking about providing custody and what gives you guys comfort doing that at a time when there's still some controversy and I guess unwillingness among some large players around providing those services? AndyCecere: Yes, so if so let me step back, our institutional investors are looking to participate in the digital currency market as an investment class, we have a large fund services business that provides fund services, transfer agency and fund administration to those clients, if an asset class that they choose to have is one that we need to be able to provide a service for, and will now offer cryptocurrency custody for those fund managers. And that's the way we're thinking about it. So it is really providing a service that we do for their other asset classes for cryptocurrency. And we've selected NYDIG to help us with that from a sub-custodian's standpoint. And actually a number of other banks do that as well, sometimes for their own customer base. BillCarcache: Got it and the revenue opportunity, any high level color on that AndyCecere : We haven't defined the revenue opportunity. It's early innings of this capability, certainly. And so it is really providing a full set of services to those customers. Operator : You have a follow up question from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. KenUsdin: Hey, sorry for the follow up. But I -- you gave us the $60 million to $70 million expected decline in PPP in the fourth quarter. I was just wondering that's the first time you've given us a number. Do you have the base of what it was total PPP net interest income in 3Q? TerryDolan: Yes, it was about $120 million. Operator : And at this time, there are no further questions. I'll turn the call back to the speakers for any closing remarks. Andy Cecere : Maybe one comment. Jen asked me to clarify something in the transcript or when I was earlier, I mentioned that the share buyback program would be deferred until second quarter. Actually it will be the second half of 2022 after about a quarter after we finished the closing. Jen Thompson : Great. Thank you everyone for listening to our earnings call. And please contact the Investor Relations department if you have any follow up questions. Operator : Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

Following a review of the results by Andy Cecere, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Dolan, Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at 11 AM Central Time through Wednesday, January 26, 2022 at 10.59 PM Central Time. I will now turn the conference call over to Jen Thompson, Director of Investor Relations and Economic Analysis for U.S. Bancorp. Jen Thompson : Thank you, Natalia, and good morning, everyone. With me today are Andy Cecere, our Chairman, President and CEO; and Terry Dolan, our Chief Financial Officer. During their prepared remarks, Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation. A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our Web site at usbank.com. I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Andy. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Jen. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry and I will take any questions you have. I'll begin on Slide 3. In the fourth quarter, we reported earnings per share of $1.07 and generated total revenue of $5.7 billion. We saw strong balance sheet growth this quarter, including deposit growth of over $18 billion, or 4.3% compared with the third quarter.  Average loans grew by 2% linked quarter, or 2.7% excluding the impact of loan forgiveness related to PPP. We are encouraged by the loan growth momentum and we have a positive outlook for 2022 given improving client sentiment and business conditions, and continued strength in certain focused commercial portfolios, such as ABS lending and supply chain financing.  The significant increase in liquidity provided by the strong deposit inflows this quarter puts us in a favorable position to support future balance sheet growth. Deposit growth provided the opportunity for tactical investment and cash management strategies that pressured the net interest margin for the fourth quarter, but was both accretive to net interest income and maintained asset sensitivity for a rising rate environment. Turning to fees. Underlying client acquisition and market share trends across our business lines were healthy and payment sales trends continue to improve on a year-over-year basis. This quarter, we released $145 million of loan loss reserves, reflecting continued strong credit quality, including a record low net charge-off ratio. In the lower right quadrant, you can see that our book value per share totaled $32.71 at December 31, which was 1.5% higher than September 30th. Our CET1 capital ratio was 10% at 31st. Slide 4 provides key performance metrics. Slide 5 highlights trends in digital engagement. Digital transactions now account for over 80% of total transactions and digital loan sales account for two thirds of total loan sales. Turning to Slide 6, we continue to believe our initiatives aimed at connecting our banking customers with our payment products and our services, and our payments customers with our banking products and services will allow us to grow our small business relationships by 15% to 20% and related revenue by 25% to 30% over the next few years.  Now let me turn the call over to Terry to provide more detail on the quarter. Terry Dolan : Thanks, Andy. If you turn to Slide 7, I'll start with a balance sheet review followed by a discussion of fourth quarter earnings trends. Average loans increased 2.0% compared to the third quarter driven by a 2.6% increase in commercial loans which benefited from new business activity and improved utilization rates.  Retail loan growth was driven primarily by higher credit card balances, growth in residential mortgages and strong production of installment loans, including auto lending. At December 31st, PPP loan balances totaled $1.4 billion compared to $2.4 billion at September 30th. Excluding PPP loans, fourth quarter average loans grew by 2.7% on a linked quarter basis.  Turning to Slide 8. Total average deposits increased by $18.4 billion or 4.3% compared with the third quarter. We continue to see a favorable mix shift with average noninterest-bearing deposits increasing by 5.4% and average savings deposits increasing by 4.4%, while higher cost time deposits declined by 3.0%.  Slide 9 shows credit quality trends. The ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was 0.28% at December 31st compared with 0.32% at September 30th and 0.44% a year ago. Our fourth quarter net charge-off ratio of 0.17% improved on both a linked quarter and year-over-year basis.  Borrower liquidity and stronger asset valuations continued to support repayment and recovery of problem loans. Our reserve release was $145 million this quarter, primarily reflecting strong credit quality metrics. Our allowance for credit losses as of September 31st totaled $6.2 billion, or 1.97% of loans. Slide 10 provides an earnings summary. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we earned $1.07 per diluted share. These results included a reserve release of $145 million. Turning to Slide 11, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis of $3.2 billion came in a little higher than our expectations. The $47 million decrease compared with the third quarter was driven by an $82 million decline in PPP interest and fees, partially offset by earning asset growth. Our net interest margin declined by 13 basis points on a linked quarter basis to 2.40%. The net interest margin decline was related to a 6 basis point impact from lower PPP loan interest and fees and a 6 basis point impact from elevated liquidity and related investment portfolio and cash management strategies aimed at optimizing our asset sensitivity going into 2022. Slide 12 highlights trends in noninterest income. Compared with the year ago, noninterest income declined by 0.6% as strong growth in payments revenue, trust and investment management fees, deposit service charges and commercial product revenue was more than offset by a decrease in mortgage revenue, reflecting the interest rate environment and lower securities gains and other fee revenue.  On a linked quarter basis, noninterest income declined by 5.9%, primarily reflecting seasonally lower payments and capital markets revenues and declining mortgage banking revenue as expected. Slide 13 provides information on our payment services businesses. Sales volumes in each of our three businesses exceeded pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter despite some Omicron-related softness in late December.  We expect year-over-year payments momentum to continue into 2022 as lagging sectors such as airline, hospitality, and corporate T&E benefit from a continuous cyclical recovery toward pre-pandemic levels, and as our multiyear investments in e-commerce and tech led drive secular growth improvements.  As we saw in our earnings press release this morning, effective January 3rd, U.S. Bank has eliminated fees for certain non-sufficient funds. We believe this is not only the right thing to do for customers, but it is a smart business decision.  For some time, we have been at the forefront of using digital technology to help our customers avoid overdraft charges, and our efforts have helped our customers more easily and effectively manage their money, which has contributed to increased customer satisfaction. This latest move is simply the next step in the process.  Turning to Slide 14, noninterest expense increased by $104 million or 3.0% compared with the third quarter. This increase was driven by higher medical claims within employee benefit expense and higher professional services expenses, higher marketing and business development costs. Tax credit amortization expense was also higher in the fourth quarter in line with typical seasonal trends.  Slide 15 highlights our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio at December 31st was 10.0%, which decreased slightly compared with September 30th, driven by risk weighted asset growth and the impact of acquisitions completed near the end of the quarter.  As a reminder, at the beginning of the third quarter, we suspended our share buyback program due to our recent announcement that we have agreed to acquire Union Bank. We continue to expect that our share repurchase program will be deferred until the second half of 2022. After the closing of the acquisition, we expect to operate at a CET1 capital ratio between our target ratio and 9.0%.  I will now provide some forward-looking guidance. We expect both net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis as well as our net interest margin to be relatively stable on a linked quarter basis with growth expected in subsequent quarters.  Under our base case scenario, which incorporates three rate hikes, we expect full year 2022 net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis to increase at a mid single digit pace. We expect mortgage revenue to be slightly lower in the first quarter on a linked quarter basis in line with slower refinancing activity in the market. Payments revenue is seasonally lower in the first quarter. On a year-over-year basis, we expect total revenue to increase at a high single digit pace driven by double digit growth in both merchant processing revenue and corporate payments revenue.  We expect credit card revenue to be stable on a year-over-year basis, as high single digit growth in credit and debit card fees is offset by lower prepaid processing fees. Excluding the prepaid headwind which will abate after the first quarter, we expect total payment revenue to increase at a low teen rate on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter.  We expect other revenue to approximate $125 million to $150 million per quarter over the course of 2022. We expect expenses to be relatively stable in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter. Credit quality remains strong.  Over the next few quarters, we expect the net charge-off ratio to remain lower than historical levels, but will normalize over time as the effects of the pandemic continue to subside. For the full year of 2022, we expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately 21.0%.  I will hand it back to Andy for closing comments. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Terry. Fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations and we are starting off the year with momentum building across our lending and fee businesses. We feel good about the trajectory of loan growth and are well positioned to benefit from rising rate environment. We expect client acquisition growth and account penetration to drive market share gains across our fee businesses.  In particular, we believe 2022 will be another good year for our payments business. Due to the Omicron surge, year-over-year sales growth has slowed somewhat in the past few weeks from the exceptionally strong pace we saw in the second half of 2021. However, if growth rates remain strong and we believe this will likely prove to be a speed bump rather than an extended slowdown, nonetheless the situation is fluid and we'll continue to monitor trends closely and update you along the way.  Our investments in technology to support our digital transformation and payments ecosystem initiatives are paying off, and we continue to look for uses of capital that will drive higher returns. In the fourth quarter, we acquired TravelBank, a FinTech that provides tech-driven expense and travel management solutions to help businesses manage their operations more efficiently.  Also, in the fourth quarter, we closed on the acquisition of PFM Asset Management, which not only increased our assets under management, but has enhanced our position in a niche area within the money market world. We are looking forward to closing our previously announced acquisition of Union Bank later this year.  The addition of Union Bank will increase our scale, improve our market share in a demographically attractive market, and add over 1 million consumer clients and over 190,000 business banking customers to whom we can offer our leading digital capabilities and our expansive product set. The strategic and financial benefits of this combination will accrue to shareholders over many years.  But the numbers only tell part of the U.S. Bank story. As we start a new year, I want to emphasize that how we do things will continue to as important as what we do. And so in closing, I'd like to thank our employees who come in every day with the goal of doing the right thing for our customers, our communities, their fellow employees, and all our constituents. Thank you for helping to make 2021 a successful year and position us well for the future.  We will now open up the call to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Scott Siefers : Good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking my questions. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Scott. Scott Siefers : Let's see. Maybe Terry, was hoping you could please discuss in just a bit more detail your updated thoughts on rate sensitivity, given some of the changes in the balance sheet in the fourth quarter? Terry Dolan : Yes. So we had the opportunity because of the deposit flows to be able to both invest in securities to help a little bit in terms of the fourth quarter. But we also, at the same time, utilized hedging strategies to keep the duration of those purchases relatively short. And the expectation, Scott, is that when long-term rates rise, which we're starting to see now, that we're going to be able to unwind those swaps and to be able to take advantage of the rising rate environment. So we did all of that fundamentally to be able to maintain as much asset sensitivity going into 2022 as we possibly could. Scott Siefers : Perfect. Okay, good. Thank you. And then perhaps either for Andy or Terry, maybe just a thought or comment regarding the anticipated kind of composition of loan growth through 2022, certainly sounds like a constructive outlook, but maybe just kind of commercial versus consumer as you see it? Terry Dolan : Yes. So maybe I'll just kind of start with fourth quarter. One of the things we saw in the fourth quarter, not only strong consumer continuing, but the C&I portfolio actually starting to expand very nicely. And we talked a little bit about that. So as we look into 2022, we continue to expect that consumer credit is going to continue to strengthen. Auto lending may be a little bit more moderate than it was in 2022, but I think credit card continues to be very strong as payment rates come down. And then we also would expect that residential mortgage portfolio loans would be growing. But I think the real story is that we're now starting to see a nice shift with respect to the commercial and the C&I portfolios. We're continuing to see growth in certain segments, like asset-backed securitization, lending and some of those sorts of things that we saw earlier in the year. But at the end of the fourth quarter, we saw a nice expansion of utilization rates. I think it was like 60 basis points on average, third versus fourth quarter, but in December it was up almost 2.5%. And we would expect to kind of see that. I think the other thing I would say is that sentiment on the commercial side, people are rebuilding their inventories. I think from a supply chain perspective, they still have some concerns about that. And so I think that they're being cautious about making sure that they have inventory to be able to run their business. And I think they're starting to make business investments ahead of the consumer spend that they see the economic growth that they see in 2022. So Andy, what would you add? Andy Cecere : Terry, I think you hit the high points. And two track changes in trends in the fourth quarter that look positive going into '22, Scott. Number one, as Terry mentioned, the increase in utilization rates, which we haven't seen for a number of quarters. And secondly is this started a decline in payment rates, which helps credit card volumes. So those are two positives I call out as well. Scott Siefers : Perfect. All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Terry. Good morning, Andy. Andy, coming back to the big transaction that obviously you guys are doing, you touched on all the benefits the Union Bank will bring to the table to U.S. Bancorp. Can you share with us what the update is on the regulatory approval process? There's a lot of obviously uncertainty in Washington today at the Fed and other regulatory agencies with the new heads coming in over time, maybe an update. Could this be delayed? What is the risk of it just being delayed getting the approval? Andy Cecere : Yes. Thanks, Gerard. So we submitted our application in early October. We've been working with Union Bank, and we have a number of acquisition teams both on our side as well as the Union Bank side working on integration activities, including technology as well as the business lines. And we've been responding and working with the regulators in terms of questions on the submission, which is normal course for this process. So we continue to believe that this will close in the first half. It may be later in the first half, but that's our continued belief with a conversion in late third quarter or September-October timeframe. So nothing to have us believe that it would be any different from that, and we're preparing for that timeframe. Gerard Cassidy : Very good, thank you. Andy Cecere : Sure. Gerard Cassidy : Obviously, there's a lot of discussion on your call and other calls about asset sensitivity and what the outlook is for this year. But pivoting for a moment, I'm kind of looking at what we're all going to be talking about on the fourth quarter call for '22 in January of '23. And I get a sense it might be more about credit than it is today. And you guys have stood out as being some of the best underwriters in the industry. Can you share with us what are you seeing out there in terms of underwriting from your competitors? Are people getting more aggressive to generate revenue, loan growth or no, everybody's still pretty conservative? Terry Dolan : Yes. Gerard, I think what I would -- the way I would kind of describe it, from our perspective, we haven't changed our credit box really at all. We really try to underwrite through the cycle. I think that there has been a lot of competition in the industry for loan growth over the last 12 months. And as you know, when the cycle turns, it's the decisions you made today that are going to end up impacting you two or three years down the road. So I do think that credit normalizes as we go through the year. I don't know if we can quite get back to where we were pre-pandemic, but I think that it will start to migrate in that direction. I would say that if there is loosening from an underwriting perspective, maybe we'll stretch it a little bit more with respect to structure, but it has been competitive both from an underwriting perspective as well as from a pricing perspective out there. Gerard Cassidy : And just to follow up on that quickly, Terry, how about exceptions? Are you seeing more exceptions to the credit underwriting box to get deals done? Terry Dolan : Again, from our perspective, we really haven't changed our approach at all. Again, I think from a competitive standpoint, again, they're focused on being as competitive as they possibly can in terms of their underwriting and their structures and their pricing. But from our perspective, we haven't really changed our approach. Gerard Cassidy : As always, thank you. I appreciate the color. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Gerard. Operator : Your next question is from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Andy Cecere : Good morning, John. John McDonald : Hi. Good morning, guys. Andy, maybe from a high level perspective, you might not want to give specific guidance, but just kind of your thoughts about the revenue and expense dynamics that you're looking at heading into '22, maybe some thoughts on the revenue headwinds and tailwinds that you're looking at and how you plan on managing inflation on the expense space? And just kind of overall, how does operating leverage feel as a goal for this year? Andy Cecere : Sure, John. And Terry gave a little guidance on net interest income for the year, but I will talk about the full balance sheet and income statement. We continue to expect mid single digit earning asset growth for the year. That loan momentum that we talked about looks positive going into 2022. We would expect revenue growth of 3% to 4%, John, on a full year basis as well as positive operating leverage of at least 100 basis points for 2022. John McDonald : Got it. And then maybe just a question on the NII guide, Terry. You mentioned three hikes. What's the cadence of what you've built in on that? And is there any rule of thumb for what one Fed hike of 25 basis points does to the NIM or NII, everything else equal, that might be helpful for us? Thanks. Terry Dolan : Yes. So our base case, as we said, bakes in three rate hikes, really started in the second quarter and then kind of as you might expect through the rest of the year. If you go back to just our disclosures at the end of third quarter, it really hasn't changed a lot. 50 basis points shock is about 3.5% from a net interest income standpoint. So I would kind of refer you back to that. If you think about three rate hikes kind of on that pace, you're probably talking about the equivalency of about a 35 basis point shock. So if you're kind of doing the math, you can kind of go to that. Andy Cecere : And, Terry, all those numbers are the impacts of net interest income. In addition, we have our waivers which total about $70 million a quarter, John, and you get about two thirds of that back at the first rate hike of 25 basis points and about 90% of it back at the second rate hike. John McDonald : Okay, got it. Thank you. Andy Cecere : Sure. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Andy Cecere : Hi, Betsy. Terry Dolan : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi. A couple of questions. Just on the guide, a couple of cleanups. The NII, mid single digit pace. Is that a q-on-q for 1Q or that\u2019s a full year '22 versus full year '21, excluding Union Bank? Andy Cecere : Everything is excluding Union Bank. And it's intended to be the guidance that we're giving for 2022. Betsy Graseck : Right. So that's versus full year '21. Andy Cecere : Full year versus full year, yes. Betsy Graseck : Right. Okay. All right, just wanted to make sure. And then when I'm thinking about the positive operating leverage of at least 100 basis points, that's obviously a nice uptick from what you've been doing recently over the past couple of years, I guess? Can you kind of highlight, is this a function of the rate environment being better primarily or is it also from some of the investments that you've been making that you are leveraging and basically able to switch on the optimization side of the investment spend? Andy Cecere : Yes, Betsy, I would say it's kind of a combination of both. The improving revenue environment certainly helps that, but we have been, as you say, making some significant investment in digital capabilities. And as that investment matures, we kind of fully expect that we would see some operating efficiencies on the expense side. We have been working through tech modernization, which that helps us and we're always looking for kind of -- from a continuous improvement point of view, trying to optimize the branch network as well as our operations. So I think it's a combination of both. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And on the investment spend side, there'll be some in integrating Union Bank, of course, but beyond that where would you be targeting investment dollars from here? Andy Cecere : Yes. I think that when we think about our technology investment continuing to have investments in our mortgage business and our digital mobile app capabilities, but a strong focus on real-time payments, money movements, and the whole B2B side of the equation is going to be important. And then, of course, we've been talking about the ecosystem between our payments business and our business banking. And so we'll continue to make investment there. So I think it's kind of a continuation of many of the same themes that we've had over the last year. On a core basis, we really don't expect any significant increase in the investment levels, but we continue to expect that we will maintain those investment levels going forward. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay. Thanks for the color on that. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Betsy. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hi. Good morning, guys. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Ken. Ken Usdin : A couple of NII cleanups please. So you mentioned that PPP was an 80 million decline, which I think was bigger than what you had anticipated previously at 60 million to 70 million. I'm just wondering, what kind of PPP decline do you still have in that first quarter outlook for NII flat sequentially? Andy Cecere : Yes. So the decline from third to fourth quarter was the most significant. It was a little bit higher than what we had expected. Part of that is because some of what we had expected to occur in 2022 actually kind of got pulled forward into the fourth quarter. Currently in our baseline or expectation is that there will be a very immaterial decline in PPP going from fourth to first. It's about $15 million, $16 million. So it's pretty insignificant. Ken Usdin : Okay. And is that the last kind of meaningful step down from there or there's a pretty much wind out from there, just trying to get to like that baseline where we can --? Andy Cecere : Really, we look at 2022 as being past PPP in all respects. So yes, I would agree that the first quarter is probably the last step down that we have. And again, it's not really significant and it's incorporated into our guidance. Ken Usdin : Yes. Okay. Second question, obviously, you did decide to buy securities, it looks like 30-something-billion. The yield on the book went down a little bit. Just wondering if you can help us understand the premium and delta and also just where you're buying versus runoff, front book-back book at this point? Thanks. Terry Dolan : Yes. So you're right. We did step up the investment portfolio a lot. It has to do with what I talked about earlier in that deployment of excess cash. We made that deployment in the fourth quarter. And while we did it in treasuries, we swapped it short. And so that is why you see net interest margin coming down as well as the yields related to the investment portfolio coming down. But we also did that because we want maximum flexibility as rates are -- as long-term rates start to rise, we would expect to kind of unwind the benefit coming through in 2022. So that's kind of how we're positioned in it. In terms of the overall investment portfolio, the vast majority of it was shorter term and with the hedging strategies. Ken Usdin : And just to follow up on that. So when you say you unwind it, do you mean that you're at the right size now or you'd rather see it go into loans remaining? Like how do you think about the mix of the balance sheet and earning asset mix as you look further ahead? Terry Dolan : Yes. As we go forward, I would expect that our investment portfolio will be relatively flat to fourth quarter levels. That's kind of our expectation. So the vast majority of earning asset growth is more on the loan side than it is in other areas. Ken Usdin : Okay, understood. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Andy Cecere : Hi, John. John Pancari : Good morning. Just on the loan growth front, I heard the color you gave in terms some of the drivers you saw in the quarter on the commercial side, et cetera. The end of period balances came in a fair amount above average. Is that a good indicator as we model out? And then separately, anything you can attribute aside from just the continued macro strengthening to the notable strength you saw in end of period growth this quarter? It\u2019s better than a lot of your peer banks. Any calling efforts or pricing campaign or anything else to call out on that front? Thanks. Terry Dolan : Yes, so you\u2019re right, John. We did see some pretty significant growth in terms of end of period balances. I think that that sets us up well with respect to 2022. One of the things it\u2019s a little bit hard because you have LIBOR transition, everything else happening. We don\u2019t know whether or not some of that is just people pulling forward LIBOR a little bit into 2021. But when we talk to our customers, I guess the thing that we see is that the underlying momentum and the underlying sentiment is pretty strong. They\u2019re actively out building their inventories again and all those sorts of things, I think, is when we think about kind of our baseline growth going into 2022, why we\u2019re pretty optimistic. But you are right. The end of period balance growth was pretty significant for us, and it wasn\u2019t because of any one specific thing that we were doing. It was pretty broad based across segments, across categories and across geographies. John Pancari : Got it. Thanks, Terry. That\u2019s helpful. And then separately on the payment side, just higher level. Given the clearly intensely competitive payments backdrop, I want to see if you can kind of elaborate on U.S. Bancorp\u2019s value proposition in the payments business as we continue to get this macro reopening or strengthening. And if T&E spend rebounds as you\u2019ve been flagging, how would you characterize your positioning in terms of a value proposition for customers? Thanks. Andy Cecere : Yes, John. So we\u2019ve talked about the fact that we\u2019re trying to really weave together our banking products together with our payment products and a comprehensive product set to help businesses, business banking customers basically manage the way they\u2019re running their cash flows and their business on a day-to-day basis. And that\u2019s our value proposition is that combination of payments and banking in easy-to-use dashboard information to help them run their businesses and manage their cash flows on a day-to-day basis. That\u2019s consistent with the TravelBank acquisition that we made in the third quarter and other acquisitions, Bento, and others that we made earlier in the year. So that\u2019s the objective. And we\u2019ll continue to focus on that. And I would highlight the simplicity component of that, the navigation. The simplicity of use is a real key to that on a go-forward basis. John Pancari : Got it. All right, thanks. And then one follow up to that, Andy. Just regarding that strategy, do you think you need bolt-on deals or anything on the FinTech side to continue to affect that strategy or do you think you have what you need? Andy Cecere : I think we\u2019ve made a lot of investment, both organic as well as acquisition in this capability. We\u2019re going to continue to focus on it, as Terry mentioned, but I think we have most of what we need. We just continue to model or refine the capabilities and simplify the offering. John Pancari : Got it. Thanks, Andy. Andy Cecere : Sure. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Bill. Terry Dolan : Good morning, Bill. Bill Carcache : Hi. Good morning, Andy and Terry. I wanted to follow up on Slide 6. Within your business banking relationships at the left, there was a modest increase in the number of customers that are now also payments customers from last quarter. Can you frame for us what the revenue benefit is of seeing that light blue region continue to grow over time? And how high can that 28% go? Andy Cecere : Well, again, we think that we can get additional movement on both of those charts, more banking customers using payments capabilities and more banking using payments. We talk about the number of customers. The revenue in that total bucket is about $1.5 billion as we think about the penetration. So that\u2019s the base we\u2019re working with. Bill Carcache : Understood. And then maybe separately, can you give a little bit of color on the process for converting some of those business banking customers -- the business banking only customers in that dark blue region to also be users of payments products? Just curious what the receptivity has been so far. And have you come across any pushback from customers who may already be using alternative payment solutions or has the customer base been broadly receptive? Andy Cecere : I would say that it\u2019s early innings, Bill. Let me start there. But I think the fundamental offering, which is a simple, easy to use combination of banking and payments products in one simple dashboard to help them manage their cash flows is a receptive thought from a consumer -- from a business standpoint. And that\u2019s really what we\u2019re focused on. Again, many of the customers have a banking product or a payments product, but it\u2019s weaving it together for that offering that we\u2019re focused on. And the receptivity of that has been pretty strong. Bill Carcache : Got it. And then lastly, if I could squeeze in one final one. On the increase in expenses attributable to competition and employee benefits, can you parse out for us how much of that was a function of greater production versus inflationary pressures and how much of that upward pressure you\u2019d expect to persist? Terry Dolan : Yes. Certainly what we ended up seeing, for example, in the Capital Markets business, it was stronger. So some of it is related to production incentives, a fair amount of it in the fourth quarter is also related to performance-based incentives that are driven by the overall performance of the company. So we certainly did see that. I would say, and maybe Andy you want to comment as well, certainly there is a lot of competition for talent that\u2019s out there. And I think the pressure is especially when you\u2019re looking for high skilled areas in technology and development, payments and/or digital sort of space, if you\u2019re in the hiring mode, you\u2019re paying top dollar in order to be able to acquire that. But that competition for talent is certainly increasing and out there. Andy Cecere : I think that\u2019s right, Terry. And sometimes it takes a little longer and sometimes a little bit more expensive, but that\u2019s all been incorporated in the guidance that we offered for 2022. And as a reminder, the other area that is challenging in this environment is entry level employees in the branch side. And we get the benefit of having Union Bank combine with us this year, which I think is a positive. And as we talked about, we\u2019re committing to frontline employees on the branch side to employment. And in this environment, that\u2019s a positive. Bill Carcache : Very helpful. Thank you for taking my questions, Andy and Terry. Andy Cecere : Sure. Operator : Your next question is from the line of David Long with Raymond James. David Long : Good morning, everyone. Andy Cecere : Hi, David. Terry Dolan : Hi, David. David Long : The last remaining question I have is related to your reserve level. And if you look back pre-pandemic, I think you guys were targeting close to 2% in reserves. You\u2019re below that now, just below that. What is the right CECL level of reserves for U.S. Bancorp here? And within your current reserves on the qualitative side, how much do you have built in for maybe Omicron or the pandemic still as part of that? Terry Dolan : Yes, David, probably the way I would describe the last one is we still certainly believe that there\u2019s some level of uncertainty that\u2019s out there in the economy, and so we take that into consideration when we go through the different scenarios that we kind of model out. Maybe kind of coming back to your first question, what is the right level? Obviously that\u2019s going to end up based upon economic outlook and what happens with respect to credit quality. But what I would say and you\u2019re right, we started the pre-pandemic or the adoption of CECL at about 2%. When you end up looking at the mix of the portfolio and how it shifted, we\u2019re kind of right at -- we\u2019re right at kind of the level that we had started with I guess is the way I would describe it. From a reserving point of view, I would just kind of keep in mind from -- in terms of CECL you have to provide for loan growth on day one. And so as loan portfolio start to grow across the industry, I think that dynamic of reserve release will probably change a bit going into 2022. And again, all of that\u2019s been kind of taken into consideration when we\u2019re thinking about our baseline forecast for 2022. David Long : Got it. Thank you. I appreciate the color. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Andy Cecere : Hi, Mike. Mike Mayo : Hi. I\u2019m going to give the question and then I\u2019ll give a wind up and I\u2019ll come back. But my question is why are you not planning for even higher positive operating leverage in 2022? And as you know, going back in time it was either some combination of Jerry Grundhofer or Jack Grundhofer or Richard Davis who said if you grow revenues faster than expenses, great things happen. And I\u2019ve asked this question before. For the last five years, you guys have had negative operating leverage. And during that time, the stock price has barely moved as of year-end when banks are up almost half and the market has doubled. So I think there\u2019s some relationship between the two. So it\u2019s good that you\u2019re guiding for positive operating leverage in 2022. I think that would be the first year in six years when you\u2019d achieve that on a core basis. But I think you\u2019re guiding for 7% to 9% revenue growth for this year. So I guess that implies 6% to 8% expense growth, which still seems to be a lot of spending. I get it. There\u2019s wage pressures. So it seems to me that just from the benefit of rates, you can get positive operating leverage, which means the tech investments aren\u2019t paying off to the bottom line. I don\u2019t question whether they\u2019re paying off. You\u2019re a conservative, trustworthy bank. But are the tech investments paying off in a way that we as investors can see those? And why don\u2019t you have higher positive operating leverage guidance? Thanks. Terry Dolan : Yes. Well, let me start with revenue just because I want to make sure that we\u2019re all on the same page. Earlier in the comments, we talked about the fact that we expect total revenue growth in 2022 to be in the range of 3% to 4%. When you think about the components of it, Mike, the net interest income is probably going to be at the higher end or maybe even a little above that range, but fee income is probably going to be growing at the lower end or maybe a little bit below that range. And the primary drivers when you think about fee income, we are still going to see in a rising rate environment mortgage banking revenue coming down. And then in our at least residual portfolio, end of term losses will be coming -- end of term gains will be coming down a bit and that shows up in other income. So I think that there\u2019s a couple of things that will mute the growth in fee income. The other thing that we talked about a little bit earlier is some changes in terms of our overall -- our overdraft pricing, and that\u2019s going to have a bit of a drag in terms of deposit and service charges in terms of fee income. So the range of growth, again, for 2022 in terms of total revenue is in that 3% to 4% range. So maybe that kind of level sets us with respect to our guidance or our expectations for revenue. On the expenses, and I\u2019ll have Andy kind of weigh in, but at least 100 basis points of positive operating leverage is kind of what our expectation or target is. That\u2019s going to be balancing short-term and long-term expectations in terms of investment. But we\u2019re very committed to being able to deliver at least that in 2022. So, Andy, what would you add regarding the investment? Andy Cecere : Yes, Mike, and just to comment on your question overall, we\u2019ve been focused on making the necessary investments in our digital capabilities and our payments business as we\u2019ve talked about that. We talked to you about that. And our objective is to position ourselves to be successful in this environment, and I think we are. We\u2019re in a strong position, and I think we\u2019re going to start to see the benefits both from a revenue growth standpoint as well as an expense efficiency standpoint, particularly as we see the secular trends starting to increase overall. So we made those investments eyes wide open, very intentional, at the same time balancing some short-term expense opportunities on the operating core basis. But I think on a go-forward basis, you\u2019re going to see positive operating leverage because of those investments. Mike Mayo : So just to follow up on the technology part, when we think about your level of investments, is that still increasing? Is it increasing at a slower rate? And my understanding was your past investments were for foundation building, non-revenue areas. And now the investments are for revenue areas. So if you could just think in terms of the tech investing relative to the payoff, where are you in terms of reaping those benefits? Terry Dolan : Yes, Mike, we\u2019re level off. So we\u2019re not going to continue to see increases in those investments. We did see some increases in the past five years, but I think we\u2019re at level set area right now, number one. Number two, we migrated from about 40/60 defense and offense to 60/40 offense right now. So most of the investments we\u2019re making are for revenue-generating areas, digital capabilities, payments, business banking and the other things we\u2019ve talked about. Andy Cecere : And the other thing that I would just add maybe is, and this is really more kind of looking into 2023, we don\u2019t really see a need to increase the amount of investment, even with bringing Union Bank into the U.S. Bank fold. And that\u2019s because, as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, most of this is just a lift and shift from their systems to ours. And so we\u2019ll be able to leverage all the investment that we\u2019ve been making and bring a lot of digital capabilities to their customer base. Mike Mayo : Great. Thank you. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Andy Cecere : Hi, Vivek. How are you doing? Vivek Juneja : Hi, Andy. Hi, Terry. A couple of questions. Credit cards, your period end was up only I think like 1.5% linked quarter. You saw a bigger jump in certainly the Fed weekly data. Any color on what\u2019s going on there, why it was slow for you guys? Andy Cecere : In terms of credit card revenue? Credit card and debit card revenue? Vivek Juneja : No, credit card loans, period end loans. Andy Cecere : Yes, what was really being still impacted at least for us is the payment rate is still relatively high. It did peak in the third quarter. It came down just a little bit in the fourth quarter. So until we start to see that measurably improve, I think that\u2019s going to end up impacting growth rates in credit card loan balances. Our expectation though, Vivek, is those payment rates do start to migrate down nicely as 2022 progresses. And so I do think that that\u2019s going to be a bit of a tailwind for us as we think about loan growth. And it will also help net interest margin and obviously net interest income. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Second question, the merchant processing decline in fees that you saw quarter-over-quarter, was that all Omicron-related coming in December or was there something else going on there too? Andy Cecere : Yes, from third to fourth quarter, that\u2019s really -- very, very little is really related to Omicron. We did see a little bit of a slow up that was kind of late in December. Really what is happening there is that as sales continue to pick up in travel and that sector, that tends to be a little bit of a different rate and so it\u2019s more of a mix thing than it is anything else, Vivek. Vivek Juneja : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Your final question is from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Terry Dolan : Good morning, Erika. Andy Cecere : Hi, Erika. Erika Najarian : I\u2019m trying to figure out given your outlook for positive operating leverage, why the stock has opened so weakly. So maybe following up on Vivek\u2019s question, I think that The Street had anticipated a much lower or lesser seasonal step-down in payments. So what\u2019s happened with the interchange rate in the quarter? Terry Dolan : Yes, so let me again just kind of step back. When we think about kind of seasonality in the payments business overall, usually from third to fourth quarter, credit and debit card, depending upon the amount of investment we\u2019re making at that particular point in time, is usually -- fourth quarter is a little bit better than third quarter. But merchant and corporate payments, typically fourth quarter is seasonally lower and that\u2019s fundamentally kind of what we saw both in terms of merchant and corporate. Now corporate ends up getting impacted by government spend, which tends to be highest in the third quarter. You get the effect of holidays impacting travel and all sorts of things with respect to payments and that sort of thing. That\u2019s why that tends to step down. So I think what we ended up seeing is fairly similar to what we would have expected in terms of the seasonality of the businesses. Erika Najarian : And the lower interchange rate that you that mentioned on Slide 12, was that anything unusual there? Terry Dolan : Yes. Again, I think that that ends up getting impacted by the mix of the business. So as travel grows, the interchange rates and the margins associated with that particular business in the merchant acquiring is at narrower spreads. And so as that is recovering, it ends up impacting the margins a little bit. Erika Najarian : Got it. Okay. And just to take another step back, on your net interest income guide for three rate hikes mid single digit, what kind of deposit betas are you assuming? I think everybody is very well aware that your corporate trust deposits are quite rate sensitive. But has there been a change in your mix since the '15, '18 rate cycle? And in general, what have you baked into your NII guide for deposit re-pricing and what do you expect to actually happen? Terry Dolan : Yes. So maybe at a high level, typically what we see in the early stages of rising rates is that deposit betas don\u2019t move a lot in any of the different categories. But you are right. The trust -- corporate trust deposits tend to be a little bit more sensitive as you get into maybe the second or third rate hike. And so when we think about maybe that first 50 basis points, we would expect deposit betas to probably be in that 15 to 25 range and then progressively getting a little bit stronger as the cycle continues. And that\u2019s kind how we think about it. Now, I would say that when we have looked at the mix of business we have had today versus let\u2019s say four, five years ago, we have kind of a strong mix of consumer base where we have seen a lot of the growth in deposits in 2021 was actually on the consumer side of the equation as opposed to some of the other businesses. And so the deposit beta -- my expectation is deposit betas especially in the early stages are probably a little bit lower than what we have experienced in the past. Erika Najarian : Got it. And just maybe a last one for Andy. As we think about USB in a cost inflationary environment but in an environment where, as you said to Mike, where your investment spend is steady state, what is really the underlying -- forget just '22, but going forward the next three years, what is the underlying expense growth of this company? And you had mentioned I think at a conference in 2021 that low 50s is something that you could achieve from an efficiency standpoint. Is that something that can only be achieved with the deals that you have pending? Andy Cecere : So, Erika, part of achieving that is also getting back to a more normal revenue environment which we\u2019re starting to migrate to with rates as we talked about in terms of our assumptions. I would expect next year, again, that revenue growth to be well below -- that expense growth to be well below revenue growth and positive operating leverage, and I would expect us to achieve that on a go-forward basis. We\u2019ve made the investments to position ourselves to be successful. Those investments are going to result in additional revenue but also importantly more efficiencies in the operations. So those digital capabilities allow us to do things more effectively and more efficiently, and we\u2019ve also optimized the branch network and we\u2019re going to continue focus on that. So it\u2019s sort of this balance, Erika, of optimizing the current to continue to invest for the future, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll continue to do. Erika Najarian : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We do have a follow up from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Andy Cecere : Hi, John. John McDonald : Hi, thanks. Two quick follow ups, one for Terry, one for Andy. Terry, could you quantify the impact of the changes you\u2019re making, the customer-friendly changes to the NSF and OD fees and what that might be for this year on a go-forward basis as well? And then, Andy, just kind of wondering, with all the dynamics in Washington, people are worried about the deal approval process for you and others getting delayed. What\u2019s the cost of that to the organization? Are you doing a lot of prep work that gets put on hold? And if you do end up waiting longer for approval, what kind of cost is that to the organization? And just some thoughts on that would be helpful. Thank you both. Terry Dolan : Yes, so let me address the overdraft. If you end up looking at our call reports, 2021, I think our overdraft fees were about -- a little less than 2% of total revenue or $340 million. And on a fully implemented sort of basis, we would expect that that impact of the change that we\u2019re making is probably in that $160 million to $170 million. And we\u2019ll probably end up realizing about 75% of that next year. And the other thing that I would just mention is that with fee waivers -- from a fee income standpoint, and we\u2019ve taken both of these things into consideration, fee waivers will help offset most of that. John McDonald : Okay. Terry, so I just -- next year, does that mean this year or --? Terry Dolan : Yes. In 2022, we would realize about 75% of the full effect. John McDonald : Yes. Okay. Andy Cecere : And John, we\u2019re not incurring a lot of incremental expense right now as part of the integration efforts. We have teams working on it, but they\u2019re not what I would call incremental in nature. The impact of a delay would be really delaying the efficiencies and the cost takeouts that\u2019s we projected for you, and that would be the principal impact. John McDonald : Got it. Okay. Thanks. Andy Cecere : Sure. Operator : I will turn the call back over for any closing remarks. Jen Thompson : Okay. Thank you everyone for listening to our earnings call. Please contact the Investor Relations department if you have any follow-up questions. Operator : This concludes the U.S. Bancorp's fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Following a review of the results by Andy Cecere, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Dolan, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 11 :00 AM Central Time through Thursday, April 21, 2022, at 10 :59 PM Central Time. I will now turn the conference call over to Jen Thompson, Head of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. Jen Thompson : Thank you, Francie, and good morning, everyone. With me today are Andy Cecere, our Chairman, President and CEO; and Terry Dolan, our Chief Financial Officer. During their prepared remarks, Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation. A copy of the presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. I'd like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Andy. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Jen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry and I will take any questions you have. I'll begin on Slide 3. In the first quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.99 and total revenue of $5.6 billion. The quarter was highlighted by strong loan growth, continued momentum in our payments businesses, well-controlled expenses and strong credit quality. As expected, mortgage banking revenue declined in the first quarter due to slower refinancing activity in the market. However, we saw a good momentum in business activity and related revenue growth within other fee businesses, including payments, trust and investment management and treasury management. This quarter, we released $50 million in loan loss reserves, reflecting continued strong credit quality. And at March 31, our CET1 capital ratio was 9.8%. Slide 4 provides key performance metrics. In the first quarter, we delivered a return on assets of 1.09% and a return on tangible common equity of 16.6%. Slide 5 highlights strengths in digital engagement. Digital transactions account for over 80% of total transactions and total digital loan sales account for about 2/3 of total loan sales. We are pleased with the progress we have seen so far, but believe there is further opportunity to increase customer engagement through digital adoption by helping customers, consumers and business customers to understand the full scope of capabilities available to assist them in managing their financial lives. We are continually adding and enhancing digital features and functionality and applying a digital plus human approach. A great example of this is our Do-it-Together co-browse technology. Through this tool, interactions with our customers, a key driver of engagements have increased in number and have become more efficient as well as effective. Turning to Slide 6. We believe our complete payments ecosystem is a competitive advantage for our company. The opportunity to connect our banking customers with our payments products and services and our payments customers with our banking products and services will continue to drive meaningful profit and return differential for our company over the next several years. Our small business initiative is just 1 example of many that we see driving both account growth and deeper relationships. We believe the suite of products we offer to our small business customers will allow us to grow those relationships by 15% to 20% and related revenue by 25% to 30% over the next few years. We are particularly encouraged by the trends we are seeing in the uptake of our talech point-of-sale functionality, which allows small business customers to manage their banking and payments needs in a simple, easy-to-use format that we provide in the form of a dashboard. On the right side of the slide, you can see that the number of new talech customers increased fivefold in 2021 compared to 2020, and that strong growth trajectory has continued in 2022. Year-to-date, new talech customers are 1.5x the full year 2020 level. Now let me turn the call over to Terry to provide more details on the quarter. Terry Dolan : Thanks, Andy. If you turn to Slide 7, I'll start with the balance sheet review followed by a discussion of first quarter earnings trends. Average loans increased 3.4% compared with the fourth quarter, driven by 8.0% growth in commercial loans, 2.1% growth in mortgage loans and 1.0% growth in total other retail loans. Commercial loan growth reflected slowing paydowns, increased business activity and higher utilization rates across many sectors and most geographies. Client sentiment is stable and commercial lending needs are being driven by inventory building, M&A activity and CapEx expenditures. In the retail portfolio, we saw good growth in residential mortgage and other retail loans, including auto lending. Credit card balances declined linked quarter, reflecting typical seasonality and the impact of certain loans being moved to held for sale in the fourth quarter, which impacted average balance growth. Turning to Slide 8. Total average deposits increased 1.0% compared with the fourth quarter despite the typical seasonal reduction in noninterest-bearing deposits. Total average deposits increased 6.5% compared with a year ago. Slide 9 shows credit quality trends. Credit quality continues to be strong across our loan portfolio. The ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was 0.25% at March 31 compared with 0.28% at December 31 and 0.41% a year ago. Our first quarter net charge-off ratio of 0.21% was slightly higher than the fourth quarter level of 0.17%, but lower compared with the first quarter of 2021 level of 0.31%. Our allowance for credit losses as of March 31 totaled $6.1 billion or 1.91% of period-end loans. Slide 10 provides an earnings summary. In the first quarter of 2022, we earned $0.99 per diluted share. These results included a relatively small reserve release of $50 million. Turning to Slide 11. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis totaled $3.2 billion. The 1.6% linked quarter increase reflected strengthening margins and strong loan growth in the quarter, particularly commercial loan growth. Our net interest margin improved 4 basis points to 2.44% due to the changing yield curve, investment portfolio actions and lower cash balances, partially offset by the impact of loan mix. Slide 12 highlights trends in noninterest income. Compared with a year ago, noninterest income increased 0.6%, reflecting strong payments services revenue, growth in trust and investment management fees and higher treasury management fees, offset by a lower commercial product revenue and lower mortgage banking revenue. The decline in mortgage banking revenue reflected lower refinancing activity in the market and tighter gain on sale margins giving excess capacity in the industry. In the first quarter, total payments revenues increased 10.1% compared to a year earlier reflecting both continued cyclical post-pandemic recovery as well as strong underlying business trends supported by investments we are making. Credit and debit card revenue increased 0.6% on a year-over-year basis, as the impact of higher credit and debit card volume was offset by lower prepaid card activity. Excluding prepaid card revenue, credit and debit card fee revenue would have increased 9.6% compared with the first quarter of 2021. Both corporate payment, products revenue and merchant processing fees increased at a double-digit pace compared with a year ago, with growth driven by both the cyclical recovery of pandemic impacted industries as well as underlying business momentum. Slides 13 and 14 provide additional information on our payment services business. In the middle of Slide 13, we provided a table, which illustrates the cyclicality that naturally occurs in each of our 3 payments businesses over the course of a typical year. On the right side of the slide, you can see that COVID-19 impacted industries continued to recover throughout the first quarter. As of the first quarter of 2022, credit and debit card travel volumes exceeded pre-pandemic levels. In March of 2022, airline volume was flat compared to March of 2019, the first time we have seen recovery to pre-pandemic levels. Although T&E-related volumes in our corporate payments business are still below pre-pandemic levels, they continue their upward trajectory. In March, corporate T&E volumes in CPS were back to 75% of the pre-pandemic level. Slide 14 provides linked quarter and year-over-year revenue growth trends for our 3 payments businesses. Because of the cyclical nature of our payments businesses, we believe year-over-year trends are the best indicator of underlying business performance in a normal environment. Year-over-year, credit and debit card revenue growth rates continued to be negatively impacted by the decline in prepaid card revenue as the benefit of the government stimulus has dissipated. We provide details on prepaid card fee revenue over the past 5 quarters in the upper right quadrant. While prepaid card revenue is approaching a run rate on a linked-quarter basis, it will impact year-over-year credit and debit card fee revenue comparisons through the end of 2022. The bottom half of the slide illustrates the strong year-over-year growth rates in both merchant processing and corporate payments fee revenue over the past several quarters, which have partly reflected the pandemic-related recovery. While we expect the year-over-year growth rates to moderate from current levels, we continue to believe that both merchant processing and corporate payments fee revenue can grow at a high single-digit pace on a year-over-year basis in a post-pandemic environment. Turning to Slide 15. Noninterest expense decreased 0.9% on a linked quarter basis. The decline was driven by lower professional services expense, marketing and business development expense and technology and communication expenses, partially offset by increases in employee benefit expense primarily due to seasonally higher payroll taxes and other noninterest expenses. Linked quarter expense growth includes the impact of the acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of 2021. Slide 16 highlights our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio at March 31 was 9.8%. As a reminder, at the beginning of the third quarter of 2021, we suspended our share buyback program due to the pending acquisition of Union Bank. After closing the acquisition, we expect to operate at a CET1 ratio between our target ratio and 9.0%. We continue to expect that our share repurchase program will be deferred until our CET1 ratio reaches 9.0% following the pending deal close. I will now provide some forward-looking guidance. The following guidance is for a U.S. Bank on a standalone basis and does not include any potential impact from Union Bank. Let me start with full year guidance.  We have updated our interest rate expectations to be consistent with market expectations. Given our revised interest rate assumptions, we now expect total net revenue to increase 5% to 6% compared with 2021, reflecting 8% to 11% growth in taxable equivalent, net interest income and stable fee income, primarily due to lower mortgage banking revenue and deposit service charges offsetting growth in other fee businesses. We expect positive operating leverage of at least 200 basis points in 2022. As it relates to the second quarter specifically, we expect total revenue growth of 5% to 7% on a linked-quarter basis, benefiting from seasonal strength in many of our fee businesses, continued loan growth and the second quarter impact of higher rates on a net interest income and the recapture of fee waivers. In the second quarter, we expect expenses to increase 1% to 2% on a linked-quarter basis, primarily due to seasonally higher compensation-related costs and business investment spend. Credit quality remains strong. Over the next few quarters, we expect the net charge-off ratio to remain lower than historic levels, but will continue to normalize over time. For the full year 2022, we expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately 21% to 22%. If you turn to Slide 17, I'll provide an update on our previously announced pending acquisition of Union Bank. In September of 2021, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the core regional banking franchise of MUFG Union Bank. We continue to make significant progress in planning for closing the deal in the first half of 2022, while we await regulatory approval. As you know, regulatory approvals are not within the company's control and may impact the timing of the closing of the deal. We expect to close the deal approximately 45 days after being granted U.S. regulatory approval. Conversion is anticipated late in the second half of 2022. We continue to believe this deal is a compelling use of our excess capital from both a strategic and financial perspective. We feel comfortable with our initial financial deal assumptions, including an expectation that it will generate an internal rate of return of about 20%, which is well above our cost of capital. Assuming a June 30 close date, we expect Union Bank to contribute approximately $310 million to our pretax pre-provision net revenue in 2022, before considering cost synergies. We continue to expect to achieve approximately $900 million of total cost synergies related to the deal with approximately $85 million to $100 million of cost savings achieved in the second half of 2022. We continue to target total merger and integration costs of $1.2 billion, of which approximately $950 million will be incurred in 2022 with some charges anticipated in the second quarter as we prepare for system integration. In addition, there will be Day 1 -- there will be a Day 1 loss -- loan loss provision required at closing in accordance with the existing CECL accounting rules of approximately $800 million to $900 million. I'll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Terry. Our strong first quarter results have positioned us well for the rest of the year, and we are encouraged by the loan growth trends and business activity that we are seeing in the early part of the second quarter. Credit quality remains strong. Nonetheless, we continue to approach credit decisions with a through-the-cycle lens. . We feel good about the secular trends we are seeing across our fee businesses. Our payments revenue continues to recover, and we look to continued cyclical recovery in travel and entertainment as the year progresses. More importantly, over the near and intermediate term, our multiyear investments in this business and the strategic initiatives aimed at leveraging the power of our payments ecosystem will continue to pay off. We are closely managing operating expenses even as we invest in our digital initiatives, our payments capabilities and our technology modernization. On that front, I'd like to highlight a few of our recent announcements. We enhanced the service that we call Extend Pay, an offering which allows our existing consumer and business cardholders to a buy now, pay later option where they can choose a flexible payment plan that suits their needs. We also rolled out a request for payment capability, which allows merchants to send bills directly to customers' bank's accounts. Those customers have the option to send payment immediately to the biller via real-time payment rails. In February, we announced a meaningful investment in our cloud strategy, which is aimed at modernizing our technology foundation so as to further improve the security of our data, financial assets and customer privacy while allowing for the transformation of applications and infrastructure to create leading-edge customer experiences. We will continue to leverage our suit of products, services and capabilities to enhance the customer experience, which we believe will support meaningful account growth and deeper relationships across our entire franchise over the next several years. In closing, 2022 is off to a good start, and I'd like to thank our employees for all they do to support our strategic goals and continue our customer -- continue to serve our customers and communities. We will now open up the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor : I was hoping you guys could provide an update on asset sensitivity of USB standalone and then the impact of UB? I know at 1 point, you had said it was going to make you a little more asset sensitive, but obviously, the rate environment has changed. I'm not really sure what's happening in their balance sheet. So some updates there on asset sensitivity, please? Terry Dolan : Yes. Matt, let me kind of take that question. With respect to asset sensitivity, and I'm going to kind of refer back to maybe the disclosures we had in the 10-K and probably the best one to look at would be kind of an upward gradual 200 basis point movement. I think that, that is at least the environment that the market implied with expected at this particular point in time. So if you end up applying that rate sensitivity of about 5.4% to the fourth quarter, I think it gives you a pretty good estimate of what sort of benefit that we see in terms of net interest income kind of going forward. Maybe kind of qualitatively, I think that when we see early in the cycle, deposit betas will be relatively low. Our portfolio, when you look at loans, it's probably about 50%, 55% is floating rate and about 45% to 50% is fixed rate. So that probably gives you some perspective with respect to kind of what we're expecting to see. From a Union Bank point of view, as we've said in the past, it is a bit more asset sensitive than us. It should help us kind of, I would say, 35, 40 basis points. When you end up looking at their portfolio and the assets that we\u2019ll be acquiring, it's deposit-heavy, so we'll have a substantial amount of cash and the opportunity to be able to reinvest that as the -- as rates move up. Matt O\u2019Connor : Okay. And then separately, you gave the impact of the UB deal on tangible book value, I think it was just a 1% reduction. What's the estimated impact on CET1 capital, both from the actual acquisition and then the upfront marks that you mentioned earlier? Terry Dolan : Yes. So as we've said, currently, we're at 9.8% in terms of our CET1 ratio. We would expect it will be in the range of that 8.5% to 9% at the end of the closing. Of course, it will be dependent upon how much rates move between now and the actual closing time. Our -- I talked a little bit about the Day 1 provision in terms of the credit mark. From an asset mark, I think it will be a little bit higher than what we had originally anticipated or disclosed in -- at the time of the acquisition, simply because of the rising rates, but not significantly different. Matt O\u2019Connor : And just a suggestion by the way, lots of good guidance on the call. It would be great if you could put some of it in the slide. It is such a busy day and scramble to drive it all down. Some of your peers do that and it's really helpful for us on this side. Terry Dolan : Yes. We would anticipate we'll start to incorporate more of that as the deal moves forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore ISI. John Pancari : On the card and payment side, just curious if you can just give us a little bit more detail on what you're seeing in terms of consumer spend behavior? Are you seeing any signs of any pullbacks and shifts in the type of spend that could point some softening there? We're starting to see some shifts towards nondiscretionary from discretionary spend. Curious if you're seeing that in your business, if that is impacting your outlook at all? Terry Dolan : Yes. So let me start and then Andy can kind of add to it. Certainly, what we are continuing to see, John, through the first quarter is good, strong, both year-over-year growth and comparisons back to 2019 really across the board. I think a couple of the trends that we talked about is that travel, specifically airline was back to pre-pandemic and so that's continuing to develop and grow and that's occurred specifically in March. And I think you'll see that continuing as we think about the second quarter and beyond. We do continue to expect in the CPS business, the travel and entertainment is going to continue to strengthen. And I think that, that is a tailwind or an opportunity for us as we move forward. I would expect that there's probably going to be a shift to some extent from what I would call durable goods that people were spending their dollars on in the past to more service-oriented sort of activities. But in terms of the overall level of spend, I feel like that will continue at least for some period of time.  Andy, what would you add? Andy Cecere : I think that's a good summary, Terry. John, it's interesting because consumer spend on the merchant side, if we look at that data versus pre-pandemic levels in the first quarter, still up 9% to 15%. Consumer credit card spend still up versus pre-pandemic 35%, and corporate payments still up 10%. The 1 area Terry mentioned that is not back to recovery yet is corporate T&E, which is about 75% of what is normal or pre-pandemic levels, and we would expect that to continue to get better as we all start to get out on the road more. So we're not seeing any negative trends thus far, and it continues to be very strong. John Pancari : And then on the commercial side, I know you cited in your prepared remarks that you are beginning to see CapEx plans as a driver behind the loan growth dynamics on the commercial side. Do you expect that to continue as we look out here? Or do you foresee a potential impact on borrower appetite amid still the inflationary dynamics and supply chain issues in Ukraine? Terry Dolan : Yes. I think that the capital expenditure is probably driven by a couple of different things. I think that most businesses over the course of the last couple of years have been kind of holding back with respect to capital expenditure. And so I think that there's a bit of an increase in that spend just related to that. And then I do think that as companies see more and more inflationary pressure, they're going to look to business and business automation as ways of kind of offsetting some of the pressure that they see with respect to being actually to acquire talent. And so I think that our expectation, at least in the near term, is that capital expenditure will continue to be reasonably strong. Andy Cecere : And our -- I think our utilization rates support that, Terry. We have been running in that 19% plus or minus, for a number of quarters, and we saw an increase, certainly not to normal levels, but in the 22% to 23% in the last few months. Terry Dolan : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Ryan Kenny : This is Ryan Kenny on behalf of Betsy. Wondering if we could dig in a little bit more on deposit betas. So I know that you mentioned that early in the cycle, you're expecting deposit betas to be relatively low. So on 1 hand, you have an industry with a lot of excess liquidity. But then on the other hand, you have consumers that might be a little bit more cognizant of rate hikes coming faster with inflation on the headlines every day. You have rising fintech competition. So putting that all together, I'm wondering how you're thinking about deposit betas really over the first 100 bps and then the following rates after that? Terry Dolan : Yes. So maybe I think it's helpful to maybe have a little context. When you end up looking at our deposit business or balances, about 50% of it is consumer based and 50% of it is institutional, if you will, which tends to have a little bit of a higher beta. But our expectation, especially early in the cycle, is that betas will move relatively slow. And then as we get further into the development of the cycle, it will start to accelerate a bit. But to kind of give you some perspective, we would expect probably through the full cycle of 2022 that betas on the consumer will be less than 10% and then maybe slightly higher that on a terminal basis. On the institutional side, we would expect through the 2022 cycle somewhere between 50% and 60% with a terminal level that's maybe a little bit higher than that. A couple of things to that, as we are looking at it, we believe that relative to, for example, the last cycle that our deposit betas will be a little bit less sensitive for a couple of different reasons. One is the consumer balances are larger by about 5% relative to the last cycle. Our corporate trust deposit balances are lower in terms of -- so the mix of the deposit base has changed. And then we have moved away from concentrations related to brokerage-related type of deposits, which we had more of in the past. We still have some, but a lower concentration. So all of those things are going to drive lower beta growth than what we saw in the past. Ryan Kenny : And then just as a follow-up, wondering if you could dig into the book value per share decline of 9% linked quarter, how much of that came from AOCI drawdowns on the AFS portfolio? And is there anything you can do to mitigate the AOCI hit going forward if the rate outlook keeps moving higher? Terry Dolan : Yes. The vast majority, if not all of it, was really tied to the change in the unrealized gains and losses on the investment portfolio. And then the driver, when we think about the future, we started to change a couple of different things. So in the fourth quarter, we moved about $43 billion of our investment securities to held-to-maturity As we are reinvesting runoff associated with the investment portfolio, we'll continue to move more and more of that into the held-to-maturity sort of category. And then certainly, as we close on Union Bank, we have the opportunity after the mark to move a lot of that into held to maturity as well. So today, about 30% of the overall portfolio is in the held-to-maturity category, And our expectation is over some period of time, we would move that percentage up significantly. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of UBS. Erika Najarian : Just putting together the most recent question and also on Matt's question, underneath the 8% to 11% NII growth, could you give us a little bit more of a breakdown in terms of what you're expecting for asset growth, given the strength in your loan book today? And Terry, I know -- short-term borrowings at period end by $10 billion. And again, going back to the question I think everybody is trying to ask, remind us how much of your deposit base is corporate trust today? And of those deposits, how much are indexed? Do they re-price immediately to the changes in underlying benchmark rates? Or do you have some ability in pricing power to be able to perhaps delay some of that repricing? Terry Dolan : Yes. So let me start with the last question and kind of talk a little bit about the deposits and then to the extent that I don't cover everything, just remind me. But deposits in the Corporate Trust business or in the trust -- institutional -- the Investment Services Group, which includes Corporate Trust, represent about 15% of their total interest-bearing deposits. Now in the last rate cycle, that was about 22%. So it's down relative to the overall mix. And then the vast majority of it is not indexed to any particular rate. And so we do have the ability to manage that. A fair amount of the deposits within Corporate Trust are noninterest-bearing as well, which I think is helpful. That percentage is probably a little bit higher than what it was in the past. But the competitive pressure will be -- will really come as money market funds start to move up, we do have the ability to lag relative to that. But that's where some of that competitive pressure comes from. Erika Najarian : Just a follow-up on the underlying earning asset assumption that you have underneath -- Terry Dolan : Yes. So when we end up looking at earning assets, our expectation is that the investment portfolio will be relatively flat or stable, really through the end of the year and the vast majority of the growth will come on the loan portfolio side of the equation. As we look into the second quarter, our expectation is that loan growth will continue to be strong. This and, as a reminder, it was up on a linked quarter basis about 3.4%. And while it may not be at that level, I think it will still be up on a linked quarter basis very nicely, and we would continue to expect good solid growth in the C&I portfolio as well as credit cards will start to seasonally get stronger, et cetera. Erika Najarian : And a follow-up question to Matt's question on CET1. When you closed Union Bank, I think I'm estimating your total asset size to be just shy of $690 billion. And how should we think about capital management? Do you potentially approach [$100 billion] asset mark in 2 years, Andy and Terry? And I'm just wondering in context of -- the TCE hit was obviously more than the CET1 hit because AOCI doesn't run through your CET1. So I guess I'm wondering in terms of like your buybacks even after you replenish to 9 as we think about crossing the 700, how that might influence your capital management and capital return potentially differently over the next 2 years? Terry Dolan : Yes. Erika, I think your estimates with respect to the total size are reasonable. Our expectation is that, to kind of give you some perspective, when you end up looking at the rules, rules say that you need to be able to -- you need to be at an average of over a 4-quarter period above $700 million. So there's a bit of runway that exists between now and when we might become a category to sort of entity. Some of the things that -- some of the actions that I talked about with respect to the held-to-maturity composition of the investment portfolio, I think, will help kind of mitigate that. Certainly, we'll generate a fair amount of earnings between now and, let's say, 6 or 7 quarters out. And I think all those things will kind of help us manage through that time frame. The other thing is that when we do close on Union Bank, it's deposit heavy in terms of the mix. So it will be a significant amount of cash, and we would expect to utilize that to help us manage borrowings down and things like that in order to be able to stay below that $700 million or $1 billion threshold for an extended period of time. Erika Najarian : Just to clarify, as you close UB, the intention for the cash is not to deploy it, but to shrink the pro forma balance sheet to be able to accommodate more client growth rather than just broad balance sheet growth from UBS? Terry Dolan : Exactly. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Just a question on fees to start. In your revenue guide, do you fully contemplate the full recovery of fee waivers, which I think you've said you've been running around $70 million? How much do you have that recovering in 2Q? And I assume that's also fully recovered in the full year guide? Terry Dolan : Yes. So to answer the last piece, yes, it would be fully recovered certainly by the end of the year. And just given kind of projections in the marketplace with respect to rates, we'll see a significant amount of that recovered in the second quarter with a residual amount kind of in the third quarter. Maybe as a reminder, we recover about 65% of it in the first 25 basis point movement. 90% of it in the next 25 basis point movement and all of it after the third 25 basis point movement. So most of it in the second quarter, but some amount in the third. Andy Cecere : So about 70% of it in the second quarter timeframe. Ken Usdin : And then also just on the mortgage business. Obviously, the reset that you had given us, the expectation for just your outlook from here given where rates have gone and the ins and outs of production and servicing? Terry Dolan : Yes. Obviously, the mortgage banking business is going to trend along with at the point in time, refinancings, the mix of business is probably 70% home sales and 30% refinancing. So the -- on a linked quarter basis, the impact of refinancings will be less than what it has been in the past. So it will come down to kind of home sale activity. We continue to think that, that will be reasonably strong. And our investment in kind of the retail channel will be good. I think the things that will be drivers, Ken, in the future on a linked quarter basis, we'll really be where do gain on sale margins go and how -- that will be driven based upon how fast the capacity comes out of the system. But at least at this particular point in time, just looking at kind of industry metrics, I think, is a good way of kind of thinking about how we'll perform as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Just to clarify, so you improved 2022 guidance, revenues from 3% to 4% to 5% to 6%, NII from 5% to 8% to 11% and operating leverage from 100 basis points to 200 basis points. I just want to make sure I have my facts straight there, is that correct? Andy Cecere : You got it, Mike. Mike Mayo : So that improved guidance, how much of that is due simply to higher interest rate? How much of that is due to better loan growth? And how much of that is due to payments or some other activities? Terry Dolan : Yes. I think that, again, we would expect that mortgage -- excuse me, that fee income will be relatively stable on a year-over-year basis. So when you end up looking at what's going to be the driver, it will be net interest income. And from here on out, I think it's going to be kind of a balance between loan growth and interest rates because I -- if I had to kind of give you a mix and I don't necessarily have that with me, but it's probably 60%, 65% rates and 30%, 35% on the loan portfolio growth side of the equation. Mike Mayo : Okay. So your loan growth is pretty -- your commercial loan growth was kind of fast. And I'm just -- I think you said there might have been a onetime element in there, but what sort of commercial loan growth are you expecting? Is this the big pivot with the recovery from the pandemic? Is it inventory build? Is it CapEx? Is it by differences by region? It just -- this might wind up being some of the best commercial loan growth that we see on a linked quarter basis percentage-wise than any big bank. So just a little more color around that would be great. Andy Cecere : Sure, Mike. I'll start. This is Andy and Terry will add on. It's across all those categories I mentioned earlier, and there is no one-timer in there. So it is core growth. One of the factors is our utilization rates, as I mentioned, have been hovering in that 19-or-so percent and they're up nearly 23%, which is a key component, which is, again, takedowns to fund all those things you talked about, which is CapEx and inventory growth and other activities. It's fairly widespread. It's true within our large corporate as well as our middle market and spread geographically as well. So it is a strength across many categories.  Terry, what would you add? Terry Dolan : Yes. The other thing I would just say is that we'll start to see some seasonal benefit associated with the credit card portfolio as we get into the second and third quarter. Mike Mayo : Okay. And then the other part of that question is related to payment. I think payments was a little bit of a disappointment for a little bit of time, and now it's come back a little bit this quarter, 10% year-over-year growth. So I guess is payments back or not back? Or how do you -- is it performing to your expectations? Are there still headwinds? Or is the recovery from the pandemic helping that business? Just how do you think about payments relative to your own expectations and the market's expectations? Terry Dolan : Yes. I mean, we're very excited about the payments business. I think there's a number of dynamics that are taking place. I think there's still cyclical recovery that's going to continue on for some period of time, and you're going to see that in the airline and the travel and entertainment and those sorts of areas, I think that's all good. Mike, we've talked a lot about investments that we've been making in our payments businesses. And over the course of the last few years, as an example, within the merchant acquiring 3 years ago or so, our tech-led sort of revenue represented about 15% of our overall merchant acquiring revenue. Today, it represents 30%, and we would expect that to continue to accelerate because of investments that we're making.  We talked about the fact that in a normal environment, as the cyclical recovery kind of starts to wane, that we would expect our merchant acquiring and our CPS business to grow at high single digits. That's 2 or 3x what we were seeing, let's say, 4 years ago when we started our investment. So we feel really good about where we're at from a payments perspective at this particular point.  Andy, what would you add? Andy Cecere : I think that's right. And Mike, when you asked about the guidance and Terry mentioned that fees are relatively stable, that is mortgage coming down a fair bit as well as deposit service charges with some of the changes that we made in overdrafts, which is offset positively by some of our payments businesses and the expectations that we now have for the full year as well as the trust businesses. So there's some value and diversification of those revenue streams, and it's coming through in payments and trust. Mike Mayo : That was a detailed answer. If I could just push my -- the limit, any numbers around the payments growth? Should it be high single digits? Can you keep that 10% growth up? Or should it settle back down to a lower range? Terry Dolan : Yes. Again, I think if you end up looking at the components, merchant and CPS on an ongoing basis, high single digits, I think credit card will be probably at a lower level than that, but it will be consistent with the way the rest of the industry is growing. Andy Cecere : And part of that credit card comp, Mike, is the prepaid impacts of prior years is still impacting the comps year-over-year in 2022. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Terry, just a clarification there. So the high single digit on merchant processing and corporate payments, are you referring to that for '22 or beyond? And because the credit card should be hurt in '22, but after that, those comps should get easier, so what do you think post '22 for credit cards? So I just want to clarify those. Terry Dolan : Again, for merchant and CPS, we think post '22, high single digits. And we believe that credit card will perform kind of consistent with the rest of the industry. The comps, as you say, this year will be impacted by the prepaid card revenue because that is coming down, but then that starts to normalize as you get into 2023. Vivek Juneja : And within this high single digits, are you expecting any more big contract renewals that could impact us? Or has that been factored into your guidance? Or are you just not expecting much of that to come up in the credit card or the merchant? Terry Dolan : Yes, we don't expect a lot of that. The large contracts that got renegotiated were more on the CPS side of the equation about 2 years ago, and that's kind of fully in the run rate at this particular point in time. As you know that those contracts are usually 10, 12 years in length. So we don't see anything on the horizon there. Vivek Juneja : Okay. One request, and that is FICO mix of your loan portfolios, I know we've talked about this in the past that you're looking to actually disclosing it. Your peers do. And I think given your high consumer mix of loans, it would be very helpful to have that. Andy Cecere : All right. Thanks, Vivek. We'll take a look at that. Thanks for the feedback. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Terry, following up your comments on the mortgage banking business, with the rates where they are and possibly going higher, probably depressing refinancing activity for the industry as well as yourselves because of the higher rates, is there a -- can you attempt or can you look to growing your home equity business, home equity lines, et cetera? This business, of course, for the industry and yourselves has been an industry that -- or a line of business that has been shrinking over the years. But could that be an alternative to people refinancing moving into home equity lines? Andy Cecere : I think that it certainly won't shrink at the same level it has been shrinking, Gerard, just for the reasons you mentioned because of refinancing people would have money out, and that would be cause -- would replace home equity, so to speak. So I think you'll see a positive trend there. It certainly is not going to offset the mortgage impacts directly, but I think it will be positive. Gerard Cassidy : And is there any plan on your guys' part to maybe be more aggressive in marketing those products? Or have you not really thought about that? Terry Dolan : We're always looking at opportunities to serve the customers in areas they need. The other -- another sort of related is the whole buy now, pay later component that we talked about. I mentioned some examples in my prepared remarks, but as you think about home equity improvements, a new way of financing that is through a buy now, pay later or financing a point of sale. So that's something we're also focused on. Gerard Cassidy : Got it. And then second, obviously, U.S. Bancorp has distinguished itself over the years with having a very strong focus on credit and delivering very strong returns to shareholders. And the question I have, because credit obviously is not an issue today for most banks, yours included, when do you start to get nervous? Or do you get nervous in this interest rate environment? If the Fed comes through and we have 200 basis points of Fed funds at the end of the year and possibly a 10-year that's well above 3%. How do you guys kind of think about that when you assess the risks for the business here at U.S. Bancorp? Terry Dolan : Yes. Fair question. And I think there's a lot more conversation around that in terms of whether or not there will be recessionary sort of pressures 12 to 18 months out. I would start by just saying when we end up looking at the economic outlook right now and kind of what we're seeing, we continue to see a pretty robust environment.  That said, Gerard, I think it's a fair question because credit issues that we -- decisions we made today and a year ago are what's going to affect us. And we never really changed our underwriting approach. We've always been very focused on as an example, in the consumer side, we focus on prime and super prime customers in our card business, in our auto business, et cetera. I think the mortgage, just the underwriting associated with mortgages is different today than it was 10, 15 years ago, which will help.  But then on the C&I side of the equation or the corporate side of the equation, we do very little leverage lending sort of activities and areas that have been kind of structurally impacted like retail, et cetera, retail malls, et cetera. We've kind of made a lot of changes to our portfolio over the last several years. So I actually think that we'll perform quite well in the event that we were to see recessionary pressures develop. Gerard Cassidy : And Terry, just a follow-up there, how about from a balance sheet standpoint, you talked about moving more of your available for sale and to help the maturity in your bond portfolio. In this rising rate environment, is that a -- do we start to see greater risks in that part of the business, not just for U.S. Bancorp, but maybe for the industry as well? Terry Dolan : Within, for example, the investment portfolio? Gerard Cassidy : Correct. Correct. Just the march that people may have to take, I know held-to-maturity, you don't mark to market. But I'm just wondering -- because we haven't had the focus on this in years. And I'm just wondering if there's something that we need to keep our eyes out open for. Terry Dolan : Yes. I mean, I think that -- I think it's worthwhile just kind of trying to understand the mix of the types of investment securities that people are putting into their particular portfolio. When you get into stress in the economy, et cetera, certain types of investments may not perform as well in terms of our own portfolio, highly concentrated in treasury and government-backed, mortgage-backed securities. So we don't see a lot of credit risk in our particular portfolio, but it is something I think -- from an industry standpoint, it's worthwhile watching. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy from Stephens. Terry McEvoy : If I go back to September, I think you expected to realize 25% of the cost savings from Union this year, which was about $225 million. Terry, I believe on the call, was it $85 million to $100 million this year? And is that just simply a function of pushing out [indiscernible] to late in 2022? Terry Dolan : Yes. It's all related to the timing. Terry McEvoy : Okay. And then your thoughts on 2023, the full 100% by the end of the year, any kind of update on 2023 when a bulk of that savings will occur? Terry Dolan : Yes. I mean I think that the bulk of that savings, we certainly start to realize some of it later this year, but the bulk of it does get realized in 2023. And certainly, when we get close to the -- into the fourth quarter and first quarter of '24, the vast majority of it will realized. So I think the timing is very consistent with what we talked about just affected by the timing of the deal. Terry McEvoy : Understood. And then as a follow-up, the 6% decline in noninterest-bearing deposits, I think that was on an average basis. In the release, it was seasonal kind of factors coming into play. Anything beyond that in terms of the decline? Or do you truly think that was just a seasonal component? Terry Dolan : Yes. With our Corporate Trust business, we always see a ramp-up in that type of deposit near the end of the year as deals try to get closed and almost like clockwork around the 10th of January and through February, we see a runoff. So it's all really seasonal from our standpoint. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Wolfe Research. Bill Carcache : I apologize if I -- if this was talked about before. I might have missed it. But I wanted to ask if you could comment on as we think about this runoff of the Fed balance sheet and happening faster than when we exited the last reserve cycle and the risk of noninterest-bearing deposits outflowing perhaps a bit faster and perhaps impacts on deposit betas. Could you comment on that? And if you already have, I'll just go back to the transcript. Terry Dolan : Yes. No, it's a good question. And as we kind of go through the modeling then we look at the information on kind of how we think it's going to end up affecting not only us, but I think the industry, so you're going to see that deposit growth is going to slow. But I do -- our expectation is that certainly, that deposit levels overall will grow slowly. And that will be more in line with just the overall growth of the economy. So our expectation is that deposits continue to grow but at a lower rate. Bill Carcache : Understood. And then following up on your commentary, I believe, Andy, around new point-of-sale solutions that you're looking at, there seems to be a little bit of debate among some banks who appear willing to promote the use of Zelle for retail payments versus others that would prefer to wait. Can you remind us where USB stands in that debate? And how you think about the risk of a product like Zelle potentially cannibalizing some of your payments volume? Andy Cecere : What we're focused on with Zelle is just increasing the utilization of Zelle across our customer base. I think it's a terrific product. It has a lot of use cases. We're looking at different use cases. But overall, what we're trying to do is just increase the utilization. Bill Carcache : And then finally, if I may, there's been this view -- I guess, following up on the strength you're seeing in the merchant acquiring side. There's been this view among some Fintech investors that Elavon is a legacy player using legacy technology and losing share in merchant acquiring, but Nielsen published its market share stats for the U.S. merchant acquirers and it shows Elavon actually moved up from #8 in 2020 to #7 in 2021 based on dollar volume. So from where you stand, do you think the investments that you're making in talech and other digital initiatives can actually help you continue to gain share in the acquiring space? Or is it more effectively protecting your position? Andy Cecere : No. We do think, Bill, that can allow us to gain share. I think it's a combination of a number of things. Terry talked about the investments we made over the last 3 or 4 years. Our focus on tech-led initiatives and selling points differently than it was 4 or 5 years ago. And then that combination of bringing banking together with merchant processing into a comprehensive product set, we talked about talech and the dashboard, I think all those things position us well for future growth, both growth within the customer base that we have, but also expanding and acquiring new customers. Operator : And speakers, we don't have any questions over the phone. Please continue. Jen Thompson : Thank you for listening to our earnings call, and please contact the Investor Relations department, if you have any follow-up questions. That concludes today's call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Following a review of the results by Andy Cecere, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Dolan, Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 11 :00 a.m. Central Time. I will now turn the call over to Jen Thompson, Head of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. You may go ahead, Jen. Jen Thompson : Thank you, Cheryl and good morning everyone. With me today are Andy Cecere, our Chairman, President and CEO and Terry Dolan, our Chief Financial Officer. During their prepared remarks, Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation. A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. I\u2019d like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today\u2019s call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today\u2019s presentation in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Andy. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Jen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry and I will take any questions you have. I will begin on Slide 3. In the second quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.99, which included $0.10 per share of merger and integration charges related to the planned acquisition of MUFG Union Bank. Excluding these notable items, we reported earnings per share of $1.09. We achieved record net revenue this quarter totaling $6 billion. Second quarter results were highlighted by strong revenue growth driven by robust net interest income and fee revenue and stable credit quality. Revenue growth was driven by strong growth in earning assets and the benefit of rising rates as well as good underlying business activity and customer acquisition trends across our fee businesses. Additionally, our multiyear investments in digital payments and technology are paying off in the form of strong top line growth and enhanced efficiency. This quarter, we added $150 million to our loan loss reserve, reflecting strong loan growth and our consistent through-the-cycle approach to risk management. Our credit quality remains strong and we are not seeing any trends in early stage metrics that cause us concern. At June 30, our CET1 capital ratio was 9.7%. Based on the results of the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2022 stress test that were published in June, we announced that we expect to be subject to a preliminary stress capital buffer of 2.5%, unchanged from the current level. We believe our industry leading results demonstrate our ability to withstand a severe economic downturn, which is a testament to the strength, quality and diversity of our balance sheet and our prudent approach to managing risk. Slide 4 provides key performance metrics. Excluding notable items, our return on average assets was 1.16% and our return on average common equity was 15.3%. Our return on tangible common equity was 20.5% on a core basis. Slide 5 highlights digital trends and engagement. I will now turn to Slide 6. We believe our digital capabilities and our complete payments ecosystem are competitive advantages that will drive meaningful profit and return differentiation for our company over the next several years. Our state-of-the-art digital capabilities have not only created a more effective and valuable experience for our customers, but they have allowed us to expand our distribution reach beyond our physical infrastructure while optimizing our existing branch network. On the left side, you will see that the success we are having with our State Farm partnership, which is driving more customers, more loans and more deposits to our platform in a cost effective way. The chart in the middle highlights the strong trends, the uptake of our talech point-of-sale functionality, which allows small business customers to manage their banking and payments needs in a simple, easy-to-use format that we provide in the form of a dashboard. And on the right, you will see the momentum we are gaining in real-time payments transactions, which through the midyear 2022 are 10x higher than the total number of transactions we saw for the entirety of 2020. We are excited about the secular growth opportunities we see across all of our business lines fairly, but I\u2019d like \u2013 but one area I\u2019d like to highlight on Slide 7 is our business banking initiative, which is really starting to gain traction. On the left chart, you will see that the opportunity we have previously discussed to connect our banking customers with our payments, products and services and our payments customers with our banking products and services. The chart on the right shows the progress we are making in growing accounts and expanding wallet share. Growth and relationships with both banking and payments products has meaningfully outpaced growth in total relationships over the past 12 months. And it\u2019s worth noting, we are still in the early innings. Now, let me turn the call over to Terry who will provide more detail on the quarter. Terry Dolan : Thanks, Andy. If you turn to Slide 8, I will start with a balance sheet review followed by a discussion of second quarter earnings trends. Average loans increased 3.6% compared to the first quarter, driven by 6.9% growth in commercial loans, 4.1% growth in credit card and 3.6% growth in mortgage loans. Commercial loan growth reflected increased business activity and higher utilization rates across both large corporate and middle-market portfolios. Pipelines are strong going into the third quarter and working capital needs remain elevated. In the retail portfolio, we saw good growth in credit card balances, reflecting strong spending activity and typical seasonal trends. Purchase mortgage, market share gains and lower prepayment activity continue to support residential mortgage balance growth. Turning to Slide 9, total average deposits increased by 0.5% compared with the first quarter. Growth in interest-bearing deposits more than offset the impact of lower balances of non-interest-bearing deposits, reflecting the rising interest rate environment. Total average deposits increased by 6.4% compared with a year ago. Slide 10 shows credit quality trends, which continued to be strong across our loan portfolios. The ratio of non-performing assets to loans and other real estate was 0.23% at June 30 compared with 0.25% at March 31 and 0.36% a year ago. Our second quarter net charge-off ratio of 0.20% improved slightly versus the first quarter level of 0.21% and was lower compared with the second quarter of 2021 level of 0.25%. Credit performance across our commercial and retail portfolios continues to be strong. On a linked-quarter basis, both early and late-stage delinquencies decreased for the total portfolio. Our allowance for credit losses as of June 30 totaled $6.3 billion or 1.88% of period-end loans. Slide 11 provides an earnings summary. In the second quarter, we reported $1.09 per diluted share, excluding $0.10 per share of merger and integration charges related to the planned acquisition of MUFG Union Bank. Turning to Slide 12, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis totaled $3.5 billion, representing an 8.3% increase compared with the first quarter and a 9.5% increase from a year ago. Linked quarter growth was driven by strong earning asset growth and a 15 basis point increase in the net interest margin. Slide 13 highlights trends in non-interest income. Non-interest income grew 6.3% on a linked-quarter basis, but declined by 2.7% from a year ago as lower mortgage banking revenue more than offset strong performance in other fee businesses. The decline in mortgage banking revenue primarily reflected lower refinancing activity in the market which continues to pressure total application volumes and related gain-on-sale margins. In the second quarter, total payment fee revenue increased by 9.7% compared with the year earlier, reflecting strong underlying business trends supported by investments we are making. Slide 14 provides linked quarter and year-over-year revenue growth trends for our three payments businesses. Because of the cyclical nature of our payments businesses, we believe year-over-year trends are a better indicator of underlying business performance in a normal environment. Credit and debit card revenue increased 0.8% on a year-over-year basis as the impact of higher credit and debit card volume was offset by lower prepaid card activity. Excluding prepaid card revenue, credit and debit card revenue \u2013 fee revenue would have increased 10.1% compared with the second quarter of 2021. Year-over-year credit and debit card revenue growth rates continue to be negatively impacted by the decline in prepaid card revenue as the benefit of government stimulus has dissipated. We provide detail on prepaid card revenue over the past five quarters in the upper right hand quadrant. While prepaid card revenue is approaching a run-rate on a linked quarter basis, it will impact year-over-year credit and debit card revenue comparisons through the end of 2022. The bottom half of the slide illustrates the strong year-over-year growth rates in both merchant processing and corporate payment fee revenue over the past last several quarters. While we expect the year-over-year growth rates to moderate from current levels, we continue to believe that both merchant processing and credit and corporate payment fee revenue can grow at a high single-digit pace on a year-over-year basis in a post-pandemic environment. Slide 15 provides some additional information on our payment services businesses. On the right side of the slide, you can see that the strong momentum we are seeing in tech-led revenue growth within our merchant acquiring business. In the second quarter, tech-led merchant revenue, which accounted for 27% of the total merchant acquiring revenue, was 13% higher than a year ago and 43% higher than the comparable 2019 period. A key to that trajectory is the strong growth we have seen in new tech-led partnerships. In the second quarter, new tech-led partnerships totaled 1.6x the number of new partnerships we acquired for the entire year of 2019 and we continue to add to that customer distribution baseline. Turning to Slide 16, non-interest expense increased by 0.7% on a linked quarter basis, excluding merger and integration costs associated with the pending acquisition of Union Bank. The change in expense was driven by higher compensation expense, marketing and business development expense and other non-interest expenses partially offset by lower employee benefit expense and other expense categories. The higher compensation expense was driven by the impact of seasonal merit increases and 1 additional day in the quarter as well as variable compensation tied to revenue growth. Slide 17 highlights our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio at June 30 was 9.7%. As a reminder, at the beginning of the third quarter of 2021, we suspended our share buyback program due to the pending acquisition of Union Bank. After the closing of the acquisition, we expect to operate at a CET1 capital ratio of approximately 8.5%. We continue to expect that our share repurchase program will be deferred until our CET1 ratio reaches 9.0% following the pending deal close. On Slide 18, I will now provide some forward-looking guidance for U.S. Bank on a standalone basis. This guidance does not include any potential impact from Union Bank. Let me start with the full year 2022 guidance. We have updated our interest rate expectations to be consistent with the market expectations. We continue to expect total net revenue to increase 5.6% compared with 2021. Given our revised interest rate assumptions, we now expect low to mid-teen growth in taxable equivalent net interest income compared with our previous estimate of 8% to 11%. We expect higher rates to pressure mortgage application volumes more than previously anticipated, which will negatively impact our mortgage banking revenue. We now expect fee income to be slightly lower for the full year of 2022 compared with our previous expectation that fee revenue would be stable. We continue to expect positive operating leverage of at least 200 basis points in 2022, excluding the impact of merger and integration-related costs associated with the Union Bank transaction. For the full year of 2022, we expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately 22%. Now, I will provide guidance for the third quarter. We expect total revenue to grow 3% to 5% on a linked quarter basis. In the third quarter, we expect linked quarter non-interest expense growth of 2.3%, excluding merger and integration-related costs as we prepare for the Union Bank transaction. Credit quality remains strong. Over the next few quarters, we expect the net charge-off ratio to remain lower than historical levels, but will continue to normalize over time. Adjustments to our loan loss reserve in the near-term will primarily reflect loan growth and changes in the economic outlook. If you turn to Slide 19, I will provide an update on our previously announced pending acquisition of Union Bank. In September of 2021, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the core regional banking franchise of MUFG Union Bank. We continue to make significant progress in planning for closing the deal in the second half of 2022, while we await regulatory approval. As you know, regulatory approvals are not within the company\u2019s control and may impact the timing of the closing of the deal. As a reminder, we expect to close on the deal approximately 45 days after being granted U.S. regulatory approval. Because this timing would likely indicate a late third quarter or early fourth quarter close, we believe it is prudent to shift the system conversion date to the first half of 2023. The financial merits of the deal remain intact. Our original EPS accretion estimates are unchanged and we continue to estimate the acquisition will generate an internal rate of return of approximately 20%, which is well above our cost of capital. I will hand it back to Andy for closing remarks. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Terry. Our second quarter results were supported by solid account growth, deepening of existing relationships and strong business activity across our banking and fee business lines and we are well positioned as we head into the second half of the year. Credit quality remains strong and we continue to prudently manage operating expenses even as we invest in our digital initiatives, our payments capabilities and in our technology modernization. In closing, I\u2019d like to thank our employees for all they do and we look forward to welcoming Union Bank employees to our company. I remain confident in the strategic and financial merits of this transaction and the meaningful benefits that will accrue to our customers, our communities as well as our shareholders. We will now open up the call to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Scott Siefers : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Terry Dolan : Good morning, Scott. Scott Siefers : I was hoping \u2013 apologies if I missed any of this in the prepared remarks, but \u2013 so it was nice to see overall deposits up a bit. The mix is changing just a bit as you go forward, I guess, but maybe thoughts on major sort of what you would expect in overall deposit balances as we go forward, how the mix might change and any thoughts on what you are seeing with pricing pressures on funding costs? Terry Dolan : Yes, Scott. Certainly, with the quantitative tightening that\u2019s taken place, I think the growth rates with respect to deposits in the industry will be relatively stable or maybe even down a little bit. But our expectation, at least in the near-term, is that overall deposit balances will be fairly stable for us. We have a lot of sources of deposits, including our corporate trust and our \u2013 the mix between our money market funds and our on balance sheet. From a mix standpoint, as you would expect and what we have seen both for us and in the industry is that the mix starts to change when rates rise. And so we are starting to see the mix between non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing start to change with a shift out of non-interest-bearing balances into interest bearing sort of categories as people are looking at seeking sort of yield. And then when we think about deposit pricing, it\u2019s been relatively low for the first rate cycle or rate hikes that we have seen. And in fact, it\u2019s \u2013 for us, we have actually outperformed our expectations, which is good to see and which is a reflection in part, because we have higher level of consumer balances today than we did, for example, 4 or 5 years ago, et cetera. But when we get into the next 125 basis points, so if you think about the next two rate hikes that the market is expecting, our expectations, deposit betas will probably be in that low to mid-30s kind of in that ballpark. Scott Siefers : Okay, that\u2019s terrific color. And I appreciate that. Thank you very much, Terry. Maybe a separate question, can you walk through any updated thoughts on sort of the capital ramifications from the pending transaction? I guess just a lot has changed in terms of both possible credit and certainly rate environment. Just curious to hear any thoughts that you have in so far as you\u2019re able to given while it\u2019s still pending. Terry Dolan : Yes. I think that right now, the capital implications are in line, certainly, with a rising rate environment, the mark-to-market is a little bit more than what we maybe had modeled in the original deal. But once you close that transaction, it accreted back into income pretty fast. Our expectation, as I said, is that CET1 will be somewhere around 8.5% at the time of closing. Of course, that will be dependent upon where rates are at that particular point in time. But the transaction accretes pretty quickly. So we do expect capital to continue to grow and accrete after the transaction. Andy, what would you add? Andy Cecere : The only thing I\u2019d add, Terry, is that \u2013 as you talked about in your comments, we\u2019re making significant process in planning for the closing of the deal, which we \u2013 as we talked about, and now expect in the second half. We targeted a second half conversion last time we talked and now \u2013 and it was going to be Veterans Day. Given now that we\u2019re coming upon little later close, we\u2019re moving the conversion date to President\u2019s Day weekend. So that\u2019s what our planning assumption is for all the teams working on this. That\u2019s that next 3-day weekend. And as Terry mentioned, our financial targets that we initially articulated are still intact, although the timing of the cost savings might be a little different, the synergies are still $900 million. And Terry, maybe you can talk about, given the rate environment, the accretion dilution per earnings share. Terry Dolan : Yes. Again, the accretion, when you think about the earnings per share accretion, we still feel very comfortable with respect to the 6% accretion in 2023, a couple of different things. Obviously, the timing will affect our ability to achieve all of the cost synergies that we expected in 2023. And so of the $900 million that Andy talked about, our expectation is we will probably achieve 50% to 60% of that next year. But what\u2019s offsetting that is with the rising rate environment, we\u2019re going to see stronger revenue that will help to offset that. Scott Siefers : Great. That\u2019s perfect. Andy and Terry, thank you very much. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Scott. Terry Dolan : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pancari from Evercore. Your line is now open. Andy Cecere : Good morning, John. John Pancari : Good morning. On the payments revenues and the merchant revenue, I know you had indicated that you do expect those revenues on a year-over-year basis to moderate here, but as you see high single-digit year-over-year growth is reasonable post pandemic. So just to understand that a little more in terms of the coming quarters over the next several quarters, that moderation that you see, is that going to put you in that high single-digit range? Or do you expect growth to be lower than that high single-digit year-over-year range in coming quarters as payments volumes moderate? Terry Dolan : Yes. So our expectation when we get to more of a normal environment is that payments would have the high single digits sort of growth rate. So it\u2019s a continuation of the business. The growth rates that we\u2019re talking about in terms of moderating year-over-year is really from the very high growth rates that we saw post pandemic as the cyclical recovery occurred. But think of payments in the single \u2013 high single digits. John Pancari : Okay. So \u2013 got it. So then in the moderation, is there a way you can maybe help characterize what type of level do you think is reasonable in the coming quarters as the moderation takes hold? Terry Dolan : Yes. I think part of it in terms of moderating the growth rates, part of it is we will start to see from \u201822 to \u201823 kind of getting into a more normal environment. So I think that it\u2019s still probably a little bit of a higher level when we think about the third quarter or in the near quarters, but certainly, as we get into 2023, I think it moderates to that high single digits. John Pancari : Okay. I gotcha . Got it. And then just on the credit front, clearly, you guys are certainly were generally historically more conservative standpoint. How \u2013 can you maybe talk a little bit more on how you\u2019re thinking about the loan loss reserve here particularly from a CECL perspective? As you\u2019re dialing in the scenarios, you have to assume the economic scenarios are going to get worse incrementally here given the Fed actions. So how do you see that impacting your reserving here just from a scenario standpoint and given the CECL requirements? Terry Dolan : Yes. Maybe as a reminder, when we end up looking at scenarios, we look at five different potential scenarios from a baseline to something that\u2019s slightly better to something that\u2019s worse and as severe, maybe as a more severe recession. So I think about that range. For some time, there is been an uncertainty if you think about Ukraine now. And when we end up looking at the different economic and we weight those assumptions, we\u2019re really waiting to a little bit more of a downside scenario. Relative to that baseline, we are trying to take the economic situation into consideration. So I feel like we\u2019re in a pretty good spot in terms of how we are thinking about it. And what I would say, John, is that at least in the near-term, think about the second half of this year, growth in \u2013 or changes, I think, in the loan loss reserve will probably be driven more by loan growth than anything else. John Pancari : Okay. Got it. So you don\u2019t necessarily, over the next couple of quarters, see an outright build related to the economic backdrop based upon the forecast that you\u2019re looking at now? Terry Dolan : I think it will be more driven by loan growth than our scenario weightings getting worse, at least not measurably worse. John Pancari : Right, right. Okay. And then one more related to that. I guess just as economic scenarios do intensify and you think if a build does begin to moderate, I mean, any way to just longer-term help us think about the magnitude? I mean we just had another \u2013 one of your competitors talk about how the pandemic-related reserve levels may not be applicable to where the banks built the pandemic-related reserves to. Would you agree with that, that the pandemic-related reserve levels were probably overly draconian? Terry Dolan : Yes. It was as you kind of went through the pandemic, it was hard to know exactly where the economy was going. So I do think that the level of reserve builds were pretty aggressive and rightfully so at that particular point in time based upon, what we knew. I think that as we see the next economic recession kind of develop, again, John, we try to manage through the cycle. And our underwriting is strong and all those sorts of things. So while there will be reserve build certainly from an economic outlook point of view, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be anywhere near what it was as a result of the pandemic. John Pancari : Got it. Thank you so much, Terry. It\u2019s helpful. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Your line is now open. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Terry. Good morning, Andy. Andy Cecere : Hi, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Terry, to follow up on credit quality, can you share with us, certainly, I\u2019m with you, I don\u2019t see the reserves needing ever to get close to what you guys had to do during the pandemic when unemployment went to 14.5%, and we had an annualized rate of decline in the second quarter GDP in 2020 of over 35%. But can you share with us in the rate stress testing for your commercial customers or anybody on variable rate loans, at what point do rising rates really start to give you guys a little discomfort? Is it 200 or 300 basis points higher? Any color there? Terry Dolan : Yes, I don\u2019t know if you have... Andy Cecere : I think what drives loan activity more than anything is the economic growth and GDP. And I think from a rate scenario standpoint, in terms of credit risk, if you think about the defense side, Gerard, I think we underwrite to a higher rate environment for variable rate loans. So I think we\u2019ve already taken that into account. And we look at cash flows under different rate scenarios as we think about putting those loans on the book. So we\u2019re less \u2013 I\u2019m less concerned about rising rates impacting credit. I do think rising rates as that impacts the economy will impact loan growth at some point. Gerard Cassidy : No. Okay. Very fair. And then, I guess, as a follow-up, sticking with credit, it seems like in past cycles, excluding 2020, there was a gradual lead into the downturns, and we \u2013 I think many of us could have seen what was going on in the aggressive lending of \u201806 going into \u201808, \u201809 or \u201888, \u201889 going into \u201890. We don\u2019t seem to have that this time. So can you guys \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you can give us any further color on what is it that the market is \u2013 so it seems like so concerned about what banks that were going to hit a brick wall or go off a cliff on credit possibly in 6 to 12 months. Any further thoughts there? Andy Cecere : Yes. I do think it\u2019s the \u2013 banks are a reflection of all the customers that we serve and to the extent the recession impacts those customers that will impact us. And I think that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing bank stocks, usually when rates go up, bank stocks outperform. Bank rates \u2013 we\u2019ve been waiting for a while for rates to go up. They are probably going up and bank stocks are going the other way. And I think it\u2019s that fear of recession for all the reasons we\u2019ve talked about. And as I\u2019ve talked about, Gerard, I think we are preparing for any scenario because the range of scenarios, and I talked about this before, he says, wide as I\u2019ve ever seen it in my career. The probability of different events occurring, there is a lot of uncertainty out there, a lot of inputs into things that we\u2019ve never had before. And I think all that uncertainty just translates into people being careful and a little prudent in terms of their investments. Gerard Cassidy : And with that, are your customers seeing any clear evidence of the slowdown from the tightening that\u2019s already gone on? Or is it still \u2013 are the customer is still in pretty good shape in terms of their businesses, generally speaking? Terry Dolan : Yes. Maybe a couple of different things that certainly we watch, I mean from a consumer spend standpoint, it continues to be very strong. From a \u2013 and that obviously is what businesses are seeing now that consumer spend is shifting a bit in terms of where it\u2019s occurring. It\u2019s less discretionary, certainly more non-discretionary on food and fuel and those types of things. It is probably shifting away from a lot of the retail purchases toward service-related type of activities. But the overall level of spend is still pretty strong. I would also say that the consumer balance sheet is strong. They still have deposit balances that are in excess of where they were pre-pandemic. I think in part, that\u2019s allowing at least on the average for that consumer to spend to continue. And then they are willing to draw down on their credit card lines as well. On the business side, the way that I would characterize it as we\u2019re continuing to see inventory builds. I think that part of the loan growth that we\u2019re seeing or experiencing maybe businesses trying to get ahead of inflation a bit in terms of acquiring inventory today as opposed to something that might have a 10%, 20%, 30% rate increase. The one thing I would say though, Gerard, is that I think that business owners, especially in the middle market space, are just more cautious today. And it comes back to what Andy said, it seems like a strong economy today, but the range of possibilities is very wide. And so people are trying to take that into consideration when they think about running their business. Gerard Cassidy : Fellas, thank you very much as always and good luck on closing the deal in the second half. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Gerard. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Erika Najarian from UBS. Your line is now open. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Erika. Terry Dolan : Good morning, Erika. Erika Najarian : Just a new clarification questions for my first one. Terry, you mentioned that deposit beta could be in the low to mid-30s for the next 125. Can we interpret that in terms of the cumulative beta by fourth quarter? Does that mean that we will be the cumulative beta by the fourth quarter? Or does that mean that the cumulative beta would be lower than that range by fourth quarter because we have to take into account the first 100? Terry Dolan : It would be lower. I mean, the average obviously will be less. So what I\u2019m really talking about is the next two rate hikes and what we would see in terms of deposit betas in reaction to that, so... Erika Najarian : Got it. I\u2019m just comparing it to appear that reported also today, I think they mentioned that the cumulative beta would be in the low 30s by year-end. And it sounds like based on the math, you could outperform that. Terry Dolan : Certainly, in terms of what we are experiencing, the deposit betas in the first rate hikes has been lower than what we had expected. I think from just in terms of the industry and where we were starting from the betas for us, at least, have been lower. Erika Najarian : Got it. Okay. And Andy, maybe taking a step back and asking more of an industry question. Clearly, the market is very worried about a recession. And clearly, the market accepts that U.S. Bank has one of the best quality balance sheets out there. The bank has spent a lot of time building their corporate market share. I guess my first question to you is, as you think about the relative resilience of banks potentially in a recession like Gerard alluded to, and the amount of sort of lost market share to non-banks, do you see some of that coming back to \u2013 that market share coming back to the industry generally in U.S. Bank specifically? Or was some of that credit quality never something that you wanted to underwrite and put on the books to begin with? Andy Cecere : It\u2019s a good question, Erika. I think there is a little bit of a shift already occurring and what you\u2019re seeing in some of the non-bank competitors. First of all, the banking industry is in terrific shape from a capital liquidity just from a defensive standpoint, much better than we were during the last downturn and that includes U.S. Bank. And you saw our results of the stress test, which showed us performing very well in a very stressful environment. And I think that\u2019s a reflection of all those things, including our diversity in our credit underwriting discipline. I do think traditional credit models work through cycles, sometimes new credit models work when things are going well and are a little more challenged when things aren\u2019t going so well. And so we will see how those new credit models and new ways of doing underwriting will work in this downturn. But I do think that banks and certainly U.S. Bank\u2019s models have been proven through multiple cycles. Erika Najarian : And my third question is, I think that most of the Street subscribes to the idea that payments, is going to be a secular winner for U.S. Bank. And there is clearly a debate right now on how weak does the consumer get in a downturn. Nobody is worried really about credit surprises in the consumer with U.S. Bank. But how should we think about the range of outcomes in payment activity and spend if we do have a recession? Andy Cecere : Yes. Erika, it depends how severe that recession is, certainly. But as Terry alluded to, what we are seeing is the consumer is still in a very good position. They have a lot of cushion we have $2.5 trillion of excess savings versus pre-pandemic levels. For U.S. Bank, we\u2019re still at 2 to 3x deposit level. So they are still spending dollars that they have not spent over the past few years. And as you know, the unemployment numbers are very good. So I think there is enough cushion. And I do think that at least for the near-term, that cushion will allow continued spend activity, albeit, as Terry mentioned, in a little bit different categories, certainly from goods to services and a little bit more in terms of non-discretionary, but we\u2019re still seeing strength there. And again, how that ultimately comes out will depend upon those that range of outcomes that I talked about that\u2019s pretty wide. Erika Najarian : And just one last one on the fee income guide, you said lower than 2021. Did you quantify how much? Terry Dolan : I am sorry, related to what? Andy Cecere : So Terry, she is asking if we quantify the fee income guide, and we quantified total revenue in that 5% to 6%. Terry Dolan : We did \u2013 yes, exactly. Erika Najarian : Sorry, I am too much going. Okay. Andy Cecere : No problem. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Andy Cecere : Hi Mike. Good morning. Mike Mayo : Hi. Good morning. So, I look at Slide 7, I am trying to look at \u2013 I am squinting on that, and that\u2019s the number of joint business banking and payment customer relationship growth, and you have that indexed at 100, starting at March 2021. And by looking at a blue line versus the green line, and this is your big effort. And so I guess you are up, with my splinting here, you are up 5% year-over-year from the growth in accounts that you use both banking and payments. Is that correct? Andy Cecere : That\u2019s right, Mike. Sorry for the squinting, but yes. So, if you index back to 100, we are up just under 6% on those combined relationships that have both banking and payments products and that\u2019s almost 2x what just the total relationships, which would imply just single service relationships are below that green line. Mike Mayo : Okay. And how much is this contributing to your growth? I mean you had outsized growth in payments, Slide 14. You have had outsized growth in commercial loans, Slide 8. So, can you kind of disassemble this? Like what percent of the growth is due to this business banking and payment initiative? And how much is just due to the environment, the onboarding of the economy post pandemic? Andy Cecere : I think it\u2019s a little bit of both. We are still, as I mentioned, in the early innings of all this. But I will tell you, Mike, that we have a tremendous focus on this on both the Business Banking segment as well as the Commercial segment. And I think this concept of weaving together banking and payment services into a comprehensive offering is going to be meaningfully important to our growth rates, both acquiring customers and providing more products and services to the current customers. And it is one of my top priorities. It\u2019s one of the company\u2019s top priorities across many business lines. And I do think it\u2019s driving the growth that you are seeing in both business activity as well as corporate activity. Mike Mayo : And then an unrelated question. I mean commercial loan growth is growing very strong. And what\u2019s the pricing like on commercial loans? It just seems like there is such a disconnect between the capital markets, which is charging so much more for credit and the bank lending markets, which might be charging more but not nearly as much. Terry Dolan : Yes. I think that, Mike, in the commercial side, corporate loan side of the equation, the \u2013 it\u2019s still pretty competitive from a pricing point of view. And so I would tend to agree in the sense that credit spreads haven\u2019t widened maybe as much as we might have expected at this particular point in time. And I think part of that kind of comes back to what economy are we looking at? I mean it\u2019s \u2013 again, today, it looks pretty good. But my expectation is if you have this type of loan growth and the economic outlook people are kind of expecting, you would expect those credit spreads to be widening and spreads to be widening our loans more, not seen it yet though. Mike Mayo : So, does that \u2013 I mean you are the most conservative bank in the industry based on several metrics, bond spreads, credit rating agencies, all that sort of thing. So, as the most conservative bank in the industry, among the largest, does that mean do you forgo some of this lending, or do you just plow ahead with the assumption that we are not going into any sort of hard landing? Andy Cecere : Mike, it\u2019s a good question as well. So, Terry and myself and our leaders are being very disciplined about what we are putting on our balance sheet. And I will tell you that while we had strong loan growth, it could have been a heck of a lot stronger, but it wasn\u2019t because we are not putting those deals that are either not appropriate from a credit standpoint, certainly or from a spread standpoint or a return standpoint. So, we are growing good loans, we could have grown more, but we didn\u2019t. Terry Dolan : Yes. And a perfect example, if you end up looking at the growth in auto lending for us over the last quarter or two quarters, although spreads have been very competitive, they have not been responsive to the rising rate environment. And we are willing to give up some of the volume there, simply because of the fact that returns are not as strong as they should be, given the current environment. So, that would be an example of the discipline we are talking about. Mike Mayo : Okay. Thank you. Andy Cecere : Thanks Mike. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Andy Cecere : Good morning Matt. Matt O\u2019Connor: I wanted to ask about the credit marks related to the pending UB deal. Obviously, spreads have widened as was just discussed. And just I would think that means kind of more marks and maybe just frame how meaningful that might be? Is there a risk that the CET1 is below 8.5%? And then of course, on the flip side, if you are marking that book down a little bit more aggressively, maybe you are essentially done building reserves in that portfolio even if we do get the hard landing. Terry Dolan : Yes. Well, maybe from a credit mark standpoint, I think it\u2019s pretty consistent with what we had expected. I mean that portfolio performs pretty strong. In terms of the mark-to-market from a rate point of view, it certainly is higher than what we had originally modeled out. That will put a little bit of pressure, as I mentioned earlier on the day one closing CET1 ratio which we still expect to be around 8.5%. It might be a little bit lower than that, but \u2013 or a little higher. It kind of just depends upon where rates are at that point in time. But as you say, it accretes back into income pretty quickly. And, so it\u2019s not really a significant concern at this particular point in time for us. I do think, Matt, also, we talked a little bit about the timing of synergies related to the cost synergies, maybe with the system conversion moving back being a little bit lower than what we had modeled, but the benefit of the mark-to-market will offset that. So, from an overall earnings accretion point of view, we still very \u2013 still feel very comfortable with 6% in 2023. Matt O\u2019Connor: And then just to summarize, so the credit markets aren\u2019t really impacted by kind of macro forecast and what we are seeing in public markets. It\u2019s more what you are seeing in the actual portfolio as we think about the credit marks themselves? Terry Dolan : Yes. I mean obviously, we have to take into consideration what our assumptions are from an economic outlook point of view. But as I mentioned earlier, those haven\u2019t changed a lot yet at this particular point in time. And so again, it depends upon the timing of the closing and what happens between here and then. But at least at this particular point in time is the quality of the portfolio is good. It\u2019s performing well, etcetera, so\u2026 Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then just separately, you talked about mortgage fees being weaker than expected in your full year guidance. Obviously, we are seeing that for the industry overall. But any signs of the gain on sale margin stabilizing? And then in the servicing book, it doesn\u2019t feel like we are getting the full benefit of the slower prepayments. I know there can be a little bit of a delay as we look across some of the banks, we are not seeing that. Is there still some benefit from the servicing book to kick in? Terry Dolan : Yes. So, a couple of different things. As we talked earlier, there will continue to be pressure on mortgage banking revenue. We think about it on a linked quarter basis, third quarter fee revenue in that area is probably going to be pretty similar to the second quarter. But that\u2019s going to be a combination of things, Matt. I do think that there continues to be a little bit of pressure on the volume side of the equation simply because of rising rates. We are seeing, at least for us, the gain on sale starting to stabilize and improve a little bit. Our expectation is that it improves as we go through the rest of the year and certainly into 2023. There is a fair amount of capacity that\u2019s coming out of the system, out of the industry. And so I think that, that will help in terms of gain on sale. From the servicing standpoint, at least from our point of \u2013 in terms of how we end up management and we try to hedge MSR valuations pretty tightly. Obviously, the values of MSRs are improving because of that \u2013 because of rates. And I do expect there is probably opportunity from a servicing income point of view. Matt O\u2019Connor: Great. Thank you. Andy Cecere : Thanks Matt. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Carcache from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Andy Cecere : Thanks. Good morning Bill. Bill Carcache : Yes. Good morning. Assuming the Fed hikes eventually lead to slower growth and higher unemployment as many hiking cycles have historically, could you help us understand at what point you would be required to increase your reserve rate because that increase in unemployment would fall under your reasonable and supportable forecast period under CECL? Does it just need to be more visible before you can act on it? Terry Dolan : Yes. I think there is a lot of uncertainty out there in which direction it\u2019s actually going to go. I think there just needs to be more certainty around what that economic outlook is. Again, kind of coming back to what I mentioned earlier, Bill, we look at a whole variety of different economic outlooks and then we weight them and we have been, for some period of time, kind of waiting them a little bit more on the downside, expecting because of the uncertainty that we have been talking about in the past. So, if a recession hits, we will have to adjust it, but that\u2019s something we\u2019ll have to take into consideration at that time. Bill Carcache : Understood. And maybe following up on that, how much of an impact would you say management overlays are having currently? Many banks have had their reserve rates fall below their day one levels already. And there is a view that the macro outlook today is not as favorable as it was on January 1, 2020. Just curious to what extent overheads are being used to the extent to which you consider using them? Terry Dolan : Yes. I mean I can\u2019t speak for what other people are doing. What I will speak to is that if you end up looking at the reserve rate on day one versus today, the change in that is really probably a couple of different factors, but it\u2019s principally the mix of the portfolio today versus what it was 2 years ago, both in terms of the quality of the asset, but also where we have seen growth over the last couple of years. ABS Securities, as an example, security lending, as an example, is very high quality. That\u2019s where we have seen quite a bit of growth over the last couple of years. And so a lot of it\u2019s mix for us as much as anything. I would say from an economic perspective, relative to certainly day one, it\u2019s probably more on the downside than it was then. So, it\u2019s \u2013 I mean again, I can\u2019t speak to what other people are doing, but it\u2019s really mix driven by for us. Bill Carcache : Understood. That\u2019s helpful. And if I can squeeze in one last one. You guys have unique view given the depth of your consumer and commercial businesses. Maybe could you price out for us what a mild recession you think would look like maybe where you see the greatest risk on both the commercial and consumer side and then specifically within USB? Terry Dolan : Yes. I think the greatest impacts will be on the low and moderate income customers base starting there and that\u2019s where inflation impacts the most, and that\u2019s where we are already starting to see some shift in spend as we talked about from discretionary and nondiscretionary. And I think as that continues that will \u2013 you will see more of an impact there. But the spend levels continue to be good as we talked about. I will tell you, one change that we are seeing for the last 2.5 years, every month, consumer balances, what our checking and savings account balances have risen every single month. We did see sort of a flattening in the last 2 months. So, that\u2019s moderating for sure. So some of that excess savings certainly is not growing, but it\u2019s flattening and starting to be spent. So, I think as that continues, that provides a cushion as we go into the next few months, but that cushion is starting to at least flatten out. So, those are the things we are seeing. And again, as a reminder, we don\u2019t have \u2013 our portfolio is prime only. Our customer base is high quality. So, I think some of those early indicators or early impacts will not be seen in our balance sheet. Andy Cecere : Yes. And then on the corporate side, we have very little leverage lending. That\u2019s just not an area that we get into. Our corporate customers are good investment-grade customers. So, they have certainly the ability to withstand especially a mild recession. Bill Carcache : That\u2019s super helpful. And Andy, maybe going back to your comment around the significant liquidity that the consumers have and how that\u2019s kind of coming down a little bit, but it\u2019s still high, is that something that you think perhaps is maybe contributing to the strength in the spending and potentially could be sort of inflationary in and of itself and lead the Fed to have to do more in terms of hiking, just curious just your high level thoughts on that? Andy Cecere : Yes. I think that\u2019s one of the wildcards or factors that we talked about. We are seeing things in today\u2019s environment that we haven\u2019t seen in other downturns or recessionary impacts. And I think this is one of them. So, we had trillions of dollars of government stimulus, unemployment, and the fact that people weren\u2019t spending given the pandemic for a number of quarters and years and that built up a cushion. And that cushion certainly is impacting spend levels because now they are using it. And that\u2019s that $2.5 trillion of excess savings. And for us, it is that high balance that we are seeing across every level of deposits, zero to $500, $500 to $1,000 up to $10,000, so still well above pre-pandemic levels, but certainly flattening out. And I think that cushion provides a little bit of time, certainly before you start to see some of the impacts from this higher rate environment because people are spending money they already have. Bill Carcache : Thank you so much. Andy Cecere : Thank you. Terry Dolan : Yes. Thanks Bill. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Your line is now open, Andy Cecere : Good morning Ebrahim. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning. Just one quick question on Slide 15, on the payments business, Andy and Terry, so, you talked about just what might happen in the next few quarters. But talk to us, when we think about the business in the medium to longer term, a lot of the digital native companies are struggling right now. What this means in terms of the investments you have made over the last few years to gain market share? Should we anticipate any kind of strategic M&A that helps you further your footprint within the payments business? And then just how that business should evolve relative in the pie chart and the breakdown you provided on Slide 15? I would love to hear your thoughts. Thank you. Andy Cecere : So, I think what we talked about is building this capability, this ecosystem, banking and payments. And we have already made a number of smaller acquisitions, talech being one of them, TravelBank being another that have built our capabilities and thinking about helping companies manage their entire business from a receivables, a payable standpoint, money movement, lending activity cash flows and such. So, the acquisitions that you have seen us make us to do exactly that, that coupled with the investments we have made is what\u2019s driving that, what we think is a great opportunity to build relationships and build revenue within those relationships, and that\u2019s driving to Terry\u2019s articulation of that high-single digit growth. Terry Dolan : Yes. And Ebrahim, I would say that if we have a focus from an acquisition point of view, in the near-term, it will be something that\u2019s very specific to a product or a capability that we are trying to fill in. But quite honestly, we feel pretty good in terms of where we are at right now. Ebrahim Poonawala : And then would you expect that over the next year or 2 years, you are gaining market share in the business? And what I am trying to do is just handicap disruption risk to that business. It\u2019s something that\u2019s on the mind of investors. And it seems like you are making good progress, but would love to hear how you think about where your market share would be if you had to draw out over the medium-term relative to today. Andy Cecere : Yes, I do think we have the opportunity. I think we have two great opportunities. One is we have a big slew of banking customers. That\u2019s on another chart. We don\u2019t have our payments capabilities yet, and we have \u2013 half of our payments customers don\u2019t have our banking. So, we have a great opportunity to provide more products and services to those customers. That\u2019s number one. And number two is, given the capabilities in this ecosystem we are building, we have the opportunity to acquire more customers, which we believe will take share. Ebrahim Poonawala : Thanks. Andy Cecere : Thank you. Operator : And speakers, we have no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back to Jen Thompson. Jen Thompson : Thanks everyone for listening to our earnings call today. Please contact the Investor Relations department if you have any follow-up questions. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Following a review of the results by Andy Cecere, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Dolan, Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 11 :00 a.m. Central Time. I will now turn the conference over to George Andersen, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. George Andersen : Thank you, Allan and good morning, everyone. With me today are Andy Cecere, our Chairman, President and CEO; and Terry Dolan, our Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer. During their prepared remarks, Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation. A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. I\u2019d like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today\u2019s call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today\u2019s presentation in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Andy. Andy Cecere : Thanks, George. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry and I will take any questions you have. And I will begin on Slide 3. In the third quarter, we reported earnings per share of $1.16, which included $0.02 per share of merger and integration charges related to the planned acquisition of MUFG Union Bank. Excluding these notable items, we reported earnings per share of $1.18 for the quarter. During the third quarter, we achieved record net revenue totaling $6.3 billion. Third quarter results were highlighted by strong revenue growth, well controlled expenses and stable credit quality. This quarter, we added $200 million to our loan loss reserve, reflecting loan growth and are consistent through the cycle underwriting approach to risk management. At September 30, our CET1 capital ratio was 9.7%. Our tangible book value per share totaled $20.73 at September 30, or 3.2% lower than the prior quarter, driven by the impact of rising interest rates on our available-for-sale securities. Slide 4 provides key performance metrics. Excluding notable items, we delivered a return on average assets of 1.24% and a return on average common equity of 16.2%. Our return on tangible common equity was 21.4% on a core basis. Slide 5 highlights continued positive trends in digital engagement as consumer and business customers gain a deeper understanding of our digital capabilities and benefit from our digital plus human approach. Slide 6 shows progress across our digital and payments initiatives that are both deepening our core competencies and expanding our competitive advantage which we believe will drive meaningful profit and return referred penetration to our company. One example of our digital initiatives is our launch of Talech Register, a next-generation all in one payments and business analytics platform that is helping to bring greater simplicity, convenience and efficiencies to the point-of-sale for our business banking customers. On the right side of the slide, you can see the continued momentum we are gaining in real-time payments transactions. Year-to-date through September 30, the total number of transactions are 17x higher than the full year of 2020. Recently, we introduced an innovative real-time payment solution to auto dealers where we provide loan funds instantly after a loan contract is finalized. This gives our participating dealer clients greater control over cash flow and helps to improve their day-to-day operational efficiency. Turning to Slide 7, our business banking initiative continues to gain traction with steady progress both in growing accounts and expanding wallet share. Growth in relationships with both banking and payments products has continued to meaningfully outpace growth in total relationships over the past 12 months. Looking ahead, we expect recently launched in innovative offerings and development to help further deepen our existing relationships between business banking and payments customers. Now let me turn the call over to Terry, who will provide more detail on the quarter. Terry Dolan : Thanks, Andy. If you turn to Slide 8, I'll start with a balance sheet review followed by a discussion of third quarter earnings trends. Average loans increased 3.9% compared with the second quarter, driven by 6.5% growth in commercial loans, 4.7% growth in mortgage loans and 6.0% growth in credit card balances. Commercial loan growth reflected increased business activity and higher utilization rates across both large corporate and middle market portfolios. Underlying demand remains healthy as we continue to focus on appropriate return opportunities to prudently deploy our capital. In the retail portfolio, we saw solid linked quarter growth and year-over-year growth in credit card balances, reflecting strong spending activity and lower payment rates. Purchase mortgage market share gains and lower prepayment activity continued to support residential mortgage balance growth. Turning to Slide 9, total average deposits increased slightly compared to the second quarter. Growth in total interest bearing deposits more than offset the impact of lower total noninterest bearing deposit balances as customers respond to the rising interest rate environment. Total average deposits increased by 5.9% compared to a year ago. Slide 10 shows credit quality trends, which continued to be strong across our loan portfolio. The ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was 0.20% at September 30, compared with 0.23% at June 30 and 0.32% a year-ago. Our third quarter charge-off ratio of 0.19% improved slightly versus the second quarter of 2022 and third quarter of 2021 levels. The allowance for credit losses as of September 30 totaled $6.5 billion, or 1.88% of period end loans. The $200 million increase in our reserve this quarter was primarily reflective of loan growth and to a lesser extent uncertainties in the economic outlook. Slide 11 provides an earnings summary. In the third quarter, we reported $1.18 per share, excluding $0.02 per share of merger and integration charges related to the planned acquisition of MUFG Union Bank. Turning to Slide 12. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis totaled $3.9 billion, representing an 11.3% increase compared with the second quarter and a 20.6% increase from a year ago. Linked quarter growth was driven by strong earning asset growth and a 24 basis point increase in the net interest margin, which benefited from rising interest rates, partially offset by deposit pricing and short-term borrowing costs. Slide 13 highlights trends in noninterest income. Noninterest income decreased 3.1% on a linked quarter basis as declines in mortgage banking and treasury management revenues were partially offset by stronger corporate payments revenue and an increase in other noninterest revenue. Compared with a year ago, noninterest income declined 8.3% primarily due to lower mortgage banking revenue, reduced deposit service charges reflecting changes in our policies, and lower treasury management fees due to rising rates, partially offset by higher payments revenue and trust and investment management fees. The decline in mortgage revenue primarily reflected lower refinancing activity in the market, which continued to pressure total application volumes and the related gain on sale margins given excess industry capacity. In the third quarter, total payments revenue increased by 4.9% compared with a year earlier. Slide 14 provides linked quarter and year-over-year revenue growth trends for our three payments businesses. Because of the cyclical nature of our payments businesses, we believe year-over-year trends are a better indicator of underlying business performance in a normal environment. Credit and debit card fee revenue increased or decreased 0.5% on a year-over-year basis, as the impact of higher credit card and debit card volume was more than offset by continued lower prepaid card activity. Excluding prepaid card activity, which was elevated last year in connection with supporting unemployment programs, credit and debit card fee revenue would have increased 3.0% compared with the third quarter of 2021. The bottom half of the slide illustrates the year-over-year growth rates in both merchant processing and corporate payments fee revenue over the last several quarters. Third quarter merchant processing revenue increased 3.6% year-over-year. Growth was negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, given market volatility in Europe and specifically in the U.K. Excluding the FX impact, year-over-year growth in merchant fee revenue was approximately 9.4%. Slide 15 provides some additional information on our payment services business. On the right side of the slide you will see the continued strong momentum we are seeing in our tech-led revenue in partnerships within our merchant acquiring business. The key to that trajectory is the strong growth we have seen in new tech-led partnerships. Through the third quarter, new tech-led partnerships year-to-date were 2.5x the number of new partnerships we had acquired in the entire year of 2019. And these partnerships are continuing to grow. Turning to Slide 16, noninterest expense increased 1.9% on a linked quarter basis, excluding merger and integration costs associated with the pending acquisition of Union Bank. The change in expense was driven by higher compensation, professional services and marketing and business development expenses. Slide 17 highlights our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 common -- our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio at September 30 was 9.7%. On Slide 18, I'll provide some forward-looking guidance for U.S. Bank on a standalone basis. Again, this guidance does not include any potential impact of Union Bank. Let me start with full year 2022 guidance which is consistent with our previous expectations. We continue to expect total net revenue to increase 5.5% to 6% in 2022 compared to 2021. We expect mid-teen growth in taxable equivalent net interest income, which is slightly improved from our previous outlook of low to mid-teens growth. We continue to expect a decline in fee revenue for the full year, primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on mortgage revenue due to lower refinancings in the market. Lower deposit service charges due to pricing changes and a decline in other noninterest income. We continue to expect positive operating leverage of at least 200 basis points in 2022, excluding the impact of merger and integration related costs associated with the Union Bank acquisition. For the full year of 2022, we expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately 22%. I will now provide guidance for the fourth quarter. We expect both total revenue and total core expenses excluding merger and integration costs to increase by approximately 2% on a linked quarter basis. Net interest income will continue to be supported by earning asset growth and higher rates. However, our fee revenue will be lower reflecting typical seasonality and some of our fee-based businesses. Credit quality remains strong. Over the next few quarters, we expect the net charge-off ratio to remain lower than historical levels, but to normalize over time. Changes in the allowance for credit losses near-term will primarily reflect loan growth and changes in the economic outlook. If you turn to Slide 19, I'll provide an update on our previously announced pending acquisition of Union Bank. In September of 2021, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the core regional banking franchise of MUFG Union Bank. We continue to make significant progress and planning for the closing of the deal in the fourth quarter of 2022, while we await regulatory approval. As you know, regulatory approvals are not within the company's control and may impact the timing of the closing of the deal. As a reminder, we expect to close on the deal approximately 45 days after being granted U.S regulatory approval. As previously discussed, we are targeting the conversion date in the first half of 2023. The financial merits of the deal remain intact. Our EPS accretion estimates are unchanged, and we continue to estimate the acquisition will generate an internal rate of return of approximately 20%, which is well above our cost of capital. The company's target CET1 capital ratio is 8.5%. Based on interest rates as of October 13, Our CET1 capital ratio at close would approximately -- would approximate 8.3%. We expect the CET ratio to increase towards 9% as the purchase accounting valuation adjustments accrete into capital through earnings. I'll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Terry. The investments we have made and continue to make across our business lines are paying off in terms of improved customer experience, new customer acquisition and deeper relationships. Expense management is a priority and we continue to target positive operating leverage in 2022 and beyond. We look forward to closing on the Union Bank acquisition, pending regulatory approval. This is a unique opportunity at scale in one of our core markets, and we remain confident in the strategic and financial merits of the deal. The credit -- the current credit environment is benign. In fact, our net charge-off ratio in the third quarter remain near historic lows, and we are not seeing any meaningful early stage metrics that causes concern. That being said, we recognize the pressure points are building in several areas of the economy that could lead to stress in the future. Borrowing costs are increasing, inflation is high, savings rates are starting to decline and the stock market is well off its highs. So while the backdrop is favorable today, it would not be surprising to us to see an economic slowdown develop at some point driven by lower confidence levels, which may lead to reduced spending and business investment. There are a number of scenarios that may play out over the next several quarters. We are preparing for a range of possible outcomes by prudently managing credit, liquidity and capital, so that we continue to grow within our -- through the cycle risk management framework and deliver industry leading returns. In summary, our investments are paying off. We remain diligent stewards of capital. Our balance sheet is strong, and our focus is firmly fixed on managing the company for the long-term. I'll close by saying thank you to our employees. Your hard work and focus are doing the right thing for our customers and communities every day, its recognized and appreciated. We'll now open it up to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] John Pancari with Evercore is online for a question. Go ahead. John Pancari : Good morning. Andy Cecere : Good morning, John. John Pancari : On your commentary around the CET1, falling to 8.3% a close, but need to get back up to the 9% before you resume buybacks. Can you give us a little more color on that in terms of timing around when you think you can reach that 9% with the PA accretion, and how we should think about the magnitude of buybacks at that time? Thanks. Terry Dolan : Yes, thanks, John. So again, our expectation is a closing up 8.3%. But we do expect that will get to roughly 9% within about four quarters. And a big part of that will be, obviously, earnings growth driven by the accretion of the mark-to-market that will end up impacting earnings during that particular timeframe. So, our expectation and what we have been signaling in the past is that we would start our share buyback program once we get to that 9%. So, about four quarters. John Pancari : Okay, all right. Thank you. That's helpful. And then just separately, can you just give more color on the payments trends that you're seeing both in the merchant processing and corporate payments businesses? And maybe if you could just talk about the potential moderation and activity there you could see as the economy reacts to the Fed action? Andy Cecere : Yes, John, this is Andy, and it's interesting. From a credit card spend standpoint, while the categories of spend as we've talked about before have shifted a bit, the level of spend is still fairly strong, about 10% on a year-over-year basis and about 30% above pre-COVID levels. We did get impacted, as Terry noted in his prepared comments, by the FX rate of the pound in our merchant processing and excluding that our revenues would have been up -- just up over 9%. We can -- we -- as well sort of a related topic, we see -- for 2 years, we have seen our consumer deposit levels by account increase. And as we mentioned, last quarter, it's been flat for the second quarter and it's relatively flat, not down modestly here in the third quarter. So we would expect some moderation of spend, but we're not seeing it yet. John Pancari : Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Andy Cecere : Thank you. Operator : Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank is online with a question. Andy Cecere : Hi, Matt. How are you this morning? Nathan Stein : Hello, this is Nathan Stein on behalf of Matt O'Connor. I just want to follow-up quickly on the payments outlook. I think previously, you've talked about higher than normal year-over-year growth in the second -- in second half of this year before moderating to high single digits next year. Just to follow-up on what you were just talking about. Does that guidance still make sense in this environment? Terry Dolan : Yes, I mean, our expectation is with respect to our payments revenues of high single digits and we think that based upon what we are seeing with respect to consumer spend at this particular point in time is that, is still very realistic. As Andy said, relative to pre-COVID, volumes continue to be very strong. And while there is a bit of a shift with respect to where that spend is occurring, it's still continuing. The other thing is that where -- if and when transaction levels start to tail off, I think the impact of inflation will have an offsetting effect. So we still feel pretty confident about it. Nathan Stein : Okay, great. Thank you so much. That's helpful. And then one quick follow-up question. Can you just touch on the plan to manage the balance sheet post the deal closing whenever that is? I think total assets were just above $600 billion at the end of this quarter. And with Union Bank, it'll push you above the $700 billion threshold. So how are you thinking about that going forward? Andy Cecere : Yes, our expectation is that we'll continue to manage the balance sheet in a very prudent way, looking for and supporting relationships that are higher profitable sort of relationships. Our expectation is that -- because I think where you're heading is really related to CAT II, our expectation is that the earliest that we would get into that category is the end of 2024. But our ability to manage risk weighted assets and balance sheet levels may extend that to some extent. Nathan Stein : Thank you. Operator : Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo is online with a question. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Mike. Mike Mayo : Hi. I think at a recent conference, you said that you will not achieve as much synergies from Union Bank next year as you originally thought, but no change in EPS guidance. Did I hear that correctly? Andy Cecere : Yes, that is correct. And if you think about the dynamics, Mike, while the timing has changed and the synergies associated with the $900 million of synergies that we expect to achieve when fully implemented, the timing will be offset to some extent by the accretion of the mark-to-market will be a little bit stronger. So we still feel pretty confident with respect to the accretion levels that we have guided in the past. Mike Mayo : Right. So instead of 75%, you said 40% to 45%? Andy Cecere : Yes, 40% to 50%. Mike Mayo : 40% to 50% and 6% EPS accretive. So if you're getting less merger synergies next year than you originally thought and you have the same EPS guidance, are you de facto increasing the end result of expected accretion from Union Bank? Andy Cecere : Yes, I don't think that we're moving off of our estimates that we have provided in the past at this particular point in time, I think we need to get beyond the closing, the approval and then the closing before we would -- I think would significantly change any estimates at this point. Mike Mayo : Okay. And any early guidance for next year? Some other banks are giving some general kind of guideposts for 2023 in terms of operating leverage. And your guidance is saying this would be some of the best operating leverage in over 5 years, I guess. And just trying to figure out how confident you are in that continuing. I know you invested for a number of years in the tech infrastructure. And now you hope to capitalize on that at a time when business is coming back. But how much follow-through should investors expect for this positive operating leverage? Andy Cecere : Yes, Mike, we're focused on positive operating leverage on a core basis and we'll continue to achieve that. Next year has a fairly large moving prior with Union Bank coming on. So that is going to be our top priority is to make sure we successfully convert and integrate that in this company, which will allow for more positive operating leverage, but that we haven't provided any guidance update on that yet. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Erika Najarian from UBS is online with a question. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Erika. Erika Najarian : Hi. Good morning. Terry, I'm going to have to ask you about the 8.3% pro forma CET1 that you mentioned. You\u2019re estimating at close. I think I didn't realize that there has been a significant conversation in the market that perhaps it has contributed to the 3 months underperformance with concern about the widening of the interest rate marks. So I think that announcement you were looking at a 50 basis point loan mark up on UB's loan portfolio that you're bringing over, given that a significant portion in that portfolio is resi. I think there was a lot of math being done in the buy side, that was, let's say, a 100 basis points lower than what you were giving us. So I guess my question here is, how is the Street getting the math wrong? Or are there protections that are built into the deal? Or are there hedges on UB's balance sheet that seems to be protecting your pro forma CET1 from a greater day one mark relative to how interest rates have moved since announcement? Terry Dolan : Yes, I think it could be a combination of different things. I mean, for example, there is an expectation that they will deliver a certain level of tangible book value and to the extent that they're available for sale portfolio is impacted. Prior to the acquisition, there is kind of a make whole provision within the agreement related to the available for sale securities, so that is part of it. I think some of it could be just what the assumptions are related to the duration of the resi portfolio. And then again, we'll end up looking at and managing in this rate environment the balance sheet as prudently as we can to ensure that we're allocating capital to the appropriate businesses during this timeframe. So it's a combination of a different variety of different things, Erika. Erika Najarian : Got it. So I guess that's the question -- as a follow-up question, that $6.25 billion that they have to deliver there's a make whole provision on the AFS portfolio, but not on the loan portfolio I'm presuming, is what you're saying, Terry? Terry Dolan : That is true. Yes. Erika Najarian : Got it. Is there -- and I'm presuming also there's a potential CDI offset at close that could help offset. But obviously that would be a higher amortization cost in day two and after? Terry Dolan : Yes, I mean, it's a combination of a whole variety of things. I mean, it's not only the interest rate marks, but it's what is the loan portfolio look like in terms of overall quality relative to kind of what our original estimates were, we think that that is slightly better, the CDI. I mean you have to look at all of the different moving parts in terms of coming up with what we think the final impact of the mark-to-market is going to be. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you so much. Operator : Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research is online with a question. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good morning, Andy and Terry. How are you? Andy Cecere : Bill. Bill Carcache : Hi. So we started nice remixing out of available for sale and held to maturity. I wanted to follow-up on that and more specifically whether there's room for you to take the mix of available for sale higher? It'd be helpful if you could just give some color on what guides your decision on how high the HTM mix can go? Andy Cecere : Yes, great question, Bill. So, today we're currently at about 53% held to maturity versus available for sale. And we moved some securities in early July, when rates dipped, that allowed us to be able to kind of increase that percentage. The other thing that we take into consideration is the fact that with respect to the AFS portfolio, there's also floating rate securities that have very little impact with respect to AOCI. So when you end up combining that together, it's about 60%, that is protected, substantially protected for movements in interest rates. So think about it almost as a 60-40 sort of split in terms of the sensitivity to interest rates. And is there opportunity? I mean, we'll continue to look at whether that makes sense, relative to our balance sheet positioning. But at least right now we feel pretty comfortable with that mix. It gives us the AOCI protection as well as some flexibility with respect to managing the balance sheet. And then the other thing you have to kind of think about is that, we have Union Bank that hopefully we'll be closing on here in the fourth quarter. And that ends up influencing decisions that we make with respect to the positioning of the balance sheet. And excuse me, of the securities portfolio, and then also with respect to deposits, we're going to have a significant amount of deposits coming on and that's going to help us as well. Bill Carcache : Very helpful. And separately I wanted to follow-up on funding and more specifically, the decrease in noninterest bearing deposits. Is it reasonable to expect that your mix of noninterest bearing deposits is going to gradually revert to pre-COVID levels as the Fed proceeds with QT? Maybe if you could address that, if you have any views sort of at the industry level and then specifically for USB? Andy Cecere : Yes, well, I certainly think that QT is going to put pressure on deposits overall. And as interest rates rise, you'll continue to see a shift out of noninterest bearing toward interest bearing, whether -- when I think that the assumption with respect to pre COVID may make sense, depending upon how much they bring their balance sheet down, et cetera, how much liquidity they leave in the system. With respect to us, it probably -- if I had to make estimates, I would say that it probably stays a little bit better than where it was pre-pandemic in part because we've grown our consumer portfolio, which tends to offset that. And then we've also worked hard to focus within our corporate trust business on retaining those deposits that are more operational in nature. And as because they're more operational in nature, they tend to be more interest bearing -- noninterest bearing as opposed to interest bearing. Bill Carcache : That makes sense. And sticking with that theme, in terms of the mix of debt relative to your overall funding, that's still well below fourth quarter '19 levels. Can you speak to the likelihood that we should expect that to gradually remix to -- back to pre-COVID levels? Andy Cecere : Yes. Again, I think the broad assumption would be fair, but again, keep in mind that Union Bank is going to be coming on. And they have a significant -- they actually have a higher percentage within their deposit base, its consumer based. And so I think you have to kind of look at the entire mix. And I think we're going to be -- U.S Bank, I think, specifically is probably going to be in a better position than we were pre-pandemic. Bill Carcache : That's great. Finally, if I could squeeze in one last one. Could you speak to your ability to bring off balance sheet money market funds back on balance sheet, maybe some of the dynamics surrounding that? Terry Dolan : Yes, great question. So, currently, we have about 100 -- roughly $130 billion in money market funds. And that is a business that's very tied to our Institutional Investor Services business. Based upon what we need to do from a funding perspective, we have the ability from a pricing point of view to bring that back on balance sheet, or off balance sheet, but it's pricing decisions that then influence customer behavior. And it is a great source for us from a funding standpoint as there is more pressure in deposits going forward. Bill Carcache : Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : Gerard Cassidy with RBC is online with a question. Andy Cecere : Hey, good morning, Gerard. Terry Dolan : Hi, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Hi, Terry. Hi, Andy. Terry, I think in your comments you talked about the residential mortgage business and the gain on sale margins were lower. And I think you reference, there's still excess capacity in that line of business. Can you share what\u2019s your outlook? You've seen some of that capacity coming out in the fourth quarter, if rates remain elevated for the purge over the refi activity, of course, being negatively affected by elevated long-term rates? Terry Dolan : Yes, we certainly are seeing capacity come down in the industry, I think you'd seen various announcements of bank and non-bank mortgage operations, kind of pulling back or reducing capacity. I think it probably still needs to reset to some extent, what's happening with rising rates and the impact that it might have on both refinancing as well as home sales. But we do see it coming down. Our expectation is that gain on sale margins stabilize and probably for us improve a bit. In the third quarter, our gain on sale was down maybe a little bit more than what we had anticipated. But about half of that, excuse me, about half of that is really driven by the mix between correspondent and retail, and the other half of it, which is really more revenue recognition, some timing issues and some secondary kind of market valuation issues, which we think will reverse a bit. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. I saw when we looked at your average loan portfolio, obviously, you've had some very nice growth and seen a very strong growth year-over-year. We're hearing some market chatter and I don't know if it's just the equity REITs are squawking, but apparently the commercial real estate mortgage business might be a little more or less liquid today. Any color that you guys can offer on what you're seeing in commercial mortgage real estate? Is it an area that you're pulling back some? I know you had growth, but maybe some color and insights on what you're hearing and seeing and what your views are for that business? Terry Dolan : Yes. Certainly with respect to commercial real estate, it's an important business for us, and one that will continue to be very focused. And I think part of it is just dynamics in the marketplace. If you end up looking at large corporate REITs sort of financing, I -- we continue to lend in that particular space, we actually probably saw some growth in the third quarter. But we do know homebuilders are starting to pull back, and even making decisions to maybe pull out of potential projects they were planning on doing. And then in the middle market space, in terms of commercial real estate, it's actually still from a pricing standpoint, pretty competitive. And people extending terms associated with that and that's the space that we're not comfortable with at this particular point in the cycle. So we're seeing a little bit of a pressure maybe in the middle market space, but we're fine with that. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you. Terry Dolan : Thanks, Gerard. Operator : Ken Usdin with Jefferies is online with a question. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Ken. Ken Usdin : Hey, good morning, Terry. Thanks. I want to just ask a little bit more on the whole outlook for deposits. I know you talked about the mix. Just wondering just what you guys are seeing given the fact that you have a little bit of a different mix versus most of the peers in terms of any updates and what you're thinking about where betas eventually go to, just given that we're in a completely different rate regime than we might have all thought 6 months ago? Terry Dolan : Yes. Well, maybe I'll kind of start just by reiterating if we end up looking at the mix of our deposit base, it has changed a little bit relative to maybe what we were 3, 4 years ago, et cetera. Certainly we went through the last rate rising cycle, a little stronger consumer, a little more focus around operational deposits within our Trust business, et cetera. Trust is also on a relative basis represents only about 15% of our deposit base today. And then again, think about Union Bank coming on and you know some of the dynamics that that will bring. But coming back to deposit betas then maybe with that context, we're actually performing probably better than what we might have expected. I think deposit betas were about in the second quarter about 30% coming up from about 20%. We would expect that to be maybe in the high 30s as we get into the fourth quarter. But certainly as rates continue to rise and the Fed continues to be very aggressive, it's going to migrate to higher percentages. Our through the cycle estimate right now it's still kind of mid 30s, though, we kind of think about the entire rate cycle that we're going through. Ken Usdin : Okay. And then as a follow-up to that, so as that plays forward, you're still expecting good NII growth into the fourth quarter. I know you're giving '23 guidance, but just can you help us understand like what is the gives and takes to make? Can you still grow NII post the fourth quarter sequentially? Or is it just a reality check about some of these mix and beta functions that make that tougher? Terry Dolan : Yes, well, I think that we can continue to grow NII as we get beyond the fourth quarter. What I would say, though, is that probably the pace of growth changes in the industry. And that'll be a function of -- it'll be a function of the deposit betas changing. And the loan growth that, certainly the industry has been experienced, I think is very strong. I don't know whether it'll keep that particular base as we kind of continue to move forward. Ken Usdin : All right. Understood. Thank you, Terry. Operator : Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley is online with a question. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Andy Cecere : Hey, Betsy. Terry Dolan : Hey, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : On your own securities [technical difficulty], it would be helpful -- maybe you could give us a sense as to how we should be thinking about the pull to par in AFS book, like, if I know it's a big F, but if rates don't change from here, or how many quarters or years is it that we should be breaking into our models? Terry Dolan : Yes, well, I think what we have said is that the duration of the portfolio is a little over 5 years. So if you think about -- if you think about that, I think that probably gives you some guide with respect to how AOCI kind of comes into the capital equation. Betsy Graseck : Okay. So it should -- it's like a longer than 5-year period? Terry Dolan : Yes, a little bit longer, but not much. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And is there anything you're thinking about with regard to restructuring the books once Union Bank comes on? Terry Dolan : Yes, it's -- again, we'll take a look at all the balance sheet and kind of see where it makes sense. We do expect that we might remix the securities portfolio when it comes on. We may end up increasing HTM as a result of what we bring over et cetera. So it is definitely something we will take a look at. Betsy Graseck : And then just separately on the consumer lens that you have in the payment side, could you just give us a sense as to what you saw on 3Q? I know 3Q tends to be a relatively strong quarter for you. Any changes in behavior, any insights as to how you think 4Q will end up shaping up? Andy Cecere : So, Betsy, the consumer spend levels overall continue to be strong, they were up and credit card spend about 10% on a year-over-year basis, about 30% above pre-COVID levels. The mix of categories has changed a bit consistent with what we've talked about before, a little bit away from hard goods to more services and a little bit away from non-discretionary -- to non-discretionary from discretionary. So that shift in spend that we have been discussing continues, but the overall levels are also still very strong. Betsy Graseck : And the savings levels of the consumers are hanging in there? Andy Cecere : Yes, Betsy. So I mentioned that we saw increases across all stratas of balances for about 2 years, but the last two quarters have been stable across all the category. So not growing anymore, but not shrinking dramatically as well. Betsy Graseck : All right. Thanks so much. Andy Cecere : You bet. Terry Dolan : Hey, Ken, I just want to clarify something with respect to deposit betas just to make sure that I've got the percentages right. The deposit betas in the second quarter were about 20%. Deposit betas in the third quarter were just shy of 30%. And we would expect that increase to continue as rates rise and to accelerate a bit -- and again probably in the high 30s when we get into the fourth quarter. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. I will now turn it back to George Andersen. Please continue. George Andersen : Thank you for listening to our earnings call. Please contact the Investor Relations department if you have any follow-up questions. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the U.S. Bancorp Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Following a review of the results, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 11 :00 A.M. Central Time. I will now turn the conference call over to George Andersen, Senior Vice President and Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. George Andersen : Thank you, Brad and good morning everyone. With me today are Andy Cecere, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Dolan, our Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer. During their prepared remarks, Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation. A copy of the presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page two of today's presentation, in our press release, our Form 10-K, and in subsequent reports on file with the SEC. Following their prepared remarks, Andy and Terry will take any questions that you have. I will now turn the call over to Andy. Andy Cecere : Thanks George. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call. I'll begin on slide three. This quarter, we completed the acquisition of MUFG Union Bank on December 1st. In the fourth quarter, we reported $0.57 per diluted share or $1.20 after adjusting for notable items related to the acquisition. This was a complex quarter that included one month of Union Bank results, merger integration charges, and balance sheet optimization activity. Terry will provide more details on these notable items. Importantly, we ended the year with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 8.4%, which was just above our expected level at deal close and we delivered positive operating leverage for U.S. Bancorp legacy operations of 230 basis points for the full year. Strong year-over-year pre-tax provision income growth as adjusted for notable items was driven by net interest income growth and positive operating leverage. Credit quality remains strong, although credit metrics are starting to normalize as expected. Slide four details are reported and adjusted income statement results as well as end-of-period balances and other performance metrics. End-of-period assets for the company totaled $675 billion, reflecting the acquisition of Union Bank and certain balance sheet optimization actions. Slide five highlights key performance ratios. This quarter, we delivered a return on average assets of 1.2%, a return of average common equity of 16.8%, and a return on tangible common equity of 23.4%, each as adjusted for notable items. Turning to slide six. The completion of the Union Bank acquisition marked a significant milestone for our company. With double-digit percent increases in loan and deposit balances, Union Bank adds meaningful scale to our business that enables us to better serve our customers and communities. Union contributes considerable small business and consumer market share in a demographically attractive California market, and we're excited about the potential to deepen existing Union Bank relationships by overlaying our leading digital capabilities and robust product set, including wealth management, consumer and business banking and payments offerings across a loyal but under-penetrated consumer base. In many ways, this deal underscores our commitment to creating a stronger, more competitive regional banking organization in a rapidly evolving environment. One of the more attractive aspects of this transaction is Union Bank's high quality, low cost consumer deposit franchise, which will support continued loan growth and margins. Let me turn the call over now to Terry, who will provide more detail on the quarter. Terry Dolan : Thanks, Andy. If you turn to slide 7, as Andy mentioned, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.57 for the quarter or $1.20 per share after adjusting for notable items related to the acquisition. Notable items related to Union Bank acquisition are comprised of three primary elements that reduced earnings per share by $0.63 related to balance sheet optimization, merger and integration costs, and the impacts of -- on provision expense related to acquired loans and actions taken to optimize the balance sheet. During the fourth quarter, the company recognized a one-time $399 million pre-tax loss on a net basis related to several actions taken to optimize the balance sheet, manage the interest rate volatility impact on capital levels and position the company for future growth. Subsequent to obtaining regulatory approval for the transaction, we entered into interest rate hedges to manage rate volatility and its related impact on regulatory capital from the date of approval through the closing of the transaction in December. During that time frame, long-term interest rates increased nearly 50 basis points before declining approximately 65 basis points. The interest rate swaps were terminated at the time of closing, and the losses recognized through earnings largely offset the interest rate marks recorded into the balance sheet through purchase accounting. In addition, the company optimized its balance sheet by selling certain loans and repositioning its investment portfolio on certain equity investments. Within non-interest expenses, we incurred merger and integration related charges of $90 million that primarily included the impact of specific deal closing costs, professional services and employee related expenses. We also incurred a $791 million charge to the provision for credit losses, which reflects an initial provision impacted by the acquisition of $662 million and a net loss of $129 million related to the securitization of approximately $4 billion of legacy indirect auto loans. Again, these moves enabled us to more effectively position the balance sheet for profitable growth and optimize returns. Slide 8 provides a more detailed earnings summary. Union Bank, which was included in our consolidated results for one month, contributed $302 million of revenue, $221 million of non-interest expenses, $81 million of operating income and $44 million of net income to the company, representing $0.03 per diluted share. On slide 9, end of period loans increased 13.3% on a linked-quarter basis to $388 billion, which included core loan growth and acquired loans from Union Bank. Union Bank contributed ending loan balances of $54 billion net of purchase accounting adjustments, partly offset by a reduction in balances of $15 billion related to balance sheet optimization actions, including loan sales and securitizations. Slide 10 provides end-of-period deposit balance composition. End-of-period deposits increased 11.4% on a linked-quarter basis to $525 billion driven by the acquisition, which contributed $86 billion of lower-cost deposits, and actions taken as a result of the deal to optimize our funding sources. On a core basis, we saw deposit balances decline slightly this quarter. Turning to slide 11. The investment securities portfolio grew 4.2% linked quarter to $170 billion. The addition of securities from Union Bank were offset by balance sheet optimization actions. Slide 12 highlights revenue trends. Adjusted net revenue totaled $6.8 billion in the fourth quarter, which included revenue contribution of $302 million from Union Bank, primarily representing net interest income. For legacy US Bancorp, net interest income grew 5.5% on a linked-quarter basis and 29.2% year-over-year driven by strong earning asset growth and net interest margin expansion, which benefited from rising interest rates. Results were partially offset by higher deposit pricing and short-term borrowing costs. Non-interest income, as adjusted for the legacy company, declined 3.0% compared to the third quarter driven by seasonally lower payment service revenue and lower commercial product revenue, offset by stronger mortgage banking revenue. Year-over-year, legacy adjusted non-interest income declined 5.5% driven by lower mortgage banking revenue from reduced refinancing activity and lower servicing charges, offset by stronger payment services revenue and trust and investment management fees. Turning to slide 13. Adjusted non-interest expense totaled $4.0 billion in the fourth quarter, including $221 million from Union Bank. Included in expenses was approximately $42 million of intangible amortization due to core deposit intangibles established at the time of the acquisition. Legacy non-interest expense, as adjusted, increased 3.8% on a linked-quarter basis largely driven by higher compensation-related expenses as well as higher expenses related to professional services, marketing, technology and tax credit amortization. Slide 14 shows credit quality trends. We reported total net charge-offs for the quarter of $578 million. After adjusting for acquisition impacts and the balance sheet optimization activities, net charge-offs totaled $210 million or 0.23% of average loans, up from 0.19% in the third quarter, which reflected the continuing normalization of credit losses. Non-performing assets for the legacy bank increased slightly, while Union Bank contributed $329 million to the total. On a combined basis, the reported ratio of non-performing assets to loans and other real estate was 0.26% at December 31, compared with 0.20% at September 30, and 0.28% a year ago, reflecting a continued strong credit quality. The provision for credit losses was $1.19 billion, which included a provision of $791 million related to the acquisition and balance sheet optimization activities. This provision includes an initial provision impacted by the acquisition of $662 million and $129 million related to our balance sheet optimization activities. The allowance for credit losses as of December 31st totaled $7.4 billion or 1.91% of period-end loans, which reflects increased economic uncertainty and the incorporation of the Union Bank portfolio. Slide 15 highlights the drivers of our linked-quarter common equity Tier 1 capital position. As of December 31st, our CET1 capital ratio was 8.4%. Acquisition impacts of 180 basis points included an increase in goodwill and other intangible assets that reflected the impact of credit and interest rate marks, the initial provision for credit losses, balance sheet optimization actions, as well as the increase in risk-weighted assets with the addition of Union Bank. These impacts were partially offset by an increase to equity related to shares issued to MUFG as part of the purchase price of Union Bank. Slide 16 provides our current expectations of certain financial metrics related to the transaction. The financial and strategic merits of the deal remain intact and are very attractive. Earnings per share accretion is now expected to be 8% to 9% in 2023, which is higher than originally estimated. While our tangible book value per share dilution is higher than initially estimated due to the significant impact of rising interest rates on the interest rate marks at close, our estimated earn-back period is only slightly longer than our original estimate at two years versus our original estimate of 1.5 years. Slide 17 provides a comparison of credit and net fair value marks from the time of our announcement to closing. Credit marks are lower due to favorable changes in portfolio composition and credit quality, partially offset by economic deterioration. Interest rate marks, inclusive of loans, securities net of sales, and debt, are higher than anticipated at announcement due to higher interest rates, but we expect that to accrete quickly back through earnings. The core deposit intangible is also higher than originally estimated, reflecting the increased value of lower-cost core deposits in a higher rate environment. I will now provide first quarter and full year 2023 forward-looking guidance, which is provided on slide 18, starting with the first quarter 2023 guidance. We expect average earning assets of between $605 million and $610 billion in the first quarter and the net interest margin that is five to 10 basis points higher than the fourth quarter level. Total revenue is estimated to be in a range of $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion, including approximately $100 million of purchase accounting accretion during the quarter. Total non-interest expense as adjusted is expected to be in the range of $4.3 billion to $4.4 billion, inclusive of approximately $125 million of core deposit intangible amortization related to Union Bank. Our income tax rate as adjusted is expected to be approximately 22% to 23% on a taxable-equivalent basis. We anticipate merger and integration charges of between $200 million and $250 million for the quarter. I will now provide guidance for the full year. For 2023, average earning assets are expected to be in the range of $610 billion to $620 billion with net interest margin expansion of between five to 10 basis points compared with the fourth quarter of 2022. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $29 billion to $31 billion, inclusive of between $350 million to $400 million of full year purchase accounting accretion. Total non-interest expense as adjusted for the year is expected to be in the range of $17 billion to $17.5 billion, inclusive of approximately $500 million of core deposit intangible amortization related to Union Bank. Our estimated full year income tax rate on a taxable equivalent basis as adjusted will be approximately 22% to 23%. We expect to have $900 million to $1 billion of merger and integration charges in 2023. I will now hand it back to Andy for closing remarks. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Terry. We accomplished a lot this past year, including the completion of the Union Bank acquisition and a strong legacy PPNR growth supported by positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis. Union Bank adds significant scale to our business and deepens our commitment to serving customers and creating economic opportunities for communities across the West Coast. We continue to target a Memorial Day weekend systems conversion, incorporating a lift-and-shift approach to our applications, which mitigates risk and allows us to more quickly capture meaningful cost synergies. There is still a tremendous amount of economic and geopolitical uncertainty, and we are preparing for any scenario. I believe we will perform well because of the strength of our business, a strong balance sheet and the great team we have. As we've proven during previous economic downturns, our business model is resilient and recession ready in large part due to our disciplined through the cycle credit underwriting standards and robust risk management infrastructure. Our consumer clients are predominantly prime, super prime, and our commercial book is generally investment grade, and we have very little leverage lending commitments. We are focused on prudent balance sheet growth, high return, high margin opportunities and the prudent allocation of capital to lines of business and products best served to deliver on our strategic objectives. Our growth strategy is focused on creating value for our customers, communities and shareholders, which allow us to generate industry leading performance. Let me close by saying thank you to our 77,000 employees across the company, including our newest colleagues from Union Bank. Your dedication and commitment are what make US Bank special and the destination of choice for all the constituents we serve. We'll now open up the call for Q&A. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And we can first go to Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Andy Cecere : Good morning Scott. Terry Dolan : Hi, Scott. Scott Siefers : Maybe a question for you. Just at the top level, was hoping you could speak to what balance sheet and capital management will look like for you. So you're still under $700 billion in assets. But any thought on limiting growth, or will there be additional sales or securitizations to help keep you under there? And then, I guess, on repurchase, I know we're on pause until we get back to the common equity Tier 1 target. But with the looming category move up, would there be any thought to hold off longer than that just to sort of see what happens? Just any thoughts on either of those would be great, please. Andy Cecere : Scott, I'll start. This is Andy and Terry will add in. So first of all, we're not limiting growth in the company. We \u2013 one of the reasons we positioned the balance sheet and took the optimization actions we talked about, Terry went through, was to allow for profitable growth. It also was related to the credit box that we manage within as well as the returns that some of those categories of assets that we securitized were returning. So those are all allowing us to grow in a profitable way in the future. As we talked about before, we not expect to cross the threshold of a Cat II until the earliest at the end of 2024, and that's into the new category at that time. And if we have any further balance sheet optimization actions in securitizations, they would be very nominal and not material in nature. Terry, what would you add? Terry Dolan : Yeah. No, I would just again reiterate, we're ready to be able to adopt Category II by the end of 2024. But there's no real cap. We wouldn't expect any real significant balance sheet optimization from here. And we spent a lot of time positioning the balance sheet for growth as we go forward. Scott Siefers : Wonderful. And then just sort of thoughts on repurchase as well? I know, we're on pause for now, but it's still sort of a crush mark, so would be curious to your thoughts? Terry Dolan : Yeah, Scott. So as we've said in that, we continue to expect that. We are starting about a good spot, about 8.4% CET1. We expect that to creep up to at or above 9% by the end of next year, and it continue to accrete 2023 and continue to move up from that particular point. So one of the things, we'll do is once we get to above 9%, we'll have to make an assessment as to all the different things that are happening out there from a regulatory perspective. I mean, you have the regulators looking at Basel III and are having to think about Category II and those sorts of things. But I think it's really going to be based upon what the landscape at that particular point in time looks like. But certainly, in terms of our core CET1, it will create nicely throughout 2023. Scott Siefers : Wonderful. All right. Appreciate all the thought. Thank you. Terry Dolan : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Next, we can go to Erika Najarian with UBS. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Hi. Good morning. Terry Dolan : Good morning. Erika Najarian : And thank you for all the detail that you gave us on the slides. My first question is on the cadence of the cost synergies as it relates to your expected Memorial Day weekend conversion. So first clarification question, the 35% cost synergies, is that a target for full year 2023? And what is that cadence like? Do we expect very little in cost synergies until Memorial Day weekend and then an acceleration in cost synergy capture as the systems converge? Terry Dolan : Yeah, Erika, great question. And just to confirm, our expectation is that of the $900 million of cost synergies, we'll see about 35% of that next year in 2023. And so from a cadence standpoint, with the Memorial Day conversion, the vast majority of those cost synergies will start to really kick in subsequent to that system conversion. So smaller during the first half of the year much more significant of that 35% in the second half of the year. Erika Najarian : Got it. So the \u2013 so in other words, we should anticipate an exit rate by 4Q 2023 of well above 35%? Terry Dolan : Yes. By the time we get to the end of the fourth quarter, we will have incorporated the vast majority of the cost synergies such that by the time we get to 2024, we will be in a good position to have achieved 100%. Erika Najarian : Got it. And my follow-up question is on the economic outlook. If you could remind us what is being captured in the legacy U.S. Bank reserves in terms of the GDP and the unemployment outlook. And how are you thinking, based on that outlook, charge-offs for legacy U.S. Bank would trend as we anticipate -- it seems like a lot of your peers are anticipating a mild recession from here. Terry Dolan : Yes, I would say that our expectations are probably consistent with that sort of a thought process. When we are thinking about the reserve, our base case is that there is a mild recession probably in the second half of the year and that unemployment ticks up and GDP is either relatively flat or down a bit. When we go through the reserving process, as we've said in the past, we end up looking at five different potential scenarios all the way from a base case to a severe sort of recession. And I would say that from a reserving perspective, we're a little bit weighted towards that downside scenario, so a little bit more conservative. From a charge-off perspective, our expectation kind of using the baseline of about 23 basis points in the fourth quarter that, that will continue to normalize throughout the year. We'll see both the delinquencies and charge-offs moving up. But to kind of give you some perspective, our pre-pandemic was at 50 basis points. We probably don't see that until sometime into 2024. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you. Terry Dolan : Thanks Erika. Operator : And next, we can go to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Terry Dolan : Good morning Mike. Mike Mayo : Hi. Hey good morning. I just wanted to clarify. So, you made your positive operating leverage in 2022 over 200 basis points. If you back into the numbers, I'm getting positive operating leverage year-over-year all-in of somewhere between, I don't know, 100 to 900 basis points. I'm not sure if that's correct. And if you back in the numbers, what do you get? And why the such big variance in the revenue guide? That's a $29 billion versus $31 billion. And why is the margin still increasing five to 10 basis points in the fourth quarter? That's a bit more of an improvement versus others. Andy Cecere : I'll start on a couple of things and then Terry will add in. So, let me sort of go backwards on your questions. The margin is increasing principally because of the value of the low-cost deposits that Union Bank brings on. We talked about that a lot, Mike, and $85 billion of principally consumer low-cost, stable deposits in this environment is very valuable in driving up that margin on a quarterly basis. And that's reflected in that five to 10 basis points. We did achieve 230 basis points of positive operating leverage in 2020 -- hearing a little bit of background. George Andersen : Hey Mike, we're getting a little background. Can you mute your line? Thanks. Andy Cecere : We did achieve 230 basis points of positive operating leverage in 2022. We would expect to achieve continued positive operating leverage into 2023. But 2023 is going to have the merger-related charges in it as well. So I'm looking at it on a core basis. And Terry, what would you add? Terry Dolan : Yes. Just maybe kind of coming back to the net interest margin, we expect see lift related to Union Bank coming on, that five to 10 basis points and then from there, kind of flattish to maybe moderate increase or expansion in net interest margin through the rest of the year. But clearly, deposit betas and things like that are going to accelerate a bit in 2023. Mike Mayo : And as a follow-up, look, U.S. Bancorp had been a low cost producer for a long time. It looks like you're going to trend back in that direction. So it sounds like you still have no change in expected synergies. I get it, Union Bank is performing better, and that's why the accretion you had brought higher, the 8% to 9%. But still no change in expected synergies from the acquisition? And then separate from that, Andy, you mentioned in December that the big tech investment cycle is now turning positive versus being a drag the last five-or-so years. If you could elaborate on that? Thank you. Andy Cecere : Sure, Mike. And you're right, we still are projecting, as Terry went through, $900 million of cost savings, 35% in 2023, 100% fully implemented in 2024. Importantly, we have not in the guidance that we provided, provided any revenue synergies. So it's without revenue synergies, which we think there are going to be some particularly after the integration and conversion process. We are past the heavy spend on tech. You're right, we're more of a flat line and starting to gain the benefits of that. And part of the benefit of this transaction is leveraging the investments we've made in the company over the last three or four years to allow us to lift and shift to our technology platform in a very low cost way. So that benefit is driving through the synergies that we talk about. Mike Mayo : Thank you. Andy Cecere : Thanks Mike. Operator : And now we'll go to John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Andy Cecere : Good morning John. Terry Dolan : Hi John. John Pancari : Good morning. So on the credit metrics, I know you indicated that you're starting to see normalization in charge-offs and delinquencies. I want to see if you can elaborate a bit more. In what income cohorts are you seeing the normalization? We're hearing from some of the consumer finance players that they are seeing some normalization impacting -- or moving beyond just the non-prime and low income but into prime and super prime? And also what asset classes are you seeing the normalization most obviously? Is it just on the card side or in other asset classes? Thanks. Terry Dolan : Yeah. I mean I -- this is Terry. So maybe to address your first question in terms of where we're seeing it and maybe as a reminder, from an underwriting perspective, we focus on prime, super prime really in all of our consumer portfolios. To the extent that we're seeing delinquencies starting to tick up, it's more so in the credit card space. And you're right; it would be probably on the lower bands as opposed to the upper bands at this particular point in time. But one of the things we talked about is that when you look at savings or excess savings from a consumer perspective, they're fairly significant. That is coming down as that's coming down; people are revolving more on their credit cards. And I think it's just kind of a natural progression that we are seeing. And again, starting more with the unsecured and the credit card portfolio, not as much with respect to the other portfolios yet. But as things continue to normalize, we would expect that too. John Pancari : Okay. Thanks. Terry, that's helpful. And then I guess related, how does this development in consumer behavior and your macro assumptions as well, how does that impact your expectations for your payments revenue and your card revenue and merchant processing revenue as you look out through the year, considering the macro dynamics? Thanks. Andy Cecere : Yeah. So the payments revenues, you saw, still is well above pre-COVID levels. The card spend is 25% above. On a year-over-year basis, we're plus 5%. So spend continues to be strong. The categories of spend are shifting a little bit. And we would expect continued strong spend, but moderating a bit as we go into the rest of 2023 for the reasons that Terry mentioned. But still expect growth but again, probably more moderate in nature as we go forward and the savings level start to normalize and the consumer behavior starts to change. Terry Dolan : Yeah. And the thing that I would end up adding, John, is that one of the things we've talked about in the merchant processing is that, we think that business is kind of a high single digits and when we look at 2023, that's kind of our expectation for that particular business. Relative to 2022, we anticipate that our credit card revenue or card revenue will strengthen a bit in terms of year-over-year comparisons. And that is primarily because prepaid sales and prepaid revenue, which has been a drag, kind of starts to moderate. And then on the corporate payment card business, we continue to think that that's going to be reasonably strong, certainly high single digits, if not low double digits. And that's \u2013 we're continuing to see travel and entertainment recover very nicely in that particular space. So we feel pretty good about the payment revenue trends for 2023. John Pancari : Great. Thank you, Terry. Appreciate it. Terry Dolan : Yep. Operator : Next, we go to Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hey, good morning. Terry Dolan : Good morning, Ebrahim. Ebrahim Poonawala : I just want to follow up one on credit. So you talked about consumer. Looking at the CRE slide, just if you don't mind talking \u2013 sharing your perspective around the CRE book, if you're beginning to see any softening either in certain markets, maybe California or within the office CRE book, which is about 10% of loans. Terry Dolan : Yeah. I mean, maybe at a high level, certainly from a CRE perspective, valuations, I think, are moderating to some extent. The areas that we have had probably the greatest focus on if you will, is really office space. And that is really probably as much tied to return-to-office sort of behaviors or patterns. And I think that, that is probably a longer-term sort of structural adjustment that's going to end up happening. We're just going to have to watch it over time. But when we just kind of look at the core CRE portfolio, it continues to perform pretty well from a credit perspective at this particular point. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And I guess, just one separate question around payments. When you think about in your slide, you mentioned about some of the tech investments and partnerships. Just give us a sense of \u2013 remind us around competitive positioning for USB, how you're thinking about just market share outlook and from this partnership standpoint, like areas of like secular growth that you see in this business? Andy Cecere : Yeah. As you mentioned, we've made a lot of investments in tech-led activity, and our tech-led investments have led to that being the principal area of growth for the merchant processing categories. And then on the card side, the partnership's component continues to be an important strength for us and a point of growth as we look forward. So those two areas, tech-led on merchant and partnerships on card, are doing well and it's partly due to the investments we've made over the past few years. Ebrahim Poonawala : And is the strategy there to just build this in-house, or do you see more kind of bolt-on acquisitions within that business? Andy Cecere : Many of the investments we made are internal investments that we've developed our capabilities and our platforms to allow for different activities and allow for integration with some of the software that the company has used to run their business. We've added as well, as you know, miscellaneous M&A acquisitions that -- you said bolt-ons like Atellic or Bento that add capabilities around the edges. And I think we'll continue to do a little of both as we look forward. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good. Thank you. Andy Cecere : Sure. Operator : And we can go to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Terry Dolan : Morning Gerard. Andy Cecere : Morning Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Hi Andy, hi Terry, congratulations on closing the deal. Question for you, Terry, on the balance sheet optimization where you guys decided to sell off certain loans that were acquired. Can you give us some color on types of credits were in those sales? And why would they chose -- I know they didn't meet your credit profile, but what was the driver of that -- I mean some of the details of the credit profiles? Terry Dolan : Yes. Maybe as a starting point, when we thought about the balance sheet optimization, the things that we were thinking about is really repositioning the balance sheet to position ourselves for growth going forward to be able to optimize or improve profitability and looking at profit margins across various portfolios and returns and then the risk profile. So, maybe from a risk profile perspective, we ended up looking at Union Bank portfolios that we end up acquiring, and there were a couple of different areas that we focused on. One is that they had acquired a number of loans related -- or through a lending club channel, if you will. And that was something that we had planned to run off over time originally when we looked at the deal. And we made a decision that when we looked at the kind of the credit risk profile, how it's originated, et cetera, that we thought that taking care of that upfront made a lot of sense. The other area that we ended up selling was some commercial real estate in their particular portfolios in order to be able to kind of bring that concentration down a bit. And then the other areas of optimization was more on the U.S. Bank side. We ended up looking at lower-margin indirect auto loan portfolio. We securitized about $4 billion associated with that particular portfolio. And then the other things that we ended up looking at in the C&I book of business and across kind of our corporate space is just relationships that maybe had lower returns associated with it, where we could optimize that. And so we allowed some of that to run off, so to speak, during the quarter. And those were the primary areas of focus with respect to the balance sheet optimization. Last thing I would maybe say on the investment portfolio side is that we ended up selling about $15 billion of securities, the vast majority of that coming from Union Bank. And that was really to kind of -- think about it from an interest rate risk perspective, HTM perspective, et cetera. But that was the other area where we did some balance sheet optimization. Gerard Cassidy : Terry, where there -- in the corporate loans, were there any shared relationships, meaning you had an exposure to XYZ company as the Union Bank and the total was maybe too much and you guys decided to take that down as well? Terry Dolan : Yes. Exactly. So, maybe from a risk perspective, looking at hold levels or concentrations with respect to specific customers, yes, that was a part of the strategy. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then just as a follow-up, you guys obviously gave us very good detail on your slides. And on the credit quality, slide 14, you give us the breakout in the net charge-offs, and you show us the reported number at 64 bps versus your core legacy number of 23 basis points. If I pull out the $189 million from the optimization, it looks like the net charge-off ratio is around 43 basis points, including the Union Bank numbers. Is that the level we should gear ourselves to for 2023 now that Union will be fully implemented into your business? Terry Dolan : Yeah. Let me clarify. So it's 64 basis points on a reported basis, 23 basis points on a core basis. And there's two components to that core; the balance sheet securitization that I talked about that you articulated. But then under CECL, what you end up having to do is you have to recapture loans that they have charged off you have to make an assessment. And then if you believe that, that charge-off was appropriate, you have to charge that off on day one, so to speak. And there was about $173 million of charge-offs related to those -- to that kind of day one effect associated with CECL. So there's really kind of three components. But 64% on a reported basis, 23% on a core basis. And when we think about going forward, I would use the 23 basis points as the start point, and that's about $210 million worth of core charge-offs. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you for clearing that up. I appreciate it. Terry Dolan : Yeah. Operator : And next, we can go to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Terry Dolan : Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi and congratulations from my end too. And the deck is super clear. I really appreciate all the effort to make it simple and straightforward. So a couple of questions for me, just to follow-up on the discussion we just had. Could we also talk a little bit about how we should think about the reserving level as we go through 2023 and into 2024? Because like you said, you've got the fair value marks, you had to do the day, you had to do the add as per the CECL rules. So does reserve ratio stabilize from here? Does it actually inch down? Is there a scenario in which it would move higher? Could you just frame out how we should think about that? Thanks. Terry Dolan : Yeah. I mean, obviously, it is impacted by a lot of different things in terms of how economic uncertainty ends up changing and the mix of the portfolio, how it might change. But as we think about 2023, I think that, that 191 basis points is probably a good -- is a good metric throughout the year. It might inch down a little bit. But I think that, by and large, we feel pretty comfortable with that as we think about 2023 based upon our base case, so to speak. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then I have one other question on the growth of the balance sheet. I know you addressed this a bit before. But when I look at the 2023 guide versus 1Q 2023, it's a slower growth rate than I think we're used to seeing at USB. So maybe you could help us understand, is this a moderated growth rate during the integration phase and maybe second half that should accelerate up, or is this the level of growth that we should anticipate? And then if you don't mind, I have just a couple of ticky-tackies on the purchase accounting and the CDI and how we should expect that steps down into 2023 and 2024. Andy Cecere : Sure. Betsy, this is Andy. So first, on the growth rate, I think 2022 had exceptional loan growth across many categories, led by commercial as well as CRE. So what we would see is that more normalizing. You're starting to see that in the fourth quarter. And I think the other fact is that, the growth rates are impacted by average balances and some of the optimization activity that we took down in the fourth quarter. It was a partial quarter in the fourth quarter, full quarter in the first quarter and the rest of 2023. But the principal driver is a function of loan demand, which is moderating a bit across most categories. So it's still growing but a less than what we saw in 2022. Terry Dolan : And then, Betsy, maybe related to your second question, which was around the recognition of the core deposit intangible over time, probably the way that I would think about it is that, it's \u2013 it will amortize into income over about a 10-year period. It will step down, and probably a good way of just modeling it is assuming kind of a sum-of-the-years digit sort of approach. Betsy Graseck : And same thing for PAA, or how should we think about that? I mean PAA, I know it's different, but PAA change\u2026 Terry Dolan : Yeah. So that's tied, obviously, to the life of the loans. And it will end up being impacted by prepayments and all sorts of things. If you end up looking at their portfolio that we acquired, about half of it is residential mortgage and half of it is corporate in shorter term. So probably, if you ended up looking at an average life of four, five years, four to six years, that sort of time frame, then of course, that will also accrete probably a little bit faster on the front end. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thank you for that. Terry Dolan : Yep. Thanks, Betsy. Operator : And next, we'll go to Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Terry Dolan : Good morning, Vivek. Vivek Juneja : Hi. Good morning. Congratulations. A couple of questions. The tangible book value recovery, the crossover and the fact that you'd recover that back quickly, can you just give any color on sort of what's the key driver of that? Is it just simply earnings, or is there something else underneath that also that's going to help that come back so quickly? Terry Dolan : Yeah. It's principally the accretion effect that we're going to see with respect to Union Bank, the marks and the underlying earnings of the company. Vivek Juneja : Okay. So the \u2013 because I just heard you say, the accretion \u2013 the question that Betsy asked, purchase current accretion that half the loans are mortgages. So that will take \u2013 come down, I guess, over more slowly? So is that part of it that pre-purchase accounting accretion is going to stay high for longer? Terry Dolan : Yeah. No, I really think it's just \u2013 it really is the kind of the 8% to 9% accretion levels that we're expecting on \u2013 Vivek Juneja : The UB side? Terry Dolan : Yeah. Andy Cecere : Yeah. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Got it. Okay. A couple of other little ones. Deposits, the decline that you had in the balance sheet optimization I think it's pretty sizable, $24 billion. Is it all UB, or is it some of yours? And which types of deposits? Terry Dolan : Yeah. It's a great question. From a deposit standpoint, when you think about kind of the optimization that we went through, we had kind of a focus on a couple of different things. We ended up looking at LCR ratios. We ended up looking at higher-cost deposits, whether that would be brokerage-type deposits or euro dollar deposits, those sorts of things. We made a very conscious decision after getting regulatory approval to kind of reposition that. On the Union Bank side, the one thing that I would point out is that, there's about $8 billion to $9 billion worth of deposits that came over that were more transitionary. And over time, those will transition back to their global investment bank as those customers, kind of, migrate. So, about half of that migrated in the fourth quarter, and I would expect probably the other half of that to migrate in early 2023. But those are kind of the things we ended up looking at with respect to deposit and deposit flows. So, it was really looking at trading out low-cost deposits -- or high-cost deposits for low-cost deposits that are coming over for Union Bank and then some of the Union Bank effect. Vivek Juneja : And what was the OCI number at the end of the year? So, as we think about where -- the going to Category II, how quickly do you expect that to come down so that you can be in better shape? Terry Dolan : Yes. So, OCI at the end of the year is about $8 billion, and the duration of the portfolio is a little over 5%. So, if you can kind of take a look at that, obviously, that's assuming that rates don't move from here. Our positioning from an investment portfolio perspective is about 52%, 53% HTM. We've also entered into some pay fixed swaps that in effect kind of get that up to the high 50s. So, we feel like we're in a pretty good position to be able to deal with -- if rates move up a bit or if rates come down, we have some flexibility there as well. So, we feel like we're in a pretty good spot. Vivek Juneja : All right. Thank you. Operator : And next, we can go to Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. Can you talk about the pace of the capital build from the 8.4% to around 9% by the end of the year? And then also, if the macro is worse than expected and you have to build reserves more, I realize that doesn't move the capital that much. But obviously, everyone else is starting at a higher point of capital, and there is focus on how quickly you can get to that 9% or even higher. So, I guess the question is like what levers can you pull to kind of aren't that painful if you need a little bit more, such as issuing preferreds or some other assets that you could kind of exit without hitting earnings that much? Thank you. Terry Dolan : Yes, I mean, obviously, Matt, from a balance sheet optimization perspective, we're going to be very focused on profitability, returns. And capital is precious. So, we want to make sure that we are dedicating our resources from an asset growth perspective in the right spots. The pace of growth from 8.4% to a little above 9% by the end of 2023, it's fairly ratable across the four quarters. Obviously, first quarter is going to be a little bit lower simply because we will not have seen the cost synergies, and we will be going through and incurring more merger-related costs probably in the earlier part of the year simply because of the timing of the system conversion. So, the pace is probably a little bit more weighted towards the back end. But that hopefully, Matt, kind of gives you some perspective. Again, I'd kind of come back from a reserve point of view, we feel like we look at a lot of different scenarios. We look at the five different approaches, one of which is a severe recession. We take that into consideration. We could see unemployment move up to around 6%, 6.5%, and we still feel like we would be in a pretty good spot from a reserving point of view. So, if it ends up getting -- if it ends up being at a level that's higher, then we'll have to focus on other balance sheet optimization activity. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you very much. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Matt. Terry Dolan : Thanks, Matt. Operator : And we'll go to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Ken. Ken Usdin : Good morning guys. First question, I just wanted to ask is just to follow on the outlook for the year. Can you just walk us through just your underlying assumptions for how NII just projects, if we just think about the core business and in terms of what deposit costs and betas do and how that impacts the underlying trajectory from this first -- from the fourth quarter of NII? Terry Dolan : Yeah. So obviously, net interest income is going to be driven by the earning asset growth that we have in here as well as the margin expansion. We expect that margin expansion to take place five to 10 basis points in the first quarter because of the Union -- full quarter effect of Union Bank. And then again, our modeling is that the margin is -- reasonably moderates from there, reasonably flat, maybe up just a little bit. From a deposit point of view, clearly, deposit betas are going to accelerate. I think that's the reason why you'll see the moderation in terms of net interest income, or net interest margin expansion in the second half of the year. But keep in mind -- and again, this is kind of -- we see that in the first quarter. The Union Bank effect associated with the value of those deposits that we're bringing on, and we'll continue to look at opportunities to optimize the deposit portfolio. Ken Usdin : Okay. And then just one follow-up on the deal impact. Can you just remind us what type of like amortization period you're using for both the purchase accounting accretion and the CDI in terms of like, is this the run rate that we keep around for a few years, or does that change as you look past 2023? Thanks. Terry Dolan : Well, I think that, again, in 2023, we expect the purchase accounting accretion to be $350 million to $400 million and the CDI to be about $500 million. As I mentioned earlier, I think on the CDI, it steps down over time. But if you use a 10-year assumption and sum of year\u2019s digits, I think that will get you from a modeling perspective pretty close to how I think it will end up amortizing off. The purchase accounting is really going to be tied to the asset lives because about half of it is mortgage and half of it is corporate and commercial, et cetera, and shorter-lived assets. I think you can think about that four to five-year sort of time frame, and it probably accretes down into a similar fashion, a little more front-end weighted. Ken Usdin : Okay. Got it. Thank you, Terry. Terry Dolan : Yeah. Operator : And next, we can go to Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Terry Dolan : Hi Chris. Chris Kotowski : Good morning. Hi. Following up a bit on Mike and Ken's questions. If I look at your very helpful slide 18 on the guidance and I take the midpoint of $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion revenue range and I day weight that to the full year, I kind of get the lower range end of the full year guidance. 29.2 is actually what I get. So that implies like a couple percent growth in the back half of the year, which again, I guess, is better than what a lot of banks are saying. And I'm wondering, is that just underlying loan growth or fee income growth, or is it the tag-ins of the benefits of rising rates, or what do you see driving that? Terry Dolan : Well, again, I think you do see kind of the full year effect associated with rising interest rates kind of come into play. Fee revenue, on a legacy basis, as an example, we should see a little bit more of a tailwind next year as opposed to what we experienced this year. So I think that those are kind of coming into play. And then I think that just timing of being able to get cost synergies on the expense side. Andy Cecere : Yeah. And I'd add, it's probably just mathematically, as you were talking about it, you're right. And it's a little bit of a growth in the earning asset that you see there going up from 605 to 610 to 610 to 620. That's number one. And then maybe going towards the high end of that range and net interest margin versus the mid or low end in the early quarters. Chris Kotowski : Yeah. Well, it's interesting because if I do the same analysis on the non-interest expense side, you're at the high end of that. So it implies kind of nice growth in pre-provision earnings through the course of the year. So \u2013 but anyway, that's it for me. Andy Cecere : All right. Terry Dolan : Thanks, Chris. Operator : And our last question in queue will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Andy Cecere : Hey, Mike. Q \u2013 Mike Mayo : AOCI, was it \u2013 I'm just going to remember here, $12 billion, now it's $8 billion? And where is it as of today? Terry Dolan : AOCI overall is at $10 billion at the end of the year and expect it to come down from there. Andy Cecere : At a lower level today, Mike. Mike Mayo : And then, Andy, just can you pull the lens back a little bit? It's been a rough 3, 5 and 10 years when you look at operating leverage in stock, not last year on the operating leverage. But that comment you made in December and you addressed briefly, but you've been in this investment cycle multi-years. And now you said that, you're coming out of it or the drag is less or maybe the spending is less and the payoffs are more. Can you just give us more color on both the spending side and the payback side and where you've invested the most and where you expect that payback? Because it sounds like you're crossing a line based on your comments from December and that you reiterated today? Thanks. Andy Cecere : Yes. Thanks, Mike. I think that's a fair representation. So we \u2013 our spend levels on pure CapEx were \u2013 grew from about $800 million to $900 million to $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion. And that growth has been in the run rate for the last couple of years. So you would not expect to see additional continued expense increase related to CapEx. Importantly, we also migrated that spend from about 60% defensive to 60% offensive. So the spend is on activities like digital capabilities, reaching customers, products and services and so forth. So all of that is what's coming through to right now, so a level set on the expense side plus a return on the investments from a revenue side. That, coupled with overlaying all that on the Union Bank customer base, is why we're projecting the numbers that we're giving you. Mike Mayo : Okay. Thank you. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Mike. Operator : We do have time for one more question. And we'll go to John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Andy Cecere : Good morning, John. John McDonald : Good morning, guys. Hey. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. So Terry, where does the balance sheet repositioning and the merger leave you in terms of interest rate positioning? How would you describe it here, fairly neutral, a little bit asset-sensitive, where you're ending up now? Terry Dolan : Yeah. I would say that, legacy US Bank is fairly neutral. When we add Union Bank on, it probably adds about 50 basis points of asset sensitivity in a 50 up sort of shock environment. John McDonald : Okay. And then on the fee income, you said some more tailwinds this year, some helpers on legacy U.S. Bancorp. What are those on the fee income front? What are the helpers this year that you can grow fee income? Maybe just puts and takes on fees real quick. Terry Dolan : Yes. Well, if you just kind of look at the different components, I think the payments revenue continues to be reasonably strong. I think that the expectation is the market comes back a little bit in terms of investment income. But deposit service charges, we saw a drag in 2022 because of some pricing changes we implemented in May. That starts to dissipate. So, I think it will be kind of a combination of things. But probably one of the biggest ones is just mortgage banking revenue. That has been a pretty significant drag, especially on a year-over-year basis. And in the fourth quarter, we actually started see that inflection point with linked-quarter revenue starting to come up, and we would expect that to be a little bit stronger as we go into 2023. John McDonald : Okay, got it. And then the last clarification. I think on reserves, you said the 1.9% ratio looks pretty good for this year. And even if unemployment went to 6%, 6.5%, you'd be okay? Terry Dolan : Yes. Again, we go through a lot of different scenarios and we take that downside into consideration and as part of kind of that weighted average process. We think 6%, 6.5% unemployment is already incorporated into our reserving process. So, -- but again, it all is going to depend upon what ends up happening, how severe the economic recession is, if there is one at all. So, I think there's just a lot of moving parts. John McDonald : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn it back to George Andersen. Please continue. George Andersen : Thank you for listening to our call. Please contact the Investor Relations department if you have any follow-up questions. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference. Thanks for your participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to the U.S. Bancorp First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Following a review of the results, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 11 o'clock A.M. Central Time. I will now turn the conference call over to George Anderson, Senior Vice President and Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. George Anderson : Thank you, Brad. Good morning everyone. With me today are Andy Cecere, our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Dolan, our Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer. During the prepared remarks, Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation. A copy of the presentation a s well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page two of today's presentation, in our press release, our Form 10-K and its subsequent reports on file with the SEC. Following their prepared remarks, Andy and Terry will take any questions that you have. I will now turn the call over to Andy. Andy Cecere : Thanks George. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I'll begin on slide three. In the first quarter, we reported earnings per share of $1.04, which includes $0.12 per share of charges related to the MUFG Union Bank acquisition. Excluding those notable items, earnings per share was $1.16. We achieved record net revenue of $7.2 billion for the quarter. Following our successful close of Union Bank acquisition in December of 2022, first quarter results reflected a full year's benefit of the acquired franchise, continued growth in earning assets, net interest margin expansion, and higher non-interest income led by stronger commercial product and mortgage banking fee revenues. Slide four details our reported and adjusted income statement results as well as the end of period and average balances and other performance metrics. On the right, you'll see the credit quality remains strong, but is starting to normalize as expected. Our charge-off ratio of 30 basis points as adjusted is well below pre-COVID levels and reflective of our disciplined risk management culture. The CET1 ratio, our binding regulatory constraint was 8.5% at the end of the quarter and is consistent with our target capital ratio. We expect to exceed 9.0% later this year as we accrete capital back quickly over the next few quarters and continue to focus on risk-weighted asset optimization initiatives. Slide five provides key performance metrics. Excluding notable items, our return on average assets was 1.15% and our return on average common equity was 15.7%. Our return on tangible common equity was 24.3% on an adjusted basis. Slide six provides both a high-level time line and general update on our planned conversion of Union Bank. Integration efforts have been progressing well and we remain on track for our successful main systems conversion over the upcoming Memorial Day weekend. We anticipate a full transition of all accounts by the second half of the year. Turning to slide seven. The industry disruption early in March has reinforced the importance of maintaining a well-diversified business with an appropriate risk profile. We maintain a resilient and diversified deposit base. Over half of our deposits are insured and 80% of the uninsured deposits are retail or operational in nature. Our diversified funding sources, ample liquidity levels and strong credit quality supported by disciplined underwriting standards are all hallmarks of our approach to risk management. I'll now turn the call over to Terry, who can provide more detail on the balance sheet strength and the first quarter earnings results. Terry Dolan : Thanks Andy. Turning to slide eight, a key strength of the bank is our well- -diversified deposit base, which remains a stable source of low-cost funding. As a reminder, following the completion of our acquisition of Union Bank last quarter, our end-of-period deposits totaled $525 billion, including approximately $80 billion of deposits from Union Bank. As we discussed last quarter, $9 billion of Union Bank acquired deposits were transitory in nature, with $4 billion returned to MUFG in the fourth quarter and additional $4.7 billion that moved back to MUFG in the first quarter of this year. In addition, $1.1 billion of acquired deposits were included in the branch sale or related to PurePoint, a broker deposit gathering mechanism that we discontinued. Importantly, prior to the events of March 8, we saw expected deposit outflow largely consistent with seasonal patterns, reflective of our business mix, including our large trust business. From March 8 through the end of the quarter, deposit balances were relatively stable, down only 0.6% as inflows from new customers were slightly offset by the impact of clients diversifying their deposits and seeking yield and money market funds consistent with broader industry trends. During this period, we saw an increase in money market funds of approximately $10 billion within our wealth management and investment services businesses. We expect the competition for deposits to remain high for the industry in 2023. Our cumulative deposit beta through the first quarter was approximately 34% and we expect that to increase to about 40% by the end of this rate cycle, generally in line with our previous expectations. Slide nine provides additional detail on the composition of our highly diversified deposit base. As the slide shows, our deposit balances are composed of a broad mix of consumer, corporate and commercial customers that we support with an expansive branch distribution network and mobile capabilities across our national footprint. Our deposit base reflects the wide range of customers and industries that our companies serve. At March 31, our percent of insured deposits to total deposits was 51%. Approximately 80% of our uninsured deposits are composed of operational wholesale trust and retail deposits that are stickier, either because they are contractually bound or tied to treasury management services and trust activities provided to corporate and institutional clients. Combined with our consumer-based deposits, the stability of our funding source is sound. Moving to slide 10. U.S. Bank's total available liquidity as of March 31 was $315 billion, representing 126% of our uninsured deposits. As of March -- as of December 31, our liquidity coverage ratio was 122%. As mentioned, our strong debt ratings reflect our diversified business profile, well-collateralized credit exposure, healthy capital and liquidity profiles and disciplined asset liability management framework. These attributes work in concert with our strong balance sheet optimization and management practices to ensure strength and stability of our balance sheet. Slide 11 provides details on the composition of our investment securities portfolio. Over the last five quarters and well ahead of the most recent banking disruption, we reduced the size of our investment securities portfolio from 30% to 25% of total assets while increasing cash levels. In preparation for and as part of the completion of our acquisition of Union Bank, we repositioned our balance sheet by selling fixed rate loans and investment securities, paid off borrowings and increased cash balances in response to economic uncertainty, industry dynamics, rising interest rates and increased market volatility. At March 31, approximately 90% of the securities in our investment portfolio are backed and are sponsored by the US federal government with 55% of securities designated as held to maturity and 45% designated as available for sale. Further, available for sale unrealized losses as a percentage of our investment securities portfolio improved in the first quarter and total AOCI improved by 11% on a linked-quarter basis. Turning to slide 12. As a reminder, following the completion of our acquisition of Union Bank, our CET1 capital ratio declined from 9.7% at the end of the third quarter of 2022 to 8.4% as of December 31st, which reflected the impact of balance sheet optimization and purchase accounting adjustments that will accrete back into capital over the next few years. Strategically, we continue to be encouraged about the financial merits of this deal and the synergistic benefits we expect to realize as a combined institution. As Andy mentioned earlier, our CET1 capital ratio at March 31st was 8.5%, a 10 basis point increase from year-end reflected 20 basis points of capital accretion, offset by the transitional impact of CECL of 10 basis points. As of March 31st, we expect to accrete approximately 20 to 25 basis points of capital per quarter as we complete the Union Bank integration and realize cost synergies. Importantly, this does not include the impacts of planned RWA optimization initiatives mentioned earlier. Turning to slide 13. Total end-of-period loans were $388 billion, which was flat on a linked-quarter basis and up 21.6% year-over-year. Commercial real estate loans represent approximately 14% of our total loan portfolio with CRE office exposure representing approximately 2% of total loans and only 1% of total commitments. Leverage lending balances are not a significant component of the loan portfolio. Slide 14 shows credit quality trends, which continue to be strong, but as expected, are started -- are starting to normalize across the portfolio. The ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was 0.3% at March 31st compared with 0.26% at December 31st and 0.25% a year ago. Our first quarter net charge-offs of 0.30% as adjusted, increased seven basis points versus the fourth quarter level of 0.23% as adjusted and was higher when compared to the first quarter of 2022, which was a level of 0.21%. Our allowance for credit losses as of March 31st totaled $7.5 billion or 1.94% of period-end loans. As the chart on the upper right side of this slide demonstrates, our credit performance through the cycle serves as a key differentiator for the bank. Slide 15 provides a detailed earnings summary for the quarter. In the first quarter, we earned $1.16 per diluted share, excluding $0.12 of notable items related to the recent acquisition of Union Bank. Slide 16 highlights revenue trends for the quarter. Net revenue totaled $7.2 billion in the first quarter, which included a full quarter of revenue contribution from Union Bank of $832 million, primarily representing net interest income. Net interest income grew 7.9% on a linked quarter basis and 45.9% year-over-year, driven by earning asset growth and continued net interest margin expansion, which benefited from rising interest rates. Non-interest income as adjusted increased 2.7% compared to the fourth quarter, driven by higher commercial product revenue, mortgage banking revenue and trust and investment management fees, partially offset by losses of $32 million from securities sales. Turning to Slide 17. Adjusted non-interest expense for the company totaled $4.3 billion in the first quarter, including $546 million from Union Bank. Non-interest expense as adjusted increased 9.1% on a linked-quarter basis largely driven by the impact of two additional months of Union Bank's operating expenses, core deposit intangible amortization and higher compensation and other non-interest expenses. I will now provide second quarter and updated full year 2023 forward-looking guidance on Slide 18. Starting with the second quarter of 2013 guidance, we expect average earning assets of between $600 billion and $605 billion in the second quarter and a net interest margin of approximately 3%. Total revenue, as adjusted, is estimated to be in the range of $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion, including approximately $85 million of purchase accounting accretion. Total non-interest expense as adjusted is expected to be in the range of $4.3 billion to $4.4 billion, inclusive of approximately $120 million of core deposit intangible amortization related to Union Bank. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 23% on a taxable equivalent basis. To date, we have incurred $573 million in merger and integration costs and anticipated charges of between -- and anticipate charges of between $250 million and $300 million for the second quarter. We continue to estimate total merger and integration costs of approximately $1.4 billion, consistent with earlier guidance. I will now provide updated guidance for the full year. For 2023, average earning assets are now expected to be in the range of $600 billion to $610 billion. We expect the net interest margin to be between 3.0% to 3.05% for the full year. Total revenue as adjusted is now expected to be in the range of $28.5 million to $30.5 billion, inclusive of approximately $350 million of full year purchase accounting accretion. Total non-interest expense as adjusted for the year is expected to be in the range of $17.0 billion to $17.5 billion, inclusive of approximately $500 million of core deposit intangible amortization related to Union Bank. Our estimated full year income tax rate on a taxable equivalent basis is now expected to be approximately 23.0%. We continue to expect to have $900 million to $1 billion of merger and integration charges in 2023. I will now hand it back to Andy for closing remarks. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Terry. Events of the past few weeks have certainly raised questions about the overall health of the banking industry and the economic outlook. Business of banking involves taking balanced risks and these risks must be carefully managed, appropriately regulated and prudently mitigated. At U.S. Bank, we are focused on the strength and stability of our balance sheet. Our investment in risk management practice is guided by our core principle that includes always doing the right thing for the many stakeholders, communities, and constituents we serve. A key strength of our institution is our high-quality and diversified business mix and deposit base. The combination of a mix of consumer, corporate and commercial customers with significant operational deposits, broad geographic reach, and a full breadth and depth of product and service offerings serves as a key differentiator for the bank. Our high debt ratings, resilient liquidity profile, available funding sources and strong earnings capacity enable us to deliver industry-leading regulatory test results and contribute to our resiliency during times of uncertainty. As we continue to work to ensure a successful conversion of Union Bank next month, we are already seeing the benefits of increased scale and market share as we bring our enhanced digital capabilities and broad and diverse product set to the Union Bank customer base. Our reputation as a prudent risk manager has been earned through our performance over many cycles and we have never been more focused on the strength and stability of our balance sheet. Let me close by thanking our employees for all that they do on a daily basis for our customers, communities, and shareholders. We have shown incredible strength and stability during these challenging times and I am more confident than ever in our ability to continue to deliver exceptional client service, superior product offerings in a rapidly changing environment. We'll now open the call for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We'll go to Scott Siefers, Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Scott Siefers : Good morning everybody. Andy Cecere : Hi Scott. Scott Siefers : Hey. Lots of noise in the deposit flows in the first quarter. I guess, moving forward, what would your expectations be for total deposit flows or balances and then the mix of non-interest-bearing to total as we sort of get through this cycle? Terry Dolan : Yes. Our expectation is that if you end up just looking at the industry, there's going to be pressure on deposits and high competition. We think will fare quite well with respect to that. To the extent that we see changes in deposits, it will be kind of based upon that competition. So, -- but I would say relatively stable. And then coming to your second question, the mix of NIBs as an example in roughly the fourth quarter was about 25%, 26% in that ballpark. It's 25%. We think it's kind of hitting that kind of stable level, keeping in mind that we have a lot of operational deposits tied to our -- both our Corporate and our Corporate Trust businesses, and that kind of helps to sustain it. So, it's a combination of things, Scott. Scott Siefers : Okay, perfect. Thank you. And then I was hoping we could talk for a second about just the categorization and when you guys would expect to be a Category 2 bank, I think there's a lot of chatter going around, especially in light of that report from a couple of days ago. So, maybe just in sort of clear terms, when would you expect to be a Category 2 bank? Will that be due to your asset size or thanks to the Fed's flexibility to designate you as one? And then how would you guys get there by that time? Terry Dolan : Yes. Our trajectory with respect to Category 2 is no earlier than the end of 2024. And that will be -- I think that will be more driven by whether the Fed makes that decision or not rather than asset size. Again, as we kind of manage the company, we're going to be -- continue to be very focused on profitable loan growth and things like that. So we get there when we get there. But that -- in our expectation right now is no sooner than the end of 2024. Scott Siefers : Okay. Perfect. And you guys feel like you're prepared to get there by that time basically? Terry Dolan : Yes. It will be a combination of a couple of things we talked about, the -- just the capital generation from earnings and of course, that is helped by the Union Bank transaction. And then, we're very focused on capital management. We have to be just -- because of the Category II. And we'll be very focused on risk-weighted asset optimization and making sure that we're focused on profitable growth. Scott Siefers : Perfect. Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Next, we'll go to Erika Najarian with UBS. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Hi. Good morning. Terry Dolan : Good morning, Erika. Erika Najarian : I guess the question for USB is, I don't think your investors doubt the through-the-cycle credit outperformance or even the PPNR strength. It's well noted that the adjustment to your revenue outlook was very minimal relative to peers. I think the big question that investors have is, you're starting from 8.5% CET1. You note earnings power and capital -- organic capital generation of 20 to 25 basis points. But as we anticipate Cat II and you're telling us that the Fed could decide and not your asset size necessarily could decide when that line is, what is the new endpoint of CET1 in your view? Because as we think about going into that new category, I don't think investors think that 8.5% to 9% is the right bogey? And then the sort of the sub question to that, Andy, is, is your priority getting to a higher capital level faster? And, if so, how are you thinking about dividend growth this year? Andy Cecere : So, Erika, good question. And so, I'm just going to go from the beginning. I think that would be helpful. So, as you know, we were well above 9% and came down to 8.4% as a result of the Union Bank transaction. The Union Bank transaction is a terrific transaction. We're exceeding our revenue expectations. We are coming under on our expense expectations. The accretion is greater than we expected. So the value of the franchise is positive for sure. As we think about the Category II, I have three or four factors, I think about. Number one is the earnings accretion that we talked about, which is strong and growing, and will become even more accretive as we get through the cost takeout component of the Union Bank integration. Number two is, we have a number of initiatives across the board for risk-weighted asset optimization. Those are things like credit transfers, risk transfers, a number of things to optimize the balance sheet that I think we ought to be focused on and are very focused on to your question. And I think, with those two things, as I mentioned, we expect to exceed 9% by the end of this year. That, coupled with our AOC burn down and additional accretion as we go into 2024, makes me comfortable that we are prepared with whatever event occurs as it relates to Category II in the timing, as Terry mentioned, no later -- no earlier than the end of 2024. Terry Dolan : Yes. A couple of things that I would maybe add because that's right on. Coming back to AOCI, that burn will be kind of a function of a lot of different things. We have been very proactive in terms of repositioning the AFS portfolio, looking at asset sales and securitization -- or asset sales, security sales, et cetera. Again, to give you some sense, the duration of that investment portfolio -- of the AFS portfolio has gone from a little over 4.5% in the fourth quarter to about 3.8% in -- at the end of the first quarter. So we're going to continue to shorten the duration and that's going to help us with respect to managing AOCI. And then in addition to that, we have been essentially reducing the volatility of AOCI to up interest rate environments through hedging activities. So it's a combination of a variety of things that we're going to go through. Erika Najarian : And is 9.5%, 10% an appropriate new bogey as we think about the shift change for next year on Cat II? Andy Cecere : So Erika, as you know, the\u2026 Erika Najarian : Go ahead. Andy Cecere : Yeah, the regulators are going through an analysis and a process right now to think about how capital levels ought to be in the industry across the board with Basel IV end game and whatever changes the categorization that occurs. So we are waiting for that as you are to understand what the new environment will look like. But the plan that we have in place is assuming what you -- what Terry just discussed. Erika Najarian : And just if I could sneak in one last one in. One of your peers closest to you in size at the TLAC was pretty much done investing. I noticed that you mentioned your superior debt rating several times. Clearly, the debt markets are still a little bit dislocated. But how should we think about the wholesale funding stack from here. I noticed on a period-end basis, short-term borrowings went up by $25 billion. Terry, as you potentially anticipate TLAC, how should we think about your senior debt issuance plans or really hold that level of borrowings until there's a little bit more less dislocation in the senior debt market? Terry Dolan : Yeah. Again, TLAC is one of those things that we're going to learn more as we go over the course of the next 12 months. I think the real question is not whether or not TLAC will exist because I do believe and we're expecting that it will be something that gets put into place. But how does that get calibrated for the regional banks, reflecting the risk profile that we have relative to the G subs? And there's a wide range of estimates that are out there. I -- when we end up looking at that, maybe one reasonable estimate would be based upon the foreign bank operators and levels of TLAC. If that is the case for us, I think it would be very manageable. It would be within a range that we would be able to manage, too. And then that just gives us flexibility with respect to how we utilize that within the bank. Erika Najarian : Thank you. Andy Cecere : Thanks Erika. Operator : And next, we can go to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Andy Cecere : Good morning Mike. Mike Mayo : Hi. Well, your PE, I believe consensus is close to seven and the market is around 20. So your relative PE is one of the lowest in history. So I would pause it, that the market is concerned about something other than earnings. So going back, I guess the simple question for you, Andy, is will U.S. Bancorp need to issue capital? And how confident are you about that? And on the other side, are buybacks potentially an option once you get to 9% CET1? And the reason I bring that up is you've seen the front page articles and papers, if you're forced to recognize the unrealized securities losses and you do a burn down and then people come up with all sorts of numbers. And would you be forced to realize that? You heard Congress talk about these issues. Could you be forced to incorporate that as part of the current stress test? Could the Fed force your hand sooner? Any color you can give. What's your confidence that you might need to issue capital over the next year or so? Andy Cecere : Thanks, Mike. So as I said, I'm -- that is not part of our thinking as we sit today. I'm confident that our earnings accretion, our RWA optimization, our AOC burn down will all get us to a point that we will be at the appropriate capital levels, and I can assure you that it's a high focus area for myself and the entire management team, including Terry. So that is something we're very focused on. Now as it relates to buybacks, I will tell you, as we all know, there's a lot of capital changes that are likely to occur from a regulatory standpoint. So we're not going to do anything until we have more clarity around that, which we hope to have in the second half of the year. But the focus on getting to the appropriate capital levels as quickly as possible, accreting capital and building that capital base is priority one. Terry Dolan : Yes. And Mike, the thing that I would add to that, we're going to learn with respect to exactly how -- moving to category two and the inclusion in unrealized losses gets incorporated into the CCAR process. But just as a reminder, we have a pretty significant amount of buffer that already exists just based upon our credit performance and our PPNR performance because of the earnings capacity. We continue to reduce the volatility of AOCI to rising interest rates. We're doing that through pay-fixed hedges and just shortening the duration and things that I talked about earlier. I think there's very likely that they will incorporate a higher rate environment into the CCAR process. I will tell you that we've done lots of scenarios that look at a stagflation sort of environment and we actually perform better in that environment because the revenue streams tend to hold up given our mix of business, et cetera. So we're taking a lot of that into consideration. And like Andy said, we feel pretty confident that we don't have to go through a capital raise. Mike Mayo : As part of this year's stress test, would they include the unrealized securities losses since that would incorporate the nine-quarter time horizon or no? Terry Dolan : No. That is not required in the CCAR analysis as a condition of the way the deal was structured. Mike Mayo : And then last short one, you're non-interest-bearing deposits. I know you brought that up before. It certainly went down more than average this quarter, but you're not guiding your margin down too much. You said 3% to 3.05% versus, I guess, 3.1% this quarter. Why wouldn't you be guiding that down even further given the decline in non-interest-bearing deposits quarter-over-quarter? Terry Dolan : Yes. It's a couple of different things. One is, again, if you end up just looking at the mix of total deposits, we again think that total deposits will be relatively stable and that the mix of NIB will be relatively stable around that 25% up or down. Part of the decline in this particular quarter ties back to some of the seasonal flows, which are part of our trust business, but also the deposits that we knew were going to go out the door to MUFG because of closing down the PurePoint, et cetera. All of those things kind of tie in to the reason why we saw the decline this quarter. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : Next, we go to John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Andy Cecere : Hey, John. John McDonald : Yes, hi. Good morning, guys. Wanted to ask on the idea of getting above 9% by the end of the year on CET1. Does that rely on the RWA mitigation opportunities, or is that just kind of the 20 to 25 basis points that Terry mentioned before the RWA benefit? Is that something that will help you next year? Can you talk a little bit about that? Terry Dolan : Yes, we think that the capital generation, the accretion that we'll see the is core earnings capability. So it does not rely on those RWAs. So the RWA optimization that we will go through will be above and beyond that. That's a part of that overall capital strategy that Andy talked about earlier. John McDonald : The benefits of that should happen and help you towards the end of this year, maybe into next year as you work towards end of 2024 capital target? Terry Dolan : Yes, it will help us both this year as well as into next year. Absolutely. As you know, John, we've been kind of preparing for Cat 2 for well over a year. We put a lot of things in place in the third and fourth quarter. We took some actions in the fourth quarter and we'll utilize a lot of those tools, if you will, as part of the RWA optimization process that we're going to go through. John McDonald : Yes. And just to clarify, Terry, this hasn't happened prior to the end of 2024, even with the Fed, right? The Fed would tell you on January 2024 that it would take effect by the end of 2024, right? So, it's not like they're going to tell you any color there, correct? Terry Dolan : That is correct. John McDonald : Okay. And then any idea of the pace of AOCI burn down? Obviously, the AOCI came down 11% this quarter with the help of rates. But in a world where rates are not coming down, what's the natural kind of burn-off pace that you might expect for that over a year or two? Any help on that? And just kind of reminding us of the duration again. Terry Dolan : Yes. The -- well, again, the duration of the AFS portfolio right now is about 3.8 years. So, just if you kind of take that into consideration, the burden down will still be fairly reasonable, even without interest rates. And again, we've put some of rising interest rates with respect to AOCI. John McDonald : Okay. Thanks. Terry Dolan : Thanks John. Operator : Next we go to John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead. John Pancari : Good morning. Andy Cecere : Good morning John. Terry Dolan : Good morning John. John Pancari : On the -- back to the RWA optimization, can you maybe give us a little more color on what you're looking at there? I know you mentioned credit transfers and risk transfers. But maybe if you can kind of flesh that out a little bit and maybe just an idea of the magnitude of the benefit that you see potentially materializing as a result of the RWA actions? And then lastly, is other business or portfolio sales or divestitures considered within that? Thanks. Terry Dolan : The second part of the question was? Andy Cecere : Their business sales. Terry Dolan : Business sales. Yes, at least at this particular point in time, obviously, we'll look at a lot of different things in terms of businesses that we may look at to sell. I mean, that portfolio optimization is something we're always doing and we've done that a number of different times over the last several years. So, that obviously will be something we'll look at. But we have a sizable mortgage servicing rights portfolio. We'll take a look at selling portions of that where that makes sense, we'll look at asset securitization like we did in the fourth quarter. There are a whole variety of risk transfer sort of structures that both we put -- we have put into place when we have on the shelf and we're ready to kind of start moving forward on when we can. So, I think it's a whole variety of different things that we will take a look at as well as balancing the mix toward growth in, what I would say, less capital-intensive businesses as opposed to capital-intensive businesses. So it will be a whole combination of things as we move forward, John. John Pancari : And do you have a way to help us estimate the magnitude in terms of how you're thinking about that targeted contribution from the RWA optimization strategies? Andy Cecere : So the strategies that we have in place are reflected in the guidance that we provided. So that would not change that, and we'll continue to update that guidance, given the economic conditions and rates and the scenarios that we see. But as Terry mentioned, this is a priority for us, and we have a number of initiatives underway, which is the appropriate thing to do, because I think capital for all banks is going to be more precious as we think about the forward regulatory environment. John Pancari : Got it. And then, just one more for me. And I know you mentioned in terms of other regulatory potentially coming down the pipe. You're already in the advanced phase of proposed rulemaking on the TLAC. And can you just talk about the other potential regulatory changes you see coming down the down the pipe? I know you had mentioned the AOCI efforts, but can you talk about potentially around FDIC or stress capital buffer, liquidity rules, anything on that front worth commenting on? Terry Dolan : Yes. I mean, it could be a number of different things. I mean we talked about TLAC, I mean, just levels of capital. You hear them talking about domestically significantly important banks. So increase in the level of the stress capital buffer is another piece of it. I think another one will be around LCR. And then, in the CCAR process, I think that they'll incorporate, I would say, multiple to kind of go back to what they used to do. They'll have kind of multiple scenarios, but one will be kind of, what I would say, a traditional sort of stress test where unemployment goes up and rates come down. Another one will be more, I think, some form of stagflation, where rates stay relatively high and you experience the credit loss stress. And again, we've run a variety of different scenarios, and I think we feel like we would be able to withstand either one of those, just based upon our risk profile. John Pancari : Got it. Okay. Thanks, Terry. Operator : Next we can go to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please, go ahead. Terry Dolan : Hey, Gerard. Good morning. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Terry. Good morning, Andy. I have a narrower question. I think it was on slide eight. You guys talked about the impacts of deposits following March 8. The inflows that you referenced, did that come primarily in the Union Bank franchise? Because, obviously, it was located in California. I know you guys have been in California as well. And then second, was it more commercial versus consumer or more interest-bearing versus non-interest-bearing? Terry Dolan : Yes. Maybe, in terms of the mix. So right after March 8, we actually saw a lot of account customer opening more so on the commercial corporate side, I would say, probably 70% on that side as opposed to on the consumer side of the equation, we saw inflows -- but again, that ended up getting offset by kind of seasonal flows within corporate trust as the rest of the month kind of progressed. The other thing that I would say is that, when I look at deposit net new customer accounts in -- specifically in California and the consumer side, we actually saw a nice increase or pop in March relative to previous months. So I think that we're actually probably seeing some benefits associated with that. And I think that addresses the questions that you had. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. And then over the years, you guys have always done quite well and underwriting your loan portfolio, you show up well in the CCAR tests over the years on credit. And so you don't have a very big exposure to commercial real estate. And I always find it interesting to talk to banks that don't have big exposures to a potential credit area that could be problem. What are you guys seeing in that commercial real estate area, particularly in the office portfolio? Any color would be helpful. Andy Cecere : Sure, Gerard. So first of all, the rest of the portfolio is very stable. If you look at our charge-off rates and non-accruals and so forth in the numbers around credit metrics, the rest of the portfolio is stable and starting to normalize, but normalizing as we expected. I do think the area of focus for all of us is office within real estate. And I do think there's some activity occurring there with tenants, behavior changes, sponsor behavior changes. That is going to cause some pressure in the industry because of maybe an acceleration of what we thought was going to be a little longer process occurring more rapidly. So you can imagine that we're very focused on it as well. We have not put on a lot of CRE office over the last many years. We've been very, very conservative around that. So as you say, we don't have a large exposure, but I do think it's an area of a lot of emphasis and focus because I do think there are going to be pressures occurring. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Operator : Next we can go to Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Terry Dolan : Good morning, Ebrahim. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning. I had a follow-up question. I think you briefly mentioned about I think AOCI hedges against if rates spiked. I was wondering, Terry, if you can elaborate on that. We've seen the five-year come back again in the last few weeks. Just what's the downside risk to capital or just an increase in AOCI if rates spiked another 50 basis points? And just talk to us in terms of the extent to which you expect to hedge against that? Terry Dolan : Yeah. So again, we've been taking a number of different actions in order to dampen the effect. As I said, selling securities were appropriate, shortening the duration, which we did very nicely, I guess, in the first quarter. And then putting in place pay fixed swaps against the long end of the curve. So dampening the effect of a move -- I meant up of rates in both -- for example, in the five and 10-year sort of space. We -- if rates moved up 50 basis points, obviously, AOCI would be impacted to some extent, but we've dampened that quite a bit over the course of the last couple of quarters. Ebrahim Poonawala : Understood. And just going back to deposit betas. I think you talked about 40% relative to 34% this quarter. I mean I'm sure you all do a ton of analysis on where terminal betas might end up. But what's the downside risk? I mean, we've obviously had a shock to the system, Fed funds being 5% plus. What's the risk? How do you handicap the risk of that 40% beta actually turning out to be something much higher, maybe closer to 50%. Terry Dolan : Yeah. We've done a lot of different analysis. And I mean, you are right. The competition for deposits is getting stronger. We've taken that into consideration. We're seeing over 5% in some markets. Generally, it is smaller banks where that is occurring, community markets, those sorts of things. And that's because for those entities, that's their primary source of funding. And so that's going to occur. But all of that has been kind of taken into consideration in terms of looking at that 40% deposit beta. If you end up looking at our business, again, in terms of who we end up competing against, et cetera. But while we end up looking at and tracking is, especially on the institutional corporate side of the equation is money market rates and those sorts of things. Right now, that's kind of in the high fours. And our deposit pricing is very competitive with that, which is why it gives us confidence with respect to both flows and the deposit betas that we've articulated. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. I mean you don't see a major shift in consumer and retail deposit pricing today versus maybe at the start of the year? Terry Dolan : Yes. It's going to depend. I mean, obviously, it depends upon the rate environment. I mean, if the Fed, for example, goes up another 50 or 100 basis points from here, that would put more pressure on deposit betas. But if you end up looking at the market implied or even up a bit, I still feel pretty comfortable with where we're at. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And next, we can go to Matt O'Connor with [indiscernible] Bank. Please go ahead. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Matt. Matt O'Connor: It's Deutsche Bank. You've got very strong reserves to loans on a stated basis. I guess, first, can you remind us what the impact is if you adjust it for the Union Bank loans that were marked at fair value when you took them on? -- if you have that handy? Terry Dolan : Yes. I missed the first part of the question. Andy, do you? Andy Cecere : I think, Mike, you're trying to understand -- or Matt, you're trying to understand the -- if Union Bank has an impact on our reserve to loans ratio and what it is. I don't think it has a major impact. Terry Dolan : Not a significant one. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then just broadly speaking like as you think about the rest of the year, I mean, you're obviously taking your best guess on reserves at the current period at your thoughts on. Terry Dolan : Hey, Matt. Sorry. It's hard to hear you. Matt O'Connor: Sorry, can you hear me better now? Terry Dolan : That's better. Yes. Thank you, Matt. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Sorry about that. I was just asking about the outlook for the loan loss reserves from here in your base case. Terry Dolan : Yes. So our expectation is that, again, Andy has talked about the fact that we're preparing for any economic sort of outcome that might exist. I think if you end up looking at the consensus in the marketplace, some form of recession, probably a softer or moderate sort of recession late this year, early next year. And if you look at the market implies, I would kind of tie into that. When we go through our reserving process, we look at multiple scenarios. We wait to the conservative side. We look at five different scenarios. We make assumptions with respect to that. Only 35% of it's weighted towards what I would call the base case and the rest of it is downside. So we feel pretty good about where reserve levels are. Obviously, if we saw economic shock above and beyond kind of what is being expected that might be a little bit different. But we feel pretty good about how we're thinking about it. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Great. And then maybe if I could just squeeze in on spending trends throughout 1Q, you guys, through your payments business, obviously see a lot. Just any observations on kind of trends throughout the quarter? And maybe any comments so far in April? Thank you. Terry Dolan : Yes. In our Payments business, we continue to see pretty strong sales, 10%-plus, for example, in our payments merchant processing business, a very strong mid to high single-digits with respect to our corporate payments business. The -- if you end up comparing any of these things to pre-pandemic is through the roof. So, we continue to see a good spend in the business. I would say that after the market disruption, there was a bit more softness in retail sales which we're going to continue to watch. It's really too early to tell whether or not that's a trend or whether that was really some of the concerns around the market disruption, but we'll continue to watch that. Andy, what would you add? Andy Cecere : Yes. And that is still growing to math, but it's just growing at a lower rate, particularly in retail. Airline spend continues to be very, very high, which is a little bit of the reason that we have a differential between sales growth and in revenue growth because the airline spread is a little thinner. So, travel continues to be strong. Retail came down a bit, but still growing. Matt O'Connor: Great. Thank you. Andy Cecere : Sure. Operator : Next we can go to Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Co. Please go ahead. Andy Cecere : Yes, good morning Chris. Chris Kotowski : Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. You've given us a lot of good detail on the AFS side. I just wonder if you could discuss a little bit how you anticipate managing the held-to-maturity portfolio. Do you also plan to let that kind of burn down and shorten? And I'm curious just given that that's a lot of mortgage backs and that they are principal payments each month. How quickly does that portfolio burn down, or do you see the need to maintain a lot of duration there just in case we get another decline in rates? Terry Dolan : Yes. Yes. I mean, obviously, we look at both sides of the equation. The burn down on the HTM side simply because of the nature of it is really more tied to how quickly you see payoffs and what the duration of that ends up looking at. I think as we look at the size of the investment portfolio, et cetera, will take into consideration what level of duration we want to have in that -- in the HTM portfolio, but that's going to be more a function of just pay downs and payoffs over time. Chris Kotowski : Yes. But I mean -- just I guess a question directionally in the next couple of quarters, you'd probably let the duration shorten and the size of the portfolio burn down left to your own devices. Terry Dolan : Yes. Yes. Absolutely. Yes. Chris Kotowski : Okay. All righty. That\u2019s it from me. Thank you. Terry Dolan : Thanks Chris. Operator : Next we have Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Hey guys. Good morning. First question, I just want to ask you on credit. On an adjusted basis, your charge-offs were 30 basis points this quarter. And per the comments you made earlier, about CRE and some of the data we see in the release about delinquencies and NPAs increasing. What's your outlook for charge-offs as we go forward versus the 30 basis points that we saw in the first? Terry Dolan : Yes, I mean our expectation is that 30 basis will continue to normalize throughout the year and into 2024, probably on a similar sort of pace. I think it's 23 basis points in the fourth quarter. So, I think that, that will continue to kind of move up as the year progresses, just part of normalization. Ken Usdin : Yeah. Understood on that. Okay. And then just coming back to the full year guide. Obviously, you made a modest adjustment which is well expected given the change in the rate outlook. We can back into that, I think it's mostly on the NII side, just given that that's where seemingly some of the changes were versus the prior outlook. But can you just kind of refresh us and just give us kind of just some underlying thoughts of NII growth versus fee growth and any changes you had on, if any, on the fee side versus your prior outlook? Thank you. Andy Cecere : To your point, most of the changes were in NII, and it's a function of the rate curve, the rate environment, the expectation about rate increases as well as the deposit pricing that Terry made reference to in the beta of approaching 40%. So most of the change was in NII. Ken Usdin : Okay. And then so just last follow-up. So then embedded in your fee outlook for the year is pretty decent growth, it would seem then. And are you expecting that to still be mostly driven by the payments business, or are there other areas that you're expecting to see some good growth in? Andy Cecere : We have a great diversity of revenue sources and they're all doing well. So payments is up approaching double digits, 9% of year-over-year basis, as Terry talked about, spend levels are good. We have had a bang of a quarter in our Commercial Products group across the categories, and that is doing just terrifically in this environment and just driving revenue growth as well. Trust is doing well. So \u2013 and mortgage. So that's the value of a diverse revenue stream. There are many different sources of revenue and fee income. Ken Usdin : Got it. Understood. Thanks, guys. Andy Cecere : Thank you. Operator : Next we go to Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Andy Cecere : Hi, Vivek. Vivek Juneja : Hi, Andy. Hi, Terry. A couple of just clarifications, I think you all mentioned that accretion from the deal, Andy, is going better than you had expected any. I know you've talked a lot, just trying to pull this all together, where are you seeing it better thus far? Andy Cecere : Yeah. So -- and we talked about this, Vivek in the fourth quarter that the expectation of that 8% going through 11% and the returns actually better. So if I look at it in the big picture, when we initially thought about the deal, Union Bank had a $2.9 billion or so revenue base and a $2.6 or so billion -- $2.3 billion expense base, so 600 PPNR and you look at the first quarter, and it's double that. So the revenues are stronger, principally because of the value of deposits in this rate environment. The expenses are a little less, and our expectations on our efficiencies are continuing to be on plan. So all that adds up to a higher accretion. Terry Dolan : Net higher accretion in the net purchase accounting is actually negative given the car deposit intangibles. So it's very strong. Vivek Juneja : Right. And that's before you even finish the integration that you -- I mean, that's not until second quarter anyway. Terry Dolan : Yeah. Andy Cecere : That's right. Terry Dolan : That's correct. Vivek Juneja : All right. Thank you. Operator : Next, we can go to Erika Najarian with UBS. Erika Najarian : Yeah. Sorry, to prolong the call. I just had one follow-up question. Andy, I asked the question in a compound way, so I apologize. But if you think about accreting to over 9% CET1 by year-end, how would you stack rank dividend growth as a priority? Andy Cecere : Dividend growth continues to be a priority, Erika. So our expectation is we would have continued growth in the dividend. The dividend growth numbers not hugely material to the capital accretion math. If you go through the numbers on that, that is a relatively small component of a negative downturn in capital. So that expectation that I talked about includes the expectation of a strong dividend. Erika Najarian : Thank you. Operator : And next over to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Andy Cecere : Hey, Mike. Mike Mayo : Hi. Hey, last quarter, you mentioned your reserves were for an environment with 6% unemployment. I was wondering if you had an update for that. And given CECL accounting, does that mean you're reserving done before the recession has even started, or how do you think about that? And what about the release of reserves the extent you stay down this low charge-off range even with some of the normalization? Terry Dolan : Yes. Well, I think we'll wait and see what ends up happening given the uncertainty that's in the economy regarding the last bit of it. But yes, I know we had said that it was the weighted average. At the peak, it was -- peak quarter was about a little over 6%. It's about 5.9% today is kind of what our weighted average case kind of comes up to. So very similar to what we had before. Mike Mayo : Okay. And your outlook for the economy, soft recession, hard landing, kind of what you're thinking? Andy Cecere : So Mike, we expect a soft recession, a moderate recession later half of this year. But as Terry mentioned, our CECL accounting is assuming a sort of a two-thirds downturn, one-third base case. So we are reserved to a little bit more downward scenario. Mike Mayo : Okay. Thank you. Andy Cecere : You bet. Operator : And we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn it back to George Anderson. Please continue. George Anderson : Thank you for listening to our call. Please contact the Investor Relations department if you have any follow-up questions. Operator : And this concludes today's conference. Thanks for participating. You may now disconnect.",

This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 11 :00 a.m. Central Time. I will now turn the conference call over to George Anderson, Senior Vice President and Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. George Anderson : Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. With me today are Andy Cecere, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Terry Dolan, our Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer; and John Stern, Senior Executive Vice President and Head of Finance. During initial prepared remarks, Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation. A copy of the presentation, our earnings release, and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. Please note that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainties. Factors that can materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, our press release, our Form 10-K, and in subsequent reports on file with the SEC. Following our prepared remarks, Andy, Terry, and John will take any questions that you have.  I will now turn the call over to Andy. Andy Cecere : Thanks, George. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I'll begin on Slide 3. The second quarter was highlighted by our successful conversion of Union Bank and a meaningful increase in our common equity tier one ratio to 9.1%, 60 basis points higher than the first quarter, driven by earnings accretion and balance sheet optimization actions. Earnings per share totaled $0.84 in the second quarter, including $0.28 per share of notable items. Excluding the impact of notable items, earnings per share was $1.12.  Slide 4 provides reported and adjusted income statement results and other key metrics. Our second quarter results were supported by new customer account growth and deepening of relationships across our business lines, as well as continued disciplined expense management. Net interest income was lower compared with the first quarter, primarily due to pressures on deposit pricing. However, momentum and fee income businesses continue strong. One of the strengths of our business model is our diverse and stable funding that includes a mix of both consumer and operational wholesale deposits. This quarter, while our average deposit balances decreased by 2.6% linked-quarter, period end deposits were higher by 3.2% or approximately $522 billion, largely reflective of seasonal operational deposit flows in areas such as our corporate banking and trust businesses. Credit quality metrics remained strong versus pre-pandemic levels, but are normalizing as expected. This quarter, we strengthened our balance sheet by increasing the loan loss reserve, reflective of our prudent approach to credit risk management.  Slide 5 provides key performance metrics. Excluding notable items, our return on average assets was about 1.07%, and our return on tangible common equity was 22.3%. Slide 6 provides a summary of our recently completed conversion of Union Bank. Following our main systems conversion on Memorial Day weekend, all credit cards, trust and investment accounts, were transitioned to our platform in June. Early indications are encouraging, and I'm even more confident today of the strategic and financial merits of this deal. We continue to expect meaningful revenue opportunities, and our cost synergy targets remain intact. One highlight is the Union Bank customers are adopting our digital capabilities more quickly than expected. As of June 30, just one month following conversion, we've had over a half a million enrollments in our digital product offerings, and this number continues to grow. Our teams are working diligently to leverage the value of overlaying all of our products and services to Union Bank customers as we continue to provide - and we'll continue to provide updates on our progress.  I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Terry, who\u2019ll provide more detail on the quarter. Terry Dolan : Thanks, Andy. Turning to Slide 7, our balanced mix of consumer, corporate and commercial deposits continues to be a key source of strength for the bank. As Andy highlighted, while average total deposits declined 2.6% or $13.1 billion on a linked-quarter basis, we ended the period with $522 billion of deposits, representing a 3.2% increase in ending balances on a linked-quarter. This quarter, our end of period percent of non-interest bearing deposits declined to approximately 20% from 25% in the first quarter, due to both industry dynamics and a change we made to Union Bank retail accounts at conversion. Specifically, about half of the decline was related to an increase in deposit volumes and mix shift, while the other half was primarily driven by a customer-friendly product conversion decision by us. To create a more positive customer experience, we upgraded Union Bank customers to our interest-bearing Bank Smartly checking product, which offers a better checking solution, as well as other benefits. This change will provide customer retention benefits without a material impact on our net interest margin. Given current interest rate volatility and the significant competition for deposits across the industry, we now expect our cumulative deposit beta to be in the mid 40% range by the end of this rate cycle, slightly higher than our previous expectation, but consistent with the deposit pricing dynamics in the industry.  On Slide 8, average total loans this quarter were $389 billion, which was flat on a linked-quarter basis, and up 19.9% year-over-year. Commercial real estate loans represent approximately 14% of our total average loan portfolio, with commercial real estate office exposure representing only 2% of total loans, and 1% of total commitments. Our office exposure is well balanced amongst suburban, specialty, and central business districts, and had a weighted average loan-to-value ratio of approximately 55% at initial underwriting. Given current macro factors, as well as other portfolio considerations, we increased the reserve ratio for commercial real estate office loans to 8.5%.  Turning to Slide 9, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.84 for the quarter, or $1.12 per share after adjusting for notable items in the amount of $575 million or $0.28 per diluted common share. Notable items this quarter included $310 million of merger and integration-related charges associated with the acquisition of Union Bank, as well as $265 million related to balance sheet optimization and capital management actions, largely driven by a provision charge of $243 million related to the securitization of approximately $4.4 billion of indirect auto loans, as well as an additional $4.2 billion sale of Union Bank mortgage loans. These moves enable us to more effectively position the balance sheet for profitable growth and optimize returns. Slide 10 provides a more detailed earnings summary for the quarter. Turning to Slide 11, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis totaled approximately $4.4 billion, which represented a 4.7% decrease on a linked-quarter basis, and a 28.4% increase from a year ago due to the impact of rising rates in the acquisition of Union Bank. Our net interest margin declined from 3.10% in the first quarter to 2.9% in the second quarter, which is somewhat lower than expected. The linked-quarter decline was primarily due to the impact of maintaining higher cash levels given the debt ceiling concerns and deposit pricing pressures, partially offset by higher rates on earning assets.  Slide 12 highlights trends in non-interest income. Non-interest income increased 8.7% or $219 million on a linked-quarter basis, driven by higher payment services revenue, trust and investment management fees, and commercial product revenues. Within payment services, revenue increased $112 million on a linked-quarter basis, reflecting credit card revenue growth of $62 million or 17.2%, driven by higher margins and sales volume, and an increase in merchant processing revenue of $49 million or 12.7%, driven by pricing. Also noteworthy were increases in trust and investment management fees of $31 million or 5.3%, driven by core business growth and commercial product revenue of $24 million or 7.2%, driven by strong debt capital markets activity in the quarter. Compared with a year ago, non-interest income for the company increased $178 million or 7.0%, largely driven by higher core fee income.  Turning to Slide 13, reported non-interest expense for the company totaled $4.6 billion in the second quarter, which included $310 million of merger and integration-related charges. Non-Interest expense, as adjusted, decreased $52 million, or 1.2% on a linked-quarter basis. Slide 14 shows credit quality trends, which continue to be strong from a historical perspective, but are normalizing as expected. The ratio of non-performing assets to loans and other real estate was 0.29% at June 30, compared to 0.3% at March 31, and 0.23% a year ago. Our second quarter net charge-off ratio of 0.35%, as adjusted, increased five basis points from a first quarter level of 0.3%, as adjusted, and was higher when compared to the second quarter 2022 level 0.2%. Our allowance for credit losses as of June 30, totaled $7.7 billion or 2.03% of period end loans.  Turning to Slide 15, we accelerated our capital actions and ended the quarter with a CET1 capital ratio of 9.1%. The 60 basis points linked-quarter increase in the CET1 ratio, reflected 20 basis points of earnings accretion net of distributions, and an additional 40 basis points attributable to risk-weighted asset and other balance sheet optimization initiatives, with low to neutral earnings impact. During the quarter, we received the results of the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2023 stress test, and we expect to be subject to the minimum stress capital buffer requirement of 2.5%, which is unchanged from last year. Despite this year's more stressful economic scenario and an additional $1.4 billion of merger-related charges, with limited recognition of cost synergies related to Union Bank.  I will provide third quarter and updated full year 2023 forward-looking guidance on Slide 16. Starting with third quarter 2023 guidance, we expect net interest income of between $4.2 billion and $4.4 billion in the third quarter. Total revenue as adjusted is estimated to be in the range of $6.9 billion to $7.1 billion, including approximately $75 million of purchase accounting accretion. Total non-interest expense as adjusted is expected to be approximately $4.3 billion, inclusive of approximately $120 million of core deposit intangible amortization related to the Union Bank acquisition. Our income tax rate as adjusted is expected to be approximately 23% to 24% on a taxable equivalent basis. We expect merger and integration charges of between $150 million to $200 million in the third quarter.  I will now provide updated guidance for the full year. For 2023, net interest income is expected to be in the range of $17.5 billion to $18.0 billion. Total revenue as adjusted is now expected to be in the range of $28.0 billion to $29.0 billion, inclusive of approximately $330 million of full year purchase accounting accretion. Total non-interest expense as adjusted for the year is expected to be approximately $17 billion, inclusive of approximately $500 million of core deposit intangible amortization related to Union Bank. Our estimated full year income tax rate on a taxable equivalent basis, as adjusted, is expected to be approximately 23% to 24%. We continue to expect to have $900 million to $1 billion of merger and integration charges in 2023, and total merger and integration cost of approximately $1.4 billion, consistent with earlier guidance. I will now hand it back to Andy for closing remarks. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Terry. I'll finish up on Slide 17. The strength and stability of our balance sheet remains a differentiator for our company. As these metrics indicate, we are well capitalized and prepared for a potentially more challenging economic environment, given our strong liquidity, diversified business mix, and consistent and disciplined approach to credit risk management. Building capital remains a top priority as we prepare for Category II designation, and we are confident in our ability to execute on our strategic growth opportunities and key initiatives. Following the successful conversion of Union Bank this quarter, we entered the second half of the year well-positioned as a national banking franchise, with increased scale, broader reach, and meaningful revenue growth opportunities provided by the addition of 1.2 million new consumer and small business customers. Across the business, from consumer to wealth management and commercial to business banking, we see significant opportunities to provide legacy Union Bank customers with a broad set of our products and services and industry-leading digital capabilities.  Additionally, the $900 million of identified cost synergies are still expected to be fully reflected in run rate savings as we head into 2024. Let me close by thanking our employees for all that they do to help provide exceptional service that makes us a destination of choice for our clients and a valued partner to all our stakeholders. We'll now open up the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll first go to Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Scott Siefers : Hey. I was hoping maybe we could start out with a couple of thoughts or expand the thoughts on capital. Maybe just sort of a refresher on anticipated capital build from here, especially in light of just how quickly you - just how quick the pace was in the second quarter. And then ideally sort of what you're targeting, presumably under Category II rules and when you might get there in your view. Terry Dolan : Yes, thanks, Scott. I think that we ended up at 9.1% CET1 at the end of the second quarter. Our expectation now through the rest of this year is that we'll be at least at 9.5% by the end of the year, and that's going to be a function of earnings accretion net of distributions, as well as some continued actions from a risk-weighted asset perspective. We had originally articulated about 50 basis points of risk-weighted asset optimization over kind of the two-year time horizon. We felt like we could accelerate that a lot because the vast majority of them were what I would call low to neutral impact on earnings accretion. We still have a number of different levers that we can pull, some of which we\u2019ll be able to execute on this year, some of which is in preparation for 2024, but we feel very confident that we have a game plan in order to be able to get to at least 9.5% by the end of this year, and to be in a position to be able to fully adopt Category II by the end of 2024, if necessary. Scott Siefers : Okay. All right, perfect. Thank you. And then maybe a question on the deposits. Appreciate all the commentary on the non-interest-bearing runoff being - I guess about half driven by the product change as you integrated the Union Bank customers. But just given sort of the optics of it, just curious about any thoughts - is that pretty much done or would you expect for the broader or entirety of the firm, could NIB balances still continue to flow out, just in light of where interest rates are, and where would you see those fleshing out maybe as the percent of total deposits? John Stern : Hey, Scott, this is John. So, in terms of the DDA mix, you illustrated that correctly. We moved about $15 billion of deposits over into that Bank Smartly interest checking product. And so, that gets us to about a 20% ratio. We think that that's about where we land here. It'll be plus or minus of course, as we kind of go through the quarters, but we think that we're at a low point here. Scott Siefers : Perfect. Okay, good. Thank you very much. Operator : And next, we'll go to John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead. John Pancari : Good morning. Regarding your non-interest income guidance of the 17.5 to 18, beyond the non-interest-bearing mix commentary that you just provided, can you also help unpack that guidance in terms of overall deposit growth expectations, as well as maybe the margin assumption behind that and loan growth as well, if possible. Thanks. John Stern : Sure. This is John again. So, a couple of things I would say maybe just to provide additional context. As you saw in our results, we saw a big increase in our deposits, up 3% on a period ending basis to $522 billion. And then we had with - as Terry mentioned about our capital actions, we had loans drop as a start point of about 2% given the auto and the mortgage sale that we talked about within our comments. And so, as I think about those things, we will have the ability to be a little bit more disciplined and moderate in our deposit pricing as we go forward, given that line of thinking. And in addition, I think that as we bring on new loans, those loans are coming in at wider spreads, although loan growth is a little bit stalled as there's a little bit less demand for that in the near term here. And the mix here of loans should be more favorable as we're bringing on cards and less in mortgage and auto. So, those are kind of the puts and takes to how we came up with the net interest income guidance. And then I think you made a comment about deposits there as well, and I can just touch on that. I think on deposit side, we would - even though we had a large seasonal uplift, as typical in the second quarter from our corporate trust and commercial businesses that bring in deposit balances, as that begins to normalize, we think we're probably in line with the industry, which we anticipate being more of a decline given the quantitative tightening and all the other sorts of things that are headwinds for deposits in the industry. Terry Dolan : Yes. And the other thing I would just mention, John, you asked a question regarding our expectation now just kind of looking at the market implied rate environment, is that NIM is probably down a few basis points in the third quarter and then relatively stable through the rest of the year. John Pancari : Got it. No, thank you. That's very helpful. And just lastly, the confidence in your through-cycle deposit beta of about 40%, looks like we have a number of banks that are turning to the high 40s and into the 50s. just what gives you the confidence in that through-cycle beta expectation of around 40? Terry Dolan : Yes. So, we're looking at - we're coming - our calculations shows at about 39% in the current beta. And we're indicating mid-40s is where we'll land. And I think it just goes back to some of the things that we talked about earlier where we did have a big flight in of deposits. We think - well, we have loans that have come down given the capital actions. And so, that gives us a little bit more flexibility with pricing. But of course, there'll be pressure as it relates to deposit betas just as we go through it, but all that is kind of baked into our mid-40s guide. John Pancari : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Next, we go to Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Terry Dolan : Morning, Ebrahim. How are you? Ebrahim Poonawala : Good. How are you? Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on this capital build. It's obviously a big topic. As we think about future RWA optimization, remind - I think you mentioned some of the low hanging fruit, I guess, things that were EPS neutral. It seems like you executed on those this quarter. As we look forward to, I think you mentioned some action in the back half, some into 2024, how punitive are those going to be from an EPS standpoint that we should think about? I'm assuming that's in your guidance for \u201823, but give us a sense of just the EPS hit from these actions and how much more of RWA optimization that should we think about between now and let's say year-end \u201824? Terry Dolan : Yes, great question Ebrahim. And so, let me maybe unpack it a little bit in terms of the different types of actions that we are likely to take. One, as an example is, we're going to be kind of winding down a cash provisioning of business. So, that'll have very minimal impact from an earnings perspective because it's not that big of a business, but it is a pretty significant user of capital in terms of risk-weighted assets. So, that's one area and one example of how we still think that there is low to neutral sort of opportunity in terms of enhancing or improving the risk-weighted asset position. We'll continue to be focused on reducing our MSR, our mortgage servicing right portfolio over the course of the next several quarters. That's an area that again it has some impact, but it's not significant. And probably more importantly, it allows us to rebalance the size of the mortgage exposure, mortgage portfolio relative to the overall size of the business. We'll continue to look at kind of similarly mortgage loan sales out of the Union Bank portfolio. Again, that reduces our concentration in California and should have minimal sort of impact kind of on a go-forward basis. And then there's just a number of other things, similar sort of structures that we've done. But the other thing that we're working on between now and the end of the year, which will kind of position us well to be able to continue to improve on a risk-weighted asset basis is setting up some securitization programs related to some of our other balance sheet asset positions. Ebrahim Poonawala : That's helpful. And just one follow-up. Strategically, I think the one question is, this environment should be ideal for USB to take market share. Competitors are under pressure. Clearly, your balance sheet holding up quite well. Give us a sense of just how much of a constrained capital levels are today as you think about getting new customer growth, picking up market share, adding - sort of maximizing the Union franchise, just how much of a restrictive factor capital is to accomplish all of those. Terry Dolan : Yes, go ahead Andy. Andy Cecere : So, Ebrahim, I wouldn't say it's a constraint. We're focused on profitable growth. We have a diverse set of business products and services that allow us to grow in a capital efficient way. I mean, I'll give you a couple of examples. The Union Bank customer base, about 80% of the consumer small businesses are single service customers. Their penetration on credit card is about half what ours is across the legacy US bank. So, we have a lot of opportunities to deepen relationships in a very capital efficient way, given the broad product set that we have. So, that is an opportunity that we're very much focused on, looking forward to, and not feeling constrained. Terry Dolan : Yes. And many of those single service on our balance sheet today, deepening the relationship will be as much focused on fee-based sort of businesses, which are capital efficient, as Andy said. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. Thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : And next, we'll move to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Hey, good morning, guys. Hey, a really good fee result this quarter. I just wanted to ask you, as I'm looking at the payment slide on Page 19, it does look like the year-over-year growth rates did all slow versus the first quarter. Can you just talk about what's going on across the payments with regards to just where the consumer is and how you expect corporate spending to trend as you look ahead, given the potential for a slowing economy? Terry Dolan : Yes, and of course that's the $100,000 question, is whether or not we actually move into a recession or not. But I think broadly from a macro perspective, some of the things that we're seeing is that some of the excess savings that consumers have held in the past has come down to really pre-pandemic levels at this particular point in time. So, I think that manifests itself in kind of a normalization of consumer spend. So, we are seeing what was very strong consumer spend starting to normalize and soften, if you will. I mean, yesterday was retail sales information that came out a little bit softer than maybe expected. We're seeing some of those same dynamics in the payments business where sales, for example in the merchant side of the equation, slower, softer sort of retail sales, but there's still a fair amount of travel expenditure that's taking place. So, customers are certainly choosing and maybe being a little more choosy as to where they're spending their dollars. Some of the dynamics that we're seeing is while sales have softened maybe a bit, the margins in some of the businesses have actually improved. So, on the credit card side of the equation where sales have come down a little bit, the margins are actually a little stronger. On the corporate payment side of the equation, margins continue to get stronger because T&E spend at the corporate - in the commercial corporate sectors, has continued to be reasonably strong. So, we continue to kind of look out the rest of the year on the merchant acquiring side of the equation of revenue kind of in that high single digits sort of range, on the credit card fee revenue still in that mid-single digits, and on the corporate payment side equation. It'll normalize, but it'll kind of normalize in that high single digits range. That's kind of what we're seeing, what we're kind of forecasting at this particular point in time based upon consumer behavior. Ken Usdin : Got it. And one follow-up on capital can you just give us, just so we all have the right number from your perspective, where CET1 was this quarter inclusive of AFS unrealized losses, and also just your view of, if rates stay the same here, what that pull to par looks like as you look forward to that year-end \u201824 point? Thanks. Terry Dolan : Yes. So, if you were to embed the AOCI into the CET1 calculation under Category II, it'd been at 6.9%. And we expect that, based upon all of our capital actions, to get to kind of our target levels by the end of 2024. We have the game plan in order to be able to get there. So, we feel confident about that. Ken Usdin : Okay. Do you do just have the AFS piece of what does pull to par by the end of the year? Because it's hard for us to understand how much the risk-weighted asset part might be, but at least we can kind of track to your view of the portfolio maturity. Terry Dolan : Yes. Do you have that, John? John Stern : Yes. So, in terms of the burndowns between here and the end of \u201824, it's about 25% or so. Terry Dolan : Yes. Ken Usdin : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Operator : Next, we can go to Erika Najarian with UBS. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Hi. good morning. I need to ask that capital question again just because it's been such a big deal for your stock, and I'm wondering if you could indulge me in some sort of cave woman's math here. So, 6.9% CET1, you have six quarters to generate capital. Based on what you're earning today, you could add another 120 basis points, right, for six quarters times 20, and that'll get you to 8%. So, given that you've mentioned, both Terry and John, throughout the call, some additional RWA actions. How much can RWA actions enhance that potential for 8% fully loaded CET1 by 4Q \u201824 just on earnings. How much can you add from RWA mitigation? Terry Dolan : Yes, so maybe just kind of unpacking a little bit. We still expect Erika, that the benefit from capital accretion or earnings accretion is going to be somewhere in that 20 to 25 basis points on average. And a couple of different things to kind of keep in mind. While there's a little more pressure on the revenue side of the equation, the things that will start to come into the equation is a lot lower merger and integration charges next year. We\u2019ll be substantially done with that, as well as the fact that by the end of the year, we will really be at kind of full run rate from a cost synergy standpoint.  So, I think that there's a number of things just in terms of why we feel confident that that accretion level starts to accelerate or creep up from where we're at today. And then I think when you end up going through - John talked a little bit about the burndown being at about 25% between now and the end of the year, and that's based upon market implied. But also keep in mind, as we have said is, we have put into place some hedging strategies to protect us from the upside risk that might exist if rates were to move up. So, we feel pretty good about where that is going to come in. And then the rest of it is really tied to risk-weighted asset actions, many of which I ended up talking about. And again, we have a pretty confident game plan with respect to our ability to reduce risk-weighted assets in order to be able to achieve the targets that we need to hit. Erika Najarian : Let me just ask it another way again, just because it feels like some of the good stuff that's going on in the company is being ignored because of this capital question regarding Category II. Based on your outlook and under a reasonable range of scenario for the economy, do you think you could get to 8.5% to 9% fully loaded CET1 by 4Q \u201824? Terry Dolan : Yes, absolutely. Erika Najarian : Thank you. Operator : And next, we can go to John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. John McDonald : Hi. Yes, thanks, Terry. Yes, just one last follow-up on that walk starting from the 6.9%, getting to 8.5% to 9%. So, is that the idea that the AOCI is kind of like a 200, 210 basis point drag today and that'll shrink to, in your number, something like 150 or that kind of drag by the end of next year? Terry Dolan : Yes. John McDonald : Okay. And does your walk include like FDIC assessment and CECL phase-in, things like that? Terry Dolan : Yes. John McDonald : Okay. The next question was just on credit. How do you see charge-off trajectory from here? I know you've said normalized 50, you won't get there for a while, but the jumping off point is 35 basis points, I guess this quarter. How do you see it kind of playing out from here? Terry Dolan : Yes, it's going to continue to normalize for all the different things we have been talking about and that I think the industry has been talking about. Our expectation is that that 35 creeps up into the kind of mid-40s by maybe the end of the year, early next year. And then it kind of normalizes around 50 basis points once we get into 2024. John McDonald : Okay. Got it. And does the full year guidance on expenses for this year incorporate some achievement of merger saves in the fourth quarter of this year? Terry Dolan : In terms of cost synergies or\u2026? John McDonald : Yes, exactly. Terry Dolan : Yes, absolutely. Gets us to the run rate, John of the full 900 by the end of the quarter. So, when we get into 2024, we will have achieved a full run rate of $900 million of cost synergies, John McDonald : And you will have achieved most of those by the fourth quarter of this year, Terry Dolan : By the end of the fourth quarter. Yep. John McDonald : Okay. And that's built into the guidance for the full year this year? Terry Dolan : Yes. John McDonald : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we can go to Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Chris Kotowski : Yes. I think last quarter you shared that the average duration of your securities portfolio went down from like 4.3 to 3.8 years or something like that. And I wonder if you could give us the similar trend in the second quarter and the outlook for the balance of the year and just your philosophy in general about reinvesting maturities. Is that kind of going into cash or are you kind of maintaining the duration that you have? Terry Dolan : Yes. The duration that we had talked about with respect to the AFS portfolio was 3.8 years and has continued to come down a little bit, not measurably, but down a little bit from there. Our game plan, I guess, is that we're going to continue to work on shortening the duration of the AFS portfolio. Again, it kind of helps us de-risk that, meaning we'll keep more in short term sort of securities, whether it's that or cash, but it'll be kind of a combination. Chris Kotowski : And on the HTM portfolio, is there a similar kind of move to shorten duration, or are you comfortable where it is? Terry Dolan : Yes. Well, with respect to the HTM portfolio, that's just kind of going to run down over time or burn down over time. We're not adding to the HTM portfolio at this particular point. Chris Kotowski : Okay. All right, great. Thank you. Operator : And we'll move to Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Vivek Juneja : Sorry, it\u2019s sort of repetitive given the multiple calls. So, I guess a couple of things. On merchant processing, any color on why up only 2% year-on-year in terms of fees? I hear you on the travel flowing, but that's - there's also a lower fee. What's caused such a sharp slowdown and what turns that around to the mid-single digits, Terry? Terry Dolan : Yes, some of it is year-over-year comp and how it'll kind of play out. But the biggest driver, Vivek, in the merchant processing at this particular point is the fact that the travel, airline specifically, is continuing to become a higher portion of the overall mix that we think is starting to stabilize. In other words, most of the - much of that growth has been in the airline space, but we think that that kind of stabilizes. Airline happens to have a lower margin. And so, that's the dynamic that you're seeing. Vivek Juneja : Got it. Okay. And OCI, your loss seems to have gone up. Did you not get any benefits from the hedges you have put on, or is there something else going on underneath? Terry Dolan : Yes. Go ahead, John. John Stern : I think the investment portfolio is, AOCI went - declined or the mark declined by about $250 million linked-quarter, but rates went up 50 to 60 basis points upon the points of the curve that that matter to the portfolio. So, it's not totally flat - as we talked about, there's a duration to that book. And so, you would expect a wider mark given the higher level of rates. So, I think with the hedges that we have put in place, that helped mute that. It could have been higher. And we continue to add hedges across that portfolio and picker spots when we see rates fall. Vivek Juneja : Thank you. Operator : And we'll go to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, gentlemen. Terry, you talked a bit about a normalization in net charge-offs moving into 2024. Can you share with us what kind of assumptions you're using to get to that normalization rate in charge-offs, both economic and just the way the customer base may behave? Terry Dolan : You want to talk about that? Andy Cecere : From an economic standpoint - Gerard, I'll start. This is Andy. We think there's probably a fairly equal weight probability that we'll either see a soft landing or a mild recession. And if we do get a recession, our models would indicate it would be short and shallow either late this year or early in 2024. You know there's still pricing pressure and the inflation's not solved.  So, we have one more rate hike by the end of the year modeled in. And then - but on the other hand, as Terry mentioned, excess savings has come down significantly, and consumer spending is slowing. So, the Fed is getting its desired outcomes. So, big picture, we think the Fed's close to being done. And as I said, sort of this probability of either shallow and soft or mild recession and or a soft landing is what we've modeled in to get to those assumptions Terry has articulated Terry Dolan : A couple of things I would just add maybe from a portfolio dynamic perspective. We're seeing nice growth in terms of credit card balances. And as credit card balances both increase and it normalizes, you'll start to see that ratio going up because that's a little higher mix for us. And then I think it may be somewhat lumpy, but it's kind of incorporated into it as just continuing to work through commercial real estate office space over the course of the next few years. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then I apologize if you addressed this question, but with the expectation of the Basel III end gain capital requirements coming shortly in this week, the disclosures, that it seems like residential mortgages may be exposed to higher risk-weighted assets. How are you guys thinking about that in terms of risk of RWA strategies, if mortgages do get a bigger weight and other areas are greater than expected? Terry Dolan : Yes. Well, certainly, a lot of our actions, for example, with respect to mortgages and that particular business, is just continuing to de-risk, so to speak. So, we're kind of trying to take that into consideration. Our expectation right now, Gerard, is that it's probably going to be fairly neutral to maybe just a little bit of a benefit it based upon everything that we're seeing in terms of the end game, but we really have to wait and see what the final rules say and then apply it to our specific portfolio. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you, Terry. Thank you, Andy. Operator : And next, we go to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. One, the asset sales that you did this quarter, was that at the beginning of the quarter or the end? I'm just trying to understand how much like revenue from that portfolio you have in 2Q. Terry Dolan : Yes. Most of them were completed the end of the - closer to the end of the second quarter, so in the June timeframe. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then the revenue outlook for the full year, is that based on June 30 balance sheet or is that also including the RWA actions you're planning on taking between now and year end? Terry Dolan : Both. It incorporates our capital actions in terms of what we expect to execute on between now and the end of the year. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Got it. All right. Okay. Thank you. That's it. Operator : And next, we can move to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. Well, on the capital issue I asked last quarter, do you think there's any chance that you need to raise capital or cut the dividend? And I\u2019ll just to ask again, or what - I mean, people were doing these mechanistic analyses where they would take the underlying securities losses, reduce that from tangible equity, give you no credit, and then say you would need to raise capital. So, now that you've met your year-end capital target, I guess would you reiterate, or to what degree would you reiterate no capital increase, no dividend cut. And in addition, if you could put in a broader context, the vice chair of the Fed, Barr, last week said that actually the economic value of equity at banks goes up because of higher value of deposits. So, it seems like he signs on to a lot of the analysis that we analyst do. So, just if you could comment on the bigger picture about your capital and the flexibility there. Andy Cecere : Yes, Mike, this is Andy. And as Terry mentioned, so we accelerated our RWA actions, got to 9.1 at the end of the second quarter, well ahead of our 9.0 by the end of the year. We expect to be at least 9.5 by the end of the year, if not better. And we have a game plan we're comfortable with and confident enough to get to 9 under the Basel - under the Cat II definition by the end of 2024. So, all those things make us confident in the capital walk that we talked about and the actions we're taking. Mike Mayo : And then on the negative side, you and a lot of regional banks have continued to lower guidance on NII, and here we go again with that. And look, I mean, rates went up faster than you or anyone had expected. The yield curve is a lot more inverted. I guess competition has picked up more than expected. What inning do you think you're in terms of this downward revision for NII? Do you think you're kind of there now? You said third quarter could be down a little bit. And as you exit the year, do you think you maintain that third quarter level or what - I think you said NIM would be flat after that, but I'm not sure if you mentioned NII. So, is the downward revision for NII done, or eighth inning, seventh inning, and what does that mean for kind of run rate going to next year? Terry Dolan : Yes. So, again, obviously you heard the guidance with respect to NII and NIM. We expect it to be a few basis points down in the third quarter and then relatively stable from there. Obviously, this is rate, excuse me, it's Fed policy kind of dependent. So, we're trying to look at what the current environment looks like, but we feel like if I had to kind of put what inning are we in, I think we're in the late innings simply because of where the Fed is from a monetary policy standpoint. So, while there may continue to be a little bit of downward pressure, we don't see it as being significant from here. Andy, what would you add? Andy Cecere : Mike, the other thing I'd add is, I think one of the benefits of our business model is the diversity of revenue. So, even in a stressed environment on deposits, which you're absolutely right about, we have the payments revenue, the trust revenue, the commercial products revenue, and on top of all that, $900 million of cost synergies that we're going to act on. So, we're pulling lots of levers, not just on margin. Mike Mayo : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And next, we have a follow up from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. John McDonald : Hi, Terry. Thanks. One more on the mitigation and optimization opportunity. Originally, you had talked about 50 basis points of opportunity to harness this year. Obviously, you got 40 this quarter. And now it sounds like the total is more. I'm just trying to - is there a way to size how much more you might see out there between the remainder of this year and next year relative to the original 50 you were targeting? Terry Dolan : Yes. Again, the 50 that we were targeting, we knew we had a high level of confidence in terms of being able to achieve it because there were low to kind of neutral impact and they were things that we could kind of execute on the - we definitely believe that as we get into 2024, the standing up, which obviously takes a little longer, standing up of securitization programs and many of the actions that I talked about earlier, gets us to where we need to be from a capital perspective when you take into consideration the burndown, et cetera. So, that opportunity I think is certainly - probably in line with another 50 basis points, would be my guess. John McDonald : Okay. And when you say no impact or low impact, we did see some this quarter, like in terms of the charge-offs and taxes, I guess they're not run rate. Is that what you mean by like you could have episodic one quarter type impacts? Terry Dolan : Yes, absolutely. We'll continue to see that as we reposition the balance sheet. But again, those impacts are all taken into consideration when we think about the net RWA impacts. John McDonald : Okay. And again, your target that you want to get to for the fully loaded by the end of next year is what? When you say you want to \u2026 Terry Dolan : Yes. Well, it'll be - fully adopted, it'd be roughly 8.5%, 9%. John McDonald : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we have no further questions at this time, and I'll turn it back to George Anderson. Please continue. George Anderson : Thank you for listening to our earnings call. Please contact the Investor Relations department if you have any follow-up questions. Operator : And this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 9 :00 a.m. Central Time. I will now turn the conference call over to George Andersen, Senior Vice President and Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. George Andersen : Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. With me today are Andy Cecere, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Terry Dolan, Vice Chair and Chief Administration Officer; and John Stern, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During their initial prepared remarks, Andy and John will be referencing a slide presentation. A copy of the presentation, our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. Please note that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, our press release, our Form 10-K and in subsequent reports on file with the SEC. Following our prepared remarks, Andy, Terry and John will take any questions that you have. I will now turn the call over to Andy. Andy Cecere : Thanks, George. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I'll begin on Slide 3. In the third quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.91, which included $0.14 per share of notable items related to merger and integration charges. Excluding those notable items, we delivered earnings per share of $1.05 for the quarter. Third quarter results were highlighted by linked quarter and year-over-year fee revenue growth that benefited from our acquisition of Union Bank, deepening client relationships and strong underlying business activity. We are achieving the cost synergies we anticipated from Union Bank and continue to prudently manage core expense as we identify operational efficiencies across the business. As of September 30, our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 9.7%, an increase of 60 basis points this quarter. This is the same level that it was prior to our acquisition of Union Bank. Total average deposits increased 3% or $15 billion on a linked-quarter basis. Credit quality continues to normalize this quarter, in line with expectations, and we further strengthened the balance sheet by adding $95 million to our loan loss reserve, reflective of an evolving credit environment. On October 16, the Federal Reserve granted us full relief from certain Category II commitments made in connection with the Union Bank acquisition given our balance sheet reduction and capital actions. As a result, we are now subject to existing capital rules or, if adopted, the same transition rules as all other Category III banks related to enhanced capital requirements under the Basel III and game proposal. As proposed, this would include a three-year transition period for the expanded risk-based approach and AOCI regulatory capital adjustment starting in the third quarter of 2025. I will discuss the impacts of these decisions further in my closing remarks. Slide 4 provides income statement results as reported and on an adjusted basis, ending in balances and other key metrics. Slide 5 provides key performance metrics. Excluding notable volumes, our return on average assets was 1.04% and our return on tangible common equity was 21%. While net interest margin declined 9 basis points to 2.81% this quarter, in line with our expectations, we continue to expect the NIM to bottom in the fourth quarter as we reach the end of the current rate hiking cycle. Turning to Slide 6. A great benefit of our business model includes a balance between our spread and fee income businesses that helps us reduce earnings volatility through a business cycle. On a year-over-year basis, noninterest income grew approximately 12%. Within Payment Services, we continue to invest in our digital capabilities, expanding our payments ecosystem and optimizing our distribution. Emphasis on expanded partners and integrated capabilities will continue to support tech-led growth across merchant processing and increased opportunities across other areas of payment services businesses. Additionally, we are continuing to make investments that leverage our scale and strategic market positioning across our corporate trust, mortgage banking and capital markets businesses, which should enhance our already strong annualized growth trajectories. Slide 7 highlights a few of our many post-conversion revenue opportunities and expected energies with Union Bank. Early indications of the potential to deepen relationships with legacy Union Bank loyal, affluent and diversified client base are promising, and we continue to be on track to realize approximately $900 million in cost synergies, which we expect to be fully reflected in our run rate as we head into the year 2024. Let me now turn the call over to John, who will provide more details on the balance sheet and results for the quarter. John Stern : Thanks, Andy. Turning to Slide 8, we ended the quarter with total average assets of $664 billion and total average loans of $377 million, down $9 billion and $12 billion, respectively, on a linked-quarter basis as we prudently managed and optimized our balance sheet given the current macroeconomic and regulatory environment. Average total deposits were $512 billion, representing a 3% increase linked quarter, driven by expected seasonality and growth in money market and time deposit accounts. Specifically, average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $16.2 billion this quarter, primarily driven by our Union Bank retail customer upgrade at conversion from noninterest-bearing checking accounts to our interest-bearing Bank Smartly product. Excluding this reclassification, the decrease would have been $6.2 billion. Our mix of noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits was approximately 19%, consistent with where we expect the mix shift to stabilize based on historical performance and the operational nature of our core deposit base. Slide 9 provides an update on the investment securities portfolio. As of September 30, our available for sale securities were 97% of our total securities. We continue to reduce the effective duration of the AFS portfolio, which is now less than 3.5 years. On Slide 10, we provide a detailed earnings summary for the quarter. This quarter, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.91 or $1.05 per share after adjusting for merger and integration charges of $213 million net of tax or $0.14 per diluted common share. Turning to Slide 11. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis totaled approximately $4.3 billion, which represented a 4.1% decrease on a linked-quarter basis and a 10.7% increase from a year ago due to the impact of rising rates and the acquisition of Union Bank. Our net interest margin declined 9 basis points to 2.81% in the third quarter. The linked quarter decline was primarily due to the impact of lower earning assets, deposit pricing and mix shift, offset somewhat by better loan spreads and funding mix. Slide 12 highlights trends in noninterest income. Fee income increased 11.9% or $295 million on a year-over-year basis, driven by higher payment service revenue, trust and investment management fees, virtual products and mortgage banking revenues. On a linked-quarter basis, fee income increased 1.4% or $38 million, driven by other revenues, which included servicing revenue from previously executed balance sheet optimization actions. Turning to Slide 13. Reported noninterest expense for the quarter totaled $4.5 billion, which included $284 million of merger and integration-related charges. Noninterest expense, as adjusted, decreased $13 million or 0.3% on a linked-quarter basis driven by lower compensation expense that was somewhat offset by our investments in marketing and business development. Slide 14 shows our credit quality performance this quarter. While asset quality metrics reflecting changing conditions in the commercial real estate office segment, results this quarter continue to trend in line with our expectations, and key metrics remain below pre-pandemic levels. Importantly, given the higher interest rate environment as well as other portfolio considerations, we increased our reserve ratio for commercial real estate office loans to 10%. Our ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was 0.35% at September 30 compared with 0.29% at June 30 and 0.20% a year ago. Our third quarter net charge-off ratio of 0.44% increased 9 basis points from a second quarter level of 0.35% as adjusted, and was higher when compared to a third quarter 2022 level of 0.19%. Our allowance credit losses as of September 30 totaled $7.8 billion or 2.08% of period-end loans. Turning to Slide 15. We continue to take action to improve our capital ratios this quarter, increasing our CET1 ratio to 9.7% as of September 30. The combination of our debt-to-equity conversion with MUFG, earnings accretion net of distributions and balance sheet optimization actions resulted in a 60 basis point increase from last quarter. Importantly, our CET1 capital ratio is now 270 basis points above our regulatory capital minimum. I will now provide fourth quarter forward-looking guidance on Slide 16. In the fourth quarter, we expect net interest income of between $4.1 billion and $4.2 billion. Total revenue, as adjusted, is estimated to be in the range of $6.8 billion to $6.9 billion, including approximately $65 million of purchase accounting accretion. Total noninterest expense, as adjusted, is expected to be approximately $4.2 billion, inclusive of approximately $115 million of core deposit intangible amortization related to Union Bank acquisition. On a core basis, we expect full year 2024 expenses to be flat with 2023. Our income tax rate is expected to be approximately 23% on a taxable equivalent basis. We expect merger and integration charges of between $250 million to $300 million in the fourth quarter. I'll now hand it back to Andy for closing remarks. Andy Cecere : Thanks, John. Turning to Slide 17. The Federal Reserve notified us on October 16 that they have granted us full relief from Category II commitments made in conjunction with the Union Bank acquisition after considering several factors, including actions to reduce our risk profile, strengthen our capital position and provisions related to Category III rules made after we received approval on the Union Bank acquisition. This important decision now subjects us to the same enhanced capital requirements as all other Category III banks, including a three-year phase-in of AOCI into regulatory capital starting in the third quarter of 2025. As expected, we will continue to carefully balance the need to accrete capital with any potential impact to earnings from further balance sheet optimization activities. Measures to manage the interest rate sensitivity and duration of our available-for-sale securities will continue. Since before our acquisition of Union Bank, our priority has been and will continue to be the strategic execution of capital-efficient growth opportunities across each of our business lines. As a result of the Fed's decision, we are now well positioned with our enhanced earnings profile and diversified business mix to increase our capital levels, continue our disciplined lending activities and further strengthen our balance sheet. Let me close by thanking our more than 75,000 employees for their dedication to supporting the needs of our clients, communities and shareholders. We'll now open up the call to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll go to Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess maybe the first question, just around the Fed decision. In its letter, the Fed said, I guess the bank anticipates taking further actions to reduce risk profile and reduce assets and increase capital. So if you don't mind talking about just what additional actions we should expect. I think you mentioned that the EPS impact could be neutral from here. But just how should we think about what else the Fed expects from you on the risk mitigation side as we move forward into next year? John Stern : Sure. Thanks, Ebrahim. So -- this is John. As a way of background, the Fed granted us as we -- as you mentioned, full relief from our Category II commitments, and that's because of the action, Andy mentioned this, of our actions to reduce risk as well as our ability to strengthen our capital position. So importantly, this is going to provide us additional time and flexibility to meet those new regulatory requirements and do so in the same timeframe as our Category III peers. And additionally, we think it's going to reduce the downside given the challenging rate environment. But nothing really changes in terms of how we're fundamentally managing the balance sheet going forward. We're still committed to building regulatory capital. We're still expecting to increase and accrete capital at a 20 to 25 basis points on average per quarter. And our expectation is to accelerate that as we get through the merger-related costs or be in the high end of that range, I should say, as we get through the merger-related costs and start to realize the full Union Bank synergies. And we're still going to be executing risk-weighted asset optimization transactions. But now we have the time and flexibility to do that over in a way that is low to neutral in terms of our earnings impact. And so for all those reasons, we feel like we have the flexibility in our balance sheet to do those sorts of things. Andy Cecere : I think that's exact, John. And the only thing I'd add is that part of the decision is reflective of what we've already done for the last 12 months in terms of reducing the risk profile, building capital, optimizing the balance sheet. And I want to be clear, Ebrahim, we are not under an asset cap at all. We are maintaining flexibility and managing the balance sheet and capital, and we'll continue to remain focused on capital-efficient growth. And that includes focusing the high-margin, high-return businesses that exceed our cost of capital, while deepening relationships from our most profitable clients. And that has been and will continue to be our focus. Ebrahim Poonawala : That's good color. And just another question, John, I think I heard you correctly -- if I heard you correctly, you mentioned you expect the NIM to draw off, and I'm assuming NIM equals the trough in the fourth quarter. Maybe just that assumption in terms of does a steeper yield curve or widening in just the curve. So is -- that assumption around troughing of NII or NIM? And what gives you confidence around mix change consumer behavior to feel good about that? John Stern : Yes. So I think in terms of the guidance we provided, we have embedded in there our rate forecast, which includes a rate increase in December. Whether or not that happens or not is relatively immaterial since we're fairly neutral from an interest rate risk positioning standpoint. I guess what I would say is as the Fed is -- whether they're done or not in terms of the rate hiking, we start to see a lot of things on the deposit side slowdown, so our noninterest-bearing balances will be relatively stable here at this level. The deposit betas will -- rate paid will start to slow down. And then on the other side, your assets will start to reprice, whether that's the securities book, the loan book and all those sort of things. So that's what gives us the confidence really that we will bottom out here in the fourth quarter from a NIM and net interest income perspective. Operator : Next, we go with John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. John cDonald : John, can I just follow up on what you're just talking about. What are you looking at in terms of the NIM for the fourth quarter roughly? And did I hear correctly, you think the deposit mix kind of settles out around 19%, 20%, where you are here in beta kind of in the mid-40s, you still have those expectations? John Stern : Yes. Maybe just to go to the last couple of questions you mentioned. So from a noninterest bearing, yes, we do expect that mix, we're at about 19%. That's about where we will be -- we expect that to be in that range. And from a beta perspective, we are in the mid-40s right now. It's possible it could creep up higher depending on where the Fed goes from here, but we feel good about that. And then in terms of the net interest margin and things like that, we do anticipate a little bit more pressure here in the fourth quarter, but then that really is the point where we feel that it'll bottom out based on my comments I just made a previous question? Andy Cecere : And that's reflected in our revenue and net interest income guidance. John Stern : Yes. John cDonald : Okay. And then recognizing with the Fed decision, you've obviously got a lot more time to phase in the AOCI now. John, can you just give us a little more color on what happened in terms of the trend in AOCI this quarter? What are the pieces there? How do the swaps affect your burn-down time line? And just also if you could add on, what do you -- how do you calculate the capital with AOCI today? It looks like maybe around 7%, something like that. John Stern : Yes. So I think all in, it's about -- AOCI is about 250 basis points of impact. So I would say 7.2% is roughly kind of where I would think about it. In terms of the change in the AFS, obviously, rates backed up on the long end of the curve, 75 to 90 basis points, depending on treasuries or mortgages that you're looking at. And that had an impact of about $1.4 billion in our -- on an after-tax basis on our AFS securities book, which we would have expected and is consistent with the duration of our book, which we have continued to wind down, as I mentioned in our comments about -- less than 3.5 years is our current duration. So that's the effect of that. We are continuing to see -- we will continue to see pay downs in that book, whether it's the HTM or AFS. We have about approximately $3 billion or so per quarter that rolls off that book, and we'll reinvest in the AFS side of things over time. Operator : Next, we'll go to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Just to be clear, how much of the $900 million merger savings were recognized in the third quarter results? John Stern : Well, in terms of -- we will get to a full run rate of $900 million, it's probably $100 million or so is kind of the -- in that range is probably what we were seeing. But it's been growing in terms of the amount, and we'll see that full benefit fall through in the fourth quarter. Mike Mayo : So relative to the third quarter, the first quarter of 2025 could see $800 million of additional expense savings? John Stern : No, because we've been -- the savings have been generated all throughout the course of the year, and they have -- they accelerate third quarter into fourth quarter, and second quarter, third quarter and the fourth quarter. Mike Mayo : So what's the cumulative merger savings? I guess how much more expense savings should there be when they're fully realized in the first quarter relative to the third quarter? John Stern : When we have the savings, we'll have approximately $400-or-so million that has gone through this full year, and then we'll expect to see that in the next coming year. But that's embedded into our full year guidance of flat expenses between 2023 and 2024. Andy Cecere : So Mike, the way I think about it, this is Andy, by the end of the fourth quarter, we will be on a run rate recognizing $900 million of savings, which will be fully reflected in 2024 in our expense base. And that is consistent with how we think about a relatively flat 23% to 24% expense base, including those savings plus investments we'll continue to make in the business. Mike Mayo : And then the big question then is, so if you have flat 2024 expenses, do you think you can get to positive operating leverage? Or is it too early or too many moving parts? Because this is the sweet spot of the merger savings coming up, right, by the next quarter. Andy Cecere : It is a sweet spot, Mike, you're absolutely right. And the savings are great. The opportunities to deepen relationships on the Union Bank customer base, I mentioned that in my comments, I think that is terrific. Our fee businesses are doing extremely well. On a year-over-year basis, it was up 12% across almost every category. And frankly, very little of that was related to Union Bank. That was just core improvement across a number of categories, capital markets, our corporate and trust, our fee businesses, our payments businesses. The challenge for us and for the entire industry is net interest income and margin. And in this environment, that's the one that I -- there's a lot of moving pieces, as you say. Loan growth is relatively tepid as we speak for us and for the industry overall. So it will be dependent upon that in terms of positive operating leverage, and I would say it's too early to call. Mike Mayo : Okay. And last follow-up, your increase in CET1 ratio due to a lot of balance sheet optimization did come at a cost of less assets, less loan growth, less earnings, right? There's a trade-off in that. So now that you're under kind of less pressure and have so much more flexibility, do you think you can be a little bit more lax in terms of your growth and in turn, that may help NII? Or is that too much of a stretch? John Stern : Yes. We have flexibility now in terms of the transactions that we do to optimize. And we still have plans to do those sorts of things. We've identified some things that are going to be relatively neutral and a little bit on the low end of earnings impact. And of course, you saw some of those transactions in the second quarter flow through in terms of provision and things like that. And that did lower our earning assets, as you mentioned, about $8 billion or thereabouts this quarter. Operator : And next, we'll go to John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead. John Pancari : I know despite the regulatory change around the Cat II requirement, you maintain the 20 to 25 bps generation in CET1 quarterly. Why no change there? Can you just talk to us maybe about the give and takes in that expectation as the need to meet the Category II shifted to Category III, why no change there? John Stern : Well, I think there's no change because we feel like given the new rule set and things like that, over time, we'll have to transition into the new regime, which will include AOCI and so all the other rules. And so, we're going to be in a mode to continue to accrete that capital and 20 to 25 basis points is our earnings stream that we will accrete. And like this quarter, for example, it was 20 basis points, but we anticipate going to 25 on the higher end of that range as we get through the merger-related costs and we have the Union synergies. John Pancari : Okay. So the less BSO activities didn't materially benefit that expectation? John Stern : I'm sorry. Can you say that? I couldn't hear you. John Pancari : The less risk-weighted asset optimization that would be needed now under the -- need to meet Category III did not materially impact the 20 to 25 basis points of earnings generation expected? John Stern : No, that did not. No, that did not. Like for example, this quarter, we had 20 basis points of RWA actions, which included some of the asset reduction you saw our earning assets lower, for example, as well as some other transactions embedded. So, we separate out core earnings -- when we were talking about 20 to 25 basis points, core earnings from other RWA optimization transactions that we have the ability to do. John Pancari : Okay. And then separately, is there any OpEx impact of the -- of now needing to conform to the Category III versus the more immediate requirements of Category II? Anything on the expense side, and then separately, on the -- on your margin bottoming comment, anything in terms of the trajectory in the margin that you would expect after you see this bottoming as we head into 2024? John Stern : Yes. So in terms of OpEx, no, there's no further investment. You may recall before tailoring, we had many of the same rules and standards that we had in terms of liquidity rules and reporting and all those sorts of things. So, we have all the capabilities built up or can quickly get to that level from an operational standpoint. So, there's no worries there. In terms of the net interest margin, we mentioned just a little bit of pressure in the fourth quarter and then bottoming out, likely stable. But still dependent on interest rates, quite frankly, at that particular time. Operator : And next, we\u2019ll go over to John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Oh, one moment here. We'll go to Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Scott Siefers : Just as it relates to sort of the balance sheet growth dynamic. So great to see you out of the Fed restriction. Do you see any risk that you'd exceed $700 billion in assets organically, or come into contact with any of the other Cat II restrictions organically in a timeframe that would inject you to Cat II rules before your peers would have to get there under new levels? In other words, I'm just trying to kind of make sure that this is indeed just a full free -- so just curious of your thoughts there. John Stern : It is. As Andy mentioned, there's asset cap so that we have complete flexibility here on our balance sheet going forward. So if we elect to grow or want to grow, and we do want to grow in a capital-efficient manner, we will do so. What I would say, though, is that we're going to be emphasizing higher return loans and deemphasizing lower return type of assets. And I think that will manifest itself as the balance sheet churns. And in addition to that, I would just highlight that in this environment right now, the loan outlook is pretty is pretty low. The demand for loans is quite low, given a number of different reasons out there. But that gives us kind of the confidence that we have a lot -- have more time and flexibility here. Scott Siefers : Yes. Perfect. Okay. And then I think you might have touched on this in an earlier question, but maybe if you can sort of re-walk us through the sort of AOCI burn-down and cash flow expectations coming off the -- both the AFS and HTM books. And then, I think you might have given the duration of the AFS book, but do you have that for the HTM book as well? John Stern : Sure. So in terms of the AFS and HTM, we're at about -- in terms of balances, about $162 billion or so, and it's about a 50-50 mix as we mentioned on the call, in terms of AFS and HTM. So, we have about, as I mentioned, $3 billion of runoff per quarter on average just given the current interest rate environment and things of that variety. In terms of our profile, we've been able to hedge about 30% of the fixed rate portion of the AFS book. And so that's what has driven the duration of that particular book in the 3.5 -- less than 3.5 years as we have. That HTM book is principally all agency mortgage-backed securities, which have longer lives. And so, it's more in the six or so range in terms of the duration of that book. Operator : And next, we'll go to Erika Najarian with UBS. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Andy, my first question is for you. Specifically yesterday's announcement is a big win for the Company. And as we think about combining that relief with a generally tighter regulatory environment, what CET1 are you looking at -- and what level are you looking at in terms of, okay, now I'm at the right level, this is now my target in the new world. And now in an environment where balance sheet growth is minimal at best, right, I can now return capital back to shareholders through buybacks. I guess I'm just wondering because there's printed -- your GAAP CET1, there's the adjusted that John gave, right? But then you only have to take into account 25% of that 250 by July 1, 2025, if we get to a final date by then. So, there's a lot of moving pieces. So as your investors think about all the parts that you've made plus this relief, what is your new target? Is that transitional or fully phased in? And what's the bogey that investors could look forward to that you would hit before returning capital through buybacks? Andy Cecere : Yes, Erika, understand the question. And first of all, I just want to highlight, we're back to 9 7, which is where we started before the deal and we're able to build. We went from 9 7 to 8 4 and build 130 basis points in basically less than a year, which I thought was a great effort across the Company. In terms of what our new target is, short-term target is to continue to build, as we talked about. Remember, there's two sets of rules that are yet to be finalized and coming down. Number one, are the Basel III end game finalization of rules, which will, in one shape -- one way shape or form increased capital levels. And the second is clarity on CCAR. We'll set those targets once we have clarity on those two items. Erika Najarian : And so just to follow up here. At least until June 2024 CCAR results, regardless of how quickly you build the capital, either on an adjusted or on a GAAP basis, you're going to continue to be at pause on the buyback until at least the until we see the CCAR and the SEB? Andy Cecere : That's my expectation, Erika. We want clarity on the finalization of the Basel III and the CCAR importantly. So, we'll be continuing to build capital and determine our capital targets and buffers and all that activity once we have more clear clarity in the finalization of the rules. Erika Najarian : Got it. That's very clear. And just one more for John, if I may. In terms of the net interest income trajectory, I think the fourth quarter is good news, especially relative to what we thought two days ago, which would be more RWA mitigation. As we think about the RWA mitigation ahead that's less impactful to EPS, should we think about it similar to what we saw early in the year in terms of securitization? Are you more actively -- are you going to continue to use credit linked notes, which I assume has cost you 12.5% or so of the pool, plus SOFR and the spread. And as we think about those dynamics, do you feel like you have to warehouse more liquidity as we anticipate LCR rules for regional banks? Because we're also hearing that there could be pretty significant haircuts on how they're thinking about HTM as HQLA. John Stern : Sure. Erika, so maybe I'll start with your point. On LCR, we will -- in addition to what Andy said on the capital side, we're going to have to wait and see what it is on the liquidity side in terms of any potential changes that come out of LCR. We feel very comfortable that we'll be able to achieve whatever that change is and feel that we'll be able to achieve that whatever that scenario is we'll work into it. In terms of -- you talked about the net interest income. We feel like it's -- again, just to kind of reiterate, we are looking for that to bottom at this particular point in time in the fourth quarter. And where it kind of goes from there post -- will depend in part of interest rates. Erika Najarian : Got it. And congratulations on the release of commitments. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Erika. Operator : And next, we'll go to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Andy, obviously, U.S. Bancorp has developed a reputation of being a strong underwriter and we talked about this in the past with you folks. And I was wondering if you could frame out the environment because every bank is talking about credit normalization as you guys did because we had such great numbers coming out of the pandemic on credit. And if you just exclude for a moment the economy because obviously, none of us can control that, but I'd really be interested in what you guys are seeing from a competitive standpoint in terms of underwriting. And if you could compare it to past cycles, obviously, we've been around for a few cycles and can't compare. But I'm curious, from your guy's vantage point, is it as risky today as it may have been in '05, '06 or '99, 2000. Any color there that you can share with us? Andy Cecere : Let me give you the big picture, and I'm going to ask Terry to highlight some specifics. I would say the consumer is entering this cycle in very strong shape from a balance standpoint, from the perspective of savings accounts that they have, the spend activity, I think they're all starting to normalize, but normalized to a pre-pandemic what I'd say, normal level. The companies and small businesses are also in very good shape. The one area that we're all very focused on is commercial real estate office, which is one of the areas that we increased our reserve to. As you know, it's at 10% in this quarter. So maybe, Terry, you can give some specifics. Terry Dolan : Yes. And what I would add to that, Gerard, as you know, when we think about underwriting, we really underwrite through a cycle. We try to take into consideration in the stress from an underwriting perspective, what could happen in terms of rising interest rates or other economic factors that could come into play. So, we haven't adjusted our underwriting standards a lot. We have been thinking about this particular cycle. I do think that when you end up looking at the industry, I think there is some tightening that's going out there. Certainly, from a competitive standpoint, we are seeing that to some extent. But we feel like we're in pretty good shape. If you end up looking at our situation, as Andy said, probably the area that we're monitoring the most is commercial real estate office space specifically. We have a reserve that's about 10% of the overall balance there. We have been increasing that, and we're likely to continue to increase that because that's going to be a pressure point. But we're starting from -- if you think about the overall portfolio, we're starting at fairly low points. Our non-accrual loans is only 35 basis points of total loans. Our allowance is strong at 208. Delinquencies are still at relatively low levels although increasing. And our expectation as we go into 2024 is that that normalization will continue. Delinquencies will continue to kind of move up and nonperforming assets will continue to move up. But I think we're in a really good position in terms of the allowance coverage that we have, and we feel pretty good about that. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Good to hear your voice, Terry. Just to follow up on what you were saying from a competitive standpoint, do you sense -- the extreme, of course, was '05, '06 when all of the crazy lending is being done by some banks, but also the nonbanks. When you guys look at the nonbank competitors, are there rogue players out there that are just doing crazy things so that the second derivative impacts the banks, not because any of the banks, yourself included, made a poor underwriting decision, but it was the competitors that really did something foolish and now the banks are suffering a bit? Or again, not like '06, I'm not suggesting we're there, but just from a comparison standpoint. Terry Dolan : I think both in the bank and in the nonbank space, I think that people are being fairly rational. Part of the issue is that it's maybe more so on the demand side of the equation as much as anything. I think corporate America is being relatively cautious out there. They're still waiting to see where interest rates settle in at. And until they see more certainty with respect to what the interest rate inflationary environment looks like. I think corporate America has been relatively cautious. And therefore, demand is relatively soft. But we're not seeing, what I would say crazy things either on the bank or on the nonbank side at this particular point in time. In fact, we're probably seeing -- if you end up looking at commercial real estate, probably a pullback across the board. Gerard Cassidy : Great. And then as my second follow-up question, Andy, it was obviously great news that you guys had yesterday about the release. Is there any read-through? Obviously, you sat down with the regulators to get that release and they seem to be fairly rational in their decision to make that change. There's been a lot of hope and criticism that the Basel III end game proposals are pretty darn strict. Do you think -- is there any read-through where we may actually see some rationality with the regulators and they may compare back some of those requirements? Or is that too far of a stretch? Andy Cecere : I think the regulators have asked for feedback. The banks will provide feedback, both collectively and individually. I think a lot of the feedback is good feedback because of the consequences to our customers. And I think that's the area of focus that we're going to be very pointed on in terms of our feedback. And we want to make sure that from a banking standpoint, we're able to serve our customers and the rule set will create some friction around that in certain categories, and that's where we're going to focus. And my anticipation is that the Fed will listen to our perspectives. And then that's my hope. Gerard Cassidy : I think -- go ahead. I'm sorry. Terry Dolan : I was just going to say in -- particularly it can be punitive with respect to low moderate income customer base. You see some capital rules related to renewable energy tax credits that don't make -- that seem punitive at this point in time. So, I do think there's a number of different areas where there's opportunity for adjustment. Operator : Next, we'll go to Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Shifting gears from capital, given that you made a lot of progress to just your normal business. Payments, you've talked, Andy, about wanting to grow merchant processing high -- mid- to high single digits, really more in the high single digits, and some of the others in the low double digits, like corporate payments. Any color on -- any thoughts on how you get back up there because that hasn't been the case the last couple of quarters, what you need to do or change or what would help you get that? Andy Cecere : I'm going to ask John to start then I'll add in. John Stern : Sure. So in terms of merchant processing, we have been making a number of investments over the years and continue to expect that high single digit in terms of that sort of thing. The numbers are have been have been strong this quarter, but there's normalization that has been happening. And so in the quarter -- the quarter-to-quarter here, the last several quarters, there's been a lot of the nuances coming out of the COVID and all those sorts of things. So, if you think about airline tickets and hotels and corporate T&E, those have been very strong, but they are normalizing. That said, services and retail have been strong. And so -- and the retail print that we saw yesterday was very constructive. So we feel like there's good underpinnings there in addition to the investments that we make to continue to believe and give confidence in that -- in our projections there. Andy Cecere : And I think two of those important investments, Vivek, our tech-led initiative, which is about 1/3 of our revenue base right now is tech lead from a perspective of new activity. And secondly is that what we've talked a lot about, which is this business payments ecosystem, which continues to be a top priority for the Company, because I think it's a huge opportunity for our business banking customer base as well as our commercial customer base. And then you add in what we're getting from Union Bank, I think that's why we're confident in that higher single-digit increase. Vivek Juneja : Okay. And then another key business that you mentioned, you're expanding capital markets since you're not doing your investors anymore. Any color on what you're doing there to expand that? You've always had the loan syndications and debt capital market. What else are you doing to step that up in terms of the level of revenues from that? John Stern : Sure. This is John. So, the -- we -- this is another area where we have continued to make investments in back-end systems and the frontline, and acquiring talent and all these sorts of things, and it's been a great story for us, and we continue to invest in this going forward. And along with high-grade and underwriting, there's high yield as well as what other areas that have been very strong is in the derivative market, providing interest rate. Hedging products for our clients, especially in this time where interest rates are moving around quite a bit as a service that has been highly needed. Foreign exchange has been a growing component here as well. And particularly now with Union Bank, we have more of a West Coast customer base and more foreign exchange need. In addition to some of the businesses that we work with in the Corporate Trust side, we have -- as you know, we have businesses in Europe as well. So there's always some form of foreign exchange, and so we've seen a lot of growth there. In addition to that, we've been gaining market share in the investment-grade business and high yield. Over the coming days, I think we've had an investment grade in the top 10 now in terms of market share. So that has been a business that has continued to advance slow and steady, and it's been a good item for us business for us. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And next, we'll go to Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O\u2019Connor: I was wondering -- Slide 7 that shows some of the revenue opportunities. I was wondering if you could size that. The UB deal, the revenue synergies related to the UB deal that you outlined on Slide 7, is there any way to frame how big that might be or what timeframe? Andy Cecere : It is a high priority for each of our businesses. Probably the greatest priority is that first one we highlight, which is our credit card opportunity. The payments business is a strength of U.S. Bank. Our card offering is terrific, and we've already had a penetration increase from where we started, and that continues to be a focus. And then you think about that with the business clients as well. I think it is a material impact. But we're still working through exactly the sizing and timing, and we'll continue to update on that. But it is a priority and a focus area for each of our businesses. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then separately, a little bit of a technical question, I forgot some of CFA materials. But when we look at the securities book of a duration of less than 3.5 years, but you're only burning down 25% through '25. Remind me how that math works? And does the burn-down kind of step up as we think about '26, right? Because the duration is pretty short and the burn-down is not all that much in the first couple of years. John Stern : Yes. The function of the curve really changed as the -- we saw the curve flatten out quite a bit this quarter. What I'd say on that is we have a number of securities that obviously are fixed rate that have longer durations to them or longer average lives. And so -- and then we have a number of -- with our -- the security portion of swaps, that has very, very low duration. It's three months or so because of how it's swapped the floating rate index. So in addition to that, we've -- as we've added on, some of the security book, we have about $8 billion or so of -- when we did some of the auto repack transaction in the fourth quarter of last year as well as the second quarter of this year. That is very short as well in addition to some of the floating rate securities within that book. So, that -- it's kind of more of a barbell approach, which gives you the duration of it, which just gives us a value change for a move in interest rates. But in terms of the burn-down, that will depend in part about how the shape and the type of securities that are within the book. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. That's helpful. Obviously, less relevant now given the Fed's decision, but still something we're all tracking. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Matt. John Stern : Thanks, Matt. Operator : And next, we can go to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : So just one more follow-up on the Category II news, I just want to make sure we're super clear. So this $700 billion stop being a bind forever? Or obviously, you don't have to cross on the prior potential timeframe. But to the prior question, just wondering, you said there's -- you don't have an asset cap. So does that mean that Category II is now a non-thing for U.S. Bank going forward in any time period? Or when you cross naturally, do you still get on the natural clock of having to comply? Just wondering how that fits in with the news you got yesterday. Andy Cecere : So, we're bound, Ken, by the current rule set, which is after four quarters of an average of $700 billion then you would go to Category II, or the new Basel III rule set, which is yet to be finalized, as you said. But the current rule set is what we're bound on. So $700 million still is important, but what we're seeing is given where we think asset growth will be, given our continued optimization in certain categories, given our focus on high-return businesses, we do not see that as a hurdle to growth. Ken Usdin : Understood. Okay. That's what I wanted to clarify. Andy Cecere : You bet. Operator : And with no further questions, I'll hand the call back over to George Andersen. George Andersen : Thanks Brad. Thank you, everyone, for listening to our earnings call. Please contact the Investor Relations department, if you have any follow-up questions. Operator : This does conclude the conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Following a review of the results, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 8 a.m. Central Time. I will now turn the conference call over to George Andersen, Senior Vice President and Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. Please go ahead. George Andersen : Thank you, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm joined by our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Andy Cecere; our Vice Chair and Chief Administration Officer, Terry Dolan; and our Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John Stern. With their prepared remarks, Andy and John will be referencing a slide presentation. A copy of the presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. Please note that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, our earnings release, our Form 10-K and its subsequent reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Following our prepared remarks, Andy, Terry and John will take any questions that you have. I will now turn the call over to Andy. Andy Cecere : Thanks, George. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. I'll begin on Slide 3. In the fourth quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.49, which included $0.50 per share of notable items that John will discuss in more detail. Excluding these notable items, earnings per share totaled $0.99 in the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter, on an adjusted basis, net revenue totaled $6.9 billion, and for the full year, we generated record net revenue of $28.3 billion. We demonstrated strength across our fee businesses, which helped to offset pressure on net interest income. Turning to Slide 4. Total loans were lower on a linked-quarter basis by 1.1%, reflecting slower demand, particularly in corporate lending and continued focus on lending opportunities that meet our return hurdles. Average deposits declined compared with the third quarter as our strong funding position allowed us to be more disciplined on deposit pricing while maintaining our liquidity profile. Credit quality continued to normalize towards pre-pandemic levels this quarter, and we further strengthened the balance sheet by adding $49 million to our loan loss reserve. As of December 31, tangible book value per share increased 14.7% from a year ago, and our common equity tier 1 capital ratio ended the year at 9.9%, an increase of 20 basis points this quarter. This ratio is 150 basis points higher than when we completed the acquisition of Union Bank in the fourth quarter of 2022. Supported by a strong capital accretion this year, the Board approved an increase to our quarterly common dividend in December to $0.49 per common share. Slide 5 provides key performance metrics. On an adjusted basis, we delivered 19.6% return on tangible common equity in the fourth quarter and 21.7% return on tangible common equity for the full year. Let me now turn the call over to John, who will provide more details on the quarter as well as forward-looking guidance. John Stern : Thanks, Andy. Turning to Slide 6, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.49 for the quarter, or $0.99 per share after adjusting for notable items. Notable items totaled $1.1 billion on a pre-tax basis or $780 million net of tax, representing a $0.50 reduction per diluted common share, including an FDIC special assessment charge of $734 million, offset by a benefit from tax settlements in the quarter. Other notable items this quarter included, merger and integration costs of $171 million, a charitable contribution to fund our community benefits plan of $110 million, and a balance sheet optimization charge of $118 million. This quarter, we opportunistically restructured a portion of our investment securities portfolio, which we expect will enhance our net interest income trajectory, while also strengthening our capital and liquidity positioning. Slide 7 provides a more detailed earnings summary for the quarter. Turning to Slide 8, we continue to manage the balance sheet prudently as we saw reduced loan demand this quarter and the competition for deposits remained heightened as system-wide liquidity declined. Total assets ended the year at $663 billion. Average loans declined 1.1% on a linked-quarter basis, as growth in credit card loans supported by consumer spending and low payment rates was more than offset by weaker commercial loan demand. Average deposits declined 1.9% linked quarter. Given our strong deposit balances in the third quarter, we moderated our deposit pricing somewhat in the fourth quarter even as we grew consumer deposits by 1%. During the quarter, we rebalanced a portion of our securities portfolio, which provided risk-weighted asset relief and improved our overall earnings trajectory. The average yield on total investment securities portfolio increased to 2.97% for the fourth quarter, a 55 basis point increase compared to a year earlier. As of December 31, the ending balance on the total investment securities portfolio was $161 billion. During the quarter, effective duration on the available for sale portfolio declined to less than three years as unrealized losses, net of tax, improved by approximately $2 billion given the movement in rates and repositioning. Turning to Slide 9, net interest income on a fully-taxable equivalent basis declined 3.0% linked quarter, driven by a modest decline in the net interest margin of 2.78%. The 3 basis point decline in the net interest margin reflected market dynamics including deposit pricing pressure and unfavorable shifts in the deposit mix, partially offset by better earning asset spreads and improved total funding mix. In the first quarter of 2024, we expect net interest income on a fully-taxable equivalent basis to be in the range of $4.0 billion to $4.1 billion. For the full year 2024, we expect net interest income on a fully-taxable equivalent basis to be consistent with our annualized fourth quarter 2023 net interest income level of approximately $4.14 billion to up slightly. Slide 10 highlights trends in noninterest income. Noninterest income, as adjusted, increased 12.1% on a year-over-year basis, driven by new account growth and deepening relationships across the business. Year-over-year payment service revenue benefited by continued strength in consumer and business spending activities, while increases in trust and investment management fees and commercial product revenue were driven by underlying market activity, a full fourth quarter with Union Bank, and core growth. Turning to Slide 11, noninterest expenses, as adjusted, decreased by 1.0% on a linked-quarter basis, driven by lower compensation-related expense that was partially offset by strategic investments in marketing and business development. Slide 12 highlights our credit quality performance. Asset quality metrics trended in-line with expectations, and key metrics continue to normalize toward pre-pandemic levels. Our ratio of non-performing assets to loans and other real estate was 0.40% at December 31 compared with 0.35% at September 30 and 0.26% a year ago. The fourth quarter net charge-off ratio of 0.49% increased 5 basis points from a third quarter level of 0.44% and was higher when compared to a fourth quarter 2022 level of 0.23%, as adjusted. Turning to Slide 13, we increased our common equity tier 1 ratio to 9.9% as of December 31. The combination of earnings accretion, net of distributions, and balance sheet optimization actions resulted in a 20 basis point increase linked quarter. Balance sheet optimization activities continue to have a low to neutral impact on earnings and provided additional risk transfer benefits. As we move into 2024, we expect earnings to be the primary driver of capital accretion with limited reliance on balance sheet capital-related actions. As of December 31, 2023, our common equity tier 1 capital ratio remains above our regulatory capital minimum by 290 basis points. Let me now hand it back to Andy for closing remarks. Andy Cecere : Thanks, John. I'll end my prepared comments on Slide 14. 2023 was a turbulent year for the industry. However, we achieved a great deal, including our successful conversion of Union Bank in late May and the realization of $900 million in run rate cost synergies related to Union Bank by year-end as we had targeted. Additionally, we accomplished our goal of accreting -- accelerating the accretion of CET1 capital and received full relief from Category II commitments we made in conjunction with the Union Bank transaction. Entering 2024, we are positioned to continue to deliver industry-leading returns on tangible common equity, are appropriately reserved for macroeconomic uncertainties and remain confident in our strategy for future growth and expansion. We are seeing positive momentum across our fee-based businesses as we deepen our most profitable client relationships and continue to target flat expense growth in 2024 even as we strategically invest in key areas and further execute on revenue growth opportunities with Union Bank. Let me close by thanking our employees for their continued dedication to supporting the needs of our clients, communities, and shareholders in what was a meaningful year for the company. We'll now open up the call for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Scott Siefers : Thanks, everybody. Good morning. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Scott. John Stern : Good morning. Scott Siefers : Hey. John, I was hoping you could maybe provide a little more context around the NII thoughts for the full year. It sounds like if I did the math correctly, we're expecting somewhere between $16.5 billion and $16.6 billion for the full year. Maybe just some thoughts on how the margin and NII should traject. I would presume maybe a little more downward pressure on NII given day count in the first quarter, but does it trough there and then sort of grow throughout the year, or would there be other factors that would cause NII maybe to bleed through, say, middle of the year and then start to inflect back up or maybe just any thoughts there? John Stern : Sure. Good morning, Scott. Thank you. Just -- maybe just to reiterate what was mentioned, in the first quarter, we'll see net interest income between $4.0 billion and $4.1 billion. As we think about the full year, for 2024, it's going to be consistent with our annualized fourth quarter number -- 2023 level of $4.14 billion and -- to up slightly. And we're using the fourth quarter actuals really because that -- we feel that's a more appropriate starting point given our balance sheet has now passed all the capital actions that took place during the 2023 calendar year. And so, some of the color around that and some of the drivers related to how we are thinking about that is we do believe that DDA and low cost deposit churn into higher cost deposits are going to abate over time. By the end of this quarter, we'll be nine months past the last Fed hike, as an example. We continue to see loan spreads improve in various categories, led on the commercial side of things. Loan and investment portfolio, asset churn continues to occur. Our loan pipelines have continued to strengthen over this quarter, certainly stronger than we've seen in the past couple of quarters. And we think that loan demand should be improved just given that the Fed is likely going to be in a cutting mode over time. And the counter to that, of course, is that deposit pricing is going to be competitive especially with QT running in some form in the background. So, while I'll say that first quarter NII projection is going to be slightly lower than the fourth quarter, these broad factors are really going to be supportive of NII growth as we -- especially as we think about the second half of the year. Scott Siefers : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then maybe just a quick question on capital. Glad to hear that some of those balance sheet optimization efforts are beginning to sunset. Maybe one, do you have what you all estimate the sort of fully loaded common equity tier 1 ratio to be now and maybe the balance between just building and potentially returning capital going forward? John Stern : Yeah. So I mean, right now, as you know, we're at 9.9% on CET1. With the improvement in rates, the impact of the AOCI on the investment portfolio securities is about 2.2 percentage points, and so, you're at 7.7%. As we think about that on a fully-loaded basis. So, if you think about it on a go-forward basis, we're going to create capital in the area of 20 to 25 basis points per quarter. We will have burned down on the securities book of about 30% or so relative to where it is by the end of 2025, just to give you some context. So, all that kind of adds up to building our capital to where we think it needs to be for the appropriate time given regulation and the timing of that. Scott Siefers : Okay. Perfect. All right. Thank you very much. John Stern : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Your line is open. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning. John Stern : Good morning. Ebrahim Poonawala : Just maybe, John, following up on the NII question. One, sorry if I missed it, what rate cut the assumptions did you have in your NII outlook? And then just talk to us about sensitivity. Are three cuts worse than six cuts? Just how we should -- given market expectations around this probably is going to change week by week. I'm just trying to test the resiliency of your NII outlook if we get more or less rate cuts. John Stern : Sure. Absolutely. So, in terms of our current projections, we have four interest rate cuts by the Fed starting in the second quarter of this year. Now, whether or not that's two cuts or six cuts, it's not going to be a material driver to our outlook. We have worked hard to get our net interest income sensitivity to be more or less in a neutral position. And so, we feel like whether the cuts are -- how they are positioned are not going to be a material driver to the change of the outlook, excuse me. Ebrahim Poonawala : That's helpful. And I guess just a second question. I'm not sure if you laid out any outlook for fee revenue growth for the year in terms of -- if you can just talk to in terms of what you expect overall in fee revenues? And particularly on payments, if you can call out expectations on what you assume for the year there? Thank you. John Stern : Sure. Yeah, I'll call a couple of things on payments and some of the other fee categories. So, as we think about payments, certainly, in terms of merchant processing, we've put a lot of investment in there. There's a lot of technology-led advancements that we've made in terms of connections and certainly some MUB synergies. And so, we continue to expect high-single digits in terms of revenue growth there. The same would be said for corporate payments, we think high-single digits, given the amount of T&E growth and client growth and all that sort of thing that we see. And then, on the card side of things, we've seen a very nice margin expansion. MUB certainly helps. And holiday sales have been -- were certainly helpful this past quarter, but we see that extending, and so we think mid-single digits from that standpoint. I would also reiterate, we've had really very nice growth in the commercial product side. We've had -- particularly in 2023. We would expect high-single digits there, given strength we've had in foreign exchange, derivatives, the fixed income, capital markets, loan syndication has all been performing very well for us. Our trust investment management fee also should experience growth led by our institutional service businesses and Corporate Trust and Fund Services, and certainly in wealth management, some of the fees associated with that. But one thing I would point out though in terms of service charges, we have exited our ATM cash servicing business and that was a business we decided to exit just given the high level of capital related to it in terms of intensity and investment. And so, that will impact us by about $30 million to $35 million per quarter, starting in the first quarter. Ebrahim Poonawala : Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. John Pancari : Good morning. John Stern : Good morning. John Pancari : John, thanks for the colors so far on the guidance. I guess similarly, can you walk through your -- within the NII expectations you provided, can you walk through your expectation for loan growth for the year and how you expect that could traject? I know your side of demand weakening. And then the same thing on the deposit front, you can maybe give us your expectation of how you think growth can look like on an overall basis and maybe how the NIB, the noninterest-bearing mix could traject from here? Thanks. John Stern : Sure. So, a couple of things there. So, I'll start on the loan growth side. I do believe our expectation is that we will see growth in the commercial side. Of course, that was a little bit weaker this last quarter as we experienced pay downs, particularly as clients were accessing capital markets and things of that nature. But we've seen really a good pipeline build in that. We expect utilization to pick up and things of that variety. So, we feel like that, along with credit cards, will be good sources of growth for us, as we think about loan growth going forward. On the deposit side, as a reminder, we'll probably be lower in the first quarter. We seasonally lose deposits just as we kind of go through the year-end process and just given the mix of our businesses, deposits end up being a little bit lower in the first quarter, but then we see more or less stabilization. But there might be some headwind there, particularly depending on QT and how the Fed draining of liquidity out of the system will impact the numbers there. And then, going into your NIB comment, we've seen, of course, rotation out of NIB into other interest-bearing products. That continues but starts to wane as we go throughout the year. And again, as I mentioned, we're going to be nine months by the end of this quarter past the last Fed hike, and that gives us some signal that that will begin to abate. John Pancari : Great. Okay. Thank you for that. And then, I guess, if you could help us just think about how we should think about the magnitude of operating leverage that's reasonable as you look at next year? I know we do have some color on how you're thinking about NII and fees and then put that against your efforts to keep expenses stable, but I guess, could you just maybe frame it the range of operating leverage that you think is reasonable as we look at the next year? Andy Cecere : Good morning, John. This is Andy. So, let me start with this and John can add on. So, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're going to benefit from the cost efficiencies of the Union deal to total $900 million, and that is fully reflected now and into the run rate starting this quarter. So, we're achieving those benefits because of the benefits of technology investments we've made, digital investments, operational investments, our risk platform. And so that is the benefit of the investments we've made, and we would expect to continue to invest in the business, in those capabilities and payments and technology modernization. So, we are also very cognizant in managing expenses very closely. We still have opportunities in terms of efficiencies in personnel and operations and activities around technology that will allow us to more efficiently deliver the services we have. So, I would expect as we get towards the second half of the year that when we start to see that margin growth that John talked about as well as the fee normalization, that we would have opportunity for positive operating leverage and we're going to -- again, that is our long-term objective as always and we have levers to pull. John Pancari : Great. Thanks, Andy. Andy Cecere : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Andy Cecere : Good morning, John. John McDonald : Hi, good morning. I was wondering if you could give a little color on what you saw this quarter in credit quality, on the NPA movement, particularly in commercial. And then, also, John, maybe just some thoughts on the potential charge-off trajectory as you see things migrate from NPA into charge-offs this year, what we should be thinking about? Thank you. Terry Dolan : Yeah. Good morning, John. This is Terry Dolan. So, I'm going to take this question related to credit quality. Your first one is really related to non-performing assets and some of the things that we saw in the fourth quarter. If you end up going across the portfolio, generally pretty stable. We did see a couple of idiosyncratic loans that went into non-performing status. Both of those were kind of Union legacy sort of credits, so continue to kind of work through that. But I would also say that both of those are fairly well collateralized. So, we don't necessarily see a lot of charge-off content related to those idiosyncratic credits. When we look at net charge-offs and the trajectory, I would expect that -- we would expect that it will continue to kind of normalize. Credit card is kind of getting closer to pre-pandemic levels, but that will continue to move up a little bit. Our expectation is that for full year 2024, we'll probably be in kind of in the mid-50s in terms of the net charge-off rate. John McDonald : Okay. Thanks, Terry. And then, John or Andy, just on the fee revenues, John ticked off on the fee revenues, a number of high-single digit kind of potential growers in '24. How do we think about kind of the ability to grow total fee revenues and what kind of base should we use for that? It looks like maybe the adjusted base for '23 was about $10.8 billion of fee revenues. Is that something you can grow off of that? Just trying to contextualize. Total revenue last year was around $28 billion. How should we think about the ability to grow revenues on fees and maybe total revenues this year? John Stern : Yeah. So I mean, we had, as you mentioned, some of the fee numbers there. From a core fee perspective, we do expect to grow. I ticked off some of the areas in terms of payments, commercial products, trust and all sort of thing. Other -- and some of the service charges components there. Of course, in terms of mortgage, that will be probably somewhat in the flat range. And in terms of other, we had a little bit of a high number in terms of the fourth quarter related to tax credit, related impact finance, syndication fees and things like that. So, all those things in, we expect kind of that mid-single in terms of the fee components going forward for this year. John McDonald : Okay. Kind of a mid-single from that 10.8 adjusted base? John Stern : Hmm. John McDonald : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of UBS. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Erika. Erika Najarian : Good morning. My first question is for you, Andy. Clearly, you went through it in terms of some capital consternation in 2023. And now you're sitting here with 9.9% CET1. No longer have to be a Category II bank early, and all the color that we're getting from Washington is that Basel III endgame will be at least delayed, if not soften significantly. As you think about maybe just one more hurdle ahead over the near term in terms of the DFAST, how are you thinking about where U.S.-based proper CET1 ratio is in terms of the minimum looking forward to a future where maybe capital is a little bit tighter, but you're also growing? And do you feel like you're now on offense and all the sort of the balance sheet management that was designed to optimize capital is fully behind you? Andy Cecere : Yeah, Erika, as John mentioned, I think our balance sheet optimization efforts are behind us. Our focus on capital accretion will be from earnings as we go into 2024 and forward. As we talked about, we are at a 9.9% CET1 ratio today. A couple of years ago, our target was between 8.5% and 9%. So, we're above that target. But we're also cognizant of the rules that are coming, both from the perspective of Basel III endgame, which is still uncertain, as you talked about, as well as CCAR and how that will evolve over time. So, we will continue to accrete the 20 to 25. We'll continue to burn down the AOCI. When we get clarity on the capital rules, both Basel III and CCAR, we'll then determine what the proper capital target will be. My expectation is we'll be above the 9% that we were a few years ago. But we'll define that, refine that, and then we'll get into what the math is around buybacks at that time. Erika Najarian : Got it. And one follow-up question for you, John. Thank you for giving us some of the components of the NII. I'm just wondering, as you mentioned QT, are you generally expecting deposits to be down -- total deposits to be down even if DDA mix shift abates? And also, how quickly do you think the deposit betas on the way down can react to each Fed rate cut? John Stern : Sure. In terms of -- the first part of your question in terms of QT, we do anticipate QT to be throughout the year. And so that's going to, on whole, put pressure on deposits throughout the year in terms of balances. And so, we don't expect a lot of growth overall in deposits, but we'll -- we have ways to manage through that. Of course, they're talking through various ways to change the QT, but that just remains to be seen. In terms of deposits performance on the way down, I anticipate commercial and wholesale type balances will go down just as fast as they would come up. On the retail side, it's going to be more of an arc. It'll take some time for that to turn. But those are our expectations. Erika Najarian : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. John Stern : Hey, good morning, Mike. Mike Mayo : Hi. So, I wasn't clear, are you guiding for flat, positive or negative operating leverage or none of the above for 2024? And more generally, I mean, the real question is, when do you get back to your historical efficiency ratio? I think you talked about this at a presentation in December. I mean, 61% core efficiency in the fourth quarter isn't exactly like legacy U.S. Bancorp, and that's up 300 basis points year-over-year. And earlier last decade, you were 55%. Going back further, you were the low 50%s. Is that just the aspirational target now? Or is that a real target over the next two years or so? And along those lines, I guess, you have all the savings you're going to get from Union Bank. So, where does the risk come from here? Andy Cecere : Yeah, Mike, it's probably more likely a positive operating leverage in the second half of '24 versus the first half given some of the margin pressures that we talked about. That is still our objective. My expectation is, once we get more to our normalized revenue level, that we will continue to manage expenses below revenue growth and continue to take down that efficiency ratios into the 50%s. That's the way we're planning. Mike Mayo : When you say into the 50%s, I mean, is it something -- can you get back to 55%? Is that in your planning horizon, even going out a few more years? And it looks like the payments business is recatching its stride here. And along those lines, I didn't see the slide anymore on the payments business combined with small business banking. You're going to grow small business relationship like 15% to 20% and the revenues by 25% to 30%. I don't see any slide for that. And I know you got -- look, you got Union Bank deal, you had the issues of last March and April, and it's okay. Your capital is back, the deal is done, and now we're back to kind of U.S. Bancorp business as usual. So, I'm just trying to look for some color on that if you're going to become the square of banking or if that's still a goal, and how those revenues might help you improve that efficiency? Andy Cecere : Sure, Mike. And it is still a goal. We do think this combination of payments and business banking and providing that comprehensive product set and capabilities to help people run their business is a key strategic priority, it continues to be. And I think the B categories that John mentioned are also a key driver of revenue, including payments, commercial products, trust and investment, and those are all areas that we expect continued growth on. The immediate pressure on net interest income is what's causing us not to get positive operating leverage in the short term. But it is something that I believe, and as John mentioned, will abate and start to grow into the second half of 2024. And so, I think we're going to get to the positive operating leverage. We are planning on it. And we will continue to drive that efficiency ratio down certainly into the 50% -- high 50%s at the beginning and continue to deliver positive operating leverage to get it even lower. That's our objective. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Matt. Matt O'Connor: Hi, good morning. Just to clarify, the flat expense guidance for '24 is also the adjusted level of '23 of 17.0? Andy Cecere : That's correct. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And I assume that includes any expense benefit from the exit of the ATM cash business that you referenced earlier? Andy Cecere : Correct. John Stern : Yes. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then just stepping back, like any other kind of small businesses or segments that you're kind of reevaluating for, not so much kind of the regulatory proposals, which we'll see how they may finalize, but just other areas that you're stepping back and whether it's in mortgage, given the smaller market there, or other parts of the business portfolio that you're looking either to exit or to potentially lean into, that's a bit different than you were thinking, say, six months ago? John Stern : Well, I can start and Andy can chime in. I think we commented on the ATM business. I mean, you're constantly evaluating certain things, particularly in the light of regulatory change. Clearly, a lot of common letters have been submitted in terms of the Basel III endgame. At the end of the day, it's not going to materially drive whether we exit businesses or enter new businesses, that sort of thing. It's just going to be a combination of a continual investment, as Andy mentioned, in terms of what we need to do toward achieving positive operating leverage and managing around regulatory actions. Those are some of the comments I'd throw out there. Andy Cecere : I think I agree, John. And the only thing I'd add is that the environment and the competitive dynamic is something that causes us to be more aggressive or less aggressive in certain categories. And maybe the example I'll give you is auto lending, which is, for us is not growing right now. And that's because of the spreads and the returns are just not at our levels that we want to put on the books. So, those are areas that we're going to not get out of or close down, but just not emphasize in terms of growth at the levels of returns that we're seeing right now. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then, specifically in credit card, we're obviously seeing a normalization of losses with you guys and throughout the industry and also very strong growth. So, if we adjust losses kind of on a lag basis, they are above a few years ago. At what point do you tighten up credit card and say we should slow growth at this point in the cycle, or do you think there's still quite a bit of runway of, call it, good growth or healthy growth? Terry Dolan : Yeah. Well, I mean, it is an area, Matt, that we think that there continues to be a nice growth in that particular space. It is an area, though, that certainly as we have looked at the economic uncertainties and all sorts of things, the pressure on consumers, especially given the inflationary sort of pressure. We -- on the margin around the edges, we do make adjustments to underwriting and tighten that up where we need to. But when you end up kind of thinking about the overall credit performance of credit card business, we still think it's a very nice business. We focus on prime, super prime sort of customers. And even through this cycle, I think it's going to perform very well. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Andy, and good morning, John. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Gerard. John Stern : Good morning. Gerard Cassidy : John, you touched on, in answering a question about commercial loan growth that some of your customers were accessing in capital markets and things of that nature. Can you guys share with us -- we read a lot and see a lot about the private credit markets have really become quite active and aggressive in making loans to corporate and commercial customers. Are you guys seeing that competition, number one? And also, is it any different than past years? Or has it intensified? And then, simultaneously, are any of these private -- Apollo, Blackstone, et cetera, are these customers of yours? And if they are, how do you balance the competition versus handling their needs? John Stern : Sure. This is John, Gerard. So, in terms of on the commercial side, when I comment that going to the capital markets, it's more or less the public market, so taking bond issuance in the public investment-grade market. We tend not to see them or compete on the private credit side of things. It's just not a structure or type of loan type in terms of our client base that we tend to run into. So, it's more or less -- I can't say it's increased or decreased versus -- because we just don't see those names. We compete in the commercial space with our peer banks more or less in that particular venue. In terms of -- you mentioned in terms of client interaction, we have great relationships with a number of different names in terms of investment services, capital markets activities, other sorts of categories. So, we do have some very nice relationships with those institutions. Andy Cecere : Yeah. Our Corporate Trust and Global Fund Services, Gerard, as John mentioned, businesses, they support a number of large private credit funds in the industry and, well, they are customers and clients of ours that we continue to serve. Terry Dolan : I think the last thing I would just add is that depending upon where the capital rules end up and what sort of -- where the emphasis is or isn't, you could see more or less moving into the private capital sort of markets. They tend to have more flexibility in terms of structure. They take on more risk, all sorts of things. Again, may not be where we compete. But certainly, from an industry standpoint, private credit continues to be an area of focus. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you, Terry. Just if we step back for a moment and look at beyond Basel III endgame, maybe we do get the final proposal in the middle of this year or later this year. We get through the next DFAST. U.S. Bancorp has always had a hallmark of having one of the highest ROTCEs amongst the regional banks. Obviously, you're probably going to maintain that. But you also were very disciplined in giving back the excess capital every year to shareholders in buybacks and dividends. Generally, if I recall correctly, around 75% to 80% of total earnings in a combination of both. Andy, do you see that coming on the horizon, maybe 2025, once we get all the rules that we know where you see CET1 ratio needs to be? What's your outlook there? Andy Cecere : Yeah, Gerard, we do achieve a high return on tangible common. I mentioned 19% to 20% fourth quarter versus full year '24. And as we think about going forward, I would expect us to continue to lead the pack in terms of that return, which is key to generating capital, key to returning capital. And again, once we get clarity on the rules, as I mentioned earlier, in both the Basel III endgame as well as the CCAR process, and determine our target capital levels, we will return the difference either through dividends or buybacks has been in our history. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Appreciate it. Thank you. Andy Cecere : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open. Ken Usdin : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just to follow-up on the deposit side, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about starting to moderate pricing a little bit, and you also talked about roll-off of higher-cost deposits. Just wondering if you can amplify both of those comments. So, what types of products or tweaks are you already being able to make on the deposit pricing front? And then, where did those higher cost deposits flow out of from a business perspective? Thanks. John Stern : Sure. Thanks, Ken. My -- the comment was really around in terms of the fourth quarter in just what we saw. Maybe just stepping back a bit. In the third quarter, we grew deposits quite a bit. And part of that was we were just getting through the Union Bank acquisition. We wanted to make sure we were maintaining strong relationships with those clients and really all clients as we're going through those times. In the fourth quarter, given where loan demand went and where we had a little bit of excess deposits, so we've made decisions really just tactically to go away from non-deposit -- or non-relationship or less relationship-based and specifically on time deposits declining and things of that nature. So, I think that's just going to be the ebb and flow of things of just how we manage it going forward depending on loan growth, depending on our profile and depending on the relationship. So that's really what that comment was intended for. Andy Cecere : And importantly, John, on our core consumer deposits, we are continuing to see growth there, as you mentioned, as we had in the slide. John Stern : Yeah. We continue to expect core deposit growth in the consumer side, and that has been something we've been -- the team has been very focused on, and we feel we've had great success there. Ken Usdin : Got it. And as a follow-up to the UB point, is everything from UB now fully baked, whether it's the cost actions and structure, and also that's kind of making sure you're buttoned up as a starting point, and have that base of loans and deposits gotten to a steady state as well? John Stern : Yes. Ken Usdin : Okay. So, we just move forward with everything and listen to the guide comments that you gave earlier. Okay. Got it. Thank you. John Stern : Exactly. It's all in the core now, yeah. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with HSBC. Your line is open. Saul Martinez : Hey, good morning, guys. Maybe on the payment side, if you just add a little bit more detail about how you're feeling about your payment strategy, how you're doing and how much -- how big the upside opportunity is there? Obviously, you're growing nicely on the issuing side, the merchant acquiring side, sort of mid-single-digit growth in revenues and volumes. I think you said high-single digit next year. I mean, as you guys know, the banks have ceded a lot of share to software companies, integrated service providers. And just how do you feel it's going in terms of integrating your commercial banking in payments offering? And it does seem like you have a major advantage in terms of having relationships, both on the retail and commercial side. And then, obviously, you kind of have that two-sided network that a lot of the fintechs want. But obviously, banks have struggled in this area. So, just maybe if you could just give us sort of an overview of how you're doing and how you feel the opportunity set is evolving? Andy Cecere : Yeah, Saul. So, first of all, the high-single digits on merchant processing is a function of the investments we've made and the initiatives we have underway. And I would highlight two things. Number one is our tech-led initiative, which is now up over 30% of our activities related to tech-led, so that is integrating our merchant processing capabilities into the software that people use to run their businesses. And number two is this whole integration of banking and payments that we talked about earlier. And the advantage I do believe that we have is that we are not just providing one single service. We're integrating banking services, deposit lending capabilities, treasury management, together with payments and money movement into one comprehensive offering that helps people again run their business, particularly small businesses and helps them ease into the process of payment activity in a comprehensive way together with the software they're using to run their company. So, those are the initiatives that we have underway. And that continues to be a huge focus, and one that I do think differentiates us a little bit because of the capabilities we have in payments. And that's true of merchant processing, corporate payments as well as retail issuing. Saul Martinez : Okay. Got it. That's helpful. Maybe I'll just follow-up on deposits. You mentioned the migration, you expect the migration out of noninterest-bearing deposits to sort of run its course. Just when and where do you see that? I think noninterest-bearing was about 17.5% of total deposits. How much more room is there? And just on deposit cost, I think the cumulative beta, if my calculations right, is around 49%. How much more room is there for that to increase? Sort of what's embedded in your guidance for NII? John Stern : Sure. So, in terms of the NIB, I think we've talked quite a bit about it. I would just -- I mean, we're at a certain percentage that you mentioned, and we're going to be around that area. Certainly could drift a little lower. But we are at a point where, from a core standpoint, particularly on the commercial and small business side, where you're starting to get into places, where companies have to run operating accounts. And over time, you're going to have account growth and things of that variety. So, I think they'll be conducive to supporting NIB going forward. But there will be some leftover churn, as I alluded to earlier in the call. In terms of beta, as you mentioned, 48.5% or so is our beta right now. I think it can creep up as we've kind of talked about, but it's going to depend on when the Fed cuts is going to be kind of that focus point in terms of how much it will go from here. And so, how -- what level is hard to predict, but there will be pressure until the Fed starts cutting. Saul Martinez : Okay. Got it. Thanks. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Andersen, I turn the call back over to you. George Andersen : Thanks, Sarah, and thank you for listening to our earnings call.

Following our prepared remarks, Andy, Terry and John will take any questions that you have. I will now turn the call over to Andy. Andrew Cecere : Thanks, George. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I'll begin on Slide 3. In the first quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.78, which included $0.12 per share of notable items. Excluding notables, earnings per share totaled $0.90. Our balance sheet remains strong. We are maintaining our through-the-cycle underwriting discipline and seeing the benefits of our multiyear investments in digital, technology and payments ecosystem in the form of strong fee growth across our business lines. Importantly, we continue to accrete capital this quarter. Our CET1 ratio ended the period at 10.0% and our return on tangible common equity ratio was 17.4% on an adjusted basis. Slide 4 provides additional performance metrics on both a reported and adjusted basis. On Slide 5, I'll provide some additional high-level observations for the quarter. Starting with the balance sheet. Credit quality metrics continue to develop in line with our expectations, and we achieved healthy growth in tangible book value per share on both a linked quarter and year-over-year basis. Loan and deposit growth remains under pressure for the industry, and that dynamic impacted our net interest income this quarter. Our NII on a taxable equivalent basis of approximately $4 billion was within our guidance, albeit on the lower end of the range. We are seeing good opportunities for loan growth in targeted portfolios. And notably, we continue to see consumer deposit growth despite the impact of QT on industry deposit levels. Over the past few weeks, the outlook for potential rate cuts in 2024 has meaningfully changed as long-term rates have backed up. Client behavior across the industry is adjusting in response to the potential higher-for-longer interest rate environment that has impacted our deposit mix and pressured deposit costs. As a result, we now expect our NII for the full year to be lower than anticipated. However, we are taking a closer look at our expense base given these near-term NII headwinds and plan to take actions to mitigate the impact of lower-than-expected NII to our overall profitability. John will go on to more details on these topics, but importantly, we believe this is a near-term phenomenon. Turning to Slide 6. We continue to feel good about the momentum across our differentiated fee businesses. Fee income represents about 40% of our total net revenue, which stands to position us well in a lower interest rate environment. Overall, we are encouraged by our current trends in our client growth and penetration rates, as evidenced by the continued strength we have seen across many of our fee revenue businesses this quarter. Slide 7 provides an update on our differentiated payments ecosystem. Over the past few years, we have made good progress to both expand our business banking and payments relationships and grow related revenue associated with these relationships. You may recall, we discussed an opportunity to grow small business relationships by 15% to 20% and related revenue by 25% to 30% a few years ago. As you can see on this slide, we're making good progress and see even greater opportunity to further expand these relationships and related revenue in the medium term. Let me now turn the call over to John, who will provide more detail on the quarter as well as provide forward-looking guidance. John Stern : Thanks, Andy. On Slide 8, we provide an earnings summary. This quarter, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.78 or $0.90 per share after adjusting for notable items, including the last of merger and integration costs of $155 million following our acquisition of Union Bank and $110 million related to an anticipated increase in the FDIC special assessment. Turning to Slide 9. Total average loans were $371 billion, down 0.5% linked quarter, as growth was impacted by slow industry loan demand in the current higher interest rate environment. Despite tightening monetary policy and ongoing pressure on industry-wide deposits, our total average deposits of $503 billion were stable linked quarter as we continue to see our efforts to grow consumer-related deposits materialize. End-of-period deposit growth was a little higher than we would typically see in the first quarter. Trust and corporate deposit inflows are seasonally higher at the end of the first quarter. However, the impact of holiday timing at quarter end delayed planned outflows of institutional deposits, which resulted in temporarily higher cash levels. We expect deposit outflows to move in line with more typical seasonal patterns. Importantly, we continue to proactively manage the balance sheet by prioritizing opportunities that exceeded our cost of capital and further optimized our funding mix. We continue to limit our reliance on short-term borrowings and remain disciplined on deposit rate paid as we focus on relationship-based deposits. Turning to Slide 10. Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis totaled approximately $4.0 billion, down 3.1% linked quarter. And net interest margin declined 8 basis points to 2.70%. Both net interest income and net interest margin declines were driven by continued unfavorable deposit mix shift and deposit pricing pressure as well as slower loan demand. Slide 11 highlights trends in noninterest income. Noninterest income increased 7.7% or $193 million on a year-over-year basis, driven by higher payments revenue, continued strength in underlying capital markets activity and stronger mortgage banking fees. On a linked quarter basis, noninterest income, as adjusted, decreased 1.4% or $38 million, reflective of seasonal declines in payments volume; and previously discussed impacts related to the exiting of our ATM cash provisioning business, which pressured service charges; and lower tax credit syndication fees, which impacted other revenue. Turning to Slide 12. Reported noninterest expense for the quarter totaled $4.5 billion, which included approximately $265 million of notable items. Noninterest expense, as adjusted, decreased $10 million or 0.2% on a linked-quarter basis and $117 million or 2.7% year-over-year, driven by both cost synergies with Union Bank and our continued focus on operational efficiency. Slide 13 highlights our credit quality performance. Asset quality metrics continue to develop in line with our expectations. Linked quarter, nonperforming assets increased 20%, reflecting continued stress in our commercial real estate office portfolio and one idiosyncratic commercial loan. The ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was 0.48% at March 31 compared with 0.40% at December 31 and 0.30% a year ago. Our first quarter charge-off ratio of 0.53% increased 4 basis points from a fourth quarter level of 0.49% and was higher when compared to a first quarter 2023 level of 0.3% as adjusted. Our allowance for credit losses as of March 31 totaled $7.9 billion or 2.1% of period-end loans. Turning to Slide 14. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.0% as of March 31 was reflective of a 10 basis point increase from year-end, which included 20 basis points of net capital accretion, offset by a CECL transitional impact of 10 basis points. We remain well above our regulatory capital minimum requirements. I will now provide forward-looking guidance on Slide 15. We expect net interest income for the second quarter on an FTE basis to be relatively stable with the first quarter level of approximately $4.0 billion. Full year 2024 net interest income on an FTE basis is now expected to be in the range of $16.1 billion to $16.4 billion. Our revised guidance reflects a shift in commercial client deposit behavior in a higher-for-longer rate environment and heightened competitive industry dynamics. For the full year, we continue to expect mid-single-digit growth in noninterest income. Given the pressure we are seeing on net interest income, we are reducing our expense guidance for the year. We now expect full year noninterest expense of $16.8 billion or lower, which compares to $17.0 billion in 2023. Let me now hand it back to Andy for closing remarks. Andrew Cecere : Thanks, John. We have been preparing for a wide range of economic scenarios for some time now, and we continue to deliver industry-leading returns despite the current industry stress. Our diverse business mix is allowing us to differentiate in a competitive market, and we are seeing the benefit of the investments we've made and continue to make in our digital capabilities, our technology modernization and our payments ecosystem.  The message I'd like to leave you with is that we will successfully navigate through the near-term challenges the industry is facing. But more importantly, we are well positioned for the future and continue to manage the company with a long-term lens. Let me close by recognizing the many dedicated employees for all they do to support the constituents of our national banking franchise. It is because of our exceptional talent pool that we remain poised to execute on our capital-efficient growth objectives and continue to deliver the financial performance our shareholders have come to expect. We will now open up the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Robert Siefers : Was hoping, either Andy or John, you could talk just in a little more detail about sort of the nuance in the tougher NII guide for the full year. So I guess, at an industry level, we've got a couple of dynamics at play, whether it's the challenging loan growth environment or of course the impact of higher for longer on deposit costs and betas. So maybe the main 1 or 2 kind of pressure points you saw.  And then I guess as the follow-up. It doesn't feel like there will necessarily be a lot more pressure on NII. It's just that it might not advance in the second half. Is that the best way to think about it? John Stern : Sure, Scott. Thanks for the question. So maybe just take a step back just to answer your question. In the -- in January, when we talked about our guidance, we looked at, and we expected our 2024 net interest income, to be in line with the annualized fourth quarter number given that was past MUB actions that we had taken throughout the course of the year. And so to your point, we're 1% to 3% lower than the new guidance -- with our new guidance here.  And the outlook really speaks to changes or the dynamics that we have in the economy, the interest rate environment, the dynamics in the deposit environment, those sorts of things. The conversation of course has shifted. At the beginning of the year, there was multiple cuts, now we're shifting to more higher for longer. And what we've witnessed over that time is that our client behavior, particularly in the corporate and mid-market sections, have been shifting their behavior. And clients are continuing to rotate out of low-cost deposits into higher-cost deposits. And the pace of this action is slowing. We absolutely see that. It's just not slowing as fast as what we would have anticipated. So to boil that all together, what we do see now with our guidance is that we have the second quarter net interest income will be relatively stable and we should see growth in the second half of the year. And we provided a range given that uncertainty in terms of client behavior and things of that variety. And the final thing I would just say is that we recognize this upfront and we're taking action. We are looking at our expense base and taking action and pulling some levers that we have been looking at. And so that's kind of how we think about the guidance from a big picture perspective. Andrew Cecere : Thanks, John. And Scott, I'd just add that we continue to look for opportunities to improve efficiencies, particularly in this higher-for-longer rate environment. So we benefited from the $900 million of cost takeouts from the Union Bank transaction. And we continue to focus on additional efficiencies in areas like procurement and third-party spend, our workplace management and our properties and real estate. And probably the area of greatest emphasis is operational efficiencies as we centralize our operations activities and technology investments we've made to really improve the effectiveness and efficiency in how we deliver our products and services. So that will continue to be a focus and a lens for us, and that's -- those are the actions we're taking. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess maybe just following up on NII, John, if we could drill a little bit into it. One, the securities yield went down 1 basis point sequentially. Just could you remind us of the dynamic, both in terms of the security book and fixed rate asset repricing that we should be mindful of going forward? And then noninterest-bearing deposits, I think, saw a big surge at the end of the quarter. Again, what's the right way to think about NIB balances and mix as we look forward? John Stern : Sure. So maybe I'll start with your first question on the securities yield. It was relatively flat or down 1 basis point, as you cited. This quarter was a little bit different. We had taken some hedging actions that actually offset some of the asset churn that we typically would see. And so I would view this as more of a temporary thing. I would look -- as I look forward, the typical churn that you see in asset repricing of that book. As a reminder, it's about $3 million per quarter that is rolling off at the lower level and will replace. And so that's really going to be what we're looking at kind of going forward. So I'd just look at this as an anomaly. On the deposit side, yes, we did -- I believe your question was on the surge in deposits. We did see a surge at the end of the quarter. There was a holiday in there, a lot of customers place balances with us. Very much temporary. A lot of those balances kind of hung on in and out here through tax season. And so we typically have that. It's just higher than what we would typically see for various reasons. And so we -- as we mentioned in our comments, we expect that to get to more seasonal levels. And then just your follow-on was really on the noninterest-bearing side of things. It's continued to trend down on that mix of NIB versus total deposits. We're kind of in that 17% category right now. As we're in a higher for longer, it's possible that, that continues to drift lower just based on the dynamics that we're seeing in the marketplace. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And I guess just separately around outlook for fee revenues. So your -- I think Andy addressed that in his prepared remarks, but give us a sense of any -- what areas you're seeing momentum on the fee revenue side. And whether there's any room for sort of upside surprise, if we get additional negative guide-downs on NII. John Stern : Yes, sure. So I mean, overall, we feel very -- we're pleased with the quarter 1 results. We saw good account growth. We're deepening relationships. We continue to see progress on Union and the growth opportunities that we see there. Consumer spending metrics, all the underlying metrics are strong, capital markets activities are strong. And that is supportive of our continued view on the single-digit growth on the fee aspect of things. Areas that we see growth. We particularly have seen that in the capital markets space. We had an extremely strong fixed income capital markets activity. A lot of issuance that came to market and our franchise absolutely benefited from that. Mortgage has continued to be strong in terms of -- even though applications and production has been lower on a year-over-year basis, we're actually seeing much wider spreads just given the areas that we're focusing on. And that's just a constant theme of how we're focusing on more return on equity -- or higher returns overall. And then the payments business continues to do well and be in line with our expectations. And so -- and that's just -- that helps us support the payments ecosystem that we have and all the initiatives and investments that we've made over time. So all that is very much coming together, and we feel very, very comfortable about our fee outlook. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. John McDonald : We're wondering about how are you thinking about the outlook for net charge-offs and provision and just kind of the credit trends you saw this quarter. John, you mentioned there was the one idiosyncratic commercial. Other than that, kind of what are you seeing? And are you still kind of thinking about a mid-50s kind of net charge-off outlook for this year? That would be helpful. Terrance Dolan : Yes, John, this is Terry. Let me take that question. So when we end up looking at credit, again, credit generally is pretty strong. I think that we're continuing to see in nonperforming assets that, that will continue to tick up and did tick up in the first quarter. It's primarily related to commercial real estate office space. And I think when we think about kind of the rest of the year, probably in the second quarter, it's going to tick up a bit more. But then, that growth rate is going to really moderate quite a bit. The thing to keep in mind with respect to commercial real estate office space is we've aggressively reserved for that. We feel like we've adequately covered the loss content that's in that portfolio. So even though NPAs are likely to tick up, we don't see that as a real impact from a P&L standpoint. From a charge-off point of view in the first quarter, that's principally driven by just credit cards. And our expectation is that, that will probably in the second quarter also come up. But then on a full year basis, the charge-off rate that we would expect in credit cards is probably going to move up a bit in the second quarter and then start to moderate downward again. On a full year basis, we would expect that charge-off rate to be pretty similar to the charge-off rate that we see in the first quarter of about 0.425%. John McDonald : Okay. Got it. And then for the overall company, kind of still kind of trending to that mid-50s perhaps on the charge-offs? Terrance Dolan : Yes. I would say mid-50s, maybe closer to the 60 basis points. And again, I think that it's going to be a little bit lumpy because of just timing of commercial real estate charge-offs that will occur through the year. But again, we feel like we've adequately reserved for it. John McDonald : Got it. Okay. Great. And then, Andy, how are you thinking about the expense flex? You mentioned offsetting the NII. I guess, within reason, you're going to flex the expenses depending on the revenue environment plays out through the year? Andrew Cecere : Yes, John. So it is an environment that it's always important to look at efficiencies, and we're -- that's something we're very focused on. And it is in those areas we talked about, we'll continue to flex where we see opportunities. We've centralized operations. We have other opportunities in spend. It's a company-wide initiative, and we'll continue to focus on that. Again, importantly though, I want to tell you John, that we're still investing, but we're looking at operational efficiencies as we deliver our products and services while continuing investments because the investments we've made is helping us with the efficiencies on a go-forward basis. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Andrew Cecere : Welcome back, Betsy. John Stern : Welcome back, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Thanks so much. So I had a follow-up on the comments around corporate behavior and the deposit shift from NIB. I want to understand two things. One is it should -- do you see your corporate deposits shifting from NIB to IB? Or is it more NIB to MMS? And then separately, typically, corporates are in NIB because it's compensating balances for other services. So as this shift is going on, does it suggest that we're going to see an uptick in, say for example, treasury services or any of the other fee lines? John Stern : Betsy, it's John. Thanks for that. So in terms of the behavior, I think what we're seeing is the trends are slowing. The rotation is going, maybe first to answer your question, more from NIB into more IB. And it's more of the -- it's the trade-off for the client. And what we're seeing really there is clients are just optimizing and being as -- just looking at their balance sheet, looking at their balances, especially in this higher rate environment. And now that they know it's going to be here for a longer period of time, they're taking a closer eye to it. We're just seeing that more and more. So the trends have been slowing, of that mix shift, it's just taking longer than what we would have anticipated. So in terms of compensating balances, those are the things that are on a case-by-case basis with the clients. We look at the ECR rates that we pay and customers will then make decisions based on that. And so those are kind of the trade-offs that we see relative to that right now. Betsy Graseck : Okay. So treasury services potentially could see a little pop up in growth as how you pay for services changes? Or is that an overreach? John Stern : It's possible. But again, the dynamic's pretty fluid is kind of how I would describe it. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And also folks are staying on your balance sheet as opposed to going off balance sheet into MMS? John Stern : That's right. Yes. A lot of this is defending clients and making sure we're there for them. Again, we view this as a temporary phenomenon. This is just a timing thing. It's really just -- the churn here is continuing. It's just being -- the pace of it is taking a little bit longer for it to stabilize than what we would have anticipated. And that's really what's going on here. We want to make sure we're here for the long run for our clients and serving them as we kind of transition through this rate environment. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay. That's super helpful. And then just kind of 30,000-foot question here. Just could you help us understand how you are currently thinking about the asset sensitivity of U.S. Bancorp at this stage? How should we think about what higher for longer means for you for the whole organization? John Stern : Yes, sure. So I think in terms of asset sensitivity from a risk management perspective, we are as neutral as you can be. We've taken a lot of different actions to make sure -- because we just don't know where the rate environment is. I mean, it was 7 cuts at the beginning of the year, the market had. Now it's closer to 0. So we just want to make sure we are prepared for different type of rate environments. And so I think as we think about the asset sensitivity, that is really how we're positioning ourselves. As we think about higher for longer and what that means, the drivers there are going to be clearly deposit betas and rate and paid and all that sort of thing may creep up. The offset to that is we're going to have asset churn on the loan side as well as the investment portfolio side. And over time, those things will offset and turn ultimately in our favor. But it's going to be that timing that's really going to matter in terms of what do those things move and shift over time. Andrew Cecere : So Betsy, as John said -- this is Andy. We've tried to narrow the corridor of volatility given the uncertainty in the outlook. And so we are about as neutral as we can be given all the puts and takes John talked about. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Kenneth Usdin : If I could ask a couple of questions on the fee side. One, can we just talk a little bit through the payments businesses? It looks like the overall year-over-year growth rate was 4%. I think you're aspiring for upper single digits. It looks like corporate was down year-over-year and maybe the rate in merchant slowed a little bit. So can you just talk us through some of those dynamics and then how you'd expect that traject going forward? John Stern : Sure. Yes. I think -- thanks, Ken. I appreciate that. We can look at -- maybe I'll take them in order. Merchant was kind of in that 4% area, as you mentioned, on the fee side of things. On that side, this quarter, we saw travel being a little bit down, but the other underlying metrics really have strong growth. We saw our tech-led initiatives really continue to propel very nicely. We saw high single digit for virtually other -- all the other categories in that space. So we think that travel is just kind of a short-term nature thing here, and we're well positioned and continue to feel good about high single digits there. On the corporate side -- the corporate payment side, as you mentioned, that is -- it was negative over this year-over-year basis, but we are lapping the freight weight that has happened over the past year and that will really churn. There might be a little bit more than that in the second quarter. But we see strong momentum as we look -- again, the fundamentals of business spend and things like that are continuing to be in case. So we feel good about high single digits. And then on the card side, really strong fee growth, good spreads, payment rates -- payment, spend trends constructive for how we're thinking about it. So all that -- we feel good about all the underlying trends from a payment standpoint. Kenneth Usdin : Okay. Got it. And then just in terms of some of the other lines, corporate services and mortgage did a lot better. I think you mentioned DCM and corporate and better gain on sale. Just wondering, are those both sustainable? Or was there any pull-forward on both of those areas this quarter? John Stern : I think it is. I think the underlying strength maybe had a little bit of positivity here in the first quarter. But underlying all that, I think the gain on sale in the markets that we're playing is legitimate. Even though the market has been slower from an application standpoint, a production standpoint, it's still kind of double digit, almost 20% down from year-over-year. So there's just -- there's a lot of -- the volumes are lower, but the spreads are wider, and we anticipate that to continue going forward. Kenneth Usdin : Okay. Great. And last cleanup one. Just the ATM business, it didn't look like service charges changed. Did that close at -- and I know it's not a net profit. I know it's neutral net profit, but can you just update us on that? John Stern : Yes. There was some of that in this quarter, and so they'll kind of fully run off here in the second quarter. Kenneth Usdin : With an offsetting cost? John Stern : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Michael Mayo : Another one on net interest income. Andy used the word temporary in your opening remarks when talking about either the decline or the worst guide. And I didn't know what you meant by temporary. Andrew Cecere : So what we're saying, Mike, is that this pressure that, as John described, we believe, is going to dissipate and has dissipated. It's just dissipating slower than we thought. And we expect a relatively stable into the second quarter and then growth in the back half of '24. So that's what I meant by temporary. Michael Mayo : Do you have any expectations for 2025 and where the floor is for noninterest-bearing deposits? Or any other color? Andrew Cecere : So I would expect that '25 would continue the momentum that we see in the second half of '24. We're not going to give a '25 guide right now because it's so volatile in terms of what rates could be. But importantly, Mike, we see the second half of '24, even in a lower rate cut environment and higher for longer, to start to go up. Michael Mayo : And I know I've asked this before, but it still applies, I think. So the big picture here is you got $900 million of savings from the Union Bank acquisition. So that's good for the expenses. The revenues you highlighted in your slide, business banking is up 1/3 over 3 years in terms of revenues. And relationships, you have mortgage, you have capital markets, you have payments. The revenues are working, the expenses are working. And then we look at the efficiency ratio for this quarter and the core number is like around 62% for a company that for so long had an efficiency ratio under 60%. Now I know you're investing a lot nationally. We heard that at the BAAB conference, but it's just like when do you get under 60%? And I get the NII effect that distorts things, but you do have some peers that are under 60% now. So how should we think about efficiency at U.S. Bancorp? Andrew Cecere : Yes, Mike, that's why we're pulling these expense levers and looking at continuing to create efficiency. So I feel very positive about our fee categories. We have a diversified set of businesses, a lot of businesses that other banks don't have, like payments and commercial products, fund services, corporate trust, that helps us drive fee revenue. That's the strength that we talked about, that 7.7%. There are some headwinds on margin for the industry and for ourselves. We'll get past those headwinds, and we'll continue to operate efficiently and look for expense levers to get that efficiency ratio downward, and that's an objective of ours. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. John Pancari : On the deposit growth in the quarter, the surge in growth you saw at the end of period, can you maybe size up the impact that was more seasonal and more tied to the holiday dynamic and how much that could pull back? And then separately, also on the -- on your NII commentary, you did mention the competitive landscape shifting. Is that just regarding the deposit mix and pricing? Or are you also seeing some competitive dynamic impacting you on the loan front? John Stern : John, thanks. Maybe to answer your second question first. It's more of the deposit mix and rate paid. It's not necessarily the loan side. I think actually on the loan side, we see -- even though loans are soft at this point, we do see decent momentum on the commercial side. We saw good period-end growth there. Spreads are good. The asset churn is positive all there. I think it's just -- again, it's back on the deposit side of things in the mix. And I would say even on the mix, I would say on the commercial side, it's just a rotational thing. The rates environment really hasn't changed in the commercial side. On the retail side, sometimes rates go up, sometimes down, depending on geography and market and all those sorts of things. But we're competitive there, and we want to make sure that we're growing, and we have been growing. We've been growing consumer deposits, as we mentioned. Back on your first question on the deposit surge. It's probably in the area of $15 billion to $20 billion that we received. We get a lot of inflow at the end of the quarter as people prepare for outflowing payments, end of the month type payments as -- or first of the month as well as fifth of the month. And then sometimes they just hold it all the way through the tax season. That's exactly what we've seen here, is that you get this kind of surge up at the end of the quarter. It holds for the duration through tax day and then it starts to wind down. Kind of -- that's been very seasonal. It's just a bigger number than what we had typically seen. John Pancari : Okay. And then separately, on the expense efforts where you're taking a closer look, and you mentioned some of the areas, are those measures that you've taken fully reflected in that updated expense outlook of $16.8 billion for the year? Or could your efforts drive a somewhat lower number as you evaluate the opportunity? Andrew Cecere : So John, they're reflected in the efforts. That's why we brought it down to $200 million. And in the note, you'll see that's $16.8 billion at least. So we could pull additional levers as we continue to focus on this, but it is reflected in the guidance. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Just want to probe, Andy, a comment that you expect net interest income to go up in the second half of '24. Could you talk a little bit about what you see as the drivers of that? Andrew Cecere : I'm going to let John start, and I'll add on. John Stern : Yes. The driver is really, Vivek, as we talked about the -- it comes down to the deposit side of things really first and foremost. And again, we're seeing the migration and rotation slow. It's just -- again, it's just taking some time. So eventually, as that goes, that will stabilize. And then you're going to have the asset -- continual asset churn on both loans as well as investment portfolio, things like that.  I would also say that we've taken a lot of action to enhance return on equity. We're looking at capital-efficient ways to grow that. Those underlying themes continue, the Union growth opportunities that we see, and loan spreads have been favorable. So those are kind of the reasons that we see a positive nature and bend to the interest income that Andy talked about. Andrew Cecere : So as John said, it's the repricing of loans, the expectation of stabilization of the flow of deposits and the securities portfolio churn that we talked about. Vivek Juneja : And the hedge that you did, which you said was an anomaly this quarter, could you talk a little bit about that? Was that for -- that's not going to have an ongoing impact? Was that just something that you put on for capital protection? Or what was it? John Stern : Sure. Yes. So it really was more to get our asset sensitivity to be -- continue to be neutral. So those are actions that we took kind of as a onetime matter. So it's in the rate and go forward. That's why I kind of -- I called it as a temporary measure here in this quarter. Going forward, again, the driver here in investment portfolio is the $3 billion or so that's rolling off at lower yields and will be replaced at now current higher interest rates. Vivek Juneja : Got it. Because you already said you were neutral, so that's what I was trying to understand, what sort of change to make that you had to do to make it go to neutral. John Stern : Yes. Those are part of the actions that we take to get neutral. And those are the things that the team looks at on a frequent basis. We're actively managing that on a daily basis. We're looking at markets, we're taking actions, and this is just the result of that. Vivek Juneja : Okay. And is that what? Just received fixed swaps you added or terminated? Or what did you do? John Stern : Well, specifically, they were just -- they were pay-fixed swaps that we had terminated. They were shorter-dated in nature, but it reduced the yield because the pay-fixed carry was -- had been gone. But that just neutralized our interest rate sensitivity. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Gerard Cassidy : John and Andy, can you share with us -- obviously, you had a nice move up and your CET1 ratio is now at 10%. And we all know the Basel III endgame is coming. Nobody knows for certain when that final proposal will be in place. But it seems like, for the category 2 and 3 banks, that the unrealized securities losses will be carried through regulatory capital, which is not the case today, of course. So with that as a backdrop, can you update us on where you want that CET1 ratio? And historically, you guys have been so good at giving back 75% to 80% of your annual earnings in dividends and buybacks. And when do you think we could possibly get back on that kind of track? John Stern : Sure, Gerard. I'll start. First of all, just to give an update on the unrealized loss. So from a positive standpoint, part of the hedging and activities that we do that I just talked about in prior questions really help here because we had -- even though rates were up 30, 40 basis points throughout the quarter, our AOCI was fairly neutral. So the impact to the AOCI from the investment portfolio in pension right now is about 220 basis points versus the 10.0% that we have on common equity Tier 1. You're right. The Basel III endgame and all those sorts of things. That, along with, I would call CCAR results, for us, are two important milestones we need to see before we make any grand declarations on what our capital ratios will be going forward. In the meantime, we'll continue to build our capital levels. And what we'll also do is focus on our returns. Obviously, the dividend is a large priority. Additional priority is investing in the company. And so we're pausing on share repurchases at this time as we build the capital. Over time, that will normalize back to kind of where we were. But this is kind of that transitional period that we're in. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And coming back to -- stepping back for a moment. Now the Union Bank, I assume is fully integrated. Obviously, that has been your focus since that acquisition. Can you share with us your thoughts about de novo expansion? You had that expand down in the Charlotte area. Is there more to come now that, again, the acquisition is behind you? What's your thoughts there as you look out over the next 12 to 24 months? Andrew Cecere : Yes, Gerard, we're focused on building our core customer base and deepening the relationships with the customers we have through those set of products and services that we offer. We have -- we do that through a number of mechanisms. One of them is through our branch system. One of them is through our relationship managers and working together. And that de novo effort is doing well. We also have partnerships with State Farm which increase our distribution base. So we'll continue to look at all those levers, but the bottom line is that we continue to focus on more customers, deeper relationships across the diverse set of businesses that we have. And a lot of the opportunity, Gerard, is providing more services to customers who already are customers of U.S. Bank could benefit from some of the other products and services that we offer. Gerard Cassidy : And Andy, just a quick follow-up on the deepening the customer relationship that you just identified. When it comes to your middle market commercial or your core commercial account, if they only have a loan relationship versus one of your preferred accounts that have multiple relationships, that deepening you just mentioned, what kind of profit differential would you estimate there is between a customer that only has a loan versus your customer that has multiple products? Andrew Cecere : It's significantly higher. The more relationships, the higher the return, the more revenue, certainly. So if they have a loan only versus a loan plus deposit, plus treasury management, plus commercial products, plus payments, it all adds up. Gerard Cassidy : Yes. No, I agree. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matthew O'Connor: There's obviously a lot of puts and takes, like as you think about the net interest margin over time. But we've seen a number of banks put out kind of this medium-term NIM target. And wondering if you have any thoughts on what a more sustainable NIM is for you guys. You talked about the securities kind of cash flowing $3 billion. I don't know if there's any kind of underwater swaps that are chunky and roll off. But I guess the question is, what do you think about NIM kind of medium term versus where you are right now? John Stern : Yes. I'll start here. Matt, in terms of the net interest margin, it's going to obviously track net interest income over time, but it may bounce around. Some of the drivers of that, obviously, could be some of the things you just mentioned, the asset churn on the investment portfolio, the creep and -- on deposit costs and things like that. The cash levels and liquidity mix and things of that variety can also drive it as well. So we don't really have a call or a base of here's where our net interest margin. We're more focused on net interest income. Matthew O'Connor: And then are there any -- again, the securities book, you're pretty clear on the cash flow there, and I think that's fairly long duration from a cash flow perspective. Any swaps that we should be mindful of that could go either way, looking out the next couple of years? John Stern : I'm sorry, Matt, I didn't... Andrew Cecere : Swaps. So again -- go ahead. John Stern : The swap activity that we have. Yes. So just as a -- our hedging -- while we're very active in our hedging activities, we -- there's really no fundamental change. We continue to focus on pay-fixed swaps that have -- that hedge the investment portfolio. Obviously, we took some off that impacted, but it's a temporary thing. We still have well over 30% -- or well over 1/3 actually, of our risk hedged on the securities book. And then we have been adding receive-fixed swaps as well. Some of that spot, some of that forward-starting, depending on the nature. As the curve has come up here, and the curve has flattened and higher, that's an excellent opportunity for us to add some protection for the downside if and when that does occur. And all that adds up to be kind of that net neutral interest rate risk position that we're in. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with HSBC. Saul Martinez : I guess another one on NII. Your guidance does assume modest reacceleration of NII in the back end. I think the second half NII is, at the midpoint, 2% higher than the first half. But what's embedded in -- can you be more specific about what's embedded in the through the cycle deposit beta assumption? And John, you mentioned noninterest-bearing could continue to move down a little bit from 17%. How far could -- what's your best guess now as to how much more deposit migration and where that ultimately could land at? And what's sort of embedded in the guidance for those measures? John Stern : Sure, Saul. It's John. So on the beta side specifically, that has continued to slow. I think we're only up 1 or 2 points here this quarter, and was 3 the prior quarter. So it clearly has slowed. And as I mentioned, deposit rates in the commercial side are very flat. They have not changed. Retail bounces around a little bit, but we're going to be competitive and follow the market there, of course. But all in, it's -- if you're higher for longer, it's going to -- it may creep up 1 point here or 2, but we feel like the low 50s is probably the right place for it, for that to be as we kind of look forward. Saul Martinez : Okay. And in terms of noninterest bearing, the total liability or total deposits, where does... John Stern : Yes. I think that -- I think -- yes, as I mentioned a little bit on the noninterest-bearing side, we're at about 17%. It's -- customers are being more efficient and things like that. It could go down a couple of points as we stay a little bit lower -- at this higher-for-longer type period. Saul Martinez : Okay. Great. And I guess a follow-up on -- just a clarification on the deposits surge, your response to an earlier question on the deposit surge, Forgive me if I missed this, but the $15 billion to $20 billion surge, that's a normal surge in noninterest-bearing deposits? But I guess the question is, what's sort of the incremental to the normal surge? What was incremental this quarter to what you normally see? I'm just trying to get a base on which to forecast noninterest-bearing deposits going forward. John Stern : Sure. So in terms of the surge, the surge in absolute terms was like it was about $20 billion or so. It's probably $10 or so billion above and beyond what we typically see for this type of the quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Michael Mayo : Just kind of still a cleanup on NII. Just in very simple terms, if you're neutral to rates, why the guide lower for NII? I just want to make sure I have that rate. Did something happen that you didn't expect? Or you weren't fully neutral before this quarter? John Stern : Yes. Sure. Mike, it's John. So the -- yes, we are neutral, to answer your question, to shocks to interest rates. I think what we're explaining is the behavioral aspect of it, which sometimes can be a little more challenging to judge at that point in time. And so again, it's a little bit -- the pace of rotation is a little bit. It's slowing down, just not as much as what we had anticipated. So again, rate shocks moving up and down, we continue to feel very good from a neutral standpoint. It's just that behavioral aspect that we've been talking about here. Michael Mayo : And do you have a number for fixed asset repricing, say, through the end of next year? Because I think that's what's driving your higher guide for the second half of this year and into next year. So you've talked about $3 billion of securities. But by the end of next year, how much do you have in fixed assets that should reprice? Do you have like one grand number for that? John Stern : Well, I think the way I would think about it is about half of our loan book is fixed rate component. The other half is floating rate component and spreads are widening. So you can see some of the floating rate components perhaps improve over time. We're seeing decent growth in payments -- or excuse me, credit card. And so some of the mix is also working at play here. And so commercial loans are coming on. They're coming on at wider spreads. So that's kind of how I think about that from a big picture perspective. Michael Mayo : And then last one, loan spreads. I mean for a while there, it looked like we're headed into the recession and loan spreads were not widening. Now it looks like we're not having a recession and you have tight spreads in the capital markets and loan spreads are widening. I just -- why are loan spreads widening now? I guess that would be an incremental positive. John Stern : Yes. So I think it's just different markets. So I think some of the drag you're seeing in the commercial volume side is capital markets. Spreads have been -- and the access has been very good. We saw that reflected in our fixed income capital market fees and things of that variety. And so -- but I think that has taken away volume to a certain extent. In other areas where access to capital markets isn't as pronounced, I would say there has been a decent opportunity for spreads there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : John, just a quick follow-up to make sure we get this right. The surge deposits that came in, I think you mentioned you expect about $15 billion to leave. Am I -- is all of that going out of noninterest-bearing? So the $91 billion number, does that go into the mid-70s as we think about the second quarter? John Stern : Some of this is temporary. So the surge that happens, it can be a mix of both money market as well as NIB. It may surge the NIB for a brief period of time, but it's not going to be material to the quarter. So even though -- so the surge that we've been talking about can be a mix of both. Ebrahim Poonawala : Mix of both. And so you do expect, just from a very -- dollar balance standpoint, NIB staying north of $80 billion. Is that fair? John Stern : Yes. I would expect, as we said, the rotation is continuing. So I wouldn't expect growth necessarily in DDA, but deposits overall, we do expect it to basically be stable. Ebrahim Poonawala : And just a separate question. Given all these questions on NII, I think, would love to hear the degree of conservatism baked into your NII outlook. Because I guess the concern you're hearing is whether we see another downward guide 3 months from now. And yes, so in terms of what would go wrong in order for us to see another guide down on NII and for you to be surprised? John Stern : Yes, Ebrahim, I don't look at it as conservative or aggressive. It's just the range. It's just the range that we provided, just given the uncertainty that's just in the market given all the factors that we've talked about here today. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Andersen, I turn the call back over to you. George Andersen : Thank you for listening to our earnings call. Please contact the Investor Relations department if you have any follow-up questions. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 10 A.M. Central Time. I will now turn the conference call over to George Andersen, Senior Vice President and Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. George Andersen : Thank you, Krista, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Andy Cecere; Vice Chair and CAO, Terry Dolan; and Senior Executive Vice President and CFO, John Stern. Together with their prepared remarks, Andy and John will be referencing a slide presentation. A copy of the presentation, our earnings release, and supplemental analyst schedules can be found on our website at usbank.com. Please note that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risks and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, our press release, and in reports on file with the SEC. Following our prepared remarks, Andy, Terry, and John will take any questions that you have. I will now turn the call over to Andy. Andrew Cecere : Thanks, George. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I'll begin on Slide 3. In the second quarter, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.97, which included $0.01 per share of notable item related to the FDIC special assessment. Excluding this one-time charge, we delivered earnings per share of $0.98. This quarter was highlighted by an increase in net interest income, continued fee income growth, prudent expense management, credit quality stabilization, and strong capital accretion. Notably, our return on tangible common equity increased to 18.6% on an adjusted basis. Turning to Slide 4. Revenue growth for the quarter was supported by improved spread income and well -- as well as continued growth across many of our fee-based businesses. On both a linked-quarter and year-over-year basis, non-interest expense as adjusted was down benefiting from cost synergies with Union Bank, prudent expense management, and multiyear investments across the business that have resulted in greater efficiencies and enhanced operating effectiveness. As I mentioned earlier, credit quality results were in line with our expectations as we saw stabilization in delinquency rates and a modest increase in NPAs. Average total deposits increased 2.2% and we continue to see growth in consumer deposits despite industry and liquidity headwinds. As of June 30th, our tangible book value per share increased $23.15 -- to $23.15 or 2.8% better than last quarter and 10.1% higher than last year. Our CET1 capital ratio increased 30 basis points from the prior quarter and 120 basis points from last year to end the quarter at 10.3%. John will discuss some key takeaways from this year's stress test in his opening remarks. Slide 5 provides key performance metrics. Excluding notable items, our return on average assets increased to 0.98%, and return on average common equity improved to 12.6%. Our efficiency ratio also improved from the first quarter to 60.7% on an adjusted basis. Turning to Slide 6. Fee income represents just over 40% of total net revenue and benefited this quarter from high seasonal revenues across each of our payment businesses. Strong [core] (ph) growth in trust and investment management fees as well as improved treasury management revenue. Overall, diversified fee income businesses continue to operate at scale and provide earnings consistency through the cycle. And most importantly, we are encouraged by the progress we're making to deepen our most profitable client relationships, expand our product set, and enhance our distribution channels. These efforts are positioning us well for continued growth and strategic differentiation. Let me now turn the call over to John, who will provide more detail on the quarter as well as forward-looking guidance. John Stern : Thanks, Andy. If you turn to Slide 7, I'll start with a balance sheet summary followed by a discussion of second quarter earnings trends. Total average deposits increased $10.8 billion or 2.2% on a linked-quarter basis to $514 billion, driven by stable institutional deposit balances and continued consumer balance growth. Average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $1.4 billion or 1.6% on a linked-quarter basis, as we continue to emphasize stickier relationship-based deposit generation. The pace of decline in noninterest-bearing balances continued to slow this quarter. As the chart on the upper-left shows, we are prudently managing our pricing as we remained focused on retaining and growing core operational relationships across the franchise. Average total loans were $375 billion, an increase of $3.6 billion or 1.0% linked-quarter. The increase was driven by higher credit card loans from high spend -- higher spend volumes and increased commercial loans from growth in corporate banking. Loan growth this quarter was partially offset by lower commercial real estate and total other retail loans. With elevated deposit levels, we opportunistically increased the size of our investment securities portfolio with short-dated high-quality securities to better optimize cash levels. As a result, the ending balance on our investment portfolio was $168 billion as of June 30. Actions taken on the investment portfolio this quarter, together with approximately $3 billion of securities runoff resulted in an average yield increase to 3.15%, a 19 basis point increase from the prior quarter. Going forward, we would expect the balance on the investment portfolio to remain relatively flat to the current level and for the reinvestment benefit from quarterly securities runoff to be approximately 6 basis points to 8 basis points on average based on current rates. Slide 8 highlights our credit quality performance. Asset quality metrics continue to develop in line with expectations and we remain appropriately reserved for potential adverse economic conditions. In the second quarter, delinquencies were flat sequentially. Non-performing assets increased approximately 3.7% linked quarter, reflecting a slower pace of change. The ratio of non-performing assets to loans and other real estate was 49 basis points at June 30th, compared with 48 basis points at March 31st and 29 basis points a year ago. Our second quarter net charge-off ratio of 58 basis points increased 5 basis points from the first quarter, in line with our expectations and we continue to expect our net charge-off ratio to approach 60 basis points in the second half of this year. Our allowance for credit losses as of June 30th totaled $7.9 billion or 2.1% of period-end loans. Slide 9 provides a more detailed earnings summary. In the second quarter, we reported $0.97 per diluted share, which included $0.01 per share or a $26 million charge for an increase in the FDIC special assessment following last year's bank failures. Turning to Slide 10, net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis totaled approximately $4.05 billion, an increase of 0.9% on a linked-quarter basis. The increase in net interest income this quarter was driven by a combination of deposit volume growth, pricing stabilization, and slower migration as well as fixed asset repricing, improved loan mix, and other actions taken on the investment portfolio to optimize cash balances. Elevated deposit levels and higher on-balance sheet liquidity drove a 3 basis point decline in net interest margin this quarter to 2.67%. Slide 11 highlights trends in noninterest income. Fee income increased $115 million or 4.3% on a linked-quarter basis, driven by seasonally higher payments revenue and stronger mortgage banking fees, which included an approximate $30 million gain on sale of mortgage servicing rights. This increase was partially offset by a slight decrease in commercial product revenue due to lower corporate bond fees and losses on investment securities sales of $36 million. Noninterest income through the first six months of the year increased 5.4% on a year-over-year basis as we continue to benefit from deepening client relationships across our fee businesses. Turning to Slide 12, noninterest expense as adjusted, decreased $6 million or 0.1% on a linked-quarter basis. The decrease was primarily driven by lower compensation and employee benefit expense which was partially offset by higher net occupancy and equipment as well as marketing and business development costs. Year-over-year noninterest expense as adjusted decreased $71 million or 1.7% as we prudently managed expenses, identified operational efficiencies across the business, and realized synergies from the Union Bank acquisition. Turning to Slide 13. Our common equity Tier-1 ratio of 10.3% as of June 30th was reflective of a 30 basis point increase from the first quarter and a 120 basis point improvement compared to last year. On June 26, the Federal Reserve released its 2024 stress test results. Consistent with the industry, the Fed's modeled results were largely reflective of an assumption taken to significantly lower fee income and increase provision expense in stress, which resulted in a 60 basis point increase to our preliminary stress capital buffer of 3.1%. We remain well-capitalized and prepared to manage any potential industry stress that might result from a severe macroeconomic downturn. I will now provide forward-looking guidance on Slide 14, which is consistent with our previous guidance. We expect net interest income for the third quarter on an FTE basis to be relatively stable to the second quarter. Full year 2024 net interest income on an FTE basis is expected to be in the range of $16.1 billion to $16.4 billion. For the full year, we expect to achieve mid-single-digit growth in noninterest income as adjusted. We continue to expect full year noninterest expense as adjusted of $16.8 billion or lower. Let me now turn it back to Andy for closing remarks. Andrew Cecere : Thanks, John. I'll finish up on Slide 15. Second quarter results highlighted the resiliency of a business model that features a highly diversified revenue mix, strong risk management discipline, and a robust earnings and capital generation profile. We remain focused on our core competencies and are aggressively building upon our key differentiators. The investments we're making across the businesses are showing through in the form of enhanced customer acquisition, improved client experiences, and deeper relationships that are further propelling our growth story. Expense management is a key priority for us and we remain focused on our target of positive operating leverage in the second half of this year and beyond. Looking ahead, we are well-positioned to continue to build upon our solid foundation and already established interconnectedness across the business with the scale, reach and product capabilities that allow us to deliver industry-leading returns well into the future. Let me close by thanking our employees for everything they do to make us the destination of choice for many clients, communities and shareholders we serve. We'll now open up the call for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Scott Siefers : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Andrew Cecere : Good morning, Scott. Scott Siefers : Hey. John, I was hoping you could please sort of discuss the puts and takes within the NII trajectory from here. It looks like we would hopefully get a bump in the fourth quarter after a stable third quarter if we sort of assume the midpoint of the full year range. I guess maybe just a thought or two on factors that would cause you to come in either towards the high-end or the low-end of the full year range, please. John Stern : Sure, Scott, and good morning. First of all, we're pleased to see our net interest income grow, and we like the actions that we've taken to position ourselves for the future. Deposit rotation and rate paid have stabilized. Loan mix has improved. Our fixed asset repricing -- earning asset repricing continues to march on, and we've been opportunistically working with the investment portfolio to deploy excess liquidity. So, if you think about some of these things going forward, the higher and lower end of the range, I'd say a couple different things. First of all, I would just say, as I mentioned, we expect stable third quarter net interest income. And then from there, we do expect growth. We would anticipate that the pluses and minuses is going to be depending upon deposit rotation and beta. We do expect some level of rotation out of deposits going forward, but it's going to be relatively modest. And as you can tell, it's slowed. In terms of rate paid, that's going to be dependent on the market. But as you can tell, that has slowed as well. And we feel good about our positioning for rate cuts as we move forward should they occur. Our earning assets, we know are going to be formulaic and continue to reprice, whether that's the investment portfolio or the mortgage book. We expect kind of in that 6 basis point to 8 basis point range on average, given current levels. And then, loan growth, we assume to be very modest in this -- in our forecast kind of going forward just kind of given the loan dynamics that we're seeing. And then, finally, I would just say, although it's not as going to be meaningful for 2024, it's just the actions of the Fed and what they do, whether they cut or not. So, those are kind of the puts and takes as we kind of think about the next couple of quarters. Scott Siefers : Okay. Perfect. Thank you, John. And then maybe if I could ask you to delve a little more deeply into one portion of that, just you noted modest loan growth here going forward. What are you all seeing in terms of commercial loan demand? I guess, I sort of asked within the backdrop of the modest outlook, but your average commercial loan growth this quarter looked a little more favorable than what we've seen from peers. So, just curious as to sort of the insight based on that. Andrew Cecere : Sure. So, I think on loan growth, we did see pockets of loan growth occur in the corporate loan book, but I think our overall thesis really hasn't changed over the last several quarters. The loan growth environment remains tepid. It remains -- there's caution in the clients, but there's a lot of interest rate movement, and I'm sure that will -- that could spark some things. But overall, it's still a very tepid market. We just happen to find good -- some pockets of growth on the corporate loan book this quarter. Scott Siefers : Perfect. Okay, good. Thank you very much. John Stern : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning. Andrew Cecere : Good morning. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess maybe, John, just following up on the NII, by my math, like your fourth quarter could be as high as $4.3 billion. So, appreciate the puts and takes you provided earlier. As we think about the NII trajectory from here, in a rate cut scenario, just remind us, in terms of the positioning of the balance sheet, what four to six rate cuts would imply, and flex on the deposit side, given sort of your corporate institutional makeup? John Stern : Sure. Thanks, Ebrahim. So, the way I think about potential rate cut shift and change in market there is that we are well positioned, given the mix of our deposit base. So, approximately 50% of our balances are retail-based and about 50% of our balances are institutional or corporate-type balances. And in a cut environment, those institutional corporate balances, the beta, if you will, of those are going to go down as quickly as they came up. So, we feel very good about the repositioning of that. On the retail side, I would just say that there will always be some arc to the retail, so there'll be probably some repricing that occurs at the [still current] (ph) higher levels, but over time those balances will come down. And so, overall, it gives us an advantage as the curve in theory should starting to steepen and you have a lower short-term rate and a higher longer-term rate that allows for continued earning asset favorability on the repricing side of things. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And I guess just separately, when you think about the outlook for the back half on fee revenue growth, the mid single-digits, where do you think fee revenue growth is going to be driven? What categories are going to drive that growth? Where do you expect some more moderation relative to what we've seen in the first half of the year? Thank you. John Stern : Sure. I think on the fee side of things, we had a solid quarter, but we continue to expect momentum in the various categories. And it's going to be a combination of all the main ones. It's going to be payments, it's going to be our trust investment management fees, and it's going to be in the capital market space is probably the three areas that I would point you to. On the payment side of things, we continue to see strong core competencies and whether in merchant processing, you're talking about our tech-led areas, if you're talking about our corporate payments side of things, you're looking at us starting to lap some of the things in freight and fleet. And on credit, credit card, we continue to see strong spend level. So, those are all going to be positive things for us as we move forward. The trust in investment management fees as well as the capital markets continue to see very strong market backdrop. And we have been doing very well in terms of investment in those businesses and as well as just utilizing our client base and deepening relationships there in a number of different facets. And then, those are going to be kind of the tailwinds that we see that position us well for continuing our guidance here in terms of mid-single-digit growth for fees. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. Thank you. John Stern : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. John Stern : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : I know we already talked a little bit about the loan growth piece, but going through the slide deck, you highlighted that there's utilization rate increase. So, I guess, I'm just wondering this, and it's important, right, because at least you're the first institution I've seen this quarter that's had a utilization increase. Do you think that's a function of the types of industries where you're seeing utilization increase, or is that more your new geographies where perhaps more focused attention on new clients is driving that? Would just like to understand that. John Stern : Sure. Thanks, Betsy. So, in terms of utilization, it did tick up. I would say it's pretty modest and I would say it's pretty much in line with where we've seen in the past. I wouldn't point to it as some new trend that we're going to see continued utilization investment or increase. I think it's really more of a function of the loan mix that we saw this quarter. Some of the loans that were brought on came at a high utilization level versus some of the things that rolled off. So, I just think it's more of a mix shift rather than a change in trend. Betsy Graseck : Okay, thanks. And then just on the credit outlook here, I got a sense that maybe there was a little bit more credit coming through towards the back half of the year. Is that right, or did I get that wrong? John Stern : Well, I don't think -- well, first of all, our guidance really hasn't changed from a credit standpoint. It continues to be -- it's stabilizing. It's as expected. From a net charge-off perspective, we came in at 58 basis points. We would anticipate approaching 60 basis points here in the back half of the year is kind of how we're thinking about the charge-off. But things like delinquencies and non-performing, those metrics have come in -- have stabilized, and have come in very nicely, giving us confidence in our credit outlook. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And are you already reserved for these NCOs? Just wondering if there's a reserve release behind that as well. John Stern : Yeah, we feel very much appropriately reserved for the book that we have. We saw a little bit of increase in our reserve build this quarter just simply because of growth, particularly in cards and things of the like. So that's kind of what has been the driver on the reserve side. Betsy Graseck : Okay, super. Thanks so much. John Stern : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Andrew Cecere : Good morning. Erika Najarian : My first question -- good morning. First question is for you, Andy. I think what was really striking about this quarter is that the balance sheet growth was impressive on both sides of the sheet and really outperforming peers. At the same time, I think we were all surprised by the stress test results, especially given we thought that the PPNR dynamics with MUFG fully baked in would be a little bit cleaner. And so, if I'm calculating this right, your adjusted CET1 would be 8% this quarter versus 7.6%. And I'm wondering, as we think about balancing those dynamics, how are you thinking about managing growth relative to this sort of changing, unpredictable element of the SCB plus, obviously, you have done a great job at managing risk-weighted assets last year, and obviously there's a burn-off rate to the AOCI. At the same time, rates are staying a little bit higher for longer, and there's a huge debate on what's going to happen to the belly of the curve, even if everyone subscribes to Fed cuts. So, I'm wondering how we should think about balance sheet management from here, especially in light of the good growth that you experienced this quarter. Andrew Cecere : Sure. Thanks, Erika. And let me start on the CCAR results. So, as you think about MUFG, the component that we were focused on there that did happen was the expense component that came down. So, that was as expected. The component that went up versus the Fed last year was the fee income component. And we don't have a lot of clarity or transparency into why that happened. It happened for a number of banks, and it happened in spite of the fact that our fee growth is actually even positive. So that was the part that was the driver of the increased SCB for us and for a number of other banks. Let me take a step back and let me talk about capital and the balance sheet overall. As we've talked about in the past, Erika, our priorities from a capital distribution standpoint haven't changed there. First is investing in the business, second is dividends, and third is buybacks. And so, as a part of this year's stress test, as we talked about, our planned capital distribution assumed an increase to the quarterly dividend of about 2% starting in the fourth quarter. And as you saw, and as you referenced, our CET1 ratio is 10.3% this quarter. So, we continue to have strong capital accretion each quarter. We expect to be well above our fully-loaded Cat II capital targets well before the cross -- we will cross that threshold. So, from a capital standpoint, we're comfortable with our levels and our ability to accrete 20 basis points to 25 basis points a quarter. So, the one open item, as you all know, is the final Basel III endgame rules. And while we prefer to have those clarified before revising our capital and distribution targets, we will assess whatever information we have available and update on our capital distribution, our targets, as well as our return targets at Investor Day on September 12. Erika Najarian : So, Andy, just as my follow up is, based on what you've just told us, it doesn't seem as if, as we think about the rest of 2024 and the CCAR years, '24 October 1st, 24th of September 30th of next year, it doesn't sound like we should expect this similar active balance sheet management in terms of growth, as we saw in '23. Andrew Cecere : So, as we've talked about, I think most of the capital accretion going forward, Erika, will be through normal earnings accretion. And as we talked about, we expect that to be 20 basis points to 25 basis points. We had a little bit of a benefit this quarter from additional RWA optimization, but going forward, I would think about that 20 basis points to 25 basis points a quarter. Erika Najarian : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Andrew Cecere : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ken Usdin : Hey, guys. Good morning. I just wanted to ask you to dig in a little bit on the payments business. Obviously, the sequential math worked as normal, but the year-over-year growth looked like it slowed from 4% in the first quarter to 3% in the second. I know we have some easier comps coming up in the second half, but can you just kind of help us understand just the absolute trajectory within the three business areas? And how do you expect that kind of growth rate to go, aside from just comps? Thanks. John Stern : Sure. So, thanks, Ken. And I do agree, I think, we do expect momentum. Part of that is comps, but we're not, obviously, relying on that. If I kind of think about the different businesses here, maybe I'll just start with merchant processing. We have seen a very good core growth in our tech-led initiative. That's about a third of our sales now, and has been growing at a very strong rate. The margins on that business have -- we are seeing nice expansion there. And a lot of our non-travel categories are really seeing very good growth. So, those are kind of the tailwinds. We have seen some headwinds this quarter, particularly on travel volumes in Europe, but that is something that we hope that will reverse and things of that nature. But otherwise, we feel like we're positioned well on the merchant side of things. On the retail card side, credit card spend is strong and constructive. I would say, the Union Bank client acquisition, we're continuing to increase the penetration rate there, but we did see a little bit of a decrease as well, just because of risk mitigation around prepaid card, which may pressure this quarter, but may linger into a couple quarters as we move forward. But still, we think that the strong growth on the retail side of things is going to -- continue to be very helpful. And then, on the corporate side of things, we are starting to get into that inflection point of lapping freight and fleet and all those sorts of things, as well as our bank card is really performing quite well. And so, I think those are really some of the things, I think especially on corporate, we -- payments we -- by lapping that fleet kind of in the third quarter or so is going to allow for very strong rates as we think about the fourth quarter. So, at a high level, we just think that there's momentum on this side of things that will allow us to grow and grow nicely. Ken Usdin : Great. Thank you. One more follow-up on NII. You had a really good second quarter result, but the outlook for a third quarter is stable and that's with an extra day. And I'm just wondering, can you just work us through like what's the holdback in terms of NII, not just growing from here? Was there either some things that helped in the second that don't recur? It looked like your securities yields were a lot higher as one example, but I'm not sure if that would have been it. So, why don't we just see the growth straight up from that 40, 50 zone we just saw in the second quarter? Thanks. John Stern : Sure. Well, I think it just comes down to the question earlier that is really around the range of outcomes that -- what's going to drive it. And it's really going to be around the deposit behavior and things. Now we saw very good trends in terms of rotation out of DDA, that pace has certainly slowed. We continue to expect it to slow moving forward, but it doesn't mean it's over, right? And so, there is that component. On the rate-paid side of things, we're just monitoring just how the competitiveness of the deposit rates will go. And quite frankly, we don't expect a lot of deposit growth in the next quarter just simply because QT is still around and is still putting pressure on industry liquidity for us and for the market. And so, that's the primary driver is just kind of the watch of that. And on top of that, we just don't know if the Fed will cut or not. I know the market has priced that in, but that's another factor in this sort of thing. So, those would be the factors I would call out. Andrew Cecere : And John, in our projections, we've assumed two more rate cuts in September and December. John Stern : That's right. We've assumed September and December for rate cuts. That's right. Ken Usdin : Okay. Got it. Great. Thank you. John Stern : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Mike Mayo : Hi. I just think my math is wrong here. If you can help me out with that? Even assuming the four items you just mentioned for NII not going higher in the third quarter, if you could just highlight your fixed asset reprice a little bit more? Here's my math, and it's clearly wrong, because, one, you said security should reprice up 6 basis points to 8 basis points per quarter, if I heard that correctly. So, if you take 7 basis points on $168 billion of security, that'd be like $100 million extra next quarter. If you take your mortgage book of $117 billion, and you take 7 basis points on that, I wasn't sure if you meant 7 basis points on that, but then you get up to almost $200 million more for NII on a base of $4 billion. That'd be 5% growth next quarter, 5% growth the quarter after that, et cetera, et cetera. And that's not your guidance. So, first, if you could just fix my math as far as the fixed asset repricing on the securities mortgages, what I'm doing wrong, and then confirm or not those four items that you mentioned offset all of that? Thank you. John Stern : Sure, Mike. Happy to. So, I think in terms of the math, in terms of mortgage, that's going to continue, given that's a very much a fixed rate book. On the investment portfolio, given current rates, we would expect 6 basis points to 8 basis point increase. However, if we assume in our projections, as we just mentioned, that there'll be a cut in September, and about half of our book is floating rate, or swap to floating and that sort of thing. And so, that will impact the investment portfolio that way. And the deposits, of course, on the other side of that will start to shift. Of course, the institutional side would start to move right away, but the retail side will have an arc to it. And so, it's the movement of the cut within the quarter, which is sort of a part of why we anticipate a relatively stable third quarter. Mike Mayo : And just for clarification, you did intend that the mortgage book should reprice upward by 7 basis points a quarter also same as the security? John Stern : Yeah, that's right. Mortgage book is kind of that 6 basis point to 8 basis point range. Mike Mayo : And then, one more follow-up and I'll re-queue. Your noninterest-bearing deposits, you mentioned that as one of the risk factors. You said it's slowing. Can you remind us what it did between the second and first quarter? And what's your all-time low for that ratio? John Stern : On the mix of DDA to total deposits, I think, 16.2% or so is where we came in this quarter, it was 16.9% a quarter ago, it was 18% or so the quarter before that. So, that pace is changing and slowing. And in terms of where it goes, it's going to be just how clients behave and all that sort of thing, but it is an all-time low for us, for sure as we look back at our data. Andrew Cecere : And Mike there is a -- on Slide 7, there's a chart upper left that shows the migration out that has slowed. It was 7.1% in the fourth quarter, down 6.4% in the first quarter, and then slowed to 1.6% down in the first -- in the second quarter of '24. Mike Mayo : Okay. Thank you. Andrew Cecere : Sure. John Stern : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Hi, Andy. Hi, John. Andrew Cecere : Good morning, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : John, you talked about the deposits and how you will approach them as the Fed starts to cut rates. I thought it was interesting in your supplement on the average balance sheet that one of your largest deposit category, if I'm seeing it correctly, money market savings, the yield was down from the prior quarter at 3.85% versus 3.92% in the March quarter. Can you share with us what kind of strategies you used or what took that down when many of the other rates like, time deposits obviously went up in the quarter? John Stern : Sure, Gerard, no problem. So, if you look at that category, it's, as you mentioned, our largest category for deposits. So, it's a mix of wholesale as well as retail and small business and all that sort of thing. And I think what we have done is, in light of loan growth, obviously it grew a little bit, but it's not -- again, it's not growing tremendously. And so, we have the opportunity to look at our relationships across the bank and price things in an appropriate manner that makes sense for us to do. And so, we've taken some opportunities to exit some high-cost deposits and we've really utilized our distribution network, whether that's on the retail side, the branch network, our app capabilities, really taking advantage, and our partnerships really taking advantage of our national bank reach and really growing in deposits in areas that have a lower cost. And so that's kind of the positive rotation that you're seeing in that specific category. Gerard Cassidy : I got it. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but when the Fed starts to cut rates, from this line item, at least you guys could potentially benefit from lower rates and the balances continue to grow, which obviously would be beneficial. Andy, just a more bigger macro question. John touched it a little bit a moment ago about the utilization rate on the C&I loans. Can you share with us when you guys go out and talk to clients, what are they -- commercial clients, that is, what are they thinking about CapEx spending, which would enable them to draw down lines? And then second, are you seeing any increased competition from alternative lenders, whether it's private credit or other, that may be affecting the C&I loan growth? Andrew Cecere : Yeah, Gerard. I think our clients are probably a little bit more focused on defense than offense right now. We just did a CEO survey and we talked to clients. They are focused on productivity, efficiency, expense management, and the investments that they're making to the extent that they're utilizing lending activity is to really amplify some of that efficiency opportunity that they're focused on. So, a little bit more on defense. But as John mentioned, the utilization rates were up modestly in pockets across the board. And I would expect that to continue as we go forward. So, nothing significantly different from what we saw in prior quarters. The competition is strong, so both bank and non-bank competition, that's driving pricing a little bit. We're continuing to seek full relationships with appropriate returns, and that'll drive the volumes as well. Gerard Cassidy : And just as a quick follow-up on the competition, are you guys seeing more aggressive underwriting for banks that want to grow that balance sheet? How are you seeing that from the underwriting standpoint? Andrew Cecere : Yeah, I'm not sure that the underwriting is changing significantly as opposed to the pricing, Gerard. That's how I would focus on it. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. Thank you, Andy. Andrew Cecere : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. Wanted to circle back on payments. A lot of good details, kind of by segment, but was wondering if you could update kind of your thoughts on the growth you expect for full year this year. And then just still, it might be a little bit lower than what you were thinking before. And then just the medium-term outlook, if that's still the same? John Stern : Yeah. I'll answer your second question first. The medium-term outlook has not changed in terms of growth rate trajectory for the payment businesses. So, we think of high single-digit growth in terms of the merchant and corporate payments system categories. And we think of mid-single-digit growth as we get into the credit card, debit card kind of area. As I mentioned, we had 4% or so and then 3% growth this quarter, the last two quarters on a year-over-year basis. We would expect momentum as we move forward and getting and approaching those sort of medium-term levels. And some of the puts and takes I had mentioned earlier are going to be kind of the drivers of that. And, of course, whether or not we're on the higher end or lower end is going to depend upon spend levels and where that ultimately comes through, but we feel confident in terms of where the market is going and how that is. So, we feel like we're well positioned in that space. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then, what's the prepaid card risk mitigation that you referred to? Maybe I missed if you've mentioned that in the past, but can you just remind us what that is and how long it [might drive for] (ph)? Thanks. John Stern : Yeah. So, it's just more fraud and things of that variety that has picked up. And so, we just -- there's just some areas there that we want to mitigate against, and so that we've chosen to just step away from some of those sorts of things. Matt O'Connor: And then, how much of a drag is that and how long will it continue? That's my last one. Thanks. John Stern : Well, I think it's -- you saw the card growth rate was about 1% or so versus our sales area of about 4% -- 3% to 4%. So, I think there's going to be some of that pressure in the third quarter or so. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Vivek Juneja : Hi. Thanks. Andrew Cecere : Good morning. Vivek Juneja : A couple of just follow-ups. One on payments. So, trying to understand, I know you've said merchant, you expect to get to high single-digit. What's happening with the -- when I look at the volumes, merchant was only up 1.7% year-on-year, and that's the slowest volume growth we've seen in six quarters. So, why has -- despite all the tech-led initiatives, which are great, and the other areas that you're trying to spend, why is volume growth slowed so much? And then, what would cause that to turn around? John Stern : Sure. So, I can talk to that, Vivek. So, on the merchant processing side, you mentioned that the sales component was about 2% or so. In terms of where we saw some volume decreases was really had to do with travel, particularly on the European side of things. Volumes were just lower for our clients in that particular area. So that's really the focal point. I think if you think about as we start to lap some of that sort of thing and same store sales come in and that sort of thing, that's where we expect the momentum in the second half of the year. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Shifting gears, you're talking about charge-offs going to 60 basis points in the second half. Delinquencies are down, so that should help. But your C&I losses are running high. Despite the losses, NPLs are running still up. Where -- first, a two-part question there. Where in C&I are you seeing these losses, which industry sectors? And your overall charge-off rate of 60 basis points, which categories do you expect would tick that up from where you are currently given the outlook for delinquencies coming down? John Stern : Sure. So, on your two-parter, I'll take the C&I question first. First of all, the increase there in charge-off was really attributed to one unique or idiosyncratic loan that went through, and that was an NPA that we saw a couple quarters ago that worked its way through. We don't anticipate anything really in the C&I book outside of that. So that is something that -- is something that we're not concerned about. On the rest of the charge-offs, if I think about just at a big picture on credit card for, as an example, we did see a little bit of an increase in charge-offs this quarter, but given the delinquency, as you just mentioned, we would expect our charge-offs in the first or the third and fourth quarter to look more like the first quarter. And I think the balance of it will be more kind of in the commercial real estate office side of things. So that's kind of the puts and takes to the charge-off guide. Vivek Juneja : Okay. So, you had one large loan written off, but then what refilled that bucket, John, given that the NPL has actually ticked up, not down in C&I? John Stern : Well, yeah, I mean, I think it's very -- it's just very modest. It's more idiosyncratic-type loans. It's not something that we're holistically concerned about at any reach. Andrew Cecere : Vivek, as you mentioned, and as John mentioned, the delinquency levels are stable. And so that drives stabilization on credit card. The idiosyncratic loan that John mentioned, it was the second quarter. As we think about the future, I think the lumpiness will come out of CRE office and that's the one that's going to go up and down a little bit. We talked about that. We've mentioned that in prior calls. Certainly manageable, but that will just cause a little bit up and down. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Thank you. Andrew Cecere : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andrew Cecere : Hey, John. John Pancari : Good morning. Andy, I appreciate the color you gave on capital. And as you look at it, I know it sounds like you're still on the sidelines on buybacks as you walk through your priorities and the expectation for capital here, but I guess what changes that? Is it continued pull to par on the AOCI side? Is it Basel III clarity? Is it clarity on rates? What gets you to the point where you get confidence in buyback outlook, or how you're thinking about your internal CET1 target? If you could just walk us through the thought process there? Andrew Cecere : Yeah. So let's start, John, by saying that I'm very confident in our capital levels and our ability to accrete capital. It's consistent with what we've talked about, that 20 basis points to 25 basis points, and we've made great improvements, as you saw from the number, 140 basis points over the last year. So, let me start there. Second, as we talked about before, we were seeking clarity on two components : number one is CCAR, which we now have; and number two is Basel III endgame, which we're getting closer to. And my expectation, John, is that we will -- one way or the other, we'll have more clarity or not -- if not the perfect answer. We will update on both our capital targets and distribution objectives as we think about it at Investor Day on September 12. So, I'll give you a full update at that point. John Pancari : Okay, thanks. Appreciate that. And then, separately on operating leverage. I know you reiterated your confidence in achieving positive operating leverage in the second half of this year. I mean, can you help us -- I know you're not giving formal 2025 expectations, but I'm trying to think about what that positive operating leverage you're generating in the back half of that expectation, what that could mean as we look into the quarters through 2025. I mean, it looks like consensus is ballparking around 300 basis points positive operating leverage. When you look at the full year '25 expectations, you were above 200 basis points in 2022, but in the years prior, you were well below that. What's a good way to think about it medium term in terms of where USB should be operating from that standpoint? Andrew Cecere : Let me do it in components. So, first of all, as you saw this quarter, our expenses were relatively flat and we focused on the $16.8 billion or lower for the full year '24. So, we are past the point of investment in the curve on increasing expenses and now realizing the benefits from those expenses. So, I would expect us to be moderate from an expense growth standpoint going forward and managing that well. We talked about the momentum in fee growth, and I would expect that to continue given the unique businesses we have. I think the biggest difference is the headwind that was net interest income turned into a tailwind this quarter. And as we talked about stabilization in the third quarter, I think as we get into '25, that becomes more of a tailwind, and those things all drive positive operating leverage into '25. John Pancari : Okay, great. Thanks. Andrew Cecere : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Chris Kotowski : Yeah, good morning. Andrew Cecere : Hey, Chris. Chris Kotowski : Hi, it's a small item, but a curiosity to me. I mean, I noticed that your automobile loan portfolio is down by more than 30% year-over-year. And I'm just curious, how did that category suddenly become in like no-fly zone? Because you think it's short-duration assets? Do you think it would be attractive given the... John Stern : Sure, Chris. So, in terms of the drop, obviously, we haven't been as active in the auto loan market just simply because the spreads and the returns on those sorts of loans have not been at our standard. And the competitors that we're facing aren't banks and they have a different return profile in this particular environment. That doesn't mean we've exited or anything like that. In fact, we've been very strong in terms of some of the leasing and some of the other areas and we continue to monitor that market very closely. And if the spreads and returns are appropriate, we will be very active in that space just as we have been in the past. Chris Kotowski : Okay. All right. Thank you. John Stern : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with HSBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Saul Martinez : Hi. Hey, good morning, guys. John Stern : Good morning, Saul. Saul Martinez : Just a follow-up on the cards growth, 1.4% year-on-year, credit of 4.3%. I guess, John, is that entirely due to the exiting or the reducing of exposure to prepaid, or you've seen any weakness in debit as well? That would be somewhat unusual typically debit in an environment where there is an economic slowdown, tends to outperform. So, just any additional color there. And just wanted to reaffirm that this is sort of a transitory thing and you should lap this and I suspect in the fourth quarter. Is that -- did I get that right? John Stern : Yeah. I think to answer your question very simply, I mean, the difference between the fee growth and versus the sales is really all prepaid on that side of things. We see strong trends in terms of credit card spend and all the union penetration, all those things that I mentioned. Those are the things and all the different partnerships that we have, those are all still very good. It's just that it's all on the prepaid side. Saul Martinez : Okay, got it. And then just a follow-up on deposit dynamics. You've talked a few times about a slowing of the rotation. And -- but if I look at period-end noninterest-bearing, it did fall close to 5% sequentially versus much different -- much worse than or much larger sequential decline than what you see on average. Just anything there that you want to call out what drove that? Is this -- and is it something that's somewhat transitory or not? Andrew Cecere : Thanks for asking that question, because I want to point something out. We have a lot of volatility in the day-to-day NIB deposit levels principally due to our corporate trust business that has payments coming in and out on a daily basis, and depending upon where the quarter ends, the holidays, the end of the week, the end of the month, you could have volatility. So, we are very focused on the average balances and I would encourage you to do the same, because day-to-day, it could be very volatile and it does not indicate any trends. Saul Martinez : Got it. All right. Thanks very much. Andrew Cecere : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Mike Mayo : Hi. During the last quarter, there's been a few management changes, people leaving, people getting repositioned. And I think as we get ready for the September 12th Investor Day, we might look at the presenters and say, \"Wow, these are a lot different than the presenters at your last Investor Day.\" So, I'm just trying to figure out what the tea leaves are saying and maybe you can just tell us directly, Andy, in terms of what is your time horizon for remaining CEO? And I only ask that given some of these recent changes. So -- and who are the contenders to be the next CEO of U.S. Bancorp? And would you consider looking outside of U.S. Bancorp for your successor? Just a little more color on all the moves that have taken place? Thanks. Andrew Cecere : Thanks, Mike. So, as it relates to Investor Day, you're going to see some new faces for sure, but you're going to see some familiar faces as well. So, we'll have a good mix of both people that you're very familiar with as far as -- and some new. One of the things that we made a change with was putting Gunjan in the President's role. And about a year and a half ago, we combined what was then called WSIB, which is the -- or we combined to the institutional wealth group together with the corporate and commercial Group. And the synergies and the activity and the customer focus that evolved from that was just terrific. So, Gunjan has that same objective to do that with the entire bank, with the payments organization, with the consumer and business banking organization. And pulling together the leadership under one -- the businesses under one leader with the customer in the center and really taking advantage of all the diverse set of businesses that we have to really grow the business, that's the objective. And she's done a terrific job with that already. She's already started very fast to do it with the entire bank, and I'm looking forward to sharing that story on September 12th. Mike Mayo : Okay. And the departures, anything related to that? Is that... Andrew Cecere : Yeah, Mike, I would just say that's natural activity. We've had a very stable senior leadership group for years and years, and sometimes change happens, but there's no messaging in that. Mike Mayo : Okay. And so, the theme, not to front run your conference too much, is, it's One USB, so you've done more One USB with wealth and commercial and now you're looking to be One USB, deliver the whole firm to the client, that sort of simple statement that's easy to say, tough to execute? Andrew Cecere : Exactly. Mike Mayo : Okay. All right. Thank you. Andrew Cecere : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ken Usdin : Hey, thanks, guys. I just had a follow-up on the securities book. Just can you help us understand the meaningful increase that happened this quarter in the yields? And then, also, you mentioned 50% of the bond book is floating. Is that the total bond book? And then, can you help us understand how much of that book is swapped and what you do with that going forward in the -- given the rate outlook? Thanks. John Stern : Sure. So, on the securities book, in terms of the quarter, the 19 basis point increase, a majority of that was related to opportunistically taking some of the excess liquidity that we had and putting it into the securities book. And so, you can think of that as short-dated treasuries or treasury swap to floating, that sort of thing, which is the equivalent from a net interest -- or an interest-rate risk perspective versus cash is just a kind of a simple way to think about it. In terms of the book itself, I would say that I made that comment because about in terms of AFS risk and all that sort of thing, we have hedged approximately 40% or so of the risk component. And then that coupled with just natural floating rate securities that we have within the book that are already floating, that gets you to about 50% that are either floating or synthetically floating through swaps. So that's kind of the details of it. Now on the other side of that, we have put on hedges to -- put receive fixed swaps on our corporate book, so that if rates do fall, we're protected on that end as well. So, those are kind of the balances. All in, it gets us to where we want to be from an interest-rate risk standpoint, which is neutral to shocks, which is where we are today. Ken Usdin : Okay. So just -- so are you saying that gets you to around half of the total book, AFS and HTM? John Stern : Yes, that's correct. Ken Usdin : Okay, cool. And sorry, just one last one. Under $16.8 billion for cost after the second quarter result, can you just remind us what that means for the trajectory from here? And thanks again for follow-ups. John Stern : Yeah. $16.8 billion or less, that's our fee -- or excuse me, that's our expense outlook. Where we have been over the last couple of quarters is very consistent with where we're at. As Andy talked about, we've hit the -- that point on the investment curve. We continue to feel like we're in a very good spot in terms of managing expense going forward. Andrew Cecere : Thanks, Ken. Ken Usdin : Thank you. Operator : And we have no further questions in our queue at this time. Mr. Andersen, I turn the call back over to you. George Andersen : Thanks, Krista. Thanks to everyone who joined our call this morning. Please contact the Investor Relations department if you have any follow-up questions. Krista, you can now disconnect the call. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

Following a review of the results, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. This call will be recorded and be available for replay beginning today at approximately 10 :00 A.M. Central Time. I will now turn the conference call over to George Andersen, Senior Vice President and Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. George Andersen : Thank you, Ellie, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Andy Cecere; CAO, Terry Dolan; President, Gunjan Kedia; and CFO, John Stern. Together with their prepared remarks, Andy and John will be referencing a slide presentation. A copy of the presentation, our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules can be found on our website at usbank.com. Please note that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risks and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, our press release, and in reports on file with the SEC. Following our initial prepared remarks, Andy, Terry, Gunjan and John will take any questions that you have. I will now turn the call over to Andy. Andy Cecere : Thanks, George. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I'll begin on Slide 3. In the third quarter, we reported diluted earnings per share of $1.03, and generated total net revenue of $6.9 billion. The quarter was highlighted by strong growth in net interest income, good momentum across several fee business initiatives, and continued expense discipline, which supported modest, positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis compared with the third-quarter of last year. Our return on tangible common equity was 17.9% this quarter. Turning to Slide 4. Revenue growth on a linked-quarter basis was driven by improved spread income from more favorable loan mix, continued fixed asset repricing, proactive and disciplined liability management as well as strategic actions taken on our investment securities portfolio. John will provide more detail on these actions in his prepared remarks. On the upper right-hand side of the slide, you will see that non-performing assets, the net charge-off ratio, and late-stage delinquency metrics were all relatively stable compared with the second quarter levels. At September 30th, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 10.5%, an increase of 20 basis points from last quarter, driven by continued earnings accretion. Our tangible book value per share increased to $24.71, a 6.7% improvement linked-quarter and an 18.5% higher than last year. Slide 5 provides key performance metrics. This quarter, our return on average assets increased to 1.03%, the efficiency ratio improved to 60.2%, and net interest margin expanded 7 basis points to 2.74%. Turning to Slide 6, we continue to see good momentum across many of our fee businesses. This quarter, we achieved year-over-year double-digit growth in both commercial and investment products revenue, driven by underlying capital markets activity and wallet share gains across our targeted industry verticals. Additionally, we also saw good year-over-year growth in trust and investment management, payment services, mortgage banking and treasury management fee revenues as we benefited from a combination of improved underlying market conditions, deepening client relationships, an expanded product set and expanded distribution channels. Let me now turn the call over to John who'll provide more detail on the quarter as well as forward-looking guidance. John Stern : Thanks, Andy. If you turn to Slide 7, I'll start with a balance sheet summary, followed by a discussion of third quarter earnings trends. This quarter, total average deposits decreased 1.0% on a linked quarter basis to $509 billion as we continued to prioritize relationship-based deposits and maintained our pricing discipline. Average loans totaled $374 billion, a modest decrease of 0.2% on a linked quarter basis. Industry loan growth remains muted, and the decline we saw this quarter was driven by slightly lower commercial balances, given continued headwinds from capital markets-related paydowns and continued relatively low utilization rates. Within retail, higher credit card loan balances and improved revolver rates drove more favorable loan mix and margins. As Andy mentioned, this quarter, we opportunistically restructured a portion of our investment portfolio to enhance our net interest income growth trajectory and to further strengthen our capital and liquidity profiles. At September 30th, the ending balance on our investment portfolio declined slightly to $167 billion with an average yield for the quarter of 3.20%. Slide 8 highlights our credit quality performance. Asset quality metrics continued to develop in-line with our expectations and reflected ongoing macroeconomic stability. This quarter, we saw a slight reduction in our exposure to commercial real estate office portfolio, which remained appropriately reserved at 10.8%. Late-stage delinquencies and non-performing asset metrics were relatively flat on a linked quarter basis, and the ratio of non-performing assets to loans and other real estate was unchanged at 0.49% linked quarter versus 0.35% year-over-year. Our net charge-off ratio of 0.60% increased 2 basis points from a second quarter level of 0.58%, in line with our expectations. At September 30th, our allowance for credit losses totaled $7.9 billion or 2.1% of period-end loans. We expect our fourth quarter net charge-off ratio to remain relatively stable compared with the third quarter level. In the near-term, we expect changes to the loan loss reserve to be driven primarily by loan balance growth and mix. Slide 9 provides a more detailed earnings summary. In the third quarter, we reported $1.03 per diluted share, which included $119 million of net losses or $189 million after tax on-sales and securities rebalancing actions within our investment portfolio. These actions were largely offset by tax favorability in the quarter, primarily due to settlements in various tax jurisdictions. Turning to Slide 10, net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis totaled approximately $4.17 billion, an increase of 2.8% linked quarter. Our net interest margin increased 7 basis points to 2.74%. Both net interest income and net interest margin growth this quarter benefited from a combination of earning asset repricing and mix, further supported by higher card revolve rates, investment portfolio actions, and disciplined deposit pricing. Slide 11 highlights trends in non-interest income. Non-interest income totaled $2.7 billion, and as mentioned, included the $119 million of net security losses related to rebalancing activity within our investment portfolio. Importantly, year-over-year, we saw a good growth across our core business offerings, including trust and investment management, commercial products, mortgage banking and investment products. As a reminder, last quarter's mortgage banking fees included an approximately $30 million gain on-sale of mortgage servicing rights. Service charges decreased 6.2% linked quarter, partly reflecting the impact of exiting our ATM cash provisioning business. The exit is now fully reflected in our run-rate for the third quarter of 2024. Turning to Slide 12, non-interest expense for the quarter totaled $4.2 billion, which was relatively flat to the prior quarter and 1.0% lower than a year-ago as-adjusted. The linked quarter increase of $16 million or 0.4% was driven by higher compensation and employee benefit expense, primarily due to higher performance-based incentives. On a year-over-year basis, the $42 million decrease as-adjusted was driven by prudent expense management initiatives and the identification of operational efficiencies across the company. Turning to Slide 13, our common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.5% as of September 30th increased 20 basis points from the second quarter. Looking ahead, we intend to balance our continued capital accretion of 20 basis points to 25 basis points per quarter with capital distributions, starting with a modest share repurchase in the near-term. I will now provide forward-looking guidance on Slide 14. We expect net interest income for the fourth quarter on an FTE basis to be relatively stable to this quarter's $4.17 billion. This guidance is reflective of our current expectation for more modest loan growth and continued QT impacts on deposits. Full-year 2024 net interest income on an FTE basis is expected to come in at the higher-end of our $16.1 billion to $16.4 billion range. For the full-year, we still expect mid-single-digit growth in total non-interest income as adjusted, but likely at the lower end of the range. We expect full-year non-interest expense as adjusted to be $16.8 billion. I'll now hand it back to Andy for closing remarks. Andy Cecere : Thanks, John. Third quarter results showcase the resiliency of our unique and differentiated business model, which featured solid top line revenue growth, supported by healthy linked quarter margin expansion as well as continued year-over-year income momentum and steady expense discipline. This quarter, we reported modest operating leverage, excluding net securities losses in prior year notable items, and consistent with our message at Investor Day. We expect to deliver expanding positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter that will continue into 2025. As recent industry headwinds become tailwinds, and we realized the benefits of our now run-rate investment spend on industry-leading digital capabilities, integrated payment solutions, and continued technology modernization, it will be the combination of our scale, our interconnected business model, and our deep and talented management team that will allow us to capitalize on the many objectives and targets at this important inflection point in our story. As always, let me close by thanking our over 70,000 employees for their everyday commitment to our clients, communities and shareholders. We'll now open the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Scott Siefers : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Andy Cecere : Hi, Scott. Good morning. Scott Siefers : Hey. John, I guess I wanted to start with NII. So, at least, relative to what I had anticipated, it looked like it came in better than you might have thought even as recently as a month or so ago at the Investor Day. I guess just in sort of simple terms, can you walk through what in your mind ended up coming in better than you might have anticipated? John Stern : Sure, Scott, and good morning. So, a couple of factors I would say there. First, I think the remixing of our portfolio, we continue to see strength in our credit card and the revolver rate as we discussed in our opening comments. It's great to see that business has been growing at 8% year-over-year on the loan side of things. Our fixed asset repricing continues. And then the other factor I would just say is that on the -- what we didn't know was the Fed was going to cut 50 basis points and we had the ability to really price on our deposits. And so I think the combination of all those things really helped us power and see nice momentum here in the third quarter. Scott Siefers : Okay. All right. Perfect. And then if I could switch gears to fees for just a second. Just wanted to chat about the sort of the implied fourth quarter number. So even if we get to the lower-end of the full year fee guide, I guess that sort of implies that fourth quarter fees would get back up near sort of $2.8 billion, $2.9 billion level that might be more typical of one of your seasonally stronger quarters like typically, I think of you all doing best in the second quarter. Maybe if you could just sort of walk through the main puts and takes and where you would see sort of a reacceleration in momentum into the fourth quarter, please. John Stern : Sure. So I think we -- I think it's just in a number of different things. And as we discussed in our opening comments, the core business components are performing quite well. We had strong growth in Trust, 6%, commercial products was over double-digits at 12%. Mortgage had a nice year-over-year growth at 8%. And we -- if payments, while it came in at 3% or so, this quarter, we do have expectations of growth in those particular businesses in the fourth quarter. So, all that kind of leads into some momentum there from a fee standpoint side. We of course have some headwinds there that we've talked about like in our ATM, exiting our ATM business, some of the prepaid card metrics and some of the other things like that in the payments. But by -- all in all, that's what gets us and gives us confidence in our mid-single-digit growth on the fee side of things. Scott Siefers : Perfect. Okay, good. Thank you very much. John Stern : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pancari from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. John Pancari : Good morning. John Stern : Good morning. John Pancari : I know you cited the partial securities repositioning in the quarter, I wanted to see if you could give us a little bit more color on what you restructured in the quarter and the sizing of that in the yield? And then do you expect further actions on that front? And would further actions already be factored into your NII expectations? Thanks. John Stern : Sure. Thanks, John. So, in terms of the securities repositioning, we did take action on what $119 million of losses, there was -- in total, there was about $10 billion in total of notional that was transacted. But importantly for you all, I mean, it's -- we consider that more or less a two-year payback is kind of how we're thinking about it. I would call the impact to the quarter maybe around $10 million or so. So there's probably a little bit more pickup in the fourth quarter related to it. And as I think about in the future, we don't have any other of these sorts of things contemplated in our guidance or anything like that. It's just -- this was an opportunity that came up with as we saw interest rates fall quite a bit, we were able to take advantage of that and we feel good about the transaction. We're constantly looking at these things, but we don't have anything contemplated at this particular point in time. John Pancari : Okay. All right. Thank you. And then separately, on the expense side, you put up some pretty good positive operating leverage this quarter, and you implied that fourth quarter you'll see that as well. And I believe at the Investor Day, you expressed confidence in continued positive operating leverage. As you look at 2025, can you maybe help us get a sense of the magnitude of that operating leverage that you think is reasonable as you enter 2025 and longer-term, I believe The Street is looking at about 150 basis points to 200 basis points operating leverage next year. Wanted to get your thoughts on that as we look at your return profile in the coming years? Andy Cecere : Yeah. Thanks, John. This is Andy. So as you saw, we reported positive operating leverage of approximately 30 basis points in Q3 here. The guidance that John provided would indicate that our expectation for positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter of '24 will be north of 1%, and we would expect it to continue to expand from there into 2025. So, building upon that 1-plus-percent into '25, exactly where we'll get, we'll give more guidance as we get the forward-looking guidance as we think about '25 across the categories. John Pancari : Great. Very helpful, Andy. Thank you. Andy Cecere : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Betsy Graseck : Hey, good morning. Andy Cecere : Hey, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Yeah. Just to -- one follow-up on that is, in the guidance for 4Q, you indicated expenses [at total of] (ph) $16.8 billion. And I know in the past, you had been saying $16.8 billion or less. So, is there anything we should take-away from that very ever so slight guidance change? John Stern : Hey, Betsy, it's John. So, I think it's just reflective of we're in the third -- we're complete with the third quarter, we're at the fourth quarter right now. We have a very good line-of-sight in terms of where our expense base will be. And so we were just being more precise with that particular number. In addition, we saw good growth in our net interest income, and so it's kind of -- the expense was coupled in part with the net interest income. You'll recall, when we shifted our discussion points on that, and since we're at the higher-end of our range, we feel like $16.8 billion is the appropriate expense side of things this quarter. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay. Now that's helpful. And then, on the rate discussion earlier, you got the surprise 50, which you were able to pass-through onto the depositor side. So, as we're thinking about the next several quarters here, does NIM expand further as rates continue to cut-down -- come down, or is there a catch-up on the asset side that we should be skewing to? John Stern : Yeah. I think broadly speaking, rate cuts are a positive thing for us in the sense that we're able -- we have a deposit base that's conducive really to cuts. We have the ability, as you know, we have 50% of our deposit base is institutional and 50% is retail. We're able to cut institutional rates fairly quickly. And so the beta for this particular juncture was around that, I'll call it, 30% area for this particular cut, and we expect that to continue to migrate closer to or up to -- just north of 50% as we kind of get through the cycle and that sort of thing. And so that's going to be helpful. And I think the other thing is, over time, as the cuts happen, then that implies a more upward sloping curve, which should help us in our trajectory going forward as well. So, those are the two pieces that I would point to. Betsy Graseck : Right. And the 30% and 50% that's on total IB deposits or total deposits, what's your denominator? John Stern : Total IB, total interest-bearing deposits. Yeah. Betsy Graseck : Yeah. Super. Thanks so much. John Stern : You bet, Betsy. Operator : Your next question comes from Erika Najarian from UBS. Your line is now open. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Just a few follow-up questions. First, on John's previous question. Operator : Sorry, Erika, can you just -- we're having a hard time hearing you. Erika Najarian : Can you hear me better now? Andy Cecere : Yeah, that's better. Thank you. Erika Najarian : Okay. Sorry about that. Just wanted to follow-up on John's question. You mentioned $10 billion of notional was sold. Could you -- so that we can understand the impact for fourth quarter, could you tell us what the average yield was of what was sold and what you invested in? And just a follow-up to Betsy's line of questioning, you said that you saw a 30% beta and the terminal would be north of 50%. As we think about the fourth quarter, is it a sort of a smooth glide path to that 50%, do you expect it to significantly accelerate from that 30% initial beta? John Stern : Sure. So, maybe I'll just take those in pieces. The first one on the securities book, I think it was just an opportunity there to remix in a couple of different things. And it was really there to improve our liquidity profile as well as some lower-yielding securities that have seasoned to reposition those. So, it's just a number of different securities. So it's hard to just summarize it in one thing. But I would just say on the beta side of things, 30% or so terminal beta, I think that just is a gradual increase as we look forward. And the reason for that is on the institutional side, you're going to get that benefit on each cut. On the retail side, you're going to get that benefit, it's kind of as I mentioned in the past, kind of an arc to the retail pricing sort of thing. And so as CDs reprice and as the money market rates come down on retail, that's going to be kind of that glide path into the 50% terminal that I spoke to earlier. Andy Cecere : And John, all of that, all that you said, which is spot-on is all baked into your flat or stable net interest income projection for Q -- quarter four. John Stern : That's exactly right. Yeah. Erika Najarian : Got it. And my second question is for you, Andy, and this is sort of a broader question. You hosted a very comprehensive Investor Day, and I think the investor reception at least as it followed through to the stock was probably less than desired. And as I think about the feedback from investors, I'm wondering if you could sort of re-address this on this call. You seem determined and you have showed us positive operating leverage. Maybe some quick notes on '25. The comments on the Southeast expansion was also hit on as a potential negative. And the third would be, you are now in a place where you're building capital loan growth hasn't yet come back, what would allow you to be a little bit more aggressive more quickly on the -- on acting on that $5 billion authority? Andy Cecere : So, I'll take them in pieces, Erika. So first of all, I thought the team did a terrific job articulating the strategy at Investor Day and part of that strategy was the inflection point discussion we talked about, which is controlled expenses, delivering on operating leverage and stronger revenue growth given the inter connectiveness of the businesses, and we're hitting on all those. And I think part of what the analyst community and investor community wants is examples and execution. And this quarter started that execution. And as I said on operating leverage, we expect that to expand into the fourth quarter and into '25. So we're going to deliver on that. Secondly, with regard to the M&A environment, the -- given this environment, large bank M&A is just not a priority for us. That's not something we're focused on. What we are focused on is organic growth and the components that Gunjan talked about, and I'm going to ask her to just highlight some of those key aspects of that right now. Gunjan Kedia : Good morning, Erika. As we shared in during the Investor Day, we do have very meaningful organic growth opportunities in our portfolio. And as Andy said, our attention is very much on executing against those priorities, deepening our client relationships, enhancing our product interconnectivity and broadening our reach. We are very focused on delivering meaningful positive operating leverage and the execution that goes with it. We have optimized our distribution via investments in our digital capabilities and our Southeast expansion is very much focused on our partnerships and our digital capabilities. Thank you. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Gunjan. And then finally, and your last question is with regard to capital, Erika, as you know, we -- as we talked about and as John articulated in his comments, we would expect to go to some level of modest buybacks here shortly. And then, we would expect to build upon that once we have more clarity on Basel III and some of the capital rules and then loan growth as you talked about is a key factor as well. But given all that, we would still expect to be up at our capital targets even under the CAT II when we cross that threshold, which again as a reminder, we talked about is not expected till 2027. Erika Najarian : I guess just to follow-up on that, the Basel III shouldn't impact you that much, right, other than -- and everybody had already put in the impact of AOCI actually more immediately than whatever phase-in Basel III end game has. I guess I'm wondering, as a regional bank, are you -- do you think it's just a -- you're just a prudent constituent in terms of not wanting to be aggressive ahead of a new set of revisions? Or are there -- are you also considering that the ratings agency is just sort of wondering what the -- and I completely understand that you're about to buyback in the first quarter, but I think that it's probably an important component of long-only investors starting to increase their position in U.S. Bank. Andy Cecere : Yeah. All those constituencies you talked about are factors in our thinking. Loan growth, the final capital rules, the rating agencies, those are all factors. But we're very confident in our accretion ability as you saw this quarter, 20 basis points, we've articulated 20 to 25. We're very comfortable with our capital position and we're very comfortable with the ability to start to buy-back and distribute as well as accrete, the level of which we'll continue to determine and judge over-time, given all those factors you talked about. Erika Najarian : Thank you, Andy. Andy Cecere : You bet, Erika. See you. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Mike. Mike Mayo : Hi. First -- hey, good morning. First, a cleanup question. So, are you interested in buying a bank in the Southeast because that's got a lot of play just following-up to the prior question. Andy Cecere : No. Mike Mayo : Not even a small bank? Andy Cecere : Mike, the environment right now is just not conducive. There's too much uncertainty for M&A, and I don't want to focus all our efforts on that when we have so much opportunity on the organic growth front. So, in this role, what you do is prioritize against the opportunity set you have in front of you and our organic growth opportunities are far more important and much more tangible to us right now. And as you know, Mike, the M&A environment is just so uncertain right now that would not be a good place to focus our efforts. Mike Mayo : Okay. So my main question here goes back to the operating leverage, which is how much of this is expenses versus revenues? And on the expense side, your investments in the last three, five more years, it's all-in the run-rate as you said at Investor Day. And how much benefit do you get from being a scale player because some smaller banks say they can just buy a lot of these things off-the-shelf and compete with the likes of U.S. Bancorp. So that's the expense question. And then the revenue question is, Gunjan, I know you're leading the go-to-market strategy, kind of what stage of that go-to-market strategy, and are we seeing it in the results now or do we expect to see more of that in the results ahead? Thanks. Andy Cecere : So, Mike, I'll start and then Gunjan will add on. I think to answer your question, I would think about it on both components. I think it's going to be both increased revenue growth and managed expenses. So, as we talked about, we were flattish this time. We might have some modest increase as we go into next year, but we're not going to have expenses growing above revenue levels and I would expect growing revenue and those jaws widening from the expense revenue differential. The revenue will be driven by the activities that Gunjan is focused on, and I'll let her comment. Gunjan Kedia : Good morning, Mike. The go-to-market is in its third and final year of our transformation. So, we are beginning to see the results in some of the areas like the consumer deposit. We built-out a lot of capabilities to manage deposit pricing, we benefited from that in this downgrade cycle. We are seeing a lot of momentum with our multi-serve clients and deepening our relationships on the institutional side. We saw that with the capital markets growth over this quarter. So, the impact of a good scaled business model is delivering good positive operating leverage, including expense management. So this is what we would continue to focus on from an organic growth standpoint. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Hi, Andy. Hi, John. John, on the deposits -- on the deposit pricing, can you share with us, the loan to deposit ratios for the industry and yourselves are not as high as in previous cycles. Do you think that can give you added flexibility in lowering the costs aside from obviously, you talked about the institutional deposits that are essentially, I think, index-priced, so they come down quickly. But in the other deposit classes, do you think you're going to have some leverage to lower those rates because the loan-to-deposit ratio is not at 90% or something like that. John Stern : Sure, Gerard. So, I would say that we don't target necessarily loan to deposit ratios. What we look at is holistically just overall serving of our clients, making sure we have the right mix of deposits and loans. And loan growth is obviously going to be a driver or not of deposits and where they're at. This quarter, loans were flat to down just slightly. And so we took this opportunity to bring down some deposits that were at a higher cost side and you saw that in the results here. And so if that continues, I would continue to expect that. Conversely, if loan growth continues to take up, we're going to be making sure that we have the deposit base to suffice that. The other thing we always try to manage around that is our liquidity needs as well as interest-rate risk profile as well. So, it's kind of more of a holistic nature as it relates to that. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then for Andy or Gunjan, on the organic growth strategy, some of your peers, the bigger banks in particular have embarked upon a branch build-out across the country, even a few -- one super -- or two regional banks have done this as well. And can you share with us as part of your organic strategy, how do you guys view new branches into maybe newer territories combined with your ongoing digital reach-out that of course, you have? Gunjan Kedia : Good morning, Gerard. Maybe I'll start here. So first, the branches are very critical to our business strategy. We see deep client relationships anchored around the branch. It really drives brand recognition. And we are very steady in investing in our branch network. Our strategy focus is to create density in the highest-growth areas within our current footprint rather than use branches to expand out of our footprint. And the reason for that is that we have built some very good strong digital capabilities that allow us to deliver our services nationally, and we are combining that with our very strong partnerships with other partners that have brand recognition and client reach in areas where we don't have. It's a powerful combination, it's a capital-light way of expanding into other markets. Second is our national businesses from the institutional side. There we are actually growing client centers in areas where we are not to expand our reach. So, you'll see us continue to invest in our branch network both inside digitally enabling them, but within our current footprint. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Gerard. Operator : Your next question comes from Vivek Juneja from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Vivek Juneja : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to understand on payments and delve a little bit into that. You had talked last quarter about corporate payments will be lapping this quarter because your tough comps with your trucking-related fees last year, but we didn't really see the benefit of that lap in this quarter. So, anything there that has caused it to be delayed, nor have we seen really merchant payments pickup in terms of year-on-year fee growth? So, any color on what's going on, and why the delay and what gives you confidence that it will actually materialize in the coming quarters? John Stern : Sure. So, Vivek, I would start by saying that I think there were still a little aftermath here on the freight side in the third quarter, but we expect that to completely lap here in the fourth quarter. And then we do see corporate spend being stronger. We saw some nice momentum at the end of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter, and that's what's really giving us the confidence that, that will grow from the level that you saw in this quarter's results from a corporate payments perspective. Gunjan Kedia : Maybe, John, I'll add. Good morning, Vivek. Just a little point on the long-term expectation for payments. Where payments is in the mix with the client relationship, it creates really sticky enduring relationships. We do see good core growth in many of the categories of payments. They are partially offset by some unique items, freight is one of them, which was very disrupted post-COVID and just is beginning to normalize and there are some others as well. So the long-term confidence question that you asked is we look at the client value, and we look at the core dynamics and you'll see that continue to improve over-time. Vivek Juneja : Thanks for that. I have another follow-up for John. John, I just -- one of your comment earlier in response to a question just piqued my interest. You said expenses were up because net interest income was up. Is there incentive comp tied to growing net interest income or is there something else that would drive expenses up when you get net interest income up? That's not really -- any color on that? John Stern : Yeah. Vivek, no, there's no linkage. What I was getting at is we're in the -- in the fourth quarter, we have a very good line of sight on what our expense levels. So we're just being more precise really with it. I was comparing that to our net interest income that had -- has gone up higher and is in the higher-end of our range. I was just making a comparison. There's no linkage from a compensation perspective in that sense. So, we'll just be more precise is the short answer. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Ebrahim. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning, Andy. I guess one question maybe first on fees, and I appreciate you're not talking about '25 right now. But just talk to us in terms of the linkage of the fee momentum accelerating from this mid-single digits into next year. And how much of that is dependent on loan growth picking up or how much of that can happen where even if loan growth or loan demand is fairly muted in the first half, we see better fee revenue momentum being a differentiator for USB? John Stern : Sure. From a -- from Investor Day, we talked about mid-single-digits being in terms of our range from a financial metric performance. And I think you know what you saw this quarter is a good example of that, particularly look at commercial products, which has benefited, of course, from loan growth being done in more in the capital market space, we see that benefit in our businesses. But we've also grown and provide -- have new products, new capabilities in that space. Mortgage is continuing to see nice growth as that has gone. The service charges you know has -- will start to lap the ATM exiting business as we think about that starting in 2025. Corporate trust continues to be just a very strong growth rates and that is tied in-part to the markets, of course. And so as that continues to develop, we have good momentum there. And Gunjan just talked about the payments side of the house. And so I think all those things put together really gives us a lot of confidence in terms of that mid-single-digit growth that we think of it from a -- on the medium-term standpoint. Gunjan Kedia : Ebrahim, I would just add that we do have a very beautifully diversified fee mix. So right now, we are seeing a lot of growth in capital markets and to some extent, that's a -- that's impacting loan growth. But our capital markets businesses are very strong. Otherwise, too, wealth is seeing a very good year because the stock markets are very strong, our investment services businesses benefit from that. And then as the rate environment changes, we would expect mortgage to have, sort of, momentum. So really as we go into the next year, it isn't any one thing, but it's the diversified mix because they play off of each other depending on different macroeconomic environments. Ebrahim Poonawala : That's helpful. And I guess one follow-up, John. When I look at the 7 basis points NIM expansion, I think you mentioned $10 million lift from the bond book restructuring, that's probably 1 basis point. Should we expect the 7 basis point expansion as getting better as we move forward with a couple more rate cuts this year, the back-book repricing? Like, how should we think about the cadence of the NIM from your ex any kind of bond restructuring actions? And is it conceivable that we could be at a 3% NIM in the back-half of next year? John Stern : Sure. So maybe just to go off of a couple of those points. From a net interest income standpoint, in the fourth quarter, we expect to have relative stability and that's just thinking about our earning assets are going to be relatively flat, we expect, and our asset repricing and liability pre-pricing are going to be largely offsetting. So, that's kind of how we think about the stability component in the fourth quarter. Beyond that, all the positive momentum that I've talked about in terms of continuing remixing in terms of our assets into higher return parts of the portfolio, our ability to reprice on deposits, as I mentioned on the institutional side and then ultimately on the retail side. And then, our deposit rotation, as you have observed is slowing down, and for all intents and purposes, complete. And so that's all conducive to growth and continued expansion. I can't put a timeframe on when exactly the 3% occurs, but that's a good level to think about, and it's -- obviously it's embedded within our medium-term guidance that we provided to you during Investor Day. Ebrahim Poonawala : And one last one, I guess maybe, Andy, I think you mentioned, and you mentioned this on the Investor Day on the 2027 crossing of becoming a CAT II bank. Is that in any which way a constraint as you think about pursuing loan growth? Like was -- do you -- Is there any reason to believe USB is disadvantaged on pursuing loan growth next year, because you're kind of, you have an eye on the $700 billion asset number? Just address just that if you don't mind. Andy Cecere : No, there's no constraint on our loan growth. The loan growth activity right now is more a function of demand and consistent with the market overall and the HA data that you're seeing, and we have no constraints on loan growth. And again, as a reminder, Ebrahim, the way it works is, you are at that $700 billion for four quarters on average, so when we think about '27, that's four quarters of impact, so we have no constraints on our assets or our balance sheet. John Stern : And we would expect that our growth will be in line with the industry. Andy Cecere : The industry, which is GDP, GDP-plus. John Stern : Yeah, exactly. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. All very clear. Thank you so much. Andy Cecere : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Matt. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. I think you guys announced that you were looking for a new payments head and were looking externally, and we're just wondering if you could update us on if there's any updates on that. And then I guess, what type of person are you looking for? And is it to kind of continue the strategy that you had or potentially re-evaluate some areas? I think there's the general view that maybe you could do more with payments, given what the revenue pool out there is overall, and that you kind of under-punched a little bit. So I don't know if you would agree with that, but what's the thought in terms of what you're looking for in the new leadership? Thank you. Gunjan Kedia : Matt, good morning, it's Gunjan, and, we are indeed excited to be out in the market looking for new leadership for payments. We have a lot of interest in our franchise. It's unique, it's different, it's very important for us, and we do have big aspirations for not just a standalone, sort of, payments franchise, but how much it embeds and integrates with the everyday lives of our customers. So with that, we are looking for someone who is talented from a payments perspective, but culturally embraces this concept of an interconnected set of solutions for our client base. And that's what we are looking for. And as just to reiterate what we shared, we have a long transition time, very grateful that Shailesh has given us enough time to plan a very smooth and careful transition. Matt O\u2019Connor: And I guess just from a strategic point of view, and this isn't really trying to lead you one way or the other, but like, are you set on kind of the long-term strategic path that you have in payments or are you open to potentially fairly decent size changes one way or the other? Again, not really a leading question, but it seems like it might be an opportunity to take a fresh look and look for some opportunities that maybe you haven't before. Gunjan Kedia : Thank you, Matt. We have deep conviction around the strategy and the path that we are on today. When you meet clients and you see the impact of the payments product sets on the relationships we have, you sort of build that conviction. So the question that we are focused on is how do you execute perhaps differently? How do you accelerate the execution? How do you stay current with the digital capabilities? And all of the strategies that we shared with you on Investor Day are really focused on accelerating the how, rather than sort of rethinking our strategy where we do have a lot of conviction that payments becomes the center point of how people manage their day-to-day lives, and it needs to be embedded in every product, every relationship that we have. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Andy Cecere : Thanks Matt. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Mike Mayo : Hi, just a follow-up to my earlier question related to the benefits of scale and specifically AI. Do you look to be an AI leader or a close follower, or do you think you can get those tools off the shelf and you'll just wait and see in the context of the benefits of scale, again, after your years of investing? Andy Cecere : Yeah, Mike. So as you know, we do have scale, we invest $2.5 billion a year in technology and technology initiatives. We did a great job with the digital capabilities, we highlighted those at Investor Day, and we're following that same model with the AI initiatives, which is the center of excellence and then the business lines surrounding them in terms of use cases. As we talked about, we have a number of use cases underway. I would say, traditional AI, we've been doing for a while, Generative AI is in the early innings, and what is important is we have a structure, expertise, leadership, and technology to deliver on it, but it is early innings. Mike Mayo : Okay. And just one cleanup from Investor Day as it relates to the digital strategy, I mean, going through State Farm, just one more time, you had spent the whole day with management in New York City and more information always better, but the idea of going out of market where you don't have too much branches and going through State Farm with the digital strategy, just -- are there other examples of banks or non-banks that have succeeded with that sort of approach? We've heard a lot of those stories over the last 20 years, and they haven't always played out. So eventually you have to build more branches than you expected or something. So again, that's just a little bit of cleanup from Investor Day. So, as relates to digital strategy. Andy Cecere : Yeah. I think for the strategy to work, I think you have to have a couple of key components. One is the digital capabilities to allow it to work with the other partner. The second is a partner who has the need from a banking product standpoint for their customer base, and then alignment in terms of how that gets done. And I think both with State Farm and certainly with Edward Jones, those pieces are in place, and we've seen good results on that. So opening up core banking products, checking accounts, savings accounts outside of our market through that partnership, we have strong conviction on, and we believe it will be successful because of those attributes. Gunjan, what would you add? Gunjan Kedia : Andy, I would add -- Mike, that we have been in this partnership business for some time now. We have a very strong franchise called Elan, which is a white label credit card provider to other banks. So, it does take a unique skillset to make these partnerships work. And many of these partnerships are restricted in terms of the number of products we're providing. So to your point, there might come a time when you think about expanding. For example, Charlotte was a market where we organically expanded and we're building out branches there. But for the core product sets and having put in place both the digital and the operational capabilities to fulfill servicing needs for people outside, we've become very good at it. So, we are expanding it now with Edward Jones. And as Andy said, good early successes and good momentum as a starting point to get your name and your brand in areas that we are not in today. Mike Mayo : Thank you. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Mike. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Andersen, I turn the call back over to you. George Andersen : Thank you, and thanks to everyone who joined our call this morning. Please contact the Investor Relations department if you have any follow-up questions. Ellie, you may now disconnect the call. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 11 AM Central Time. I will now turn the conference over to George Andersen, Senior Vice President and Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. Please go ahead. George Andersen : Thank you, Audra, and good morning, everyone. Today I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Andy Cecere; President, Gunjan Kedia; Vice Chair and CAO, Terry Dolan; and Senior Executive Vice President and CFO, John Stern. In a moment, Andy and John will be referencing a slide presentation together with their prepared remarks. A copy of the presentation, our press release, and all supplemental consolidated schedules can be found on our website at ir.usbank.com. Please note that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's earnings release presentation, our press release, and in reports on file with the SEC. Following our prepared remarks this morning, we will be happy to take any questions that you have. I will now turn the call over to Andy. Andy Cecere : Thanks, George. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I'll begin on Slide 3. In the fourth quarter, we reported $1.01 per diluted share or $1.07 after adjusting for notable items. John will discuss these one-time charges in his prepared remarks. Net revenue totaled $7 billion for the quarter and $27.5 billion for the year as we saw both sequential and year-over-year quarterly growth in net interest income and non-interest income driven by effective balance sheet management, earning asset repricing and mix, and our highly diversified fee business offerings. Overall, the quarter was highlighted by top line revenue growth and continued expense discipline, which resulted in 190 basis points of positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis year-over-year. Turning to Slide 4, we had slight balance sheet growth this quarter with average earning assets increasing 1.2%, driven by higher on-balance sheet liquidity. This quarter, we had modest loan loss reserve release, largely reflective of improved credit quality and a more favorable portfolio mix. On the bottom right of the slide, you can see that our CET1 capital ratio increased 10 basis points from the prior quarter to 10.6%. Our tangible book value per share total $24.63 at December 31, an increase of 10.4%, compared to the end of last year. During the quarter, we effectively balanced continued capital accretion with an initial $100 million of share repurchases. Slide 5 provides key performance metrics. On an adjusted basis, we delivered an 18.3% return on tangible common equity and an improved efficiency ratio of 59.9% in the fourth quarter. Turning to Slide 6, fee income represented over 40% of total net revenue in the fourth quarter. Results this quarter were driven by double-digit, year-over-year fee growth in commercial products, trust and investment management, and investment product revenues. Slide 7 highlights a few of our key selected initiatives on interconnectedness across the franchise. Let me now turn over the call to John, who will provide more detail on the quarter as well as forward-looking guidance. John Stern : Thanks, Andy. If you turn to Slide 8, I'll start with a more detailed earnings summary followed by a discussion of fourth quarter earnings trends. In the fourth quarter, we reported earnings per diluted common share of $1.01, which included $109 million of notable expense items or $82 million net of tax. Notable items for the quarter included $60 million related to operational efficiency initiatives and $49 million from lease impairments associated with strategic real estate restructuring actions. After adjusting for these notable items, we delivered diluted earnings per common share of $1.07 this quarter. Slide 9 provides a balance sheet summary. Total average deposits increased 0.7% on a linked quarter basis to $512 billion as we continue to prioritize relationship-based deposits and maintained our pricing discipline. While total non-interest bearing deposits increased slightly this quarter, this was largely driven by institutional deposit seasonality at the end of the quarter. Importantly, after accounting for this seasonality, our percentage of non-interest bearing deposits to total deposits now looks to have stabilized in line with our earlier expectations. Average loans totaled $376 billion, a modest increase of 0.4% on a linked quarter basis, driven by commercial lending initiatives, slower paydowns, and new originations in residential mortgages, as well as higher seasonal credit card spend. At December 31, the ending balance on our investment portfolio increased slightly to $171 billion from opportunistic repurchases of securities. This quarter, we saw a slight decline in the average yield across both our investment portfolio and loan book as the impact of variable rates more than offset the benefits of fixed asset repricing. Turning to Slide 10, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis totaled $4.18 billion, which was stable to the third quarter. For the year, total net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was slightly better than our earlier guidance of $16.4 billion. Slide 11 highlights trends in non-interest income. Linked quarter, we saw non-interest income growth in the trust and investment management and other revenue that was partially offset by lower mortgage banking and seasonally lower payments revenue. Importantly, excluding security losses, full year noninterest income increased 3.9% compared to 2023, consistent with our 2024 guidance as we benefited from continued growth across our diversified and differentiated business mix. Turning to Slide 12, non-interest expense for the quarter totaled $4.2 billion as adjusted. For the year, total non-interest expense was $16.79 billion as adjusted, which was just below or better than our full-year guidance of $16.8 billion. We remain focused on prudent expense management and continued to benefit from operational efficiencies across the company. Slide 13 highlights our credit quality performance. Asset quality metrics this quarter were in line with expectations and reflected ongoing macroeconomic stability. Our ratio of non-performing assets to loans and other real estate was 0.48% at December 31st, compared with 0.49% at September 30th and 0.40% a year ago. The fourth quarter net charge off ratio of 0.60% was flat to the third quarter as expected and our allowance for credit losses totaled $7.9 billion, or 2.09% of period-end loans at December 31st. Turning to Slide 14, our CET1 capital ratio of 10.6% as of December 31st increased 10 basis points net of distributions, which included an initial $100 million of share buybacks this quarter. Moving forward, we expect the level and pace of buybacks to remain modest in the near term as we balance continued capital accretion with distributions. I will now provide first quarter and full year 2025 forward-looking guidance on Slide 15. Starting with the first quarter 2025 guidance, net interest income is expected to be relatively stable to the fourth quarter of 2024, excluding the impact of fewer days. As a reminder, the first quarter has two fewer days than the fourth quarter. Total non-interest expense is expected to be relatively stable to the fourth quarter level of approximately $4.2 billion as adjusted. We expect to deliver positive operating leverage in the first quarter of 200 basis points or more on a year-over-year basis. I'll now provide full-year 2025 guidance. Total revenue growth on an adjusted basis is estimated to be in the range of 3% to 5% compared to the full year 2024. We expect to achieve positive operating leverage excluding the impact of security gains or losses of greater than 200 basis points for the full year. I'll now hand it back over to Andy for closing remarks. Andy Cecere : Thanks, John. 2024 was a pivotal year for the company in many ways and it marked a very important inflection point in our story. Going into the year, there was much uncertainty with respect to the broader macroeconomic environment, persistent inflation, significant rate volatility, political and regulatory headwinds to name a few, but we effectively managed through the changes and most importantly executed on our strategic objectives. Fourth quarter results showcase our commitment to execution which was highlighted by our delivery of 190 basis points of positive operating leverage. As credit quality continued to stabilize and we prudently manage our capital position, it was effective balance sheet management, our financial discipline, and expanding interconnectedness across the franchise that enabled us to fully deliver the strong results we did this quarter and fully expect that momentum to continue into 2025. Finally, I'd like to extend our thoughts to those impacted by the devastating and ongoing wildfires in Los Angeles. We are closely monitoring the situation and have teams across the Bank involved in our collective response efforts to help best support our employees, customers, and their communities. Let me close by thanking our employees for their continued dedication to our clients, communities, and shareholders in what was a meaningful year for the company. We will now open up the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Scott Siefers at Piper Sandler. Scott Siefers : Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking the time. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Scott. Scott Siefers : Hey. John, I was hoping maybe you could delve in a little more to discuss the drivers of the 3% to 5% expected full year \u201825 revenue growth. In other words, how much comes from NII, how much ends up coming from fees. And maybe -- and then I guess a little clarification, when you're talking about the 1Q NII guide, I think you're saying flat excluding the day count difference. I just want to be certain we're thinking it would be down on a reported basis marginally just due to fewer days. John Stern : Right. Thanks, Scott, and good morning. So let me take your last question first. Yes, excluding days, about $40 million would be lower on a reported basis. So stable, excluding those two days of that $40 million. That's how we're representing that. On the drivers on the 3% to 5% revenue growth, let me start with the fees and then I'll go over to -- into net interest income. We had really solid and healthy growth on the fee side of things. And we have a lot of momentum building. And that's despite some headwinds that we saw, particularly on our prepaid, on the card side of things, as well as freight. So some areas in the payment space that saw some headwinds. We also saw headwinds with the ATM exit of our cash servicing business. So those things will abate or have abated here in 2024. And so we see obviously momentum in the core. At Investor Day, we talked about our expectation for the medium term for rate -- expectations for 2026 and 2027 to be at mid-single-digits for fee growth. And that's a reasonable range for us to really think about as we think about 2025. And it really comes down to core areas of growth within our trust area. We're seeing strong market share, fund formation. The macro is really strong there. Payments, we have good momentum in a number of areas, strategic initiatives that are underway. Treasury management and capital markets continue to have strong growth in certain areas. A couple of areas that we're watching is mortgage. Mortgage is -- with these higher rates, it's hard to see volumes really persist or be a lot stronger than it was in the prior year and gain on sales pretty stable as well. And then our other revenue will continue to be in that $125 million to $150 million range on an average basis per quarter. So put another way, we expect fees to grow. We have strong momentum and we think that mid-single-digit is a reasonable place for us to begin. As we think about net interest income, again, well positioned. The balance sheet's in a great spot. We saw inflection in our 20 -- throughout 2024, and we really think about three key drivers for net interest income, it's going to come from better asset mix which we've seen more of a shift into higher returning assets that that shift will continue, we've seen deposit normalization, that's the non-interest bearing rotation is starting to slow down and really stabilize at this level. And importantly, fixed asset repricing on our back book is going to be a meaningful driver this year, particularly with the curve steepening. We've seen -- since we were last on this call, the curve, and I always look at, SOFR versus five-year treasury, that was meaningfully inverted back in September, now we're positive, actually. And so we think the back book is going to give us some nice trajectory. Just as an example, we have about $3 billion of investment portfolio that reprices per quarter $3 billion that runs off that can get replaced at 150 basis points to 200 basis points of spread. And then on the other fixed rate assets that we have which includes residential mortgage, commercial loans and auto loans and things like that, we have $5 billion to $7 billion on average that reprice again at that 150 basis points to 200 basis points mark and that's assuming kind of today's rates. So either way, we're very confident in our growth, both on fees and in interest income, and you put it all together and that's really where we come up with our 3% to 5% total revenue growth. Scott Siefers : Perfect. All right, good. Appreciate all the details, John. Thank you. John Stern : You bet. Operator : We'll move next to John McDonald at Truist Securities. John McDonald : Hi, good morning. Andy Cecere : Good morning. John McDonald : Hey, guys. I wanted to ask two strategic questions. Maybe the first one is for Gunjan. Just on payments, you reorganized the business yesterday or this week you announced a new head to the consumer side. Maybe just kind of give us the plan for payments and what you hope the new organization and setup will do for the growth and opportunities there. Gunjan Kedia : Good morning, John. Let me just remind you of some of the facts that we shared last time. A payment franchise is a very strategic asset for us, and our sense is that we can do more to interconnect that product set with our consumer franchise and our institutional franchise. So the oak structure and splitting it into the two pieces that are more aligned with the two parts of the franchise is an expectation to accelerate execution. So, it's not really a strategic focus. We are very pleased to welcome two very high quality leaders. Mark Runkel, we announced earlier in the year. He stepped into his role on the institutional side. And Courtney Kelso joins us from AmEx next month. So that was sort of the intention, and the goal is to truly accelerate our execution around our vision for interconnectedness. John McDonald : Okay. Thanks, Gunjan. And, Andy, maybe broader, just kind of where have you planted seeds for offense across the company? I think in the retail bank, you're looking in the union franchise and maybe through your partners, Edward Jones and State Farm. But maybe just across the footprint, where are you excited about where US Bank has kind of invested for growth and you might be moving to the front foot? Andy Cecere : Thanks, John, and good morning. I think it's across all of our business lines, and it's that concept that we talked about in an Investor Day, which is about interconnectedness. But if you think about the momentum that John articulated and Gunjan talked about, our payments business, our trust and investment management business, our commercial products business, our retail business, the growth and deposit activity, our commercial business with the growth and targeted loan activity, profitable loans. So we really have a lot of momentum going in that. John, coupled that with sort of the headwind that was the yield curve that John talked about, I think, drives to positive momentum on net interest income. The fee category we talked about, which I all think have positive momentum, and all of that is coupled with a relatively flat expense for the last five quarters, which drives to this positive operating leverage that we talked about. So, across all the categories of revenue, it's positive, expense is well managed and that's going to deliver the positive operating leverage. John McDonald : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Betsy Graseck at Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. John Stern : Good morning, Betsy. Andy Cecere : Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : I noticed that mine sounds very ticky-tacky, but I just want to make sure I understand what forward curve your NII guide is based on? And I think you mentioned today, but I -- and the reason I ask is, as we all know, the forward curve has changed a lot between like beginning of December and today. So, that's the first question. John Stern : Sure. So, in terms of our curve, we do have two rate cut assumptions embedded. I think one's in May and one's in September. So that's kind of how we think about the short end of the curve and the long end of the curve is at this level. So, right now, the 10-year treasury is at [4.65%] (ph). That's probably a good place. That's kind of where we're at kind of throughout the year. Of course, we know that it's volatile. It's been volatile. And that's why, I say the curve does matter when we kind of look at these sorts of things. But, those are our projections. Betsy Graseck : Okay, great. And can you help us understand how your projections would move in the event that you've got fewer rate cuts or the long end went up more? John Stern : Yep. Exactly. So, again, we continue to be neutral from an interest rate risk standpoint. So, as I mentioned, we expect two cuts. But if those cuts don't manifest or the Fed even hikes or there's more cuts which, we know the cycles, right, things will shift. We want to be as neutral as possible to those particular movements from the Fed on the short end of the curve. Where there is can be some change is really on the shape of the curve. So a steeper curve, the better off we are. If it's more inverted, then that would put a little bit more pressure on the net interest income. So at a high level, those are kind of the puts and takes. Betsy Graseck : And as we roll through the year, can you just give us a sense as to that fixed asset repricing? Is it coming through kind of quarterly cadence the same or is there any acceleration or deceleration during the year that we should be thinking about? John Stern : It's pretty consistent. So I mentioned the $5 billion to $7 billion per quarter. I mean, it's going to range in that corridor, each quarter, but it doesn't accelerate. It doesn't tail off. It's pretty consistent throughout the course of the year. Same on the investment portfolio, pretty consistent. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thank you so much. John Stern : You bet. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning. John Stern : Morning. Ebrahim Poonawala : Sorry if I missed this in your prepared remarks. When we think about the NII guidance for the year -- or your revenue outlook, what's underpinning that from a loan growth perspective, like, one, so yeah, what's the assumption of loan and deposit growth? And are we seeing any green shoots of a pickup and lending demand? John Stern : Sure. Thanks, Ebrahim. So, we did not comment yet on loans, but I would just say in terms for purposes of our forecast, now we're thinking about \u201925, we have pretty modest loan and deposit growth for the full year. Now, in terms of sentiment and things of that variety, clearly there's a lot of positivity. Our client base is excited. I think there's a lot of momentum clearly in our pipelines that we can see has not yet translated into elevated loan growth at this point. But perhaps the changes we're thinking, hopefully is in the back half of the year, we can see that pick up in loan growth. But in terms of our forecasts and our projections, we anticipate modest for the year. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And I guess maybe just talk about, I think you addressed a little bit around the payments business. As we think about the fee revenue sort of categories across payments, if you can sort of drill into expectations around that year-over-year in context of your overall revenue guide, and obviously, you brought in a new head of payments yesterday. Remind us of the market positioning. Are we winning share, losing market share, and what the ambition is there going forward? Thank you. John Stern : Sure. So, as I mentioned in payments earlier, we have momentum on the core side. We had had some headwinds there. So if I just kind of go through the different categories, on the card side of things, we had strong sales on the credit card side, just over nearly 6%, really. And total revenue was hurt and prepaid this quarter by about 4 percentage points given the exiting some of our prepaid revenue. That's going to impact us again in the first quarter, but then we'll fully lap that in the second quarter. But continuing in the card side, we anticipate growth there and we have a lot of momentum in different products. We have our Smartly card that is coming online. We have a lot of excitement around that, our Union acquisition increasing that penetration. So we continue to expect that mid-single-digit growth in terms of, on a retail card side of things. On the merchant side of things, we've had, again, strong sales. Our tech-led formation and growth there has been really strong. We've been making investments. We expect travel to improve, same store sales to improve. Clearly, our growth rate in \u201824 was below our expectations. And, as we see a lot more, high volume, lower margin type clients continuing their pace. We are looking at the growth rate as better than, of course, 2024, but it may not be at our aspiration of high single digits for 2025. And then on the CPS side of things, strong quarterly growth that we had, they had their best year. We've been making a lot of investments there. The pipelines are strong. Freight, we have lapped. So, a lot of positive things there. And again, the Union penetration is going to be really paying off for us as well. And so, we see high single-digits there as well. Ebrahim Poonawala : All right. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Erika Najarian at UBS. Erika Najarian : Yes, good morning. You did announce that $5 billion share repurchase authorization during Investor Day, and I think the market got quite excited about that. In terms of the pacing of the buybacks, you did $100 million this quarter. I guess, I heard you guys loud and clear during the prepared remarks, but what are the puts and takes that you're considering in terms of thinking about that pacing? I know that you're looking for modest -- a modest pace to begin with, but if loan growth is a little soft and that it seems like you have conservative guidance embedded in your revenue guide for balance sheet growth, what are the puts and takes in terms of the more modest start to buybacks? John Stern : Sure. At a high level, Erika, it's really the balance between growing our capital to get to where we need to be from a Category II perspective. We talked about 10% being an approximate level of where we want to be on a Cat II basis. And obviously we don't expect to be a Cat II bank until 2027 or there about. So, that's really the one side of it. The other side is, as you said, long growth. If it's weaker, then there's an opportunity for deployment. But we're going to be -- we just started. We're stepping into this, and we talked about the next quarter and the pace thereafter is just going to be dictated on those factors that I just mentioned. Erika Najarian : And just as a follow-up here, and maybe this is for Andy, the way you laid out your projection on Slide 15 in terms of the revenue guide and then positive operating leverage, if net interest income or payments swing one way or the other, either to the better or maybe softer, it's a message here that there's -- you're now to a point where there's enough flex where regardless of the revenue environment, that 200 plus basis point is going to be sort of the baseline for what you can deliver in 2025? Andy Cecere : Short answer, Erika, is yes. It's 200 basis points plus on positive operating leverage. We do have flex on expense. I'm going to ask John to highlight some of the areas. But we've been managing to a flat expense base for a number of quarters. This is our fifth quarter of the flat expenses. We're still investing in the company. We're managing across many different areas. And we are very confident in that positive operating leverage, regardless of what the revenue environment is. And, John, why don't you talk about some of the levers? John Stern : Yeah, clearly we've done a lot of work on the expense. We're very proud of the efforts that the teams have made thus far, but we have continued to see different levers that we're looking at and we'll kind of, throughout the year, kind of talk more about. But obviously we had a notable item on the real estate side of things. There's -- continue to be optimization there. Procurement and third-party spend actions, we see opportunities as well as organizational simplicity and bringing fragmented groups together and centralizing certain aspects. And then just automation of processes. We have a lot of the investments that we've been talking about over in Investor Day help us manage that expense by automating certain processes. And then that inflection point that we talked about in terms of investment in our digital capabilities. So the stabilization of that digital investment, we've increased that amount all along that J-curve, if you will, and now we're at a flat place and we're bending that cost curve on the digital side, which we're really excited about. So those are kind of the main pieces. There's others. We have a lot of different initiatives, but those are the different levers that we look at. Erika Najarian : Great. Thank you. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Erika. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Pancari at Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Good morning. Andy Cecere : Morning, John. John Stern : Good morning. John Pancari : Just -- appreciate the color -- the breakout of the revenue growth outlook by fees and then your commentary around net interest income, just behind that net interest income commentary and some of the drivers you mentioned around fixed asset repricing and deposit normalization, can you give us maybe your thoughts around the net interest margin trajectory as we look through the year and perhaps maybe even help us with how the -- where the margin could end up as an exit rate coming out of 2025, just to help give us a better color around the -- what it means for the medium term trends. Thanks. John Stern : Sure. Thanks, John. And we anticipate, given the drivers, we do anticipate net interest margin to follow net interest income and increase. We -- certainly, from a management standpoint, we don't manage to net interest margin. As an example, this quarter, it fell 3 basis points entirely due to liquidity, right? So there's always going to be transitional puts and takes to it. But directionally, it should follow, we talked about it at Investor Day about how, not that there's anything magical about 3%, but I mean, there's certainly a lot of momentum in all those categories and drivers that I just mentioned really to kind of get us into that level over time. I think the big things that can move it are really loan growth as that goes up and down, deposit management, and then the shape of the curve, which impacts our fixed asset or our back book repricing. So those are gonna be the components, but certainly expect directionally the net interest margin to improve as we march through time. John Pancari : Got it. All right, John, thank you for that. And then separately back to capital. On the M&A front, I know post the Investor Day, you've been clear that large -- whole bank M&A would only be more of a consideration longer term as you look at your franchise versus a near term opportunity. I guess, Andy, has that, or Gunjan, has that changed at all or just given the election results and how comprehensively we expect a regulatory supervisory role change across the different regulators and then, does it, I guess another question would be what would change your view in terms of possibly putting M&A options more in the near-term view? Thanks. Andy Cecere : So, John, our perspective is the same, which is it\u2019s just not a priority for us right now. The combination of the purchase accounting marks, the regulatory approval process, which may improve but isn't clear yet, and the current bank valuations all factor into this. So, while it may return -- large bank M&A may return over the longer term, we're very focused on our organic growth opportunities because we have a lot of them. And that's where we're putting our efforts and priorities right now. And Gunjan, maybe you can highlight a couple of them because I think that emphasis is because of the opportunities that we have in front of us. Gunjan Kedia : Very true. Good morning, John. I'll add that while the regulatory environment is very attractive for our organic growth opportunities, too, we saw a very significant acceleration of our trust and investment fees and our capital markets fees because investor confidence and consumer confidence is very high. So, the ability to drive a real inflection in organic growth with positive operating leverage is very much our focus. And it's across many, many parts of our business. On the product side, we have a balance sheet that would support a much bigger capital markets business. So we are very focused on that. We're introducing new capabilities there at quite a good pace. And the interconnectivity across our product sets is really deepening the franchise as well. So it's a very good strategy to drive growth with positive operating leverage, and that is our focus right now. John Pancari : Okay, great. Thank you, Gunjan. Andy Cecere : Thanks, John. Operator : We'll go next to Mike Mayo at Wells Fargo Securities. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Mike. Mike Mayo : You're finally turning the corner on positive operating leverage. You said at least 200 basis points. I think after so long not having positive operating leverage, I think people are wondering, it's kind of a show me story. I think you might understand that. Under what scenario do you think you could have more than the 200 basis points guide? Some other banks are actually guiding higher today and you have a lot of tailwinds in the industry. So, how high could that go? Because the stock is down, people are questioning this. What would be your reaction? Andy Cecere : Mike, what we wanted to do is to provide a guide that we have confidence in and that we're conservatively giving you numbers. I'm very confident in our ability to manage expense in this environment. And I'm very confident in the inflection point on the revenue components. So that's why we put a 200 basis point plus on that guide. So we'll hit 200 at least. But at the extent that the market helps us on the revenue side with the yield curve and the things that John talked about, I\u2019d expect it to be above that. But we want to give you a guide and an expectation that we're very comfortable with and that we take into account the different puts and takes that are a little bit out of our control like yield curve. Mike Mayo : And then a more specific question. The merchant acquiring yield looked like it contracted 70 basis points year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and the revenues didn't accelerate with the volumes. Was that expected? Was that a surprise? Is there competitive pressure? What's causing that 70 basis point contraction in the merchant acquiring yield? Thanks. John Stern : Sure. So, Mike, I think I mentioned, although it was pretty quick when I mentioned the -- that our client base, while we had strong growth in terms of same store sales and tech lead initiatives, which are -- the tech lead has strong margins and it continues to be about a third and has been growing a third of our total business on the merchant side, the growth on the other side of our client base has been in higher volume, lower margin, and that has persisted kind of throughout the year, and that's kind of creating that disconnect that you just mentioned. And [Technical Difficulty] talked about the expectations that we have here in 2025 is kind of followed because of that. Gunjan Kedia : I can add some color here, John, if I may. We were disappointed in the merchant results for this quarter as well, but the business is really showing two very different characteristics. There's the part that we are very proud of, which is the tech led part, about a third of the business now. The value proposition to the customer and the client across our franchise is very strong there. And we see very nice growth rates there. talech and Salucro were two acquisitions we did around the retail space and the healthcare space. So that part you see revenue and sales volumes show good patterns. On the other side, we have a very vast group of partners, and we just saw growth in a few very large volume, low margin businesses. And some of that might persist on that side of the business, but that was the quarter here. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Mike. Operator : We'll take our next question from Matt O'Connor at Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk about the trends in commercial products revenue. It was up nicely year-over-year, but was a little bit lower versus kind of the run rate between the other quarters this year. Just remind us, I think there's a decent contributor of capital markets in that and remind us like what the drivers of the underlying businesses are. John Stern : Sure. So this is the commercial products, Matt, is what I heard you say. So, yeah, we had strong growth in commercial products. It's been a good story for us. We've highlighted it, of course, at various investor conferences, obviously at Investor Day and then in a fourth quarter conference as well. So we've talked quite a bit about it. But the growth really came in a lot of different areas here this quarter. It was in client-related derivative activity, which were either interest rate swaps or foreign exchange. Loan syndication was up as well, bond underwriting. And we're seeing the new products also kick in. So we've talked about some of our other ABS desks, syndication desks and commodities and things like that. And so that's -- about 20% of our growth this year was really on the new product side. And the verticals, interconnectedness we have with the private credit side of things really help us focus in on that growth. And we expect, and we've talked about our expectations with that and nothing has really changed. We have high expectations for this business. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then separately on the deposits, the average deposits grew and I noticed some seasonality on the period end, but they were down a little bit this quarter for the third quarter in a row. So maybe I just answered the question that there's too much seasonality to really focus on period end, but maybe just address that. And I think you did say you expect modest deposit growth. So anything to add to the narrative though that the period end was lower? John Stern : Sure, yeah. So, for us, as we've talked about, the average balance is a better indicator than ending. The ending can really fluctuate. We do get -- we can get some pretty meaningful movements at the end of quarters, particularly in the third quarter was very strong from a deposit growth standpoint. So even though we had a pretty big surge of deposits at the end of the fourth quarter, it was compared to a really high third quarter. So that's just kind of one example. In the first quarter, part of the reason we talk about a stable net interest income for the first quarter is, in the first quarter, deposits seasonally decline, particularly in our institutional and wholesale side of things in DDA as an example, just because if you think about our operational accounts that we have there, there's a lot of either deployment of investments from our institutional clients or just overall investment from our corporate related clients. And so that's kind of a driver of Q1 from a deposit standpoint. But overall, you should think about deposits being a modest growth, consistent with the industry, those sorts of things is kind of how I would -- how I characterize it. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay, thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to David Long at Raymond James. David Long : Good morning, everyone. John Stern : Good morning. David Long : I just wanted to stick with the deposit theme here. And when I look at your average deposit cost for the quarter, it came down in line with what I'm seeing with some of your peers. And just curious what you're seeing in the competition for deposits and pricing, and how do you think that plays out throughout 2025? John Stern : Sure. Thanks, David. So, from a deposit standpoint, and this is again embedded in our growth projections and things like that of modest growth and deposits, I do expect it to be kind of equal in terms of either whether it's on the consumer side or on the institutional side. If I kind of break those two pieces apart, on the consumer side, it seems like things have been -- it's kind of either, it comes and goes in terms of competitive nature, I would say more lately with the rate cuts that have occurred, that's loosened things up and so we're seeing a little bit better in terms of pricing competitively. It may not show up immediately this quarter, but over time we would expect the retail competitiveness to moderate. On the institutional side, that also kind of comes and goes, but I would call it pretty standard at this point. I think the one negative or headwind right now is QT. That's been drying up liquidity and that can create some competitive natures on the institutional side, but all in all, we expect to be obviously very competitive out there. We have a lot of new great products that are helping us grow deposits, and we feel very strongly about that. And those are kind of the main puts and takes. David Long : Excellent. Thanks, John. Appreciate it. Operator : We'll go next to Vivek Juneja at JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Hi. Thanks for taking my question, Andy. So, a strategic question. Payments, there's been some discussion about that already. And it's a question we've talked on previous calls. I heard Gunjan's response, the tech-led is doing well, but the rest continues to drag. And that probably cut news into next year. Given the business, given the pricing pressures, have you considered about whether you should get rid of this business and deploy the capital to other areas where you\u2019re doing a much -- where you're in a much stronger position, getting better returns? Why wouldn't you think of that? Andy Cecere : I'll start, Vivek, and ask Gunjan to add on, but I think in this environment, this interconnectedness of banking and payments is as important as it's ever been. And the concept of moving money together with storing money and lending money is all intertwined. And to the extent we can offer these things together with a terrific technology platform that we have and also have the ability to grow that in a very capital-efficient, fee-focused way is why we want to retain the business. And the interconnectedness of that is as critical as it's been in the last 20 years. So, we're very focused on this business because of that opportunity, and Gunjan, why don't you add on? Gunjan Kedia : Vivek, good morning. It's a thoughtful question. And I'll add to what Andy's saying here. First, just we are talking about deltas to expectations, but the business has very high returns. It's a very attractive business. It is an area where a lot of competitive set has been building market share, and we are seeing more discipline come into this industry, just focus on profitability, focus on a return on investments rather than just market share gains. And if you look long term, it is the one product where we have frequent, deep, and embedded interactions with our clients. And it anchors the client value proposition and the client retention in a way that is very hard to do from some of the banking and some of the more sort of routine products. So, we have deep conviction that money movement needs to be on the center of a financial relationship with the client surrounded by banking capabilities. I also would just remind you of the size of just the various parts of our payments business. It's 25% of our total revenue. Two-thirds of that is our core credit card, card issuing business. Very healthy, very steady market shares there. Our corporate payment and card issuing business is also looking at very healthy pipelines. All of this gives us great capacity to stay with the Elavon business and build it out both for the small business and for the corporate areas. So, to answer your question, it's a good question and strategically you want this capability in the mix with your clients. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Thank you. Andy Cecere : Thanks, Vivek. Operator : We'll move next to Bill Carcache at Wolfe Research. Andy Cecere : Good morning, Bill. Bill Carcache : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Your tech-led merchant processing service revenue growth seems solid at the time. There's still a perception that you're at a disadvantage to some of your fintech competitors. Can you take us inside of that 9% growth and discuss the breakdown between new additions versus customer attrition? Gunjan Kedia : Good morning, Bill. Let me just start here. So, the competition on the tech-led comes in two ways. One is the user experience on the front-end. What we do with our partners here in the tech-led space is provide the reliability, the operations. It's not easy to be the backend partner of a unique value proposition in the front. So, it's fraud monitoring, it's transaction monitoring, it's reliability of systems, it's all of the networks that go into it. This is a very good partnership as much as it is competition with other areas. It's a matter of where you're playing role. And we do expect that to be a really strong contributor to the growth rate of this business. And as time goes by, it will take over more and more of the total franchise. To your question around sort of the new business versus not, it's a very dynamic space. I mean, we have a vast number of partnerships, and their success in the front end can shift that mix a little bit. So, it's really the portfolio that we manage to. Bill Carcache : Got it. Separately, following up on your NIM commentary, I may have missed this, but where did deposit funding costs end the quarter and where would you expect the average cost to grow from here given your rate expectations? John Stern : Sure. So from a deposit cost standpoint, maybe I'll speak to it in beta terms because I think it's just easier to utilize that because we're -- obviously you're going to see a little bit of impact next quarter, but the Fed moves that we saw in the fourth quarter will impact the first quarter. So our cumulative beta for the \u2013 throughout the -- through the fourth quarter was 38%. We anticipate our beta to be at kind of the mid to high 40s as we look at our first quarter results. And so you'll see that decline on the deposit rate as we move forward. Bill Carcache : Got it. If I could squeeze in one last one, can you discuss how much cash flow and fair value hedge notional is active? I guess how that exposure changes as we progress through the year and any color on pay versus receive rates for both? John Stern : Sure. So, this quarter is actually a really good example of our hedging program at work and why it's working as intended. We have pay-fix swaps and we have receive-fix swaps. The pay-fix swaps are intended to help protect capital when interest rates rise. They did rise. We saw 80 basis point upward movement. Our AOCI number did increase, but not nearly the magnitude that perhaps others and things of that [indiscernible] helps us manage that Cat II capital lull that I spoke to. Obviously with the pay-fix swaps, that's going to create a little bit of a drag on NII. However, offsetting that was our receive-fix swaps that were attached to either commercial loans or debt. And those receive-fix swaps increased our rate relative to where they would have been otherwise. And so you can think of those as largely offsetting. So, from an income standpoint, the hedges are relatively neutral. Bill Carcache : Thank you for taking my questions. John Stern : You bet. Operator : We'll take our final question from Saul Martinez at HSBC. Saul Martinez : Hey, good morning, guys. Vivek -- I think Vivek asked my question, but I'll maybe ask it another way. I guess I'm struggling to see how you differentiate yourself in the merchant acquired businesses. With the exception of maybe Chase, most banks have lost share over the years. There's enormous amount of innovation in that space, a lot of capital in that space. You see the shift in power to software providers and legacy merchant acquirers have lost share over the years. I guess, like what I was going to ask you is whether you can make an argument that it's worth more to somebody else than to you? And I guess the answer to that question from your answer to Vivek\u2019s question is that it does provide value to the entire franchise, to the entire business. Is that the answer? And I guess the adjunct to that question is, how do you measure success in the acquiring businesses? Are you looking at just volume growth, revenue growth, are there other measures? How do you measure whether this business, you're succeeding in your strategy here and this business is adding value to the entire franchise? Andy Cecere : So, Saul, I'm going to start and then ask Gunjan to add on. This is Andy. I'm going to start by reiterating what I said before, which is this interconnectedness of banking and money movement and payments. And we've made investments in categories and verticals that are very focused on capabilities to provide information and help those businesses run their platform and their business like healthcare and some of the other areas that we're focused on. So what's happened in payments and money movement has become more embedded in the banking component. And I think that's our advantage versus as pure play merchant provider is interlocking those components to help them run their business. And we've focused in certain verticals that are, I think, very important in terms of our overall growth opportunities. And in terms of what we're looking for, it's all those things. It's top line revenue growth, but importantly bottom-line profitable revenue growth. And the progress we've made in the tech and -- tech-led, the interconnected components that we've talked about in terms of those verticals we're focused on are all indications that we're headed in the right directions. We're not where we want to be yet, but we're heading in the right way. Gunjan, what would you add? Gunjan Kedia : At the power of the distribution franchise, we have 15 million clients. And if you look at standalone players that bring a very high level of innovation, as you called it, to the table, their gap is the client franchise. And that's where the partnerships come with some of the innovation in the industry. Saul, it's a lot of infrastructure and investment to connect the transaction and the provision of the services beyond the user experience and the innovation in the front. And so we see very significant demand for a partnership with us, but the model has to transform in the direction that we are going where we need to be able to provide and connect and have a very easy onboarding experience, very easy, quick ability to bring merchants on and off. And that's all of the investments that we have been making. So, it's the distribution side, and it's all of the back-end product capabilities that may give us the competitive edge here. Saul Martinez : Okay. I mean, that's helpful. I guess just a quick follow-up in on deposits, John. I guess we're closer to the end of the rate cutting cycle, although seemingly every day there's shifts in what the forward curve is expecting. But remind us what the through-the-cycle deposit beta you're expecting. I heard mid-40s in Q1. I think like high 40s, low 50s is what you\u2019ve -- is that the right, through-the-cycle beta? John Stern : That's right, Saul. So, we think about 38 is spot through the cycle as of this quarter. We expect mid to high 40s in the first quarter. And assuming there's additional cuts, we would migrate kind of through the cycle to that 50%, north of that level is kind of where our expectations are. Thank you. Saul Martinez : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Andersen, I'll turn the conference back over to you. George Andersen : Thanks, Audra. Thank you to everyone who joined our call this morning. Please contact the Investor Relations department if you have any follow-up questions. You may now disconnect the call. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
